FT  22 MAY 92 / A different tune for electronics in Japan: Sony and
Matsushita have reported profit falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of strong growth, Japan's mighty consumer electronics giants
have run up against a wall. Faced with recession in international markets,
Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, the largest and second largest
consumer electronics groups in the world respectively, yesterday reported
large profit falls and said they would be scaling back their capital
investment programmes.
Matsushita reported a fall in operating profit of 18 per cent to Y389bn
(Pounds 1.64bn) as it was hit by foreign exchange losses of Y62.1bn. Pre-tax
profit fell 39 per cent to Y363.4bn and after-tax profit declined 49 per
cent to Y132.9bn.
Sony reported a 44.1 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profit to
Y166.3bn on a 5.7 per cent increase in sales at Y3,821bn. Net profit rose
2.7 per cent to Y120.1bn, but was boosted by the proceeds of a public
offering by Sony Music Entertainment (Japan), which raised Y61.5bn.
The extent of Sony's difficulty was highlighted by a fall in the group's
parent operating loss to Y20.5bn from a profit of Y72.2bn, and the company's
first loss since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958.
Consumer electronics manufacturers worldwide have been hit by their failure
over the past few years to stimulate consumer demand with exciting new
products while large markets in industrialised countries are already
saturated with colour TVs and audio equipment.
Even in Japan, 'the consumer electronics market has been flat for the past
five years', says a spokesman for Matsushita.
The leading companies in the industry have seen the difficult times coming
for some years. Since the mid-1980s there has been growing concern about the
lack of new products to stimulate consumer demand. But attempts to introduce
model changes and, in the case of Matsushita and Sony, by buying into
prominent US entertainment companies, have not been as successful as they
would have liked.
The results of Matsushita and Sony were affected by their need to digest the
acquisitions, of, respectively, MCA and Columbia Pictures, although
Matsushita boosted consolidated sales 13 per cent to Y7,449.9bn, thanks to
MCA revenues of Y480bn.
Meanwhile, efforts to stimulate demand by introducing new product models at
the frenetic pace of once every six months have backfired. Japanese
consumers are no longer fooled by such gimmicks while the country's Ministry
of International Trade and Industry has warned the manufacturers that
frequent model changes were an unnecessary waste of resources and labour
time.
Matsushita said sales of video equipment remained flat at Y1,699.8bn, while
audio equipment sales rose 6 per cent to Y631.7bn. Home appliances grew 9
per cent to Y982.2bn, communication and industrial equipment sales advanced
8 per cent to Y1,678.6bn, while electronic components rose 3 per cent to
Y862.7bn.
Revenue from entertainment, including films and music entertainment, video
and audio tapes, totalled Y626.4bn. However, Matsushita said revenues at
MCA, which were included into the sales figures starting last fiscal year,
fell 4 per cent because of the shortage of box-office hits.
Sony reported a 1.3 per cent decline in video equipment sales to Y896.4bn,
in spite of a 6.7 per cent fall in the final quarter. For the year, audio
equipment sales rose 7.5 per cent, televisions 7.3 per cent and filmed
entertainment 27.8 per cent, while music entertainment fell 7.4 per cent.
The consumer electronics industry does not expect to see a marked
improvement until later in the year while products which they are placing
their hopes on, such as digital audio tapes and interactive video systems,
are being introduced only this year and will take some time to attract
widespread demand.
Both companies hope that the release of new products in the domestic market
and a recovery in the US and Europe will lift sales during the current year.
For the current year to next March, Matsushita expects consolidated pre-tax
profits to rise 6 per cent to Y385bn, on a marginal increase in sales of 0.7
per cent to Y7,500bn.
Sony expects a 2 per cent increase in sales at the parent company to
Y2,020bn and a 45 per cent increase in net profit to rise 45 per cent to
Y30bn, while research and development spending is likely to rise from Y240bn
to between Y245bn and Y250bn.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Supermarket group makes accounting policy change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM MORRISON Supermarkets, the Bradford-based grocery chain, yesterday
announced a significant change to its accounting policies by choosing to
depreciate its land assets.
The company said the change was prompted by the 'interest of prudence'
recognising that the alternative use value of its sites might be much less
than their food retailing value.
The move could increase shareholder pressure on other food retailers to
follow suit, threatening a big dilution in their earnings.
The share prices of all the leading food retailers were unsettled yesterday.
Morrison slipped 5p to 369p, while J. Sainsbury fell 7p to 458p, Tesco shed
6p to 274p and Argyll Group, which runs Safeway, slid 6p to 351p. Mr Tony
Shiret, food retailing analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'The fact
that Morrison's has acknowledged the argument on alternative value will put
the other food retailers under increased institutional pressure to do
likewise.'
He argued in a recent circular that big food retailers were significantly
overvaluing property portfolios by failing to provide for such depreciation.
'In a high-inflation environment this policy was considered appropriate as
inflation offset any diminution in the underlying value of the asset. We
have now moved to a low inflation environment with many of the more recently
acquired assets staring at uncomfortably high valuations,' he argued.
Mr Shiret estimated that the effect of adopting 'prudent' depreciation
policies would depress Tesco's earnings per share in the year to spring 1993
by 21 per cent. J. Sainsbury would suffer a 15 per cent reduction and Argyll
Group, which runs the Safeway chain, an 11 per cent dilution.
Asda is expected to announce a substantial write-down on its property assets
when it reports its results this summer.
Mr Kenneth Morrison, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that the company
would depreciate all land, whether in use or not, by 1 per cent a year from
the beginning of the financial year.
He added it would have had the effect of reducing last year's pre-tax
profits of Pounds 62.6m by about Pounds 1m.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Retailing chief quits due to ill health: Storehouse results
more than double to Pounds 15.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Julien is to step down as chief executive of the Storehouse
retailing conglomerate on his doctors' advice after being unable to shake
off a viral infection he contracted last year.
He will be succeeded by Mr David Dworkin, currently chairman and chief
executive of the BhS subsidiary, after the company's annual meeting in July.
The announcement came as Storehouse, which also embraces Mothercare,
Habitat, Richards, and Blazer, reported an encouraging turnround in its
trading fortunes after four consecutive years of declining profits.
In the year to March 28, Storehouse more than doubled pre-tax profits from
Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 15.8m on sales 2 per cent lower at Pounds 1.18bn. The
improvement was rewarded by a 3p rise in its share price to 140p.
Last year's figures were, however, flattered by the absence of any
exceptional costs. In the previous year, Storehouse took a Pounds 14.8m
exceptional rationalisation charge and a Pounds 24.3m extraordinary loss on
disposals.
Profits from retail operations were Pounds 10m last year compared with
Pounds 19.2m the year before.
However, Mr David Simons, finance director, said the group had experienced a
significant trading improvement in the second half of the year and was
showing clear signs of recovery.
The trend had continued over the first few weeks of the current year, he
added, with group sales running at 7 per cent higher than a year ago.
Mr Simons attributed the pick-up in sales to internal improvements made at
Storehouse rather than to a general strengthening of consumer sales.
BhS was the biggest contributor turning a first-half deficit into a Pounds
500,000 advance to Pounds 22.1m by the year end. But Mothercare saw a
reversal in its fortunes falling from a Pounds 6.8m profits into a Pounds
3.9m loss. Habitat reduced losses from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 8.8m. Earnings
per share rose from 1p to 2.6p. The final dividend was held at 2.5p
maintaining the yearly payout at 5p. Storehouse said this reflected its
financial strength and optimism for the future.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, yesterday paid tribute to Mr Julien's
achievement in strengthening the company's finances and refocusing the
group's operations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There were grounds for mild optimism in Storehouse's annual results. The
return to profit was mainly thanks to a second-half bounce in the BhS chain
which Mr David Dworkin has done much to improve. Now promoted to chief
executive, he should be able to work the same trick at Mothercare, but the
benefits will take time to accrue. Habitat, which lost Pounds 9m last year,
remains an uglier proposition. Its US operation looks a prime candidate for
closure. That could leave the way open for a sale of the remaining French
and UK assets to management which would effect an immediate Pounds 10m boost
to profits.
Whatever happens, the market has been too enthusiastic about the group's
shares. After outperforming the sector by nearly 30 per cent this year, they
are on the same forward rating as those of Marks and Spencer. Yet Storehouse
made a mere Pounds 10m of trading profit on Pounds 1.2bn of turnover; five
years ago, profit was Pounds 130m on similar turnover. At present rates of
progress, the dividend will be barely covered this year. Storehouse still
has much to prove.

FT  22 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Farm reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to lose count of the number of times EC farm ministers have
definitively tamed the Common Agricultural Policy. As recently as the spring
of 1988, Brussels was celebrating an historic accord to apply
self-correcting price cuts and production limits once cereal and livestock
surpluses showed signs of spinning out of control. Within 18 months it was
obvious that this system was yet another in a long line of inadequate
responses.
To be fair the 29 per cent cereal price cut which forms the centrepiece of
yesterday's deal is deeper than anything hitherto contemplated, while the
principle of paying direct income support for farmers is a genuine
breakthrough. That said, there is still a danger that the politicians will
be grappling with some of the same issues four or five years down the line.
The explanation lies in doubts about whether the latest medicine is really
harsh enough, and whether farmers will gratefully cash their compensation
cheques and seek to increase output on land which is not taken out of
production. The headline 'set aside' target of 15 per cent will be more like
10 per cent in practice, and could be equivalent to 6-7 per cent on the
assumption that farmers choose to give up their lowest yielding land. With
productivity worth 2 per cent a year EC cereals output could be back to
current levels in four years' time.
If food processors are to maintain their profitability they will have to
respond to lower input costs with higher trading margins. Much will depend
on the competitive balance between manufacturers and retailers. Branded
products should be at an advantage, but in fragmented sectors like poultry
the likes of Sainsbury and the consumer will be in a position to take more
of the spoils.

FT  22 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Bank of England figures on sterling lending to the M4 private
sector contain something for everybody. Bulls of the economy will doubtless
claim that April's Pounds 5.1bn leap shows credit demand started to pick up
after the election. Bears will point to the notoriously unreliable seasonal
adjustment. April's growth followed a Pounds 400m fall in March. That could
suggest borrowing was deferred until after polling day. More likely the
series is simply erratic.
Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association appear to offer some
support for the optimistic school. Although there is certainly no sign of a
recovery in construction and property lending, there is a faint stirring of
activity in the manufacturing sector as well as in the wholesale and retail
distribution trades. The figures for corporate borrowing must be treated
with some caution, since prior weakness in the lending aggregate partly
reflected a switch of borrowing activity to the bond market. Net corporate
borrowing in the bond market was sharply down in April. So perhaps companies
were simply turning back to their banks because the government was hogging
the limelight in the bond market.
The BBA says bank lending on house purchases is not much above the level of
recent months. That suggests there is not much building society component to
the official money supply figures either. Had there been a sharp rise in
house lending in April, estate agents would surely have been trumpeting the
turnround in the market in February. All in all, the figures point to a weak
recovery at best.

FT  22 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BT plays a canny hand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's annual figures from BT provided a model of regulator and
investor relations. Other unloved monopolies, notably British Gas, would do
worse than take notes. The novel, if tiny, fall in BT's pre-tax profits and
the more substantial slippage of its rate of return were elegant reminders
that the regulatory regime has indeed begun to bite. At the same time, the 8
per cent dividend increase and assurance that the payout will not be
directly linked to a declining earnings stream were designed to keep
shareholders sweet.
Given that Oftel is shortly to complete a review of BT's prices, the company
has played a canny hand. Consumers will doubtless be hoping it has not
outplayed the regulator entirely. Oftel's problem is how seriously it should
take yesterday's figures as a guide to the future. While the present price
formula is certainly hurting BT - fourth quarter earnings per share fell by
12 per cent - it is not clear that it should be eased just because inflation
has fallen. BT still has plenty of scope for job cuts and will continue to
generate huge amounts of cash.
But Oftel must also consider its general policy of encouraging competition.
Unless Sir Bryan Carsberg's successor intends a radical shake-up of the
entire UK industry, the likes of Mercury will find it harder to wrest market
share if BT's price cap is too harsh. Oftel might favour a gentler cap in
return for giving competitors better terms of access to BT's network.
BT shares rose by 2 per cent yesterday, mainly because the market was
pleased by the prospect of a smaller than expected charge from the
redundancy programme to this year's profits. Were the pricing review to be
favourable, the shares could rise a lot further again.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Letter: Law change that would remove inequities in pension
schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MORET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your leader ('Reform of the pension funds', May 11) rightly highlighted the
need for reform of the current occupational pensions framework. I fear that
tinkering with the existing structure, such as extending the 'Club' transfer
model as suggested by Mr Redman (Letters, May 13) complicates matters. The
final salary legislative framework that has evolved is already so complex
that the vast majority of its beneficiaries do not comprehend it and it
needs its own 'industry' to translate it.
Potentially, money purchase schemes have the merit of simplicity - and do
not suffer from the cross-subsidies and questions of ownership that plague
final salary schemes. Investment risks exist but these can be minimised.
More importantly, the members undeniably benefit from favourable investment
performance.
Unfortunately, occupational money purchase schemes remain subject to many of
the final salary benefit restrictions and other legal requirements.
Company-sponsored personal pensions plans, with freedom of investment, offer
a far simpler and flexible solution - but a change to the Financial Services
Act legislation is needed to enable employers actively to 'promote' such
schemes. This step, along with the introduction of some safeguards such as
restrictions on the marketing of high-cost products and controls on
commission levels, would go a long way to solving the inequities and other
recently exposed limitations of final salary schemes.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Letter: Electricity supply security forgotten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to add a few comments to your preview of the public
inquiry into the National Grid Company's application to erect new 400kv
transmission lines between Teesside and York ('National Grid faces first big
inquiry', May 19).
Chris Tighe's report rightly cited Enron's huge new gas-fired power station
at Wilton as the main catalyst and suggested that completion of the upgraded
lines by National Grid would enable that plant's net output to be sold into
the electricity pool.
In fact, in the name of competition, Prof Stephen Littlechild, the
director-general of electricity supply, in September 1990 gave National Grid
written derogation from its proper licence conditions on transmission
standards for the connection of new plant in respect of the Greystones
(Enron) station. This will enable the plant to sell its output before the
disputed lines are ready, under conditions of reduced system security.
The liberated market place therefore gives rise not only to environmental
concerns, as voiced at the Northallerton inquiry, but also to fears of
degraded security of supply. It was only a few years ago that the Department
of Energy confirmed at the Hinkley Point inquiry that transmission security
was an integral part of overall security of electricity supply, but that
message, like the department itself, is being forgotten.

UK (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIFFORD CHETWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Malcolm Craig is widely off the mark and totally inaccurate when he
writes of 'hotch-potch' training in the construction industry.
Construction, which employs one in 10 of Britain's workforce, has developed
a highly disciplined, properly integrated and, more to the point,
employer-led training base.
Led by the Construction Industry Training Board, it has the biggest youth
training programme of any industry in Britain, and YT has long been accepted
as the preferred method of entry training for craft workers.
More than 165,000 young people have been through the scheme under the CITB's
managing agency, training for up to two years in very specific
industry-related occupations. Today we are training some 16,000, despite the
recession.
Periods of instruction and supervised practice at a college or training
centre alternate with periods under supervision on site. These on-site
periods are generally spent with the trainee's sponsoring or employing
company in order to give practical experience of day-to-day working
techniques and conditions. There are 30 individual skills and occupations
for which the CITB provides YT programmes.
Until now, most of those completing the programme have gone on to gain City
and Guilds craft qualifications after further training under apprentice-type
arrangements. We expect most of those who complete the programme in future
to achieve the construction national vocational qualifications now jointly
awarded by the CITB and City and Guilds.
Equally important, more than 90 per cent of those who have finished the
programme have remained in the industry in permanent jobs. Surely evidence
enough to confirm that their training has been wholly relevant, and not
hotch-potch.

Sir, Malcolm Craig's Personal View ('Bring back apprentices', May 20) is one

total inadequacy of the reality of vocational training in Britain.

Sir, Ivo Dawnay's article ('Shadow boxing in the Labour ring', May 13)
continues your paper's tendency to see Labour's results in the recent
general election as a 'humiliating' defeat. Yet, the Labour party:
increased its number of MPs and percentage of the vote for the third
consecutive election;
reduced the government's previously large majority;
cut into the Liberal Democrat vote;
came within 1,000 votes of victory in 17 seats.
While, obviously, Labour lost the election, some analysis of the real losers
 -the continuing post-1983 decline of the Lib Dems and Paddy Ashdown's
strategy of replacing Labour by the Lib Dems, is needed. This will then give
a more balanced presentation.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Major's chance to take a lead in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing prepares you for your first sight of Budapest. I offer this thought
to Mr John Major, who will come here for the first time next week, following
his maiden visits to Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The bit western first-timers see is close to home, with its excellent
hotels, its range of shops from Benetton to McDonald's and its many imported
cars. The British prime minister will probably not have the necessary hours
to spare for an excursion down the Danube; if he did, he would take notice
of the boat houses and dachas that, with their owners at play in the sun
last weekend, reminded me of Florida's waterways. Stand on the riverside in
Pest and contemplate the wealthy suburbia in the hills of Buda and you could
persuade yourself that all the talk of a new third world on the European
Community's eastern border is misplaced; that, rather, this is one of the
fairest cities in what will surely become the Greater West.
The fancy could be elaborated. The democratically elected coalition
government includes Christian Democrats. It appears to be conservative,
cautious, apparently suited to Mr Major's taste. There is a functioning
opposition and a free press. The rule of law is slowly being re-established.
The prime minister, Mr Jozsef Antall - a comfortingly grey personality - has
maintained stability during these difficult early stages of establishing a
parliamentary democracy. Hungary is the most popular eastern destination for
western private capital. Foreign investment is pouring in, not only from
Germany and Austria but also from the US and even Britain. Earnings from
tourism and foreign trade are rising rapidly.
Mr Major will not wish to be bamboozled by the stage set components of this
picture. His Foreign Office brief will surely prevent that; alternatively,
common sense should be enough. The Hungarians deserve help and
encouragement, but this should not be allowed to disguise the fact that they
are only in year three of what could be a generation-long struggle to build
a prosperous, free and open society. Away from the shops and restaurants of
central Budapest, the visitor finds dark rows of ill-maintained buildings;
away from the capital itself the low standard of living of many Hungarians
is evident. On one rough estimate, 30 per cent of the people are better off
than they were under the communists, about a fifth are living at about the
previous standard and the remaining half are worse off.
Unemployment is rising: it could reach 15 per cent this year, according to
the Economic Research Institute. Inflation is falling, but might still end
up at 25 per cent in 1992. Productivity, national output and consumption are
all decreasing. The anecdotal evidence is of families crowded in dingy
flats, widespread job losses and, in compensation, the flourishing of a
black economy first developed under communist rule.
The new democracy's roots are fragile, and in thin soil. Plum positions are
still allocated on an old boy network; former communists get their
disproportionate share. Civil society, with its plenitude of independent
institutions, has been corrupted over the past 40 years; it could not be
re-established overnight. Most of the politicians are painfully
inexperienced. Their factional quarrels, shown on television, have
disenchanted a public for whom, in some quarters, there is a nostalgia for
the certainties of communist rule. The turn-out in recent by-elections has
fallen below 20 per cent. Mr Antall, accused by his opponents of incipient
authoritarianism, clearly has no patience with the partisanship of the
opposition press. His attempts to treat the heads of the official radio and
television networks as paid employees of a politicised civil service have
been frustrated by the president and the constitutional court. It is not the
third world, but it is not the first either.
Yet it undoubtedly belongs within the west European family. Mr Major's
primary task next week is to assure the heads of the Polish, Czechoslovak
and Hungarian governments that he not only believes this, but that when
Britain assumes the presidency of the European Community in a few weeks he
will behave as one who regards their eventual full membership as certain. As
Mrs Margaret Thatcher said in Bruges in September 1988: 'We must never
forget that, east of the Iron Curtain, peoples who once enjoyed a full share
of European culture, freedom and identity have been cut off from their
roots. We shall always look on Warsaw, Prague and Budapest as great European
cities.'
This makes Mr Major's task clear, but awkward. He must affirm EC and UK
support and sympathy while yet reminding his hosts in all three capitals of
what it takes to become a thriving democracy. Mr Antall is most at home in
German; his relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl is close. The Hungarian
prime minister may accept private advice from Bonn but is unlikely to
respond well to anything that would resemble public preaching from London.
He might, characteristically, defend himself by emitting a cloud of
verbiage, most notably on the bloodshed in Yugoslavia, where many Hungarians
are trapped by the war. He can present his republic as a tranquil island in
a potentially inflamed central Europe.
Yet Hungary sees eventual EC membership and the protection of a European
security umbrella as the principal aims of its external policy. This is the
logic of its history: it has ever been the vassal, the colony, or the client
state of one or another giant neighbour. It does not wish to repeat the
experience. It can thus reasonably be kept aware of the necessary
qualifications for membership of the various European clubs. Press freedom
is one of them. The International Press Institute, meeting in Budapest this
week, urged political leaders in former communist countries to accept a free
role for the media, since the new governments would be judged on their
attitudes to political expression. Mr Major will see the value of
reinforcing this message.
To leave it at that would, however, be to lose an historic opportunity. With
President Bush pre-occupied with his election campaign and the French
president and the German chancellor both weakened by domestic political
difficulties, the British prime minister is in a unique position to propose
a new course for western policy in the post-communist age. We knew what we
wanted in the half-century after Yalta: it was to roll the Soviets back. But
now someone has to explain, in language as vivid as Mrs Thatcher would use,
why it is in our interest to move the boundaries of the west eastwards over
the coming decades.

Comedy programmes had been accumulating on Fridays to the point where there
were rather too many of them. You had to use the video recorder at 9.00
either for Rory Bremner, now much our best impressionist, on BBC2, or for
Cheers on Channel 4, though admittedly this series set in a Boston singles
bar currently consists of repeats. At 10.00 came one of the week's funniest
programmes, the game show based on recent news stories, Have I Got News For
You (BBC2), followed promptly by Clive Anderson Talks Back on C4 at 10.30.
All that is still the case, and now what have they done? Added a new series
on BBC1, Joker In The Pack, in which Marti Caine introduces 'ordinary people
with a natural joke-telling talent'. This, too, takes the form of a game
show, with competing teams in the studio and the audience joining in with
favourite jokes.
However, the most remarkable of Friday's funny programmes are usually Made
In The USA in which Laurie Pike illustrates some of the wilder aspects of
Amerika by way of clips from cable television (11.10 C4); and Married With
Children, an American sitcom which exults in pre-political correctness
attitudes.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Richard III
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Eyre's production of the bloody tragedy is back again at the
National, before it tours America. No doubt the Minnesota audience will find
it as impressive as Londoners have done; but they will find it a longer sit,
too, for they are going to miss a great many lines.
Not because the text is badly spoken; indeed it is very well spoken - but
also, deliberately, 'well-spoken' in the classy modern-English sense. Across
the Atlantic, those squeezed vowels and juiceless consonants (as affected by
certain upper-middle circles, J. Arthur Rank actors and theatrical knights)
will cry out for surtitles. It is an under-remarked fact that whereas 'good'
French, Italian or Spanish is distinguished by its clarity, 'good' British
English has the phonetic marks of a rancid provincial dialect.
Eyre wanted those voices because his Richard is set critically in the
England of some 50 years ago. That was when Brecht was raiding Shakespeare's
play for his Hitler-play, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui; Eyre repays the
compliment by rendering the original as if it were the 'Ui' story. Where
Brecht fingered German industrialists and aristos as the collaborators who
smoothed Ui/Hitler's path, Eyre presents Richard's partners and victims as
the modern Establishment who might have let Fascism into Britain.
In the black spaces and the stark industrial lighting devised by Bob Crowley
and Jean Kalman, it makes a terrific show. There are losses, but one almost
forgets them in the dazzling glare of Ian McKellen's star Richard, crisply
supported by a large and skilful team. Here, Richard's differently-abledness
takes the form of galloping alopecia and stiff left limbs, compensated by a
prehensile right hand that does tricks no less hypnotically fascinating than
Antony Sher's famous spider-crutches. McKellen's demise is extended into
one-legged ballet of a rare virtuoso order.
This Richard in his time plays many parts, starting with the grim,
self-regarding persona of some Second World War Generalissimo - rendered
with such fruity gruffness that even from the fifth row I had to fill in
some lines from memory. Little by little, the tics and twitches begin to
seem generated from some desperate inner stress. Where Olivier wielded a
monstrous glamour and played teasingly with his various prey, McKellen
offers a brilliant solo study: it exerts an implacable grip, but reduces the
other characters to abject, terrorised victims.
They do what they can, but until the interval the audience responded to all
their griefs as to black comedy. We were intrigued, not moved. There was no
perverse erotic spark in Richard's wooing of Lady Anne (Anastasia Hille),
and for Buckingham the prescribed Establishment mutter dampened Terence
Rigby's solid, wary grandee. Only later, when the royal ladies went
splendidly into passionate-denunciation mode, did we begin to feel for the
losers. On the final scenes, Peter Darling's Richmond who will be Henry VII
 -bestows a dewy sitcom sweetness that shifts the action fast-forward into
the 1980s.
Lyttelton Theatre, to May 26

FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Avant-garde ball for Cinderella - Vienna Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great, the good and the frankly pretentious from the theatrical
avant-garde have descended on Vienna in equal measure this year. As Europe's
showcase for radical drama, the Festwochen lays down no rigid themes, but
over the days connections emerge: this time an emphasis on classic
archetypes, from fairy tale to Shakespeare, controversially updated.
The hot news from week one is that the new English production Cinderella,
adapted by Tony Britten and Nick Broadhurst from Rossini's La Cenerentola,
is star of the show and one of the most dazzling examples of contemporary
revision which, through images drawn from our own social reality - the
Ferrari, Essex Man - revitalises the essential myths love and forgiveness,
power and control, survival - of the original.
Britten and Broadhurst are founders of Music Theatre London, the opera
ensemble which casts actors and singers, rather than opera singers, in witty
new translations of opera-drama. Their Cinderella opening out-shocks Opera
Factory's 1980s bikini Cos fan tutte: The ugly sisters, played i travesti by
Simon Butteriss in a butch pink swimsuit and by William Renton in a froth of
petticoats, lounge on the diving board of a pool and swap transvestite
fantasies about Prince Ramiro's ball. Cinders flames the plastic red
barbecue and fixes the sunshades on the Costa-del-Basildon villa guarded by
a life-size ceramic Rottweiler.
Dad, Don Magnifico, is Essex Man, floral braces, gold pyjamas, east London
accent intact ('who was that bimbo who turned up?' he asks at the ball),
boastful/deferential in his philistine sneering. In Tim Hardy's parody,
comic yet menacing, the violence to Cinderella clearly stems from his own
repression.
His opposite is philosopher Alidoro, Oxbridge charmer (Kevin Colson), who
offers himself as alternative father. Freudian implications, the girl's
longing for her unattainable father, are thus embodied: Alidoro the ideal,
Don Magnifico the monster.
Interwoven is class warfare. Social disguise is the key in both Perrault and
Rossini, where Ramiro swaps roles with his valet. Here Dandini (Harry
Burton) is the chauffeur rigged up as HRH in a kilt, attended by tartanned
royals. Ramiro (soprano Gaynor Miles), the 'choufleur d'amour' pondering
his/her sexuality completes a kinky pantomime trio: the i travesti roles
bring out sexual as well as social undercurrents.
It is romance within a post-Thatcherite parable of the rise and fall of the
self-made man. Flimsy as his Cindy-doll-by-the-pool home, Don Magnifico has
no chance once pitted against the royals (his 'get yer arses down ere'
evokes another classic English social satire, Eliza at the races in My Fair
Lady). Revealed as a bankrupt, he is saved from repossession by Old Money
when Cinderella, in a stream of quicksilver lyricism from Jan Hartley
Morris, marries her prince.
With an onstage orchestra of eight jazzing up Rossini, this is a vintage
1990s show, set in a broken golden arch it blazes with deconstructionist
wit; Alidoro, a Prospero-Zarusthro figure, fashions paper hearts during the
love duets and remote controls a toy Ferrari, driven by models of Ramiro and
Dandini, across the stage to precipitate the denouement. The
libretto/dialogue, sarcastic and slangy ('you watch your lips now/just get a
grip now'; 'Am I dreaming? am I hell?/It's a setback, not an ending') is
matched by yuppie slapstick - poolside dunkings, petticoats singed on the
barbecue - and high camp hi jinks, and acted to the hilt by this talented
young company.
If Cinderella has 'British class obsession' stamped all over it, Katharina
Thalbach's Macbeth is a quintessential Berlin export: a Brechtian
interpretation which turns Shakespearean tragedy on its head and makes of
the bloody male world of Macbeth a feminist triumph.
Malcolm Rutherford saluted this production when it briefly visited London
this winter, and I add my voice to his. With its grim illustration that
power corrupts, Macbeth has of course the perfect Brechtian plot. Thalbach
despatches the soldier-monarch in just over two shrill and breathless hours
during which Marcus Vollenklee triples in size from hen-pecked weakling to a
bloated, parody of kinghood. Gone are the long speeches, the philosophising:
this is a Macbeth action-packed as a cartoon strip, bright with caricature
and expressionist display. Thus when Guntbert Warns plays Duncan as a
pastiche of Bernard Minetti, the 86-year-old Berlin actor who had his debut
with Max Reinhardt in the 1920s, Thalbach is making a theatrical joke which
later turns into a neat political point: the same actor, as Macduff,
discovers Duncan's corpse - friend and foe, survivor or victim, are equally
ridiculous in the game of war and heroics.
'Fair is foul and foul is fair', the witches scrawl on a wall. They are
recast here as a cross between The Threepenny Opera's Tart-without-a-heart
Jenny and Brecht's streetwise pacifist Mother Courage. They dance, hang
above the stage on ropes like seductive spiders, then pamper Macbeth as in a
brothel. Their dance of death is at once a showpiece and the last word: 'We
don't need a new master, we don't need one at all', they chant in an almost
exact quotation from Brecht's die Rundkopfe und die Spitzkopfe.
Thalbach is an entertainer with the technical imagination to channel her
subversive message into a coherent masterpiece of staging. At the other
extreme of Shakespearean innovation, Vienna has Romeo Castellucci's Amleto,
which with a cast of one plus a chorus of stuffed toys offers a futuristic
Hamlet set in a man-size circuit board of tangled wires and flashing lights.
I cannot report on the language of the production because, between electric
shocks and toy pistol shots, Paolo Tonti stutters like an autistic
Christopher Robin through a text where not one word is fully uttered. His
father's ghost is a teddy bear, Gertrude is a kangaroo and Ophelia a wind-up
doll.
This is not a Spitting Image joke but a two-hour performance deadly serious,
mightily pleased with its own metaphors of non-communication, and achingly
dull. Heiner Muller's Hamlet Machine did this sort of thing properly at last
year's Berlin festival; can the Festwochen organisers really not distinguish
between copycat gibberish and original vital reworkings? Two further redrawn
classics are to come to Vienna in June: Bruno Moderna's composition
Hyperion, after Holderlin, and Needcompany's Antony and Cleopatra. On this
showing, they will be either brilliant or beastly.
'Cinderella' is sponsored by Mobil; the Festival continues until June 4

FT  22 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Travel case will be heard in Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMED EL CHIATY &amp; CO v THOMAS COOK GROUP LTD Queen's Bench Division
(Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: May 5 1992
A WRITTEN contract expressed to be governed by a foreign law but silent as
to jurisdiction, may be treated as rectified for the purposes of the action
in any Division of the High Court on the application of the plaintiff or the
defendant, if there was prior oral agreement between the parties that the
foreign court should have exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes and they
mistakenly believed that the express wording as to the governing law
achieved that effect.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when staying three actions by Hamed El Chiaty &amp; Co,
trading as Travco Nile Cruise Lines (Travco), against Thomas Cook Group Ltd,
on claims arising under agreements for charter of the Nile Rhapsody.
HIS LORDSHIP said Travco was an Egyptian tourist company specialising in
Nile cruises. Thomas Cook was an English travel company.
Under a project originating towards the end of 1987, Thomas Cook was to help
finance the construction of Nile Rhapsody by Travco, and then charter her
from Travco for use on package tours.
Thomas Cook guaranteed a stipulated minimum of passengers for each trip.
Written contracts were drawn up. They provided that 'this agreement shall be
governed by Egyptian law', but were silent as to jurisdiction.
Thomas Cook's case, strongly denied by Travco, was that in 1988 it was
agreed that the contracts would be subject to Egyptian law and to the
exclusive jurisdiction of Egyptian courts.
It said it could rely on the principle in El Amria (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 119
that the court would generally enforce such an agreement unless the
plaintiffs could show a strong reason for not doing so.
Its second line of attack was that it was entitled to a stay on the basis of
forum non conveniens on the principles in Spiliada (1987) AC 460.
The consequence of establishing the Egyptian jurisdiction agreement would be
a shift in burden of proof in favour of Thomas Cook.
Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2 1990. The ensuing crisis engulfed the
tourist trade in Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Thomas Cook failed to
fulfil its guarantees. On February 4 1991, the British Foreign and
Commonwealth Office advised people not to travel to Egypt without strong
reason. On February 25, Thomas Cook purported to invoke force majeure, and
that was re-iterated in March.
On the evidence, the court found that in January 1988 the parties agreed
orally that disputes should be subject exclusively to Egyptian law and
Egyptian jurisdiction, and that they thought (wrongly) that the clause
inserted in the contract had that effect.
Snell's Equity 29th Edition 1990, page 626, having noted that rectification
claims were assigned to the Chancery Division, stated that 'any Division may
give effect to a defence of rectification as regards transactions without
actually rectifying the instrument'.
In Mostyn (1876) 1 CPD 145,150, the Court of Common Pleas held that if a
defendant in that Division set up facts which in the Chancery Division would
entitle him to have an instrument reformed or set aside, 'though this
Division cannot reform or set it aside with regard to its effect in future
it may, for the purpose of determining the action, treat it as set aside'.
In Breslauer v Barwick (1876 36 LT 52), the same court applied Mostyn and
treated a charterparty as if a mistake as to the plaintiff's identity were
amended, since 'facts were shown as would cause the Chancery Division to
reform it'.
Both cases were of general application.
The statement in Snell was accurate, subject only to the qualification that,
having regard to Breslauer, a plaintiff as well as a defendant was entitled
to invoke the power.
As to whether the Chancery Division would have made a rectification order,
there must be 'convincing proof' that there was a prior agreement, that it
was still effective when the relevant instrument was executed, that by
mistake the instrument failed to carry out that agreement, and that if
rectified as claimed, the instrument would carry out the agreement (Snell
628-632; Joscelyne v Nissen (1970) 2 QB 86).
There was convincing proof of all four aspects. In the exercise of its
discretion, the court would treat the contracts as rectified, so that 'this
agreement shall be governed by English law' read as 'this agreement shall be
governed by Egyptian law and all disputes hereunder shall be referred to the
exclusive jurisdiction of Egyptian courts'.
Thomas Cook was entitled to invoke the El Amria test. That was sufficient to
dispose of the summonses in its favour.
The Spiliada tests laid down by Lord Goff were that a stay would only be
granted on the ground of forum non conveniens 'where the court is satisfied
that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction,
which is the appropriate forum for trial of the action, ie, in which the
case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the
ends of justice'.
In applying the first test, the correct approach was to consider which
country was the natural forum.
On the second test, the key factor was whether the plaintiffs could
establish that they would not obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction.
As to the first test, the fact that a contract was governed by foreign law
was highly material - not only because a foreign court was obviously best
fitted to adjudicate on its own law, but also because it avoided the expense
of bringing expert witnesses to the UK to debate foreign law issues.
In the present case substantial points of legal principle were at stake.
Egypt had a modern civil code system, modelled mainly on French law. Other
sources of law included custom, Islamic law, natural law and equity.
It was not a case in which English courts would be applying familiar
principles.
On nearly all the Egyptian law issues, there was almost total disagreement
between the expert witnesses.
Force majeure was a very important potential defence. The experts disagreed
as to the relevant provisions of the Egyptian Civil Code. The legal
questions were pre-eminently more suitable for decision in Egypt than in the
UK.
Thomas Cook understandably found it necessary to lead evidence from Egypt as
to the general effect of the Kuwait crisis and Gulf War on tourism there.
In relation to Egyptian law and to Egyptian evidence, the force majeure
issue pointed very strongly in favour of Egypt.
As to damages, there was dispute between the experts. One said damages would
be assessed on a net loss of profit basis. The other said parties might fix
damages in advance.
So far as evidence was concerned, Thomas Cook would need to scrutinise
Travco's accounts (partly in Arabic) and to call crew members of Travco's
vessels and suppliers of services on the Nile.
It followed that in relation to Egyptian law and evidence the damages issue
pointed very strongly in favour of Egypt.
The court was satisfied that the evidence as a whole pointed overwhelmingly
in favour of Egypt as the natural forum, since the actions had their most
real and substantial connection with Egypt. Egypt was another available
forum with competent jurisdiction which was clearly and distinctly the
appropriate forum for trial of the actions. Thomas Cook had satisfied the
first Spiliada test.
As to the second test, the burden was on Travco to show juridical
disadvantage. It relied on delay, interest and costs.
In respect of costs, which were not recoverable in Egypt, and to a small
extent in respect of delay and interest, Travco would suffer juridical
disadvantages if the action was stayed in England.
That fell far short of establishing that Travco would be deprived of
substantial justice if the UK actions were stayed and trial took place in
Egypt.
Justice did not require that a stay should not be granted. Travco failed
under the second Spiliada test.
The actions were stayed.
For Thomas Cook: Charles Haddon-Cave (Field Fisher Waterhouse).
For Travco: Jonathan Gaisman (Linklaters &amp; Paines).

<TEXT>
Paul Bobroff has stepped down as managing director of Mark-heath, the
loss-making property company 60 per cent owned by the Australian Adelaide
Steamship Group.
The resignation of Bobroff, 40, who founded the group in the early 1970s,
was 'mutually agreed' with the rest of the board. His departure marks a
change in direction for the company, which is returning to its core business
of property investment and development.
In recent years, Bobroff had tried to diversify by taking a stake in Camford
Engineering, a motor components company which has since been sold, and in
Frogmore, a property investment company. However, the plan to create a
diversified group was interrupted by the property recession and the
retrenchment of the parent company, which underwent a debt restructuring.
In a statement to the stock exchange, the company explained Bobroff's
resignation as: 'In the present circumstances of the UK property market,
there is restricted opportunity for someone whose main interests are in
creating and executing corporate transactions.'
Instead of appointing a new managing director, the board will report to
Michael Rendle, the chairman, who is a former managing director of British
Petroleum, and Richard Westcott, a non-executive director.

Young he may be, at 43, but Neil Johnson will bring a lot of long-term
insight into the UK industrial scene when he takes up the post of
ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION director-general in July.
The Cardiff and Sandhurst-educated Johnson has been witness to nearly 20
years of transformation in UK engineering, from what at times has been one
of its most changeable and uncomfortable vantage points: Rover Group, nee
British Leyland, nee BLMC, nee British Motor Corporation.
After serving as a graduate trainee with Lex Service, Johnson joined BLMC in
1974.
In the course of seven years, in a variety of capacities, he watched at
close quarters as appalling labour relations, productivity and other
problems took Britain's biggest car-maker to the brink; and as one of Sir
Michael Edwardes' corporate strategists helped tentatively pull it back
again.
He acquired another perspective from helping to package Jaguar for
privatisation after joining it as sales and marketing director in 1981.
Post-Jaguar's privatisation, 'soldiering on' for Johnson assumed literal
meaning - he took a three-year secondment to the Ministry of Defence,
commanding the 4th Battalion, Royal Green Jackets, before returning to Rover
as sales and service director for Land Rover Worldwide. Currently he is
Rover Group's director of European Operations.
An affable father of three, as full-time EEF chief executive, Johnson will
be expected to lead from the front in further developing the federation's
representational ties, both with the UK government and, increasingly, EC
institutions.

Richard Andrew, a former executive director of Scandinavian Bank in the UK,
has been appointed chairman and chief executive of Wimpey's housebuilding
division. He also becomes a director of George Wimpey, Britain's second
largest housebuilder.
It is unusual for a housebuilding company to appoint a chief executive from
outside the construction industry, but as Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's group chief
executive, explains: 'Richard Andrew will bring appropriate financial
experience to an area where asset management is the key to profitability and
success.'
The decision to appoint a banker reflects Wimpey's view that Britain's entry
into the EMS will change the way in which the UK housing market has
traditionally operated and will make financial skills more important.
Andrew, 47, was formerly director responsible for strategic planning and
international business for the bank. In 1987 he was appointed chairman of

Sharks generally get a pretty poor press, but it seems they do have some
rather surprising uses.
An international dermatologists' conference in Perth, Australia was told
last week that shark bile, secreted by the liver to aid the digestion of
fats, cuts down grease production and reduces acne significantly.
David Fenton of St Thomas's Hospital, London, told the conference that in a
study of 15 patients who applied shark bile extract spray on their faces
twice a day, 14 had significantly improved or altogether cleared their acne
problems within two months. Two months after treatment stopped, the spots
returned.
Known as isolutrol and marketed as Ketsugo, the solution has been patented
by McFarlane Laboratories, a family-owned Melbourne drug company. McFarlane

Airport arrival and departure displays provide important information to
passengers about flights, but behind the scenes flight and other information
is used by everyone from the airport controllers to service suppliers and
accountants.
Often this has meant re-keying information, which is costly and increases
the risk of error. But Sign2000, designed by Sheffield-based Sanderson
Computers, is a computerised information display and management system which
allows users to access the information as required.
The first installation at Newcastle Airport provides arrival and departure
information, gate departure data, aircraft parking and weather information
for flights.
The system can also control baggage carousels and provide information to
airport suppliers like aviation fuel and catering operators. Sanderson

In a healthy person the heart responds to exercise and sustained physical
activity by accelerating the heartbeat and pumping more oxygen-carrying
blood around the body. But in diseased or damaged hearts pacemakers do the
work.
Conventional pacemakers work with a piezoelectric (activity) sensor which
speeds up heart rate in response to physical activity. But doctors have
found a way to sustain higher heartbeat rates and improve workload capacity
by adding a minute ventilation sensor.
Medtronic's new Legend Plus pacemaker, which was implanted for the first
time in a 60-year-old patient in Munich last month, stimulates a diseased or
damaged heart to pump more blood in response to the body's varying needs for
oxygen.
The new device weighs 40 grams and lasts for more than eight years.

FT  22 MAY 92 / The Property Market: UK giant profits from its cautious ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Hunt, chairman of Land Securities, the UK's largest property
company, sat in his splendid new offices overlooking Trafalgar Square in
central London and gently scoffed at the critics who believe the company is
too cautious. 'If we had geared up two years ago as the brokers said we
should, we (he motioned to his fellow directors) would not be here.'
The claim was something of an exaggeration at a time when his rivals have
kept their jobs in spite of some hair-raising mistakes. But Mr Hunt can be
forgiven for pressing the point. Land Securities has been a model of
prudence - at a time when extravagant gestures were two-a-penny in the
sector.
The company's caution has been rewarded by the stock market, where its share
price has significantly out-performed the rest of the sector. And the trend
could well continue; a poll of investors by Gallup for Chartered Surveyor
Weekly, a trade magazine, this week suggested that Land Securities would be
the best performing property share of the year.
Investors appreciate the liquidity of Land Securities' shares in addition to
the company's stability and broad exposure to property. 'It's almost like an
institution,' says Mr Marc Gilbard of County NatWest, the brokers.
Few of Land Securities' stock market rivals offer such security of income.
Three quarters of the company's rental income is underpinned by leases
expiring beyond 2000, without break clauses and with upward only rent
reviews.
The company has not put a foot wrong in recent years and its stalwart,
defensive qualities are exactly attuned to investors' needs at present.
But for how much longer? Will its supporters abandon it in better times, as
they have done in the rising markets of the past? Moreover, might the very
qualities that have stood it in such good stead as an investment make it a
target of criticism in the broader context of the economy as whole?
The criticism of Land Securities is largely directed at its conservatism and
bulk. Its tenants, struggling in the teeth of recession, could be forgiven
for viewing the company as a rent-collecting machine, which reaps its
profits from the structure of a UK property market which heavily favours
landlords.
Land Securities' rents - among the highest in the world - are protected by
lengthy leases, upward only reviews and the right to claim rent from an
original tenant if it assigned a lease to a company that subsequently
defaulted. At a time when these contracts are driving businesses into
receivership, large landlords such as Land Securities are sometimes seen as
burdens on business rather than providers of an essential service.
The company's apparently effortless ability to generate higher profits has
long provoked envy as well as admiration. 'Landsits: How to stay in bed and
make Pounds 10m' thundered a newspaper headline in 1980.
The same reaction has often been provoked by Land Securities' ability to
increase the value of its portfolio (with two notable exceptions: in the
property crash of the early 1970s, the value of its portfolio crashed by 38
per cent; and the 32 per cent decline over the past two years). In the
1980s, a newspaper complained: 'There is something almost indecent about a
company which sees its value increase by more than Pounds 1bn in a single
year with barely a sign of sweat on its management's brow.'
A common charge against Land Securities is that after it had built itself up
through an audacious programme of borrowing and takeovers, it then simply
sat on the best sites in London. This emphasis on acquiring the best
positions in London was reflected in the enduring motto of the company's
founder, Lord Samuel: 'Location, location, location.'
The company's natural caution was reflected in its reluctance to pioneer new
markets in the Docklands. This bewildered more adventurous developers,
including Olympia &amp; York, which thought that London's established landlords
were responsible for the capital's outdated and expensive office stock.
Land Securities' policy of shunning new locations such as the Docklands
could have been risky. During the heady days of the late 1980s, it seemed as
though the primacy of location (ie, the City) would be replaced by the need
for the most up-to-date product (as provided by the Docklands) as the most
important priority for tenants. In the event, following the difficulties of
Olympia &amp; York, Land Securities' reserve in venturing into the Docklands
seems vindicated.
Criticism of the company's conservatism does not rankle with Land
Securities. The company remains unabashed about its lack of enthusiasm for
pioneering offices in east London. Mr Hunt believes that London will go on
developing in a westerly direction. He describes the government's promotion
of the Docklands and its lackadaisical attitude to transport planning as
'extraordinary'.
The government's decision, late in the day, to give priority to east
London's infrastructure over central London is 'monstrous', says Mr Hunt.
'The taxpayers working in the centre deserve to have central London tubes
and railways built with their money before that thing in east London,' he
says.
Land Securities can also shrug off the idea that it has an outdated
portfolio. During the 1980s, it spent hundreds of millions on revitalising
its portfolio. The task of updating its Pounds 4.3bn of property is an
endless one and the process will continue, although the slump in the market
has forced Land Securities to mothball its planned redevelopment of
buildings such as Stag Place in Victoria.
Even its concentration on central London offices - which are still set to
under-perform - is less overwhelming than previously. Retail and industrial
property now account for more than half the portfolio's value, the result of
a conscious shift in strategy as well as the slump in office values. Land
Securities now likes to describe itself as the biggest retail investor on
the market.
Yet some property experts think it is just too large to be nimble. 'It is
like a crude oil tanker,' says one. 'If it wants to change direction by five
degrees, it takes 20 miles to do it.'
This is a long-standing criticism. Back in 1979, Mr Joseph Sebag, then one
of the UK's top property brokers, issued a call for the company to be broken
up. 'We believe that the group is now just too large to manage dynamically
and consider the management's philosophy is to put safety before
entrepreneurial gain,' he said.
The young Turks of the 1980s property expansion agreed and repeatedly ran
their slide rules over Land Securities. They reckoned they could secure
greater returns by borrowing and working the companies' assets harder,
although in the end, the company was always too big to be threatened.
The charge that Land Securities is an under-geared monolith that is
insufficiently exploiting depressed market conditions may gather force when
the market recovers. Rivals which are more highly geared will see the
steepest increases in their assets, a key measure of a property company's
success.
But Land Securities remains unmoved. Although it has looked at the
possibility of corporate acquisitions it considers that none have sufficient
quality. It would prefer to cherry pick individual properties, while keeping
a stern eye on its own gearing, now at 43 per cent.
'We are not going to buy because brokers say we should,' says Mr Hunt. 'In a
valuation based business you have to be very careful with gearing.' The more
the company borrows, the greater impact falling property prices will have on
its net asset value.
Not all analysts think that Land Securities's asset values will take another
battering this year. Mr David Tunstall, a property analyst with Smith New
Court, a securities company, says an improvement in retail values could push
the company's net asset value up from 555p to 570p this year.
Most analysts have pencilled in another fall, some to as little as 500p over
the next two years. There is also reason to be cautious about future
profits. The large rent increases which were in the pipeline two years ago
have virtually disappeared in the worst-hit parts of the market.
But Land Securities has no reason to be on the defensive. It has made none
of the mistakes of its smaller rivals. And if inflation and the rewards of
heavy borrowing are things of the past, its cautious style may stay in
fashion.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE traditional annual pay rise will virtually vanish in the financial
services sector within two years, according to a survey published yesterday.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultants, found that 75 per cent of
companies had introduced performance-related pay and predicted that this
would increase to more than 90 per cent in the next two years.
Performance-related pay has grown rapidly in the private sector over the
past decade for white-collar and professional workers. KPMG said financial
services companies with established schemes regarded them as 'highly
successful' and were planning embellishments, for example group bonuses for
sales staff.
Performance pay is the norm in building societies, while some of the bigger
insurance companies have introduced such schemes and banks are following.
The large mutual life companies have been the slowest to introduce
performance pay schemes.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Building workers skirmish over pay: Strike organisers tell
Diane Summers why they believe the employers are vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIKE, CHRIS and Frank are sitting in a cafe after a hot day's work on a
central London building site. They would prefer to be quenching their thirst
in the pub next door, but have been asked to leave for wearing 'work
clothes' - the euphemism employed by landlords to protect white-collar
drinkers from the sight of the working man.
The pub is not the only place Mike, Chris and Frank are unwelcome to the
management. They are part of a team which has been organising unofficial
strike action and flying pickets on nine London building sites over the past
few weeks.
So far there have been only skirmishes, but the core group of 40 to 50
activists known as the Joint Sites Committee are threatening full-scale
battle with building contractors across the capital before the end of the
summer - Frank claims that even the new headquarters site for MI5 at
Vauxhall and MI6's site at Millbank have been penetrated.
Links are being forged with workers on sites in other parts of the UK, and
builders claim unofficial support from London Underground employees and
postal workers. Money to support strikers is raised at meetings, union
conferences and in canteens on building sites across London.
The issue is money - building workers have taken pay cuts of between 30 per
cent and 40 per cent over the past two years. Sometimes there is no pay as
subcontractors hit by the recession disappear and cheques bounce. Longer
working hours and deteriorating health-and-safety standards are also sources
of complaint.
Mike says there is deep anger among building workers: 'They can't pay the
rent - they've got nothing to lose by taking action. When there's a
confrontation with the employer, instead of walking away, they're standing
their ground. Anyway, they can't walk away, there are no other jobs.'
Now is a good time to strike, says Chris: 'The employers are weak. They've
cut their own profit margins even before the foundations are laid. They're
terrified of penalty clauses for not completing on time.'
Two years ago a bricklayer was getting between Pounds 75 and Pounds 80 a
day. Now jobs are being advertised at Pounds 48, says Frank. Rates for
labourers have dropped from around Pounds 40 to Pounds 60 a day to Pounds 35
a day, Chris says. The worst off might be left with Pounds 23 after tax, he
adds, for working from 8am to 6.15pm.
The figures are confirmed by research carried out by Ucatt, the main
building union, in support of this year's pay claim. Ucatt says building
workers have been doubly hit by the housing crisis. Many became first-time
buyers of properties they were building in the boom 1980s. Mortgaged up to
their necks, they have now seen earnings plummet.
For Mike, Chris and Frank, the official pay talks are an irrelevance. Like
700,000 other building workers out of a total 1.3m, they are self-employed
and sceptical of the effectiveness of union representatives.
Says Frank: 'A lot of the officials are only interested in their flash cars
and cushy jobs.' But Mike says some union officials have backed them, though
this has to be 'with a nod and a wink' because much of the action is illegal
secondary picketing and wildcat strikes without the balloting required by
law.
Some of the activists are union members - mainly Ucatt, with a few TGWU
general union members. Others - like a large proportion of the workers
taking action - belong to no union.
BUILDING employers yes-terday proposed a freeze on basic pay rates in talks
covering 600,000 building and civil engineering workers. The proposal was
rejected by the unions and further talks are due to be held on June 9.
The Building Employers Confederation and the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors said the industry was 'still stuck at the bottom of the longest
recession the economy has suffered since the 1930s'.

FT  22 MAY 92 / More charities submit accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY half of Britain's registered charities submitted accounts to the
Charity Commission last year in response to its drive to improve
administration of the sector.
The commission said yesterday that 46 per cent of registered charities
submitted accounts last year compared with only 11 per cent in 1989. Under
the new Charities Act, financial controls will be strengthened and the
commission believes a target of obtaining accounts from 80 per cent to 90
per cent of charities can be achieved by 1994.
The commission said in its annual report that at the end of last year there
were 166,503 charities on its database, and that 1,168 inactive
organisations were removed from it. The number of new charities registering
last year was 4,042.
The commission concluded 397 inquiries into charities last year as a result
of public complaints and its own monitoring, and irregularities were
discovered in 129 cases. Maladministration was the most common problem,
covering 40 per cent of cases. But 10 per cent involved fund-raising abuse
and 3 per cent involved charities engaging in political activities.
The new changes in the law will add to the responsibilities of charity
trustees. The report says the commissioners have decided that there is no
objection to trustees being insured for personal liability at their
charity's expense for acts 'either properly undertaken or undertaken in
breach of trust but under an honest mistake'.
The report says the commissioners were asked by the Law Society whether it
would be appropriate for solicitors employed by charities to draft wills of
prospective benefactors. The commissioners say drafting of wills is unlikely
to be a proper activity.

UNEMPLOYMENT in South Africa could climb to 7.3m or 57 per cent of the

Already there are over 5m unemployed, nearly two in five workers, the ILO
estimates.
While blacks bear the overwhelming burden of joblessness, the ILO says
unemployment and poverty have surfaced among whites for the first time since
the 1930s.
South Africa's labour force is expected to rise from 13.4m in 1990 to 20.2m
in 2025, with up to 500,000 workers entering the labour market each year.
Only 31,000 new jobs a year were created in the 1980s and fewer since then,
mostly in the public sector, the ILO notes.
The report also says South Africa has one of the highest rates of child

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   KHARTOUM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS are due to begin on Sunday in the Nigerian capital Abuja between the
Sudanese government and southern rebels who have been fighting a
particularly bloody civil war since May 1983.
The talks are being organised by Nigeria, which is current chairman of the
Organisation of African Unity and was given a mandate by the organisation
last year to bring the two sides together.
The Sudanese government delegation is due to meet Mr Lam Akol, who is one of
the leaders of the Nasir faction that has recently broken away from the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
Whether the SPLA leader, the dictatorial Mr John Garang, will himself be
present is not yet clear. On previous occasions in the last two years, when
the two sides established contact in Nairobi and Addis Ababa, Mr Garang was
known to be in town but would not meet the other side.
What might give hope for the present talks is that both sides have good
reasons for bringing the war to an end.
In the latest dry season of November to May the northern army has captured a
number of important southern towns. The SPLA was also weakened by the
collapse in Ethiopia last year of the hardline communist regime of Colonel
Mengistu, who had been its main outside backer.
On the northerners' side the main reasons for wanting peace now are
economic. Military spending has been consuming a large part of the
government's budget and a lack of progress towards peace in recent years has
been a main reason why Sudan has not received development aid from western
countries.
The army also has suffered heavy casualties in recent fighting. A military
hospital area near Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, has been closed
to civilians so that they cannot see the large numbers who have been coming
back from the south badly wounded. Before the recent campaign began there
were mutinies in some of the northern army garrisons.
But if the military and economic logic point to peace, the political signs
are less encouraging. The reasons go back to the breakdown of the Addis
Ababa agreement, which ended the earlier civil war of 1955 to 1972. The
agreement established a federal system of government which gave the south
autonomy and recognised its distinct cultural identity.
But later the central government began amending the boundaries of the south
so that it could transfer to the north a small oil discovery in the Upper
Nile province, some uranium deposits and the fertile Renk area bordering the
White Nile. Then there were attempts to introduce the north's Arab and
Islamic culture into the south.
If there is to be an agreement at Abuja one possibility is that the
southerners will have to accept that, even if they get regional autonomy
they will be disadvantaged second-class citizens in an Islamic state,
excluded from any important jobs in the north, which has 20m out of Sudan's
total population of 26m.
Alternatively the northern regime, if it is not prepared to weaken its
commitment to Islamic law Arabism, might think of allowing the south
complete independence. This is now discussed quite widely in Khartoum, where
it is suggested that some members of the government might like to be rid of
their Christian and pagan minority, but officials of the regime reject the
idea.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Nightmare in Bombay for bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Williamson's worst nightmare has come true. Since late 1989 when
he joined Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, he has been
trying to convince shareholders and rival banks that Standard's
accident-prone days were over.
However, late on Wednesday Mr Williamson, now managing director, disclosed
that the bank was making a Pounds 50m provision to cover possible losses on
an arcane form of securities business carried out by the bank's branch in
Bombay.
Indeed, yesterday he admitted that the Pounds 50m estimated loss was an
arbitrary figure. The loss should not be 'more than Pounds 100m' and it
'could be less' than the Pounds 50m.
Such uncertainty will not reassure the bank's shareholders, but it is
understandable. Mr Williamson got wind of the problem only last Wednesday,
when he was entertaining government officials in Brunei.
'When I was told, my initial reaction was shock, disbelief, lack of
comprehension,' he said. The source of the problem was a form of securities
business unknown to him. Indeed, it appears that no one in Standard's City
of London head office was aware the bank was involved in this business.
He then thought about flying to Bombay immediately, but could not get a visa
in Brunei or in Manila, his next stop. So in the event Mr David Brougham,
the bank's treasurer, and Mr Erick Naslund, its chief firefighter, were
flown out with more than a dozen other executives to investigate.
What they found was 'trunk-loads of paper', Mr Williamson said. 'Sorting it
all out could take months'. These banker's receipts are a form of IOU issued
by banks in India. Settlement of Bombay stock exchange transactions is a
lengthy and convoluted process. In order to create a more liquid market,
banks issued IOUs to each other, which were promises to deliver shares or
stock at some distant date.
The recipient of such an IOU was not supposed to transfer it to any other
institution. But Mr Williamson said that a market developed in the paper.
'It became a form of currency.'
The amount of paper circulating then exploded from the beginning of the
year, as Bombay share prices began to soar.
The only check on the integrity of the market was a monthly attempt by the
Reserve Bank of India to verify whether there was a balance between banks
claiming to be owed stock by virtue of the receipts they held, and those
banks recognising a liability to deliver stock. 'At the end of last month,
the Reserve Bank noticed there was a massive imbalance', said Mr Williamson.
'All the banks then started to assess their positions'.
What Standard Chartered found was shocking. It has an exposure to Pounds
100m of transactions where it cannot be certain of receiving payment.
Mr Williamson said there were three possible explanations for this
discrepancy:
It may be holding forged IOUs.
The counterparty named in an IOU may not have the financial capacity to
complete the transaction.
It may have received a claim from another bank and not have the securities
claimed.
Not all the Pounds 100m is likely to be lost. Over coming months Standard
should be able to make some further recoveries. However, it does not know
whether other banks are holding further IOUs making claims on it.

JIANG ZEMIN, the Chinese Communist party leader, has staked his position
firmly in the pro-reform camp with a glowing tribute to capitalism, Reuter
reports from Beijing.
In comments to graduates, carried on the front pages of all leading
newspapers yesterday, Jiang said the main goal of China's economic reform
was to learn from capitalist nations. Western diplomats said it was clear
Jiang had thrown in his lot with senior leader Deng Xiaoping's reform drive.
'The main goal and contents of China's reform and opening policy is to learn
all the good and advanced things from overseas, including from capitalist
countries, to speed up economic development,' Jiang was quoted as saying.
Learning from capitalist countries has been a theme of Deng's campaign to
speed up the pace of market-oriented change. It has been fiercely resisted
by ideologues who see it as a betrayal of socialist principles.
Diplomats said Jiang, along with Prime Minister Li Peng, lacked an
independent political base, and moved with prevailing winds. Consequently,
their statements were a good indication of the balance of power in China.
Sweden's Defence Research Establishment (FOA) said yesterday it had
monitored what it believed was the most powerful Chinese nuclear test
explosion since 1976, Reuter adds from Stockholm.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Military drives Nigeria to the brink: Michael Holman looks
at the causes of political malaise in Africa's most populous country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'NIGERIA is in the grip of a revolutionary pressure,' warned African
Concorde, one of the country's leading weekly news magazines, in mid-April.
An irate government confiscated the strongly critical issue and closed the
magazine for two weeks, but the warning is proving prophetic.
Nearly seven years after seizing office in a bloodless coup, President
Ibrahim Babangida faces a crisis that threatens next January's scheduled
handover to civilian rule, and imperils the stability of Africa's most
populous state.
At least 250 people are reported to have been killed in clashes in Kaduna
state, angry youths have rioted in Lagos, the biggest city, while trouble
yesterday broke out near Abuja, the new federal capital, and in Lagos, the
largest city. Police used tear gas to break up ethnic fighting in a Lagos
market.
The violence, often described as 'religious and ethnic riots', is
undoubtedly caused in part by rivalries in a country divided between a
largely Moslem north and mainly Christian south, and with three leading
ethnic groups. But the violence is also a symptom of a different malaise.
The military government is fighting for its life, undermined by economic
mismanagement and endemic corruption, and under attack for human rights
abuses. Living standards have fallen drastically in the 12 years since
Nigeria's oil boom ended.
The roots of the crisis can be traced back many years, but what may prove to
have been the turning point for the Babangida government came last March. A
big devaluation of the naira (from 10.5 naira to Dollars 1 down to 18 naira)
was a last-ditch attempt to shore up a faltering structural adjustment
programme, and meet one of the main conditions for the renewal of a lapsed
standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
The result was all pain and no gain. Prices soared, and inflation is set to
reach 50 per cent later this year. The IMF negotiations that followed failed
to clear other hurdles including the size of the budget deficit. Meanwhile
the IMF deadlock holds up urgently needed rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars
30bn external debt.
A series of other developments further eroded the government's standing. A
confidential World Bank report which reached the press was highly critical
of the lack of accountability in government spending - a polite way of
referring to corruption. Nigerians and foreign partners alike have been
dismayed by the government's profligate spending on Abuja, continued funding
of an uneconomic Dollars 5bn steel project, and a Dollars 1.4bn aluminium
project of arguable merit.
For all the promises of probity, the military elite is as corrupt as any
regime that preceded it, taking kickbacks on contracts and diverting
government funds. But for sheer audacity, the government's unrepentant
admission that it had provided middle-ranking army officers with private
cars on nominal repayment terms took some beating.
For infuriated Nigerians, with per capita income down by two-thirds over the
past decade, it was the act of a cynical self-serving regime.
If the return to civilian rule had whole-hearted support, there would be a
safety valve for the current tensions. But many Nigerians are resentful that
the government insists that only two political parties will be allowed,
their rule-books written by civil servants and indistinguishable the one
from the other.
If the violence continues, however, even this unsatisfactory path to
democracy may be closed - if not by Gen Babangida, then by his successor
from the barracks.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Quayle line on modern lifestyle causes furore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT NEVER ceases to amaze that a single sentence can spawn a million words.
Vice-President Dan Quayle's comment in California on Tuesday about a
fictional television character could yet break all records. It could also
make or break a few political reputations.
The furore surrounding his assault on the lifestyle of Murphy Brown - a
forty-something white, wealthy career woman who chooses to have a baby out
of wedlock - might be dismissed as just another example of the prevalent
confusion between fact and fiction, but for its immediate political impact.
It has demonstrated, above all, how concerned President George Bush's
re-election campaign is about shoring up his political base among Republican
conservatives, previously attracted to Mr Pat Buchanan but now under threat
from the prospective independent candidacy of Mr Ross Perot.
The clear strategy is for Mr Quayle, popular with such conservatives, to
secure this heartland, while Mr Bush plays a more aloof role. The
vice-president will be allowed to attack the media and all its creations,
real and imagined.
Mr William Barr, the attorney-general, has been designated a key supporting
actor in the upholding of law and social order.
The conservative message is that the collapse of traditional family values
is the real dagger pointing at America's heart and a key factor behind the
Los Angeles riots.
'It doesn't help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown - a character
who supposedly epitomises today's intelligent, highly paid, professional
woman - mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone, and
calling it just another lifestyle choice,' Mr Quayle said on Tuesday.
In the city ghettoes of the US, it is a fact that well over half of black
children are born out of wedlock, well over half of all families are headed
by single women, and well over half of all families live below the poverty
line.
But the relevance of their plight to the Murphy Brown character, a
television anchorwoman played by actress Candice Bergen, is distant. One
survey puts the programme, although the third most popular nationally, 55th
among black TV audiences.
As for the election strategy obligation for Mr Bush to play a kinder,
gentler role, events after Mr Quayle spoke laid bare one of the president's
great weaknesses: his frequent inability, especially when impromptu, to
articulate with any clarity what he does believe in. Mr Bush seemed
embarrassed, almost hapless, in the face of a barrage of reporters'
questions on the issue.
Abortion, which the president now opposes, is at the heart of the row. It
could be an Achilles heel for him this year. Only this week, Mr Bush
announced that a new human tissue bank would not be allowed to use tissue
from aborted foetuses.
Yet an ambivalence, an apparent desire to have it both ways, remains. This
leaves the president politically vulnerable to the more confident assertions
of his opponents and even of his supporters.
Mr Quayle does at least state what he thinks, with confidence, which is why
some pundits have taken to referring to him as the stronger part of the
Republican presidential ticket this year.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: Europe aims to sweep path to Uruguay
Round - One thorny problem may have been removed in the world trade talks,
but plenty more are waiting to take its place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor and FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   LONDON,, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS CARLA HILLS, US trade representative, was in no doubt two weeks ago
about the state of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation.
'The problem is agriculture: that is the problem that has to be swept away -
and the Europeans have the broom. We have to wait until they have a
consensus as to how they are going to treat with it.'
Today it seems the EC has delivered at least the consensus she needs.
Whether the package of CAP reforms provides an adequate broom for the
agriculture problem to be swept away has yet to be made clear. Much will
depend on meetings in Washington next week between US and EC negotiators.
Even if the point has indeed been reached where the agriculture problem can
be swept away, a new and unhappy reality may then be brought back into
focus: the dispute between the US and the EC is but one of the obstacles
blocking a Uruguay Round agreement. If this were now to be cleared away,
problems over market access agreements, and trade in services could yet
bring the agreement to grief.
Disagreement over farm trade reforms have blocked progress towards a
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round since the Brussels summit at the
end of 1990. Crisis was triggered there not by the US, but by Argentina,
which led a walk-out of farm exporters from the developing world in protest
at EC farm trade policies. They were angered not just because Europe remains
largely closed to their exports, but because the EC practice of dumping
subsidised farm products on to world markets had ruined food prices,
undermining their main source of export earnings.
For the past 18 months, all attempts to seal a Uruguay Round agreement have
foundered on EC resistance to farm reform. Hopes that had been revived in
December by publication of a draft agreement were quickly dashed in January
by EC rejection of its proposals for liberalisation of farm trade. Most
intractable were demands for a 20 per cent cut in domestic farm price
supports; for a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports, and a
36 per cent cut in their value; and for compensation payments to farmers to
be made in a form that did not encourage higher production.
In addition, the EC was demanding that the US cut its sales to Europe of
cheap grain substitutes, and that it agree a 'peace clause' preventing US
companies from using US courts to enforce demands linked with any part of
the farm trade agreement.
As far as farm price supports are concerned, Mr Ray MacSharry's proposals
appear to provide an important breakthrough: at 29 per cent, the cuts will
be deeper, and will be made earlier, than the draft Uruguay Round agreement
had demanded. Whether this augurs well for the unresolved issue of export
subsidies is unclear. It is nevertheless worth recalling that a senior US
trade negotiator said just two weeks ago: 'Whether it is export subsidies or
rebalancing or internal supports, it comes down to the price of grain.'
In Geneva yesterday, where Uruguay Round negotiators have faced mounting
frustration in recent months over the lack of headway, the proposed CAP
reforms received a cautious welcome. Officials from the Cairns Group of 14
agricultural exporting countries said they were cautiously optimistic that
the deal would inject 'fresh spirit' into the talks. But they needed to see
how the projected reform would translate into changes in the EC's bargaining
position over farm trade, and how it would affect products other than
cereals, such as dairy and sugar.
Cairns officials said the broad thrust of the reform appeared to be on the
right lines. As long as the rest of the package broadly followed the
agreement on cereals, it provided an assurance that the EC would make
sizeable cuts in farm subsidies, including export subsidies, and curb
over-production.
Officials added that yesterday's agreement meant that, for the first time,
the EC would be speaking with one voice on farm trade reform.
Set against the advantage for US negotiators that an EC position will at
last be clear when they meet in Washington next week is the disadvantage
that the EC now has very little negotiating flexibility. Having sweated
blood to wring this package of compromises out of EC member states, Mr
MacSharry has little scope to win further compromises. If the package falls
short of US and Cairns group demands, then further concessions will almost
certainly have to come from them rather than the EC.
A Uruguay Round farm trade breakthrough would immediately put Japan, Korea
and Canada into the hot seat. All three are under fierce pressure to open
their markets to farm products. All have been 'hiding' behind the US-EC
conflict in recent months.
For the Japanese government, concessions will be impossible until upper
house elections late in July. For Korea, embarrassment is even more acute.
The government faces elections at the end of this year, and could suffer
gravely in important farm communities if it opens its market to rice imports
before then. Canada's prime minister, Mr Brian Mulroney, has the unhappy
position of being the least popular democratically elected leader in the
world. He has just 15 per cent endorsement from voters in recent polls. With
elections in 1993, concessions on opening up Canada's dairy market may cost
him still more votes.
'It is unquestionably a time of reckoning,' said one EC observer.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: French rural workforce holds the key
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE, by far the largest farm power in the European Community, holds the
key to the reform of the CAP.
The process will not be easy for its diminishing, but vocal, farm
population. As elsewhere in Europe, the economic importance of agriculture
has weakened in France over the past decade, yet the country remains the
EC's largest producer of maize (about half the total), wheat, beef and fine
wine. It grows twice as much cereal as it eats and has more farmland than
Spain.
The political influence of traditionally right-wing farmers' unions has also
declined. Yet the farmers' organisations, led by the Federation Nationale
des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA), still have the capacity to
wreak mayhem.
Only last autumn, 150,000 farmers descended on Paris to protest against CAP
reforms, in response to which the government promptly dished out FFr1.27bn
(Pounds 120m) in emergency support.
However, Mr Louis Mermaz, agriculture minister, and French farming unions
have always seen eye to eye on one point: that incomes must be at least
mainly linked to prices, rather than derive from social handouts. In
reality, social subsidies are gaining fast. Some kinds of farming, notably
beef and sheep, have already become so poor that various EC subsidies
represent more than half of farmers' income.
In that respect, the deal taking shape in Brussels can be presented to
French farmers as a reasonable compromise.
France, formerly one of the staunchest defenders of EC agriculture policy,
signalled its willingness to compromise on reform last October, just a week
after Germany, another former CAP conservative, gave its support for the
European Commission's plans.
This turning point in French agriculture policy reflected a growing
realisation by farming leaders that some kind of social help was needed to
enable an ageing farming population with few successors to retire
peacefully. Every year, 30,000 farms close and only 10,000 new farmers start
business, according to the FNSEA.
The decline of France's rural workforce is sadly evident to any visitor to
near-deserted villages in the rural centre and south. Over the past 20
years, farmers have fallen from just over 13 per cent of France's total
workforce to 6 per cent. This did nothing to help the surplus, since
productivity rose by an average of 1 per cent per year over the same period,
and volumes of some cereal crops even rose. The surplus was shipped partly
to EC neighbours, and also to the third world and the Soviet Union.
As more farmers have gone out of business, more farms have merged, so that
the average size of a holding rose from 19 hectares in 1970 to 28 hectares
by 1988, making France the EC's fourth most intensive farming country. On
the surface, this makes it a prime candidate for the EC proposals that all
but the smallest farmers should take 15 per cent of their land out of
production.
However, the biggest farms are concentrated on the fertile basin plains
north of the river Loire. The deal appears to offer less help for the
smaller farmers, producing wine, fruit and vegetables, in the poorer rural
depths of southern France.

FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Convertible zloty gives Poland's exports
zip - Sharp rise in trade is most tangible sign of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND HAS reacted with alacrity to the restoration of internal zloty
convertibility and the throwing open of foreign trade to private
entrepreneurs. A sharp increase in foreign trade has been one of the most
tangible signs of economic change throughout the first 30 months of the
country's reform programme.
Imports as a percentage of gross domestic product, for example, have risen
from 13.6 per cent in 1989 to 22.8 per cent last year while exports almost
doubled from 9.2 per cent of GDP in the last year of the old regime to 15.3
per cent.
The government is now banking on a further increase in exports this year to
help break the back of a domestic recession which has seen industrial
production in the state sector drop by more than 40 per cent.
The fragile coalition government which emerged after elections last October
signalled its intention to make exports more competitive by dropping the
former policy of maintaining an overvalued zloty as an 'anchor' against
inflation and a means of opening monopolistic domestic producers to the
chill winds of competition.
The shift began with a 17 per cent devaluation last May coupled with the
introduction of a crawling peg system which allowed the currency to devalue
by 1.8 per cent a month in the autumn. This was followed by a 12 per cent
devaluation in February this year. As a result exports rose 5.7 per cent to
Dollars 4.3bn between January and April while imports dropped 15 per cent to
3.7bn in the same period. This has turned a Dollars 269m trade deficit over
the first four months of 1991 into a surplus of Dollars 612m this year, over
four times the Dollars 153m surplus registered over 1991 as a whole.
The speedy response to market signals is largely a reflection of the pace
with which private entrepreneurs moved into an arena which used to be the
preserve of lumbering state-controlled foreign trade companies.
Private traders handled more than half last year's imports and 20 per cent
of exports. At the same time trade shifted radically away from the former
Soviet trading bloc Comecon area. Three years ago over a third of Polish
trade was with the Comecon countries. Last year this had shrunk to a mere 17
per cent while the share of trade with European Community markets has soared
from from 32 to 55 per cent.
In a few cases however the shift to dollar payments for trade formerly
conducted in the now defunct 'transferable' rouble has in fact increased
trade. While neighbouring Czechoslovakia paid roubles for coal it stayed at
the back of the queue despite the fact that the Polish mines were only a few
kilometres away from the consuming Czech power stations and steel plants.
Now the Czechs pay in dollars, however, sales from Poland's Silesian coal
mines have risen from 1.4m tonnes in 1989 to 830,000 tonnes already in the
first four months this year.
Meanwhile Poland's ever-closer trading links with the European Community
have caused a fog of confusion to descend on the details of the country's
trade. To blame is the Single Administrative Document introduced by Polish
customs in January and modelled on documents in use throughout the EC and
the European Free Trade Association. Form-filling errors on a massive scale
have led the statistical office to withhold foreign trade data until all the
returns can be checked.
The statistics are expected to reveal however that imports of consumer goods
from the EC have dropped sharply this year. The lower zloty has increased
the incentive for Polish entrepreneurs to produce such items domestically on
sophisticated imported machines. The weaker zloty has also increased the
competitiveness of exports such as steel products, already up 43 per cent
last year. The risk here is that further Polish export penetration could
trigger safeguard clauses and reverse the free-trade promises held out by
last year's association agreement between the EC and the three central
European countries-Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
The survival of Poland's steel industry is becoming more and more dependent
on exports which accounted for a quarter of the 9.8m tonnes of rolled steel
produced in 1990 rising to 38 per cent of last year's lower output of 8.1m
tonnes.
Textiles and above all agricultural products are the other sensitive area
with the EC but the present association agreement, with its commitment to a
dismantling of barriers to trade in industrial goods by the end of the
century, leaves most of the farming questions to further talks next year.
But, according to Mr Witold Pereta, the head of Animex, a privatised meat
and animal trader, Brussels need not worry as Poland's ailing agriculture
may not even be able to supply the permitted quotas.
'In 1993 Poland will be permitted to sell 7,200 tonnes of mutton into the
EC. But with the drop in our sheep population I think we'll have problems in
finding that amount,' he says.
Production costs at home are also so high that Animex is no longer exporting
its Krakus brand ham to the US but is producing it under licence near
Philadelphia in a company a quarter owned by the Polish group.
Meanwhile, signature of the EC association agreement has made Prague, Warsaw
and Budapest realise that trade barriers among themselves could soon be
higher than with the Community. Accordingly talks are in train to liberalise
trade within the triangle and bring it in line with the EC agreement.
Such developments however are making the Americans uneasy at the prospect of
facing new barriers in central Europe. The US has already protested against
tariffs introduced last year to dampen rising imports and protect foreign
currency reserves. American exporters argue that they are being
discriminated against in favour of the EC.
But Germany, Poland's main supplier and market, is only a few hours truck
ride away for Polish traders and Poland's economic integration with the EC
is expected to deepen by the year. This is in spite of the enormous
political importance attached to attracting investment from and trade with
the US and a long-term belief that Poland will also be well-placed to
benefit from the eventual economic regeneration of the former Soviet Union.

GREECE'S Public Power Corporation (PPC) has awarded a Dr19.6bn (Pounds 56m)
contract to Babcock Energy Systems, the British engineering company, to
upgrade a power station at Lavrion, near Athens, writes Kerin Hope in
Athens.
The PPC intends to help reduce atmospheric pollution in Athens by developing
generating capacity outside the city and converting diesel-fired units to
natural gas during the 1990s. Babcock was the lowest bidder, ahead of
Ansaldo of Italy and Asea Brown Boveri, the PPC said.
The project involves transferring a steam turbine from the Keratsini power
station in Athens to Lavrion, 40 miles from the capital. The turbine will be
linked to two existing gas turbines to form a combined cycle unit, raising
the plant's capacity from 114 to 180 MW. The project is due for completion
in 1994.
The Keratsini unit, formerly Athens' main power station, is closed for much
of the year because of pollutants from its diesel-fired generators. The PPC
plans to convert Keratsini to use Russian natural gas in the mid-1990s.

A GROUP of visiting British executives yesterday called on the Japanese
government to ensure that foreign companies have the same access in the
country as Japanese companies have in the UK market.
The six-company group, headed by the Duke of Kent and Mr Michael Perry, the
chairman of Unilever, and including executives from Glaxo Holdings and SG
Warburg &amp; Co, presented a list of proposals to Japanese industry
representatives and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti).
In an 'Agenda for Action by Japanese Business', the executives expressed
their confidence that British companies will expand Japanese market share
'unless that market is distorted for political reasons or because of
excessive bias towards Japanese domestic suppliers'.
However, Mr Perry said the delegation, in Tokyo as part of the Priority
Japan campaign, does not regard Japan as a 'problem' but as an 'opportunity'
and that British industry does not 'want to argue about the rules of the
game'.
UK exports to Japan had grown from Pounds 1.49bn to Pounds 2.63bn from 1987
to 1990, but the slowing of the Japanese economy and a resultant fall in
demand for luxury goods and industrial machinery led to a decline to Pounds
2.26bn last year.
For 1991, Japan's exports to the UK were Pounds 6.75bn, down from Pounds
6.76bn.
The text of the Agenda for Action reflected UK concerns that Japanese
equipment purchases, including aero-engines, satellites and semiconductor
technology, could be influenced by the political pressure applied by
Washington.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NATO countries have agreed in principle that the alliance would be prepared
to take on a peacekeeping role in Europe beyond the borders of its member
nations, Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said yesterday.
Mr Woerner, said details had still to be worked out but Nato foreign
ministers are expected to give their blessing to the plan at a meeting in
Oslo in two weeks.
Until now, Nato's military structure and forces have been limited to the
defence of member nations, although there is no suggestion the alliance
should get involved in Gulf War-style military intervention.
The decision could mean alliance troops might one day be deployed in
peacekeeping missions, which until now has been the sole preserve of the UN,
in places such as Bosnia or Nagorno-Karabakh.
'This is strictly for peacekeeping, not for warfighting,' said one alliance
diplomat.
According to the idea, backed by the US, Nato could put its military
infrastructure, supplies or even troops at the disposal of the 52-nation
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) for peacekeeping
missions.
The fighting in Yugoslavia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the threat of new conflicts
breaking out in an increasingly fragmented post-Cold War Europe have given
impetus to the idea, which would mark a big policy change for the 16-nation
alliance.
France and some others had hesitated over the proposal to extend Nato
responsibilities. France, which feels that the US has too large a say in how
European security is run, would prefer to develop other institutions like
the nine-nation Western European Union.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Czechoslovakia makes bold leap to people's capitalism: In a
couple of months two out of three citizens will be shareholders in ex-state
enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE basement of the federal statistics office in Prague, at the end of a
dark corridor littered with empty cardboard boxes, a computer is busy
calculating the wishes of 8.5m people.
Throughout the summer, the large Digital computer will be allocating the
shares of more than 3,000 state-owned enterprises to Czechs and Slovaks who
earlier this year subscribed to the mass privatisation scheme launched by
the Czechoslovak government.
In the space of a couple of months, the unique scheme will turn two out of
three citizens into shareholders and make more than half the country's
state-owned enterprises private.
The rule of the game is speed: the aim is to privatise fast, using book
value to set the price of an enterprise's equity and to create a mass of
shareholders who, ideally, will then exercise control over the enterprises.
If it works, policy-makers say, the model privatisation handbook for former
communist countries will be able to be written, based on the Czechoslovak
experience. But a number of problems could arise as the scheme unfolds.
Since last autumn, government officials in Czechoslovakia have been turning
grey trying to unravel a myriad of privatisation projects. In the Czech
republic alone, 10,000 projects for 2,500 enterprises have been prepared at
government request by managers, deputy directors, employees or outside
investors.
The average enterprise is expected to offer about 60 per cent of its equity
to the voucher programme. But enterprises may offer up to 97 per cent with a
minimum of 3 per cent of their equity set aside for the restitution fund.
This fund compensates former owners who were illegally expropriated by the
communist regime.
There are also various forms of partial privatisation, including direct
sales to a local or foreign investors, public auctions or sale to other
parties such as employees, management or municipalities.
A total of 292.6bn korunas (Dollars 9.7bn) in equity will be distributed in
the form of vouchers. Of this amount, 185.3bn korunas belongs to enterprises
in the Czech republic and 93.5bn to Slovak enterprises with the remaining
13.8bn representing equity in properties owned by the federal authorities.
This equity will be distributed to 8.5m citizens who subscribed to the
scheme by buying a book of vouchers for 1,000 korunas, the equivalent of a
week's salary for the average employee. In nominal terms, every voucher book
should be worth 30,000 korunas in equity, calculated on a book value basis.
Actual values however could differ significantly once market prices are
established.
Last Monday, voucher holders begun choosing the shares they want to receive.
A first allocation of shares is planned early next month in instances where
the demand for shares matches the offer of vouchers. Enterprises for which
the demand surpasses the supply of vouchers by more than 25 per cent,
however, will be re-offered for higher bids. A total of five bidding rounds
is planned and the whole process could take until the autumn.
Confused by the choice of enterprises and often lacking basic information,
two-thirds of investors have entrusted their vouchers to private investment
funds who which will select enterprises for them.
More than 400 funds have been created in recent months to benefit from the
privatisation programme but the bulk of vouchers are concentrated in the 10
biggest. The most popular funds belong to the Czech or Slovak banks, but
other funds set up by private entrepreneurs have successfully wooed a large
number of voucher holders by offering a guaranteed ten-fold cash return in a
year's time.
Such promises have raised eyebrows in government circles, however, and could
provoke a liquidity crisis if the newly-privatised shares have to be sold to
raise the cash to honour such promises and meet operational costs.
In an economy where quality assets are rare, the pressure to sell could
endanger the nascent stock market. It could also allow foreign investors to
buy equity cheaply - a possibility that could meet political resistance at a
later stage.
A functioning, liquid secondary market will be needed to allow shareholders
to concentrate their stakes and build up controlling stakes in enterprises.
This stage will be crucial to facilitate the much-needed restructuring of
Czechoslovak enterprises.
The speed of the privatisation process has met domestic resistance, with
critics claiming that the government should have allowed more time for
restructuring.
But Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister who is the political
godfather of the Czechoslovak privatisation programme, recently summed up
the argument for speed. Any strategy, he said, was better than leaving
enterprises in the current paralysing grip of 'pre-privatisation agonies'
where they were accumulating debts with other enterprises and selling vital
assets just to pay wage bills as the enterprises crumble around them.

THE Russian parliament yesterday adopted a potentially explosive resolution
declaring illegal the transfer of the Crimea peninsula to Ukraine in 1954.
Deputies approved by a slim majority a resolution saying the 'gift' proposed
by the then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and rubberstamped by an obedient
Communist parliament was unconstitutional and had no legal force.
The vote, coming hours after the Crimean parliament rescinded an
independence declaration under pressure from Kiev, is likely to aggravate
the already difficult relations between Ukraine and Russia.
It could also expose Russia to a host of territorial claims from other
republics and national minorities. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Georgia
are already unstable because of disputes over borders drawn under the Soviet
era.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UN in disarray as Serbs halt Croatia pullout: Fears grow
that war could break out anew in Croatia

<TEXT>
THE future of the United Nations peace plan for Croatia was yesterday thrown
into disarray after the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army announced it was
halting its withdrawal from the east of the republic.
The army statement coincided with renewed calls to the international
community by Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, to send troops
into the besieged city of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The military statement said the army had decided to halt its planned
withdrawal and would 'undertake measures to defend its territory,
population, and its forces in eastern Slavonija, Baranja, and Western Srem,
Serb-occupied territories in Croatia'.
The army's withdrawal is a key element of the UN plan agreed last December
between Croatia, the UN and the Yugoslav federal army.
Western diplomats said the army's statement could mean the start of another
war in Croatia.
But a UN official, anxious to salvage its peace mission in Croatia last
night said the delay in the army's withdrawal was only suspended. She said
the evacuation of the protected areas was supposed to be on a mutual basis,
adding that three Croatian tanks had failed to pull back from the eastern
sector.
General Satish Nambiar, the UN commander, was holding negotiations with army
commanders.
However, western diplomats expressed serious doubts over the success of the
UN operation. 'Time is running out,' a senior defence attache said. 'We are
faced with delays in Croatia. It is becoming tense there again. We have
talked about sending in aircraft to relieve Sarajevo, we have talked about
imposing a wide range of sanctions. But we must have the political will to
stop Serbia and to prevent the war from spreading to Kosovo and other parts
of the Balkans,' he said.
Yesterday, armed Serb militiamen finally allowed 6,000 Moslem women and
children to travel to the western Croatian city of Split.
They had been held hostage on the outskirts of Sarajevo by Serb gunmen
demanding that food be allowed into the federal army barracks in Sarajevo.
But the federal army and Serb irregulars continue to deny the people of
Sarajevo any food, medicine and water.
'The army is starving the city into submission. Why is it that western
aircraft can protect the air space for the Kurds, but it is unwilling to
protect the air space and free the airport in Sarajevo in order to feed our
people,' Mr Silajdzic said. Serb forces already control two-third of Bosnia.
In Austria, Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister, said the only chance to
secure peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina was to create a restricted security zone
around Sarajevo.
In Brussels, Mr Willem van Eekelen, secretary-general of the nine-member
Western European Union (WEU) criticised European Community states for their
reluctance to use force to stop the fighting in Yugoslavia.
Mr van Eekelen said 'We recognised these republics (Croatia and
Bosnia-Hercegopared to defend those countries.'
'I think we have to do more to remain credible and faithful to our own
principles,' he said.
In Lisbon, attempts to reconvene the EC-sponsored peace talks stalled after
Moslem representatives from Bosnia were unable to travel outside the
republic.
Mr Silajdzic said the peace talks were being undermined by Serbia. 'None of
the agreement set down at the previous talks have been fulfilled. The roads
(in Bosnia) have not been unblocked, and the airport has not been freed. Our
country is being overtaken by fascists,' he said.
In Bosnia, Borba, the Belgrade daily reported that General Ratko Mladic,
commander of the Serb army of Bosnia, demanded martial law for all
Serbian-controlled territory, including suspension of all civilian
institutions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday moved swiftly to signal its support for the republic of
Armenia following Turkish threats of military intervention in its conflict
with Azerbaijan.
Yesterday Mr Gennady Burbulis, Russian president Boris Yeltsin's top aide,
General Pavel Grachev, the new defence minister, and Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, flew to Yerevan, Armenia's capital, for talks with the republic's
leaders on the status of its seventh army based in Armenia.
The conclusion of a treaty permitting the stationing of Russian troops in
another state would be the first such agreement since Russia decided to form
its own army last month. It would also send a clear signal to Turkey and
Azerbaijan that Armenia is in Russia's sphere of interest.
The talks come just two days after Mr Turgut Ozal, the Turkish president,
threatened to send introops after reports-denied by Armenia - of the entry
of Armenian soldiers into the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan, situated
between the borders of Armenia, Turkey and Iran.
Marshal Shaposhnikov warned two days ago that such intervention could
'create a third world war'. However, yesterday, Mr Burbulis said he 'ruled
out' a Turkish intervention. There are also fears the broader conflict
between Armenia (supported by Russia) and Azerbaijan (supported by Turkey)
over the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh could escalate into
a regional conflict.
Mr Yeltsin and Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, are due to
hold talks in Ankara on Monday.
Reuter adds from Baku: Commonwealth border troops near the Turkish frontier
have been put on alert after a night of fighting between Azeri and Armenian
forces around Nakhichevan. The Turkish foreign ministry said Armenian units
were firing on Nakhichevan from their side of the border.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Teasing out Milan's Swiss connection: Haig Simonian on an
off-shore banking probe in Italy's expanding financial scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fast train for Lugano leaves Milan's vaulted central station at 25
minutes past the hour precisely. The 50-mile journey takes almost an
hour-and-a-half, lengthened by passport controls and a change of engines at
the Swiss border.
It is quicker by car, and probably a lot more comfortable in the sort of
chauffeur-driven Lancia or Alfa Romeo saloon issued as standard to senior
Italian corporate or party functionaries.
Either way, it is a journey which may have become familiar to many of the
politicians and businessmen who have either been arrested, or are under
investigation, by magistrates in Milan in what is fast becoming the
country's biggest political corruption scandal since the war.
Three months of investigations since the arrest in February of Mr Mario
Chiesa, the Socialist administrator who spilled the beans on a still
widening web of urban skulduggery, has brought the Swiss link increasingly
into the open.
The network of bribes paid by local companies in return for lucrative
public-sector building and maintenance contracts and funnelled to the city's
main political parties by apparatchiks and city councillors originated in
Milan. But the trail has already led to Lugano, the capital of the Swiss
canton of Ticino, which has for decades played the role of off-shore banking
centre for trates believe they have stumbled upon a network of bribes and
corruption which has seen at least L150bn (Pounds 68m) changing hands over
recent years.
While much of the money has gone into party coffers in a largely
institutionalised form of percentage takes on big contracts, part has been
destined for personal enrichment.
magistrates sent their colleagues across the border a list of names of
individuals suspected of involvement in the affair. The Swiss were asked to
ascertain under new laws whether those included held bank accounts in the
canton; the laws have opened up a chink in Switzerland's famed banking
secrecy for funds that are believed to have been 'recycled'.
Speaking on Italian radio earlier this week, Ms Carla Del Ponte, the Lugano
magistrate working with the Italian authorities, confirmed that information
had already been provided regarding Mr Chiesa.
However, the Italian requests for information have now run aground. At a
closed-doors meeting earlier this week, a committee of the Ticino bankers'
association advised members to take legal action to block further requests
for information.
The path to Lugano has become familiar to thousands of rich Milanese over
the years, who have traditionally used the town to hide money which they did
not want the local tax man to see.
Non-lira bank accounts are no longer illegal for Italians, and the country's
fiscal authorities have, so far, taken a back seat to the magistrates in the
Milan investigation. But the scandal has clearly put the Swiss on the spot
and could test the scope of the more open rules on access to bank accounts.
Many banks in Lugano, which draw a large number of clients from northern
Italy, fear a substantial loss of business should they appear overly
co-operative towards the latest requests for information. A lot of money
could be at stake. Few believe the Milan affair is an isolated incident.
Kickbacks on big public-sector contracts are widely believed to be endemic
in Italy's biggest cities, with the money flowing to political parties in
the north and to organised crime in the south.
But Milan has proved particularly easy to milk in recent years. Italy's
second biggest city and financial capital has enjoyed a boom in
infrastructural projects, which have made it a model of sorts in Italy.
Among the costliest schemes has been the third underground line, completed
last year at a price of around L2,500bn. The ambitious project to build a
rail-link deep under the city, which is still a long way from being
realised, is now expected to cost around L4,000bn. Further projects include
the expansion of the second airport at Malpensa, now forecast to cost
L450bn. Meanwhile, the breathtaking renovation of the San Siro football
stadium in time for the 1990 World Cup cost L180bn.
The list excludes the hundreds of smaller contracts awarded for hospital
modernisation or more limited new construction projects in recent years.
Many were entrusted to local building companies, some of whose bosses have
now been implicated in the scandal. And even less conspicuous are the
thousands of renewable service contracts for public buildings. These alone
probably formed as rich a vein of funds as the big public works projects now
under investigation.

<TEXT>
THE major powers may have to use force to halt the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction in Third World countries, the International Institute of
Strategic Studies warns today.
Regional efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
ballistic missiles and advanced conventional forces 'increasingly threaten
not just regional stability, but even the global stability brought about by
the end of superpower rivalry,' the London-based institute said in its
annual Strategic Survey.
If those on the verge of acquiring weapons of mass destruction could not be
persuaded voluntarily to reverse their policies, the major powers might be
forced to make them change their minds.
However the IISS dismissed as 'laughable' any idea US forces could act as a
'globo-cop'.
The Institute suggested that 1995, when 146 signatories of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty meet, might be the time for the nuclear power
states to substantially cut their armaments.

The Bank of Spain yesterday cast strong doubts about the government's

with plans to meet the target of Economic and Monetary Union (Emu), Tom
Burns writes from Madrid.
A Bank report said the fiscal deficit was growing faster than the government
had hitherto acknowledged and that it would be difficult to achieve any
significant reduction this year. The government has committed itself to
reducing the deficit, which stood at 4.4 per cent of GDP at the end of 1991,
by at least O5 per cent a year.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Brittan clears Hongkong bid for Midland Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK'S hopes of buying rival Midland received a setback yesterday
when the European Community competition commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said
there was no need for an extended investigation into a competing bid for
Midland from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading is believed to have recommended to Mr
Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, that Lloyds' proposed
offer should be subject to a lengthy investigation by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. It made its recommendation late on Wednesday evening.
Only rarely is the OFT's recommendation rejected by the Department of Trade
and Industry, Mr Heseltine's department. He is likely to announce his
decision by early next week, probably on Tuesday.
Lloyds and its advisers admit in private that they expect their planned bid
to be referred. The bank is expected to tell Midland's shareholders that it
is confident of being cleared by the MMC and would therefore ask them not to
accept Hongkong Bank's bid, pending the outcome of the inquiry.
As a testament of its confidence in the outcome of an MMC inquiry, it may
buy Midland shares in the stock market. It believes it could buy up to 10
per cent, held by 'arbs' or speculators, relatively easily. However, it
would have to ask Mr Heseltine's permission to buy the shares if the bid is
referred, although it is confident of receiving this.
Sir Leon Brittan said yesterday: 'We found that Midland Bank and Hongkong
Bank compete in very few sectors, and that if the merger (of those two
banks) went through, fierce competition would remain in these sectors.'
The clearance means the government cannot open its own investigation into
the bid unless it invokes an as yet unused clause in the EC anti-trust
rules. This allows member states to examine bids for prudential reasons even
if they have been cleared by the Commission.
However, the Bank of England has already indicated it is happy with the
Hongkong Bank deal, and Mr Heseltine would have difficulty finding another
plausible reason to reopen an investigation. EC officials said they did not
expect him to try.
The Commission finished its examination six days short of the official
deadline, having discovered that the only significant overlap between
Hongkong and Midland was in the gilts market. But 'even in this sector . . .
competition is intense and would remain so after the merger,' the Commission
said.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Russian deputies to lay claim to Crimea

THE Russian parliament is expected today to revoke the 1954 gift of Crimea
to Ukraine.
Mr Vladimir Podoprigora, deputy chairman of the parliament's committee for
relations with former Soviet republics, said most parliamentary factions
were prepared to vote 'yes' on the proposal.
The much-postponed resolution decrees that Khrushchev's decision to transfer
Crimea from Russia to Ukraine was unconstitutional.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, condemned the proposal and said
it would further undermine relations with Russia.
'Ukraine has not passed a single political resolution which interferes in
the domestic affairs of Russia,' he said.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, sought to
reassure Ukraine that Russia's review of the 1954 transfer was a matter of
historic justice not a territorial claim, but Mr Kravchuk dismissed this
justification. 'This is a question of justice from the Russian point of view
but if we are to follow this logic then all unjust acts must be reversed
beginning with 1917 or even earlier.'
Mr Kravchuk accused the Russian parliament of violating international law
and ignoring political reality.
Mr Podoprigora denied the vote would mean Russia reclaiming Crimea, since
both countries remained bound by an agreement not to seek border changes as
long as they remained part of the Commonwealth.
But whatever the rhetoric of some deputies and Russian nationalists, the
Russian leadership has good reason to preserve the status quo. By reclaiming
Crimea, Russia would create a precedent for territorial claims by others on
its land.
In Simferopol, the Crimean parliament backed away from confrontation with
Ukraine yesterday by repealing an act of independence passed last month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN a fortnight before Denmark holds a binding referendum to approve
or reject the Maastricht treaty on European union, the most recent opinion
poll has indicated that 41 per cent of voters are against the treaty.
According to a Gallup Poll published yesterday, only 39 per cent of Danes
are firmly in favour of the treaty while the remainder are not likely to
vote or are still undecided.
The Gallup Institute points out that the gap between those against the
treaty and those in favour is so narrow that statistically the difference is
not significant.
This is the third Gallup Poll this month and all three have shown a small
majority in favour of rejecting the treaty.
Denmark will be the first of the EC countries to approve or reject
Maastricht, and only one other country, Ireland, will be holding a
referendum.

THOUSANDS of employees of France's state-owned gas and electricity companies
took to the streets of Brussels yesterday to protest against a European
Commission plan to liberalise the EC energy market.
The proposals - which would allow large consumers to buy gas and electricity
from suppliers anywhere in the Community - will be discussed by energy
ministers today when further demonstrations are planned by the French
unions.
The plans are opposed by states such as France, Germany and the Netherlands,
which are protective of national energy monopolies. Britain, which has
liberalised its energy supply, backs the Commission.
The directives on the table envisage opening networks to large users from
January 1, 1993, with further liberalisation possible from 1996.
Electricite de France and Gaz de France have been among the most vociferous
opponents. Representatives of the unions yesterday met advisers to Mr
Jacques Delors, the Commission president.
Mr Claude Cambus, an EdF manager and director of the French confederation of
senior employees said employees were worried about the effect on long-term
investment and security of supply. 'From 1996, if all clients can go to the
supplier of their choice you will no longer be able to say exactly who is
responsible for continuity of supply.'
Today's meeting of ministers will not reach a decision on the directives.
Informal discussions in Portugal last month showed that most ministers had
reservations about the core of the proposals.
Several European electricity generators are lobbying the Commission and
their national governments to adopt an 'alternative approach to the carbon
tax', writes Neil Buckley in London. They say limiting CO emissions could be
met more effectively than the proposed tax.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Milan scandal tests Swiss bank secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS in Lugano have been advised to take legal action to avoid providing
information on accounts held by Italian citizens under investigation by
magistrates in the corruption scandal in Milan.
The decision could embarrass the Swiss authorities, who in recent years have
opened a chink in the country's banking secrecy laws in cases involving
drugs or terrorism.
The move followed a special session of a committee of the Bankers'
Association in the Swiss canton of Ticino, which met on Tuesday to consider
a request from local magistrates for details on various Italian account
holders.
Magistrates in Lugano, which has traditionally served as an off-shore
banking centre for rich northern Italy, have been co-operating with their
Italian counterparts in investigations concerning construction projects in
the city.
The Milanese magistrates have been able to follow a trail of financial
transactions, estimated at up to L150bn (Dollars 120m), part of which is
believed to have gone through accounts in the Swiss city. However, the
requests for information have put both Swiss magistrates and bankers to the
test. They could create a test case on Swiss banking secrecy.
Local bankers have questioned whether the criterion of 'recycled funds',
drawn up in relation to money stemming from drugs and terrorism, is
applicable in the Milan case, which involves a largely institutionalised
form of corruption involving leading figures from the city's main political
parties.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Technology: Tools at fault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNA KOCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounds like a familiar story. Europeans are ahead of the Japanese and the
US in a new machine tool technology - but the Japanese could once again take
the lead.
The issue is fault-tolerant control technology, a package of hardware and
software that would enable a machine tool to function at higher performance,
with greater precision, fewer breakdowns and reduced idleness.
Most of the faults that stop a machine tool can be detected easily. But
according to Piet Ephraim, of the Eastleigh-based company Stewart Hughes, it
takes only five sensors to provide the 30-40 items of data required to
monitor continuously the condition of a machine and forecast, or even
prevent, most faults.
Stewart Hughes and Macclesfield-based Amtri are behind developments that
have brought the fault-tolerant technology project - originally part of an
EC Esprit programme - to fruition. Amtri designed the most complex of the
sensors that need to be fitted to the machines. Stewart Hughes developed the
control system which processes the data coming from the different sensor
systems and feeds back the results to the machine tool's own control unit.
At one test site operated by Pegaso, the Spanish trucks company, the savings
are expected to include a 60 per cent reduction in scrap parts and 40 per
cent fewer stoppages in production.
In the automotive industry, the average machine tool spends about 30 per
cent of its possible running time not cutting metal, says Pierre Boisson,
director of machine tool engineering at PSA, the French automotive group.
The cost of incorporating the technology in a machine tool would add 5-10
per cent to its current sales price, according to Nicolo Vincenyo, director
of innovation at Mandelli, the Italian machine tool builder.
The question remains, though, whether European customers will accept the
economic arguments for the technology, preventing yet another European
machine tool advance from being thrown away.

FT  21 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Stocks boosted by KIO stake talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY FEELING that the sunshine might draw dealers away from their trading
screens was dispelled yesterday, as London stocks received a boost from what
many in the market discounted as no more than rumour, and remained
surprisingly firm all day.
The FT-SE 100 Index was marked up at the opening and rose sharply in the
morning to show a gain of 24.4 points, before slipping to a close of
2,711.9, up a net 11.3, but with no sign that it will stumble in the next
few days.
It was helped by a strong close on Wall Street overnight and a clutch of
well-received company results. However, its first kick-start of the day came
from rumours that the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) was about to sell its
9.8 per cent stake in BP to Lord Hanson.
The idea that Hanson might bid for BP has been talked up and knocked down
for some time, but the possibility that the KIO might sell its stake,
amounting to more than 500m shares, gave a new twist to an old story. BP
rose 10p initially but analysts pointed out that the shares had
underperformed the market significantly since the general election.
Some pinpointed the derivatives markets as the source of the talk and,
certainly, the Footsie future for June delivery traded at a significant
premium to its estimated fair value throughout the day.
As the BP impetus faded, the market began to look at the UK retail sales for
April, which were higher than the weak March figure but slightly off the 1.1
per cent rise expected.
Traders also looked towards the opening on Wall Street. Although the Dow had
reached a record peak at the previous close, some felt it could move higher
on hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut the discount rate. Others argued
that a huge issue of new General Motors shares would hold back the Dow.
The Footsie ticked back from its mid-morning high of 2,725, affected partly
by an overhang of stock in Argyll, a profits warning from Ranks Hovis
McDougall, and fears that Sun Alliance would offload its stake in Commercial
Union.
When it opened, New York gave no clear direction but the Footsie was strong
enough to hold on to a gain of around 10 points. Buying by overseas
institutions was still evident even though London had to compete with strong
demand in most of the other European markets. Traders added that the buyers
were matched by a wall of reluctant sellers.
Individual stocks providing support included Bass, with good results, and
well-received figures from Land Securities. Elsewhere, the pound was steady
and gilts were firm.
Turnover of shares, which many had expected to drift, was a solid 598.7m,
compared with Tuesday's 565.4m. The volume was helped by two medium-sized
programme trades, but it still indicated that the value of genuine customer
retail business would be higher than Tuesday's Pounds 992m.
Hopes that the Federal Reserve would reduce the discount rate remained
unfulfilled and the Footsie June future slipped back slightly in
after-hours' trading. However, dealers were convinced that the London market
had not reached a ceiling.

ACTIVITY in the derivatives market returned to comfortably high levels
yesterday, prompted by bid talk and buying by independent traders, writes
Peter John.
The Footsie contract for June delivery was consistently at a premium to its
estimated fair value, which currently stands around 8 points above the
underlying cash index.
The June contract opened higher on the back of a strong Wall Street and
Tuesday's well-received company figures, and remained firm until the
announcement of slightly disappointing retail sales figures.
At the official close it stood at 2,734, a premium of 22.2 to cash and 14
above fair value. There were almost 9,500 contracts traded. In after-hours'
dealing it moved back to 2,726 and turnover swelled to 10,800 lots. Volume
was boosted by a 2,000-lot spread trade in the June and September contracts.
Due to a change in the expiry rules, the near-month contract will end on
June 19 as opposed to the end of the month, and rolling out into September
will subsequently begin earlier than usual.
Turnover in traded options was also high at 39,523 lots, compared with
Tuesday's 27,710. British Airways was the most popular stock option, with
4,214 contracts traded as investors continued to respond to Tuesday's
impressive figures. BP was also in demand.

FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases in absence of Fed
move on rates

Wall Street
US SHARES turned slightly lower following signs from the Federal Reserve
that monetary policy would remain on hold, at least for another day, writes
Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 3,400 level at 11.30am, by
adding a mere 2.93 points, but it failed to hang on to its slim gain and
ended 4.15 down on balance at 3,393.84.
New York SE turnover, which has been thin in recent weeks, was moderate with
198.7m shares changing hands. Declining issues narrowly exceeded advances by
861 to 820. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.98 to 415.39, but the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks added 2.24 at 580.29.
On Tuesday, the Dow climbed 21.96 to a record close of 3,397.99, assisted by
widespread speculation that a surprisingly sharp drop in April's US housing
starts would prompt the Fed to ease monetary policy.
Share prices turned lower shortly after the Fed failed to intervene in the
open market, which was taken as a sign that it did not intend to reduce
interest rates. The Fed often signals a change in monetary policy through
its open market operations.
A large offering by General Motors on Tuesday also put pressure on prices.
The company's global public offering of 55m shares were priced at Dollars 39
apiece through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley. The company, which has
said it would use the proceeds to improve liquidity and its balance sheet,
had increased the size of the offering from 50m. GM eased Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 39.
Of the other big US auto makers, Chrysler softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars
18 1/2 and Ford lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 44 1/4 .
Humana tumbled Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 in active trading after the
company warned that a decline in hospital admissions and heavy discounting
might cut into its third-quarter profits. It has projected earnings of less
than 50 cents a share in the quarter, compared with 64 cents a year earlier.
In the department store sector, Dayton Hudson advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 64 5/8 , adding to its Dollars 3 5/8 gain on Tuesday which followed
news of first-quarter net income of 40 cents a share, against 39 cents a
year earlier. Dean Witter Reynolds has added the issue to its recommended
list and increased its rating on the stock to 'buy'.
A number of blue chip stocks were prominent among the most active issues on
the NYSE, including Walt Disney, down Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 ,
McDonalds, up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 , and Coca-Cola, off Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 44 3/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Intel led trading, rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47
7/8 . QVC Network jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 20 5/8
on news of first-quarter net earnings from operations of 29 cents a share,
compared with 5 cents a share on fewer shares outstanding a year earlier.
An initial public offering of 2.2m shares in Holson Burnes was priced at
Dollars 14, and the stock traded at Dollars 14 3/8, up Dollars 3/8.
Canada
TORONTO shadowed Wall Street to end slightly down as many investors remained
on the sidelines awaiting further news on possible cuts in US and Canadian
interest rates.
The market is still hoping for a reduction in the US discount rate and a
lowering of Canadian prime rates. Some traders said an expected 13
basis-point fall in today's Bank of Canada key lending rate could lead to a
round of  1/4 percentage point prime lending rate cuts by leading Canadian
banks.
The composite index finished 4.1 lower at 3,381.2 and declines outscored
rises by 314 to 246, with 251 issues unchanged. Volume came to 26.7m shares.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed decides not to ease rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR regained some ground against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges
yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided once again not to ease interest
rates, writes James Blitz.
The Fed's decision not to signal a cut in the Fed Funds rate on the second
day of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting took many dealers by
surprise, leading to good dollar buying in late trading in Europe.
The US unit rose  1/4 pfennig on the day to DM1.6020 in London. It also
rallied against the Japanese yen, closing in London at Y129.65 after a
previous finish of Y129.10. In New York the dollar eased back to end at
DM1.6005 and Y129.55.
The vast differential between American and European short-term rates is
certain to cause worries in the market again. But some analysts said the
dollar's rise yesterday was an indication that it will have a floor in
D-Mark trad-ing at DM1.58 for some time.
There were several signs that the market was taking a more bullish view of
the US currency. One was a reduction in the rates of dollar volatility
quoted in options trading against the D-Mark. This sank below 10 per cent in
early New York trading for the first time in a week. Some dealers expect
further slippage ahead of the US Memorial Day extended weekend.
One-month dollar/D-Mark volatility was offered at 10 per cent and bid at
9.8, compared to Tuesday's 10.4/10.6 per cent. Dollar/yen volatility dropped
even more drastically to 8.2/8.3 per cent for one-month options from
Tuesday's 9.0 per cent.
Another indication was that markets reacted calmly to poor figures for the
US trade deficit, which showed a rise to Dollars 5.82bn in March from a
revised Dollars 3.29bn for the month before. Analysts suggested that higher
imports spelled rising demand and economic recovery.
Economists also suggested that US rates might not be reduced after all. An
analyst at Swiss Bank Corp in London said: 'The decision to cut rates is a
closer-run thing for the Fed than the market realises.' He claimed that the
authorities in the US are particularly concerned that a cut might prove to
be counter-productive, as this would lead to higher inflation and an adverse
reaction from the bond market.
Long-term US rates are much higher than short-term ones. Even higher yields
for long-term borrowing will damage recovery hopes since the majority of
mortgage rates are linked to them.
On the European crosses, there was little movement. The D-Mark mostly
consolidated its gains this week against other European currencies, although
the pound rose 75 basis points to DM2.9325. The German currency also
declined against the yen, ending at DM1.2350 per 100 yen from DM1.2325.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Cash trading quiet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE-MONTH money ended slightly softer in the sterling cash markets
yesterday, as traders anticipated smaller shortages in forthcoming weeks.
But the market was quiet, and closing figures in the cash and futures
markets ended mostly unchanged.
Yet more hints that a cut in base rates is unlikely over the summer led to a
quiet market. In a speech to the annual dinner of the CBI on Tuesday night,
the chancellor of the exchequer said that Britain should aim to match
Japan's inflation performance if it wants to be 'a first-rank commercial
power'.
That was compounded by the Bank of England's statement in its quarterly
bulletin that the Maastricht criteria relating to inflation and interest
rates will be met by 'a continuation of the present counter-inflationary
stance of policy'.
As a result, period rates were mostly unchanged. One-month money ended the
day at 10 per cent, down  1/16 on the previous day's close. But three-month
money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving,
remained unchanged at 10 per cent.
On the sterling futures market, there was also little change. The June short
sterling contract closed at 89.98, up one tick on the day after very low
volume. That closing price suggests that three-month LIBOR in a month's time
will be at 10.02 per cent.
In its money market operations, the Bank of England found that players were
again unwilling to offer paper. With a bank holiday weekend approaching, the
market is probably waiting until tomorrow to take up the shortage in the
hope of pushing the overnight rate down over a three-day weekend.
The Bank purchased Pounds 30m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and
Pounds 11m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the
Bank purchased Pounds 100m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent,
Pounds 267m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 35m of Band-2
bills at 9 7/8 per cent. It offered late assistance of Pounds 610m.
In Germany, the Bundesbank drained DM4.2bn from the banking system with
yesterday's repurchase agreements. It allocated DM29.7bn of 27-day funds,
mostly at 9.65 per cent, and DM9.6bn of 56-day money, mostly at 9.65 per
cent.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudi oil minister fails to
turn up at Opec summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HISHAM NAZER, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, yesterday failed to turn up
at the ministerial summit of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Vienna. Other delegations were surprised and disconcerted, but
the Saudis said it signalled no change in the kingdom's oil policy.
A Saudi delegate said Mr Nazer was simply 'a little bit exhausted' after an
intensive series of overseas meetings.
Some oil analysts suggested that Mr Nazer's absence, his first from an Opec
meeting since he replaced Sheikh Yamani as the kingdom's oil minister in
1987, could be interpreted as a 'slight' towards delegations favouring a
higher-price Opec policy.
However, diplomats in Riyadh who met Mr Nazer yesterday said they believed
he was genuinely overtired. The diplomats said that there was no indication
that Mr Nazer's post as oil minister was threatened, or that his absence
indicated a shift in oil policy by Riyadh.
Mr Nazer's place at the summit was taken by Mr Fayez Badr, a minister of
state with responsibility for the Saudi Ports Authority and a man with no
obvious oil expertise.
Saudi Arabia has widely flagged before the Opec summit, which begins in
earnest today, that it would be seeking a 1m barrels a day rise in the
cartel's production ceiling for the third quarter from the 22.98m b/d agreed
for the second quarter in February.
Iran, among several other delegations, opposes such a move and would prefer
to see Opec restrain output to force prices towards the cartel's formal
reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel. Mr Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil
minister, told reporters curtly yesterday: 'I want a cut in the ceiling.'
Saudi Arabia estimates the call on Opec crude to reach 24.2m b/d for the
third quarter, but actual production for the second has neared 23.5m b/d
rather than the nominal February figure, largely because of Kuwait's
accelerated output and a Saudi refusal to cut production below 8m b/d - as
it was notionally allocated.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa deficit estimate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEFICIT in the world cocoa supply and demand balance for 1991-92 has
been cut to 107,000 tonnes by Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house owned by
ED &amp; F. Man. This compares with a January estimate of 177,000 tonnes and a
surplus of 178,000 tonnes in 1990-91.
The main reasons for the adjustment have been a bigger than expected crop
from the Ivory Coast and a virtual absence of buying from the former Soviet
Union, says Gill's latest cocoa market report.
The Ivory Coast crop, estimated in January at 710,000 tonnes, is now put at
750,000 tonnes. Buying from the former Soviet Union is now thought to have
sunk to 25,000 tonnes, compared with a January estimate of 65,000 tonnes.
Gill believes that the downside risk on the cocoa markets is limited but the
upside risk is greater, particularly if next year sees another deficit.

PRESIDENT Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan is expected to sign an
agreement with Rothschild North America today, aimed at developing
Kazakhstan's mining and metal processing, Reuter reports from New York.
The deal with Rothschild, a subsidiary of the British merchant bank NM
Rothschild, is meant to stimulate investment by western companies and has a
potential value of several hundred million dollars, according to Mr Vladimir
Scherbakov, an adviser to President Nazarbayev. The deal comes three days
after Kazahkstan signed a 40-year, Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.2bn) deal with
Chevron to exploit the country's large Tengiz oil field.
Mr Scherbakov said Kazakhstan would sign at least two other deals before the
president's delegation leaves the US on Saturday.
One is an industrial development deal with Creditanstalt bank of Austria and
the other is a link between the New York Stock Exchange and Kazakhstan's
stock exchange.

Two management contracts, together valued at around Pounds 10m, have been
awarded by Forte to the P&amp;O company BOVIS CONSTRUCTION to build and fit out
two Welcome Break motorway service areas, both of them in Scotland.
The larger will be built on the M74 at Gretna Green and the other, at
Abington, Lanarkshire, is at the junction of the A73 and M74.
Work has already started at Abington and completion is due in December. The
Gretna Green project begins this month with completion in spring 1993.
At Abington, the client is Forte Welcome Break, part of Forte, while at
Gretna Green it is Forte Welcome Break in association with BP.
The Gretna Green project involves the redevelopment of the Welcome Break
services area on the northbound carriageway of the M74, together with the
extension of a Travelodge. A new and larger amenity building of 25,000 sq ft
will provide two restaurants, together with shops, a tourist information
centre and staff quarters.
Other Bovis works include the construction of an extensive road network
giving access from and to the M74, together with parking for 250 vehicles.
At Abington, there is a similar specification building, of 16,000 sq ft,
again containing two restaurants, a shop and rest rooms/toilets. Bovis will

Beginning in the second half of 1992, the system will handle all payments to
doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. Record keeping for the 10m eligible
insured persons and the collection of insurance premium payments will begin
officially at the start of 1993.
The HP computing systems, which are adjustable to meet the computing needs
of the individual branch offices, will include a client/server configuration
using HP's Precision Architecture RISC-based HP 9000 Series 800 business
servers, HP-UX Unix-based operating system, personal computers, data

FT  21 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall slightly in absence of
monetary easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and SIMON LONDON AND RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices languished yesterday at lower levels as the market waited
in vain for a signal that the Federal Reserve had eased monetary policy.
The Fed indicated that monetary policy was on hold by abstaining from
operating in the open market during its usual intervention time, when Fed
funds were trading at 3 3/4 per cent, the Fed's perceived target for the
rate.
By late afternoon, the Trea sury's benchmark 30-year note had extended its
loss to  7/16 at 102 7/32 , yielding 7.801 per cent. The two-year note was
off  7/32 to yield 5.066 per cent.
Expectations of an imminent interest rate cut were sparked by Tuesday's
report of an unexpectedly steep decline in April's housing starts. Prices
rose steeply, and, in spite of yesterday's losses, many players still expect
an imminent rate cut.
LONGER-dated gilts jumped a third of a point yesterday as poor retail sales
figures pointed to the slow pace of any UK economic recovery.
Most market predictions had been for month-on-month consumer spending to
more than recover the 1 per cent decline in March, but in the event the
April sales growth was just 0.8 per cent (or 1.2 per cent higher than April
last year).
The Bank of England took advantage of a rally in index-linked gilt prices -
driven in part by an expectation that the Bank will have to buy back
existing stock if the calculation of the retail price index is changed - to
announce two tap issues, each of Pounds 150m. The two index-linked issues,
each with a coupon of 2.5 per cent, mature in 2013 and 2020.
Meanwhile, most of yesterday's gains were at the longer end of the yield
curve. The yield on the benchmark 9 3/4 per cent gilt maturing in 2002 fell
from 9.04 per cent on Tuesday to around 8.99 per cent, while the yield on
the 9 per cent bonds due 2011 fell around five basis points to 8.85 per
cent.
GERMAN government bond prices moved higher yesterday as traders adopted a
more optimistic view of money supply figures due to be released in the next
few days.
The rally was led by the futures market, with traders reporting a number of
large professional buyers. The June bund future on Liffe, the London futures
exchange, opened at 87.52 but rose strongly through the morning session to
hit 87.80. In the afternoon the best of the gains were maintained and the
contract stood at 87.77 by the close. Volume was healthy at around 65,000
contracts, but not exceptional.
Cash bunds also rose, although institutional investors were more cautious.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity fund bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.34-42
for a yield of 7.94 per cent, from 7.96 per cent on Monday and Tuesday.
The rally was sparked by a reduction in the Bundesbank's official measure of
money supply growth during March, which was revised from the 9.7 per cent
previously announced to 9.4 per cent.
This led analysts to scale back predictions for April M3 growth, which is
expected to be released either this week or early next.
THE RALLY in the Japanese government bond market continued unabated, in part
on the back of comments made by prime minster Mr Kiichi Miyazawa that the
economic recovery was taking longer to materialise than had been expected.
With the yen remaining firm, this gloomy view helped to push the yield on
the benchmark bond No 129 down to 5.43 per cent by the close in Tokyo.

S&amp;P said the problems of O&amp;Y 'underscored the likelihood that property
markets worldwide will continue to experience high office vacancy rates and
diminishing underlying property values.' That set of circumstances would
have a negative impact on the banks' assets quality, S&amp;P added.
The ratings under review are RBC's AA long term senior debt rating, and the

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Westpac puts brave face on
losses - The impact of a bank's pessimistic view of the Australian economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS precious little sign of Australia's long-awaited economic recovery
in the massive losses announced yesterday by Westpac Banking Corporation,
the country's largest bank in terms of assets.
The level of Westpac's write-offs and problem loan disclosure reflects an
extremely pessimistic view of the Australian economy, precisely at a time
when some encouraging recovery signs are beginning to emerge.
The bank has not only written down the bulk of its property portfolio by
more than a third, but has also virtually doubled its problem loan
provisioning.
Westpac's brutal accounting treatment also throws down the gauntlet to its
competitors in an Australian banking industry still wracked by a 1980's
lending spree to the country's remarkable crop of failed entrepreneurs;
notably Mr Alan Bond, Mr Christopher Skase and Mr John Spalvins.
National Australia Bank is due to report interim results today, followed by
ANZ next week. However, widely varying write-off and provisioning approaches
have long been a feature of the Australian banking industry.
Westpac's action suggests that anything less dramatic by rival banks may
mean that they will meet stock market disapproval. In its latest full year,
National wrote off Dollars A955m (USDollars 729) in bad loans and raised
problem loan provisions to Dollars A3.9bn while corresponding figures for
the ANZ were Dollars A1.04bn and Dollars A3.6bn.
The stock market is likely to demand much more 'blood on the floor,' mindful
that on an international scale, the Australian banks can afford bigger
write-offs. They enjoy comfortable capital adequacy ratios, especially the
all important Tier 1 measure.
Even after yesterday's deck-clearing, Westpac is claiming a Tier 1 ratio of
5 per cent against the 4 per cent minimum demanded under central bank
regulations. National boasted a Tier 1 ratio of 7.6 at the end of last year,
with ANZ on 6 per cent.
Even so, Westpac's decision not to have it's ADollars 1.2bn rights issue
underwritten was surprising; especially in the light of some worrying
information buried in the fine print of yesterday's announcement.
The fine print showed that the big write-downs have reduced the company's
net asset backing from Dollars A5.66 to Dollars A3.75 a share, but 74 cents
of that valuation is in future income tax benefits which are not allowable
for capital adequacy purposes.
As a consequence, on a strict interpretation, Westpac's asset backing is
perilously close to the Dollars A3 price of the rights issue. The shares
closed at Dollars A3.89 in Sydney yesterday.
Westpac's managing director Mr Frank Conroy put a brave face on the results
yesterday, pointing to an improvement in core profitably. He noted that
operating earnings before tax totalled Dollars A687m in the latest half.
Although that was a decline on the Dollars A892m recorded for the
corresponding six months of last year, it was higher than the Dollars A655m
earned for the second half of 1990-91.
Mr Conroy said that the bank did not expect any negative response from the
ratings agencies, and shortly afterwards Moody's confirmed all Westpac's
ratings. 'We do anticipate a positive reaction as we proceed with the
capital raising and the bank's performance continues to improve'.
'I want the market and the media to have no misunderstanding on the
following points: I can assure proprietors, staff and customers that our
reviews have been thorough and conservative. The bank is sound, and what we
are reporting today will increase our financial strength. We expect a sound
profit in the second half and we can look forward to the future with
confidence,' Mr Conroy said.
Analysts, however, were less than happy last night as they digested the
enormous breadth and impact of the Westpac statement. Some were puzzled that
the property exposure involved properties with a book value of Dollars
A6.3bn. Some analysts' estimates put Westpac's total property exposure in
excess of ADollars 12bn.
Much of Westpac's property exposure is held through the Australian Guarantee
Corporation (AGC) subsidiary which made a loss of Dollars A719m and has
necessitated an Dollars A850m capital injection from the parent.
Mr Conroy said that AGC's affect on the group was actually more serious than
it appeared on paper because a number of the finance arm's problems had been
transferred to the bank.
'If you include Bill Acceptance Corporation, Westpac General Finance in the
UK, and the cost of the support arrangements from the bank, AGC and its
related activities accounted for Dollars A1.1bn of the Dollars A1.67bn group
half-year loss,' he said.
He added that the bank would reduce AGC's exposure to major property
developments and would turn its attention to specialist activities. Mr
Conroy's final comments on AGC underlined, if they did not understate, the
plight of the entire group. 'Of course mistakes have been made,' he said.
'Hopefully we have learnt from them.'

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sega lifts profits and increases
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEGA Enterprises, the video game and toy maker, doubled profits to Y33.5bn
(Dollars 251.87m) for the year to end-March. Unlike most Japanese companies,
it sharply increased its dividend.
Comparisons are made difficult by a change in the company's accounting year,
but sales rose from Y106.6bn to Y213.3bn on strong demand for Sega games in
the US.
After-tax profit was dragged down to Y14bn by the settlement of a US patent
dispute over image-display technology, which resulted in the company writing
off Dollars 28.67m of the agreed Dollars 43m payout to a US inventor.
The only other disappointment was the impact of the Tokyo share price
collapse on short-term holdings of stocks, which are showing unrealised
losses of Y235.8m, up from Y25.5m at the end of March last year. The
increase came in spite of the company almost halving its short-term holdings
to Y1.35bn.
Even though Sega apparently paid the Dollars 28.67m out of its cash
reserves, these rose, from Y29bn to Y72.5bn, following a surge in US sales
during the Christmas period, when it took market share from the industry
leader, Nintendo.
Yesterday's results came as Sega of America, the US subsidiary of the parent
company, and Sony Electronic Publishing announced a marketing agreement.
Under the deal, Sony will produce and market Sega video games and
interactive entertainment, Reuters reports. Sony Electronic will develop
games for all Sega cartridge-based platforms. The deal also provides
opportunities for the development of Sega titles through Sony Pictures
Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment.

<TEXT>
TOYO Sash, Japan's top maker of aluminium housing products, revealed a 14.6
per cent drop to Y32.5bn (Dollars 244.36m) in non-consolidated pre-tax
profits for the year to end-March.
Net profits also fell sharply, by 28.6 per cent to Y14.8bn, although sales
climbed a modest 4 per cent to Y481bn.
A sharp drop in demand in the second half - reflecting the nation's stock
market troubles - and a private sector spending downturn were behind the
profit retreat, the company said.
Sales of housing sashes, which account for over half of company sales, grew
1.1 per cent to Y280bn.
Building sash sales increased 10.6 per cent to Y148bn, due largely to the
introduction of new products for high-rise structures.
Turnover of housing equipment and other products also gained 11.5 per cent
to Y14bn. But construction material sales were off 0.2 per cent to Y38.7bn.

MR CONRAD BLACK, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group, yesterday informed
trade union leaders at the New York Daily News that he would want to cut 700
jobs if he acquired the newspaper.
Mr George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, a
coalition of nine unions, said representatives of Mr Black mentioned the
prospective job cuts at a 'get-to-know-you meeting.'
Mr John Campi, spokesman for the Daily News, said that Mr Black on Tuesday
submitted a bid for the famous New York tabloid acquired last year by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell. The bid was believed to be for Dollars 75m (Pounds
42m).
Mr McDonald seemed untroubled by the job cuts mentioned by Mr Black's
representatives. 'It's just a proposal. They'll say it's negotiable,
otherwise we can't do business. Black wants the paper and we want our jobs,'
he said.
The unions gave up about 800 jobs last year when Mr Maxwell acquired the
paper.
Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher of US News and World Report, is another
prospective buyer of the Daily News.

<TEXT>
TORAY Industries, Japan's leading synthetic fibre maker, yesterday posted
falls in consolidated earnings for the full year to March. It blamed
sluggish demand for its synthetic fibres, and lower profits at its
construction affiliate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Pre-tax profits fell 11.4 per cent to Y64bn (Dollars 481.20m) on a 6.5 per
cent rise in total sales, to Y976.7bn. After-tax profits fell 26.2 per cent
to Y27.7bn.
The company's fibre sales grew 10.1 per cent to Y489.9bn. However, the
company said demand for nylon used in tyre cords and fishing nets declined.
Sales of chemicals and new businesses declined 0.5 per cent and 2.4 per cent
respectively.
Nylon resin sales slowed because of sluggish demand from the automotive and
electronic industries. Polyester film sales also decreased because of low
demand and increasing price competition from film for magnetic tapes and
industrial materials.
Sales of the housing and engineering division rose 7.8 per cent to Y219bn,
but operating profits fell 3.2 per cent to Y7.6bn.

gauntlet to IBM
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-Packard has launched a bold challenge to IBM by introducing a new
class of high-performance computers that will represent a cheaper
alternative to conventional mainframe computers.
'Mainframes based on old and proprietary technologies can't match the
flexibility or cost-efficiency of H-P's new systems, which provide similar
performance at one-fifth the cost,' Mr John Young, president and chief
executive of the US computer system maker, said.
H-P is building on the momentum of its sales of workstations and
minicomputers which helped boost first-quarter earnings, announced earlier
this week, by 40 per cent. Its shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 .
The company is now targeting IBM's traditional stronghold in the corporate
data processing centre.
H-P introduced nine new 'corporate business servers' with performance up to
75 per cent better than its current high-end machines - and more powerful
than 90 per cent of installed IBM mainframe systems.
However, it has yet to subject its new computers to standard benchmarking
tests. The new systems incorporate the same reduced instruction set
computing (Risc) technology that is at the heart of H-P's computer range and
will run the same applications programs.
Four models are designed to run H-P's version of the Unix operating system,
while five run H-P's proprietary operating system.
With its new products, H-P hopes to play a leading role in the trend toward
reducing the size of data processing systems by off-loading applications
from room-sized mainframes onto networks of smaller computers.
More than 46 per cent of mainframe computer users are taking such steps,
according to a survey late last year by Dataquest, the US market research
firm.
H-P stressed the cost advantages of its new systems, which the company
believes will appeal to companies trying to limit spending in the weak
economic environment.
An IBM mainframe computer with a performance equivalent to H-P's fastest
model costs five times as much to operate, H-P claimed. The cost of
ownership includes the initial purchase price of the system and peripherals,
software and support for a three-year period.
Cost savings include lower systems prices, ranging from Dollars 335,000 to
Dollars 925,000, about a fifth the cost of IBM's latest mainframes. Other
factors reducing costs include lower power consumption and reduced support
personnel requirements. Not included in this calculation, however, is the
potentially high price of converting applications to run on the H-P systems.
To ease the conversion process, H-P has persuaded several leading mainframe
computer software developers to produce new versions of their programs to
run on H-P computers.
Despite all the advantages that H-P claims for its new computer systems, the
company must still prove its ability to address market segments where it has
little presence. These will include the financial services sector,
telecommunications industry and government markets.
'The world mainframe market is Dollars 50bn. We only have to win a modest
share of that market to be very successful,' maintains Mr Lewis Platt, H-P
executive vice-president and head of the Computer Systems Organisation.

MR Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, yesterday quashed rumours
that the US carrier had been in talks with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines over
some form of partnership, possibly involving the purchase of a share stake.
Breaking from American's normal policy of not commenting on merger rumours,
Mr Crandall said: 'There is no KLM deal - it's absolutely made up.'
Earlier this year, merger talks between KLM, the Dutch flagship carrier, and
British Airways broke down.
Recent newspaper reports have suggested that KLM might have found an
alternative suitor in American.
Back on the domestic front, Mr Crandall acknowledged the serious competitive
problem posed by Southwest Airlines, a small low-cost carrier which competes
in a number of short-haul markets.
He said American was looking at various options to deal with the situation.
These included the possible withdrawal from some markets it serves or
'introducing a re-defined product . . . where our full feature service is
more than our customers want or need.'

COVERED insurance claims from the Los Angeles riots are unlikely to rise
much higher than the Dollars 775m estimate reported yesterday by insurance
trade groups, industry officials said, Reuters reports from Los Angeles.
'We're pretty confident the Dollars 775m will be an all inclusive number,'
Ms Patricia Lombard, spokeswoman for the Western Insurance Information
Services, said.
Among insurance companies Farmers Insurance Group estimated its insurance
losses at Dollars 70m from about 800 claims filed so far, mostly for
businesses. Allstate Insurance has so far received more than 440 claims
totalling Dollars 24m, a spokesman said, adding the company's largest losses
were for vehicles vandalised or destroyed. Transamerica Insurance Group has
received about 130 claims totalling about Dollars 13m, the company said.
State Farm, a mutual insurance company, expects its claims to total about
Dollars 41m from 1,100 claims. The company added it had so far paid out
Dollars 7m. California's FAIR plan, an insurance industry pool, had received
514 claims totalling Dollars 37.4m, it said.
Ms Lombard said the industry was moving quickly to settle the claims in the
riot-torn area. 'A lot of people have been given partial payments already,'
she said. 'Companies are geared up and they want to deal with it as quickly
as possible.'

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Salomon agrees Dollars 290m
settlement in bond scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday agreed to pay
Dollars 290m in fines and compensation to settle charges relating to its
alleged illegal activities in the US Treasury markets between 1989 and 1991.
Criminal charges, however, will not be filed against the firm, although
criminal investigations of individuals and other firms involved in the
Salomon case continue.
In an additional penalty against Salomon, the firm was suspended for 60 days
from engaging in transactions with the New York Federal Reserve. The New
York Fed said it would resume trading with Salomon on August 3, when its
previous ban on the firm bidding in Treasury auctions for customers -
imposed immediately after the scandal broke last August - will also be
lifted. The suspensions, however, do not affect Salomon's status as a
primary dealer in government securities with the Fed, which it retains.
After yesterday's settlements were announced, Salomon said that it would
take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 185m in the second quarter of this year,
which, with the Dollars 200m set aside last year, will go towards covering
the cost of the penalties and legal costs related to the roughly 50 private
lawsuits that have been filed against the firm in the wake of the bond
trading scandal.
The Dollars 290m settlement ends a 10-month joint investigation launched by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve and the
Justice Department in August 1991, when federal authorities discovered that
members of Salomon's bond trading desk had faked customer orders and bid
beyond government limits in Treasury auctions.
The SEC also said yesterday that during the investigation it was discovered
that in August 1989 another primary dealing firm secretly bid for Dollars
3.5bn in government securities on Salomon's behalf by concealing the real
identity of the bidder in its records of the transaction. Officials at the
SEC declined to identify the primary dealer involved. There was no comment
on what action might be taken in light of the discovery.
Of the money Salomon has agreed to pay for its actions, Dollars 190m
represents fines and forfeitures for violating US securities laws, and
Dollars 100m will be placed in a fund to compensate victims of the
violations. The settlement, however, does not affect the private lawsuits
filed against Salomon by clients and individuals who claim they suffered
losses because of the firm's activities.
The penalties imposed on Salomon yesterday were generally regarded by
analysts as sizeable but not threatening to the firm's survival.
The news was certainly well-received on Wall Street, with Salomon shares
jumping Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 .

</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York has funnelled so much cash out of its profitable US buildings
in recent months that it has asked authorities in New York for temporary
relief on municipal tax payments which fall due on July 1.
O&amp;Y said yesterday it was exploring 'options' with the New York City
administration, and was likely to reach an agreement in the next week.
About USDollars 75m in property tax payments fall due on July 1. Although
only four of O&amp;Y's 12 New York buildings have cash flow problems, the
company has diverted every spare dollar from its US operations to the
cash-starved Canadian parent and the Canary Wharf project in London.
O&amp;Y hopes that last week's Ontario court order, which freezes its Canadian
debt obligations under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act (CCAA),
will give it sufficient breathing space to replenish the coffers of its US
operations. Its ability to do so partly depends on petitions to be brought
by bondholders in the Ontario Court of Justice today to exclude some of the
developer's most prized Canadian buildings from the CCAA order.
The bondholders' move to reverse the order has wide implications for all
forms of non-recourse finance. The bonds were issued by single-purpose
companies with no recourse to O&amp;Y Developments, the parent. The bondholders
had previously assumed that they would be insulated from the parent's
liquidity crisis.
The bondholders will argue that their claims should be separated from those
of O&amp;Y's other creditors and that they should be at liberty, if necessary,
to seize rents from the buildings to cover overdue debt-service payments.
The CCAA order issued last week covers a total of 28 entities besides the
parent company. They include First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey flagship
in Toronto, as well as other buildings in Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa.
The application is likely to be opposed by O&amp;Y's bank lenders, whose claims
on the projects in question generally rank behind the bondholders.
However, some of the banks which provided a Dollars 2.5bn jumbo loan to O&amp;Y
are expected to raise concerns of their own about the CCAA order. The banks
contend that the order in its present form permits O&amp;Y to channel surplus
cash from its Canadian assets to the US and UK operations, which have not
been brought under court protection.
The banks will also mount a separate court challenge today against the
amount of collateral provided by the developer to its Canadian lenders. The
international group is seeking to assert its rights to the security pledged
on a Dollars 100m loan advanced earlier this year by four Canadian banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPERATING profits for Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank, the
Frankfurt-based merchant bank, advanced 30 per cent in the first four months
of the current year compared with the previous corresponding period.
Partial operating profits - excluding the contribution from trading -
increased by 21.5 per cent, Mr Klaus Subjetzki, outgoing senior partner,
told the bank's annual meeting.
Total assets climbed by 5.2 per cent to DM28.1bn (Dollars 17.6bn), while
interest income was up 5.5 per cent and commission income up 20 per cent.
The results are in line with strong results from other German banks which
have also reported good figures for the early part of the current year.
The results follow a record year for the German banking sector and suggest
that there has been only a moderate slowdown in loan demand in spite of a
sharp downturn in German economic activity.
The sector is also benefiting from a recent improvement in conditions in the
domestic stock market.

<TEXT>
Henderson, the fund management group, is seeking at least Pounds 20m from
the launch of an investment trust specialising in European equities. It is
the second new European investment trust to be announced this week.
Henderson EuroTrust will have a split capital structure, with 75 per cent of
the issued capital in ordinary shares, and the rest in zero-dividend
preference shares.
It is hoped that this structure will stop the shares from moving to a
discount to net asset value.
The company has a 10-year life until the annual general meeting of October
2002, when the zero shares will be redeemed at 70p.
This is equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 10.2 per cent. Projected
initial gross yield on the ordinary shares is 5 per cent.
During the launch issue only packaged units, consisting of one ordinary
share and one zero at a price of Pounds 1, will be available.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: US buyer for ASH's surveillance division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), which supplies burglar alarms and other
security products, is selling its electronic and television surveillance
wing to a US company for Pounds 150m.
The loss prevention business, which includes till monitoring to prevent
theft by shop staff and the new TVX system using a tiny video camera, is
being sold to Sensormatic, a supplier of electronic security systems listed
on the New York stock exchange.
It is acquiring a business that made Pounds 11.1m trading profit last year
on sales of Pounds 60.2m. Net assets before the deduction of borrowings were
Pounds 68.5m in November. It is being sold debt-free.
ASH previously tried to float off this wing. More recently, it tried to sell
part of the leasing portfolio to reduce debt. The cash consumptive nature of
the business had raised concern among analysts.
Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, said the sale would wipe out the group's debt and
'take away balance sheet concerns'.
At the end of November, ASH's net borrowings were Pounds 95m. The group
still has about Pounds 60m of convertible capital bonds.
ASH made Pounds 23.2m pre-tax profit last year and the first fall in 19
years came as a shock to the market, further undermining the share price.
This had fallen from more than 300p two years ago to 81p in March. The
recovery continued yesterday with an 11p rise, though the announcement did
not come until after the market closed.
ASH's remaining security systems business made a trading profit of Pounds
35.1m on sales of Pounds 119m last year. The deal should lift the interest
burden on the remaining business.
Mr Buffett said the deal marked an alliance between the two groups. He would
become non-executive vice-chairman of Sensormatic.
The initial payment of Pounds 50m cash is expected to be followed by another
Pounds 100m from the proceeds of a public offering of securities by
Sensormatic.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Net assets fall 16.9% at Land Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND SECURITIES, the UK's largest property company, suffered a 16.9 per cent
fall in its net assets in the year to end-March, which its chairman
described as 'the most difficult period for the property industry that I can
remember'.
'High real interest rates, over-borrowing in both the personal and corporate
sectors, the over-supply of accommodation, particularly in central London
and, until recently, political uncertainty, all took their toll,' said Mr
Peter Hunt, chairman.
But the company stressed its financial strength, which was underlined by a
5.7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 215.2m to Pounds 227.5m
in the year to March 31.
The company owns Pounds 4.3bn of property, the value of which fell 12.6 per
cent during the year. Its borrowings of Pounds 1.52bn, up from Pounds
1.27bn, correspond to gearing of 43.2 per cent, which is relatively modest
for a property company.
The fall in net assets per share from 668p to 555p was mainly blamed on the
central London market, which has been particularly badly hit by recession
and oversupply of space. Properties in the West End and Victoria were worst
affected, falling 21.3 per cent in value, while those in the City fell 17.6
per cent.
Elsewhere in the UK, the value of shops and offices fell 2.8 per cent. The
value of out-of-town retail property increased 9 per cent; industrial and
warehouse property increased 0.7 per cent.
Mr Hunt criticised the government for neglecting central London's transport
systems, describing the priority given to Docklands transport as
'ridiculous'. He is also lobbying the government to remove the 'patently
unfair' rate charges on empty buildings.
Earnings increased 5.7 per cent to 32.62p. A final dividend of 15.75p makes
a total of 21.75p for the year.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Fiat in deal with Polish carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY ROBINSON and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT HAS signed a preliminary agreement to acquire a 90 per cent stake in
Poland's Fabryka Samochodow Malolitrazowych (FSM), the country's largest
producer of small cars, in the largest ever foreign investment in Poland.
The deal will lift the Italian carmaker's investment in Poland to Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.1bn), but in terms of investment in eastern Europe, it remains
far behind the Dollars 6.9bn which Volkswagen is investing to aquire a 70
per cent stake in Skoda, the Czechoslovak carmaker.
Formal approval between the Polish government, which will retain a 10 per
cent stake, and the Italian group is expected by May 28.
Last October Fiat signed a memorandum committing it to take a 51 per cent
stake in the company. Under this scheme up to 30 per cent of the shares
would have been allocated to the company's 20,000 employees.
During negotiations between the two groups since the October accord, the
Polish government has argued that Fiat should absorb the group's substantial
domestic debt, believed to be more than Dollars 100m. In return, the Polish
government offered a higher stake and larger financial commitment.
Of the Dollars 2bn committed to the project, some Dollars 800m has already
been spent, mainly on bringing into production the Cinquecento, Fiat's new
small car which is being built by FSM at a rate of 160,000 cars a year.
Under yesterday's agreement, signed between Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the
caretaker Polish finance minister, Mr Renato Ruggiero, Fiat's deputy
chairman, and Mr Paolo Cantarella, Fiat Auto's managing director, production
of the Cinquecento will be expanded to 240,000 units a year. Fiat will also
invest in a new model to replace the Fiat 126, another small car built for
Fiat by FSM.
Fiat believes that if it did not sign while Mr Olechowski was still acting
finance minister the future of the deal would have been in doubt.
Mr Olechowski, a former trade minister and central banker, resigned as
finance minister earlier this month in protest against a parliamentary vote
that would have increased government spending and pushed up the budget
deficit.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Governor of Bank waives bulk of his 28% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, was given a 28
per cent pay rise to Pounds 198,446 in 1991-92, but he decided to waive all
but 6 per cent of the increase.
Last year, Mr Leigh-Pemberton was widely criticised for accepting a pay rise
of nearly 17 per cent in the year to February 1991, while urging pay
restraint on the public.
Bank directors yesterday defended their decision to give the governor a 28
per cent rise while the government and the Bank were encouraging companies
to make low pay awards.
'There's no way I would apologise for that,' said Mr Gavin Laird, general
secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and a member
of the Bank's remuneration committee which set Mr Leigh-Pemberton's salary.
'I believe in the rate for the job,' Mr Laird went on to say. 'My only
complaint was I felt he should have taken the money.'
A Bank official said Mr Leigh-Pemberton's decision to forego most of the
rise was 'entirely his own decision'. The Bank refused to say whether Mr
Leigh-Pemberton had waived any of his wage rise in the current year as well.
After waiving Pounds 34,135 of the rise, Mr Leigh-Pemberton was paid Pounds
164,311 in 1991-92. The 6 per cent increase was in line with that of the
bulk of his staff.
Other executive directors of the Bank saw their remuneration increase by 13
per cent on average. None of them has waived their entitlement to the
additional money.
Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Bank's remuneration committee and a
campaigner for improved corporate management practices, said it was
essential for the Bank's health that the pay of senior directors should not
fall too far behind the private sector.
He said the committee, which includes Sir David Scholey, chairman of
merchant bank SG Warburg, and Sir Brian Corby, who retired yesterday as
president of the Confederation of British Industry, had established a
framework in 1988 for moving the directors' pay nearer to a 'semi-market
rate'.
'We realised we could not get the pay rates to the proper level all in one
go,' he said. Instead, the committee decided to recommend sizeable pay
increases in each of the succeeding few years.
In November 1990, the committee fixed the precise amount of the 1991-92 pay
rise, opting for a 28 per cent increase for Mr Leigh-Pemberton, even though
there were clear signals from the government that prominent public figures
should set an example by accepting lower pay rises.
Sir Adrian said it was vital that the Bank should be in a position to
recruit outsiders to its top jobs, so its pay levels should be competitive.
But it was difficult to find a private sector equivalent of the governor.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Standard Chartered makes Pounds 50m provision: UK-based bank
suffers high losses in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO and ROBERT PESTON

<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK based international bank, is being forced to make
a provision of Pounds 50m to cover losses by its Bombay branch from
securities deals.
It is therefore likely to emerge as one of the two biggest losers - with the
Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays - in India's worst financial scandal.
Standard said last night that a senior team of bank executives, recently
sent over to India from London, is 'investigating the possibility that
losses may have been incurred in its Bombay branch as a result of
transactions in breach of the group's established control procedures entered
into to finance stock exchange dealings'.
Its total exposure to this form of stock exchange finance is Pounds 100m.
Although it could not quantify how much the eventual loss will be precisely,
it was making a Pounds 50m provision against possible losses, it said.
According to bankers, Grindlays is also likely to face significant losses.
Nine state-owned Indian institutions including State Bank of India, Canara
Bank, United Bank of Calcutta, Karad Bank and National Housing Bank are also
vulnerable to substantial losses.
Yesterday, representatives of several banks spent a second day at a
round-table conference in Bombay seeking to reconcile their accounts in the
interbank securities market.
As banks embarked on what is the massive task of reconciling the backlog of
securities transactions, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank,
announced that it had suspended four of the employees from the office which
has responsibility for registering transfers of government securities.
The bank took the unusual step because of what it called 'procedural
irregularities in the upkeep of the register'. Until now the register has
been maintained by hand.
Standard Chartered said it had brought a six-man team to India to verify the
daily records of its securities department over the past six months. The
bank does not exclude fraud. 'We cannot rule it out,' it said.
Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the governor of the Reserve Bank, has supporters who
point to his role in bringing to light the abuses in the securities market.
But there are also many bankers who hold the central bank governor
ultimately morally responsible for inadequate supervision of a market that
has grown explosively.
Mr Harshad Mehta, a Bombay broker who has been suspended by the Bombay Stock
Exchange authority, was questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation
for the first time yesterday. While the authorities are pursuing him, they
also seem to be opening the door to a settlement that would allow him to
meet at least part of his outstanding obligations through transferring
shares.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Two per cent inflation and slow recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In last Monday's Economic Viewpoint, I argued that the only way to discover
whether, and how far, British interest rates could move below German
interest rates within the constraints of the ERM was to 'suck it and see'.
That is, the Bank of England should move them down gradually and be prepared
to go into reverse if sterling came under pressure within its ERM band.
Why has not the Bank of England so far attempted this? One answer is that
these are early days. It is only since the April 9 election that there has
been this room to experiment; and there has already been a half point cut in
base rate to 10 per cent. A further reduction of half a point - or two
further cuts of a quarter point - would take the UK rates a shade below
German rates and into the experimental zone.
There are also, however, domestic arguments for caution about cutting basic
rates, which need to be discussed, but not necessarily endorsed. In line
with my usual practice of leaving the heavier economics to the second half
of my articles, I shall start off with the partisan political case.
The chart shows UK output in relation to the trend of productive capacity.
The numbers just give an order of magnitude. The trend line is meant to give
an idea of where output might be if inflation is not accelerating, and
production is growing in line with capacity.
During the period in the late 1980s, when the thick line, indicating actual
output, was above the dotted trend line, there was pressure on productive
capacity, with inflation rising and the balance of payments gap widening.
Somewhere towards the end of 1990, output reached a sustainable level, as
overheating was giving way to recession. Since then, output has been well
below the sustainable level, recession has been prolonged, but inflation has
fallen.
The Bank of England expects a slow recovery. This means not merely that
output will stay below the trend line, but that the gap shown by the shaded
area between output and productive potential will continue to widen. Indeed,
according to some definitions it would not be a real recovery.
The prospect is nevertheless quite pleasing to some in government. The logic
of the case is this. The upturn in the late 1980s came too early and went
too far. Therefore, the 1992 election had to be fought under the handicap of
a corrective recession. If output can be kept comfortably below capacity for
a couple of years, there can be a growth spurt in the pre-election period
without any inflationary overheating. The GDP line would then start to move
up smartly towards, but still not reach, the trend line.
Thus there could be a pre-election boom without too much inflationary
danger; and after the next election the government will try to stay nearer
the trend line. I am perhaps over-rationalising a desire to do in this
parliament the opposite of what was done in the last; but the proposition
should be discussed.
There are two objections to this approach. First, it is immoral to have
recessionary conditions unnecessarily prolonged and unemployment
unnecessarily high to arrange a pre-election boost. Second, it will not work
politically. The errors of the late 1980s were honest lapses and arose from
policies such as credit deregulation, which were worthwhile for their own
sake, and were corrected when they were diagnosed, despite the political
risks. The electorate sensed this and still preferred the Conservatives to
the alternative. If, however, they sense that they have gone through
unnecessary years of stagnation and are then being bribed by a deliberate
and unsustainably rapid expansion, the government will be out on its ear,
however weak the opposition.
Now let me turn to the economic case for preferring a slow recovery. I had
described the subject of this article to colleagues needing to know in a
rush as 'the Bank of England's case for continuing the recession'. This
served as shorthand, but may be unfair in view of the May Bulletin's
statement that 'high interest rates in Germany have obliged other countries
in the ERM, especially those in the narrow band, to maintain higher interest
rates than domestic considerations would, for the most part, have dictated'.
I defy anyone to tell me whether or not the Bank of England is saying that
UK interest rates are higher than it would like.
What then is the domestic economic case for maintaining a substantial and
widening 'gap' between output and productive capacity? It is to achieve an
inflation rate which the chancellor, Norman Lamont, has described as 'not
only below the European average, but as low as the best in Europe, measured
on a comparable basis'. He quantified this objective as '2 per cent'.
When UK output fell below the trend line near the end of 1990, the
underlying inflation rate was still much too high, even allowing for lags.
If this is to be reduced, output must fall below the trend line and stay
there until a sufficient improvement in inflation is in the pipeline. And if
the amount of slack is not merely high, but increasing, inflation will come
down that much faster.
The case for continuing to pile on the agony is that UK inflation is still a
good deal higher than it appears in the headline rate, which is distorted by
the timing of mortgage interest reductions. The underlying rate is still
about 5 1/2 per cent, a good deal higher than Germany's, for all the
Schadenfreude. UK producer price inflation, which is now running at 2 per
cent to 3 per cent a year, is doing much better; but in leading competitor
countries it is below 1 per cent.
How strong are the arguments for suspending this aim until something like
'stable prices' has been entrenched? Common-sense observation suggests that
it is much more difficult to squeeze out the last few percentage points of
inflation than to get down to 4 or 5 per cent. An inflation rate of 2 per
cent is less than the creeping inflation that prevailed in the Bretton Woods
period and less than anything known in the lifetime of most of the
population. To achieve it would involve a clampdown on the costs of the half
of the economy that is sheltered from international competition such as
construction, property rents and other services.
We have moved a long way from the traditional economic objective, which
would have been to stabilise the movement of output as near to the trend
line as possible. As this is well beyond the half-way point of my article, I
can add that some might have described this objective as 'minimising a
quadratic loss function' - or flattening out booms and slumps.
Even if the Treasury wants to forget about stable growth rates, it may
simply not be able to maintain the margin of slack required for inflation to
fall as low as it would like. For if demand remains slack for too long,
capacity can be retired and workers become so discouraged that they leave
the labour force. Such people have little disinflationary influence.
It is reasonable for the chancellor to seek to publicise a lower rate of
inflation than he expects to get. If he becomes a 'Stormin' Norman' for 2
per cent, he may be able to lock in 4 per cent. But serious disinflation
objectives are best stated in terms of internationally traded goods and
services; and the reluctance of the sheltered sectors to follow suit is best
treated by competition and other supply-side activities.

Things are different in Rio de Janeiro, where the society's rolls have just
been swelled by several hundred motor-cyclists, given to inching along in
line abreast and intermittently bumping into one another if not falling off
unaided.
Early theories that they must be apprentice Hell's Angels turned out wrong.
They are in fact police in training to serve as outriders for the motorcades
of the heads of state due to attend the Earth Summit in Rio next month. The
necessary skills are rare in the city where motorbikes are normally few and

Still, a pile-up of more than 100 heads of state would be something to be

If you want to understand the Danes, go to Ghana. That tip for anyone
betting on the outcome of Denmark's impending referendum on the Maastricht
Treaty, comes from Britain's former ambassador there Sir James Mellon, now
chairman of Scottish Homes.
He has just marked his long love affair with the country, which began with
his first visit as a teenage hitch-hiker in 1948, by publishing a book in
Danish called Og gamle Danmark . . . (the first two words meaning roughly:
'And as for dear old').
But in it he reveals that it wasn't until his foreign office duties involved
him with the Ashantis in Ghana that he twigged how to fathom the Danes. He
suddenly realised that they are not so much a nation as a tribe, with the
tribe's much greater exclusiveness - which would seem to lead him to expect
them to turn the treaty down.
The tribal exclusiveness makes them touchy about the idea of international
co-operation, especially if it threatens to interfere with what they see as
their Danishness, he writes. 'That seems to be precisely the worry that many
Danes have about European Union. The very word 'union' suggests an unwelcome
intrusiveness.'

Having spent the last two years graphically depicting the impact of
recession on its membership, the Confederation of British Industry yesterday
poured out its own, sorry tale of financial hardship.
The organisation's expanded accounts for 1991 show that an operating surplus
of Pounds 756,000 in 1990 turned into a deficit of Pounds 188,000 last year
 -a performance the CBI tries to pass off as an achievement in these tough
times.
But having preached the need for moderation on pay throughout the darks days
of 1991, the CBI also disclosed that its own salary roll - despite a
standstill in the numbers employed - rose by a healthy (some might say well
above average) 12 per cent during the year.
At least Sir John Banham, the retiring CBI director general, did not
personally add to the organisation's swelling pay costs. Yesterday, he was
again reminding people how he has consistently refused any pay rise during
the slump - which puts Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton's much
trumpeted self-denial firmly in its place.

The gang of five atop the Bundesbank has been feeling the pinch. Germany's
central bank directorate, reduced last year from the previous complement of
seven by the death of Ottomar Werthmoller, was also depleted by the more
headline-grabbing resignation of Karl Otto Pohl, the then president.
While Pohl was happier with no more than six wise men, which reduced room
for dissent, his successor Helmut Schlesinger frets that five is too slender
for comfort. With officials often spread all over the world speechifying -
and one fifth of the policy-makers in the shape of Johann Wilhelm Gaddum off
administering the bank's affairs in east Germany - the president gets
nervous that there'll be no one left to mind the store.
So, with the holiday season upon him, Schlesinger is agitating to fill the
two vacancies pdq. While Bonn has the last word, it can take recommendations
from the central bank. Observer hears that both posts will be filled by
'technicians' - with an announcement due any time, perhaps even after
today's regular council meeting.
The late Werthmoller's post seems likely to be taken by Wendelin Hartmann, a
safe pair of hands who as chief of the Bundesbank's admin-
istrative department has to most practical intents and purposes been doing
the job in recent months. He appears to have finished a short head in front
of one Hans-Jurgen Siegmund from the Hamburg central bank.
But will the Pohl vacancy also be filled by someone from inside the bank?
Since Karl Otto was always going to be a hard man to follow, it might be
best not to make the attempt. Why not just settle for yet another
bureaucrat?

Sir, There are several points one could make about Joe Cryans' letter (May
16), but I would make just one. Canary Wharf may currently appear as 'one of
the more visible mistakes of the markets', though, no doubt it seemed a good
decision at the time. Perhaps it is worth saying that neither the 'New
Right' nor, perhaps, the 'Old Left' is infallible. And, who knows, future
generations may thank us for our wisdom and foresight in building such a
wonderful office complex.

MAXWELL'S FALL By Roy Greenslade Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 4.99
Among the least edifying spectacles of the aftermath of Mr Robert Maxwell's
death was the speed of the overnight conversion of his flagship newspaper,
the Daily Mirror, from docile servant to exposer of the publisher's many
sins.
The newspaper that had proclaimed Mr Maxwell a 'giant with wisdom' was to go
out of its way to condemn him as a devil. The Mirror's exposes ranged from
stories of widespread buggings of senior executives to mock-up photographs
of Mr Maxwell with the white hair he would have had if he had not had it
regularly dyed dark brown by his Savoy barber.
Maxwell's Fall is the book that Mr Maxwell did not ban; he died before its
publication. Its author, Roy Greenslade, is a former senior executive of Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Sun and Sunday Times, who accepted the editorship of the
Daily Mirror in January 1990. He left 14 months later after agreeing a
generous severance payment and a confidentiality clause designed to prevent
Greenslade from ever publicly speaking ill of Mr Maxwell.
Greenslade argues that only someone who has been 'sullied by working closely
with Maxwell' can share in the exhilaration of release felt by Mirror
journalists, past and present, at the news that Mr Maxwell's body had been
found floating off the coast of the Canaries.
The book certainly records a cathartic experience, a genuine attempt to
understand a part of the author's past that he had either ignored or
overlooked.
Why an experienced journalist like Greenslade, who had worked for a rival
Murdoch tabloid, volunteered to work for Maxwell in the first place is a
mystery. Claiming to have some sense of Mr Maxwell's dishonesty as a person,
but unsuspecting about his financial improprieties, Greenslade initially
considered himself capable of taking on Maxwell the idiosyncratic bully and
of imposing himself as an editor.
The book lists several episodes in which Greenslade portrays himself as
having successfully stood up to Mr Maxwell by defending some of his staff
from sacking, and overriding his employer's attempts to dictate a story or
headline.
On one occasion, for example, Greenslade refused to fill up his front page
with the news that Mr Maxwell had bought two Israeli football clubs. On
another he ignored Mr Maxwell's telephoned 'tip-offs' - erroneous as it
turned out - that six members of the British cabinet were about to resign
over the Tory leadership contest.
In the end, however, Greenslade found himself increasingly impotent in the
midst of 'Maxwellia' - the crazy, disorganised, cruel and corrupt world Mr
Maxwell created.
Mr Maxwell never forgave his editor for a memorable interview Greenslade
gave to the British newspaper trade's weekly magazine, the UK Press Gazette,
which cast gloom over the future sales of tabloids such as the Mirror.
Along the way there were moments when Greenslade chose silence rather than
protest. In one of the best-written human episodes in the book, he describes
Mr Maxwell's public humiliation of a secretary.
'Never has an extrovert with an overweening sense of self-importance and the
thickest of skins, lacking even a tiny perception of the word embarrassment,
got to control a newspaper group and use it so flagrantly for his
self-aggrandisement,' reflects Greenslade.
It is not merely the man himself whom Greenslade criticises. His business
moves come under attack too. Perhaps the only commercial decision for which
Greenslade believes Mr Maxwell did deserve praise was his move into colour
printing before his rivals. The decision boosted advertising revenue,
enhanced the editorial content of his newspapers and eventually forced the
rest of Fleet Street to follow suit.
Apart from that single episode this is the story of irrational and
improvised decision-making by a newspaper publisher who insisted on
controlling the expenses of his editorial staff, while lavishly wasting his
companies' resources on personal promotion.
The blurb on this paperback boasts that Greenslade's book is the first
account since the publisher's death of the full monstrous story. In fact
several financial chapters seem to be the result of a skilful cuttings job
on material already published in newspapers, rather than the product of
original investigation.
As such it puts the key in the door, but fails fully to unlock the mystery
of the whys and wherefores of Mr Maxwell's dealings or to assign
responsibilities to family members, employees, and financial institutions.
As for Mr Maxwell's personal history, Mr Greenslade adds little to what can
be gleaned already from Tom Bower's The Outsider, although he is adept at
pointing out the contradictions between Bower's unofficial biography and the
official account written by Joe Haines.
Greenslade suggests that Mr Maxwell commited suicide under pressure over his
collapsing business empire but fails to indicate where the evidence might
come from to back this up. Neither does he explain why the Daily Mirror,
under his editorship, did not probe into Mr Maxwell's pensions fund when its
rival the Daily Mail did.
The chapters focusing on Greenslade's first-hand experiences of Mr Maxwell
are what gives this book its particular value, and raises it above the level
of a mere attack on his labyrinthine financial dealings.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: The Family Reunion - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1951, TS Eliot reflected on the 'intentions, failures, and partial
successes' of his plays. He rightly said of The Family Reunion: 'After what
must seem to the audience an interminable time of preparation, the
conclusion comes so abruptly that we are, after all, unready for it.' This
throws down the gauntlet to both audience and director, and his challenge
has been met in a bold, exciting production at the Leicester Haymarket.
Putting a difficult verse drama on the Haymarket main stage calls for nerve
and invention: Reunion gets both from director Julia Bardsley and designer
Aldona Cunningham. The out-of-kilter country-house set works with the
discordant soundtrack (Andrew Poppy) to conjure feelings which, according to
Eliot, 'which we can only detect' from the corner of the eye. Frequent
changes of state indicate the shiftings of consciousness implicit in Eliot's
text.
Reunion, based on Aeschylus and cut for Leicester, traces the return of
Harry to his ancestral home. There, a chorus of aunts and uncles, a harridan
of a mother and a jilted sweetheart await him. He has been haunted by
'furies' ever since his wife fell to her death from an ocean liner; he
searches for peace with himself and his dying mother.
Eliot wrote Reunion in 1939, midway between Murder in The Cathedral and Four
Quartets. It shares technical similarities with both, and was subject to his
rigorous verse-drama aesthetic. While he felt that he overvalued the verse,
neglecting plot and character, Eliot managed to write speech rhythms which
make one cease to be conscious of the play's verse form. This production
strives to stay in touch with those rhythms: 'In an old house there is
always listening . . . We do not like to walk out of a door and find
ourselves back in the same room.'
Eliot was later to rue the chorus and the furies. But here, two coups of
stagecraft involving both make the evening. The furies are terrifying
children dressed as Harry's relatives, and appear in a wonderfully
frightening sequence; they reappear in a psychodrama of Harry's past. The
exorcised furies become 'the friendly ones'.
The fine acting of Rory Edwards (Harry) and Paola Dionisotti (his sage aunt
Agatha) sends tap-roots into the subconscious. Even her dangerous lines 'May
the weasel and the otter be about their proper business' find a place amidst
the evil in the dark. The chorus is an apt melange of insight and stupidity,
conveying their uncertainty and their knowledge; the reflective passages
should be quieter.
This is intelligent directing which tackles Eliot head on. If the production
overreaches itself, it does so to compass Eliot's scope; for he knew that
art was the imposition of credible order upon ordinary reality which
elicited a perception of order in reality.

THE LONG DAY CLOSES (12) Curzon West End
WAYNE'S WORLD (PG) Empire Leicester Sq
DON'T TELL MOM THE BABY SITTER'S DEAD (PG) MGMs West End, Odeon
Kensington
DEF BY TEMPTATION (18) Prince Charles
Terence Davies's The Long Day Closes, like his Distant Voices, Still Lives,
is a dream of what film-making could be like. Davies is telling us another
story from his past: his boyhood memories of life with Mum (Marjorie Yates)
in mid-1950s Liverpool, when the bliss of family life and of discovering the
movies (The Robe, Private's Progress, The Lady-killers) was poisoned only by
an eleven year old's first taste of life at a new Catholic school.
It is not what Davies tells, it is how he tells it. He must never have
listened to sensible cinematic advice in his life. The film has no coherent
story; there are long silences interspersed with cryptic dialogue or
impromptu singalongs; and the images mix the real with the surreal. In one
scene a fantasised sailing ship splashes real spray at hero Bud (Leigh
McCormack as the young Davies) as he daydreams in a classroom. In another,
he sees his own face in a school window: but it is not a reflection, it is a
new image of himself about to flash us forward into a new scene.
The Long Day Closes is a miracle of rebel imagination over movie manners.
Since Davies's first film Trilogy, a three-part suicide note shot in black
and white with BFI money, he has put colour and humour into his work. And a
dazzling sensuality. He turns his recreated postwar Liverpool, painstakingly
mocked up at London's Rotherhithe Studios, into a dreamscape part beautiful,
part brutalist.
Changing daylight weaves shifting traceries on worn carpets. Rain lends a
silver pointillism to a street outside a cinema. (As abruptly and
dramatically as it comes, it is cut off.) And lyrical tracking-shots travel
not just between streets but between years, lubricated by Davies's
invocation of hallowed movie dialogue lines. 'In those years they had time
for everything' (The Magnificent Ambersons); 'Mrs Wilberforce, I understand
you have rooms to let' (The Ladykillers).
Some filmgoers resist or even resent film-making so determinedly
impressionistic. Even though their own minds operate in this
free-associative way almost every minute of their lives, they think films
should tell neat linear stories. But just look at one scene that turned this
filmgoer incandescent with joy. The boy sits on a staircase silently musing.
All that 'happens' is that the lighting on his face changes three times. The
scene has no takeaway message, the boy's thoughts and feelings are not
spelled out in over-voice. But the profundity and serendipity of changing
human mood has never been more simply, vividly caught.
Davies only falters, briefly, when he harks back to the messianic
miserablism of Trilogy. It is a good black joke to follow Mum's wistful 'I
wonder what 1956 will bring' with a shot of nailed feet on a cross. (Cue
Bud's entry into his new school.) But the round of lice inspections and
bleak cruelty, with more helpings of religious symbolism, is too overtly
querulous.
We feel hectored. Worse, we feel we have been smuggled into Davies's mind by
the non-denominational beguilements of the film's early scenes in order to
be his anti-Catholic storm troopers when he needs us.
Far more haunting is a single, inexplicable nightmare image at home. A pair
of hands reach out from behind Bud's bed and clasp his head. Nothing leads
to the scene, nothing leads away: it is for the audience to join the
emotional dots. Here and in the film's use of music to challenge or ironise
the visuals, and in the ingenuity of the visuals themselves like the
halo-ing back-light on Bud's head in class that suddenly wobbles to become a
movie projector beam, Terence Davies proves that he is not just a good
film-maker, he has the makings of a great film-maker.
Wayne's World provides the most convincing argument since Network for
throwing your television out of the window. It follows the antics of two
young American couch potatoes, Wayne and Garth (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey),
as they present their public access TV chat show, an anarchic combination of
mindless babble of the 'party on, dude' variety, woebegone special guests
and lots of heavy metal music. When not on air, Wayne and Garth stumble
through the world in a permanent electronic thrall - quoting TV adverts, lip
synching to the radio, dreaming of the girl in the rock video. Their idea of
witty dialogue is for one to exclaim 'No Way]', whereupon the other counters
by saying 'Way]'.
The film was born as a regular skit on America's Saturday Night Live comedy
show, where it provided an often hilarious depiction of a generation of
youth unable to conceive of anything that is not bounced off a satellite or
channelled through loudspeakers. It is a shame that Myers, the show's
creator, felt it had to be stretched out to a movie format - the plot,
involving a venal network producer trying to take over the show, is
nonsense, while the satire quickly achieves saturation point in a series of
gags which will try the patience of most viewers. To make matters worse,
there are continual references to television commercials and programmes
unavailable over here. This is not to say that there are not some funny
moments, though the overall impression the film leaves you with is that the
telecommunications revolution is over, and the machines have won.
A far less distressing view of American youth is on display in Don't Tell
Mom The Babysitter's Dead. The film's plot is more or less deducible from
its title: a harried single mother of five decides to take a few months off
in Australia, leaving her children in the care of a tough old sitter, who
promptly dies, whereupon the eldest child (Christina Applegate) must take
charge of the family. The carefree 17-year-old soon shows her worth by
bluffing her way into a high-paying position in the fashion industry,
managing to hold the family together while at the same time winning the
heart of the boy in the hot dog delivery van. What starts out as a
potentially chaotic teen comedy soon turns into a gormlessly charming
coming-of-age story that comes down firmly in favor of honesty, hard work
and traditional family values.
The distributors of Def by Temptation claim that it is 'the best black
vampire movie since Blacula', an assessment I am not prepared to argue with,
having missed all the other black vampire movies. Unfortunately, first time
writer/director James Bond III has made a film which is hard to praise in
many other ways. It tells the story of a young divinity student who travels
to New York City for a vacation, only to find himself doing battle with a
female vampire barfly who tries to tempt him away from his faith. Despite
some spirited acting by Bill Nunn and Kadeem Hardison, the film's pace too
uneven and its goriness too unconvincing to make it very scary.
It is not that Bond is without talent - he just has failed to stretch his
low budget to adequately cover the horror genre.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: Patagonia/The Fastest Clock in the Universe - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telling your own history is an important way of showing that you have some
pride in yourself. Patagonia, presented by the Welsh group Brith Gof, is
less about that distant land than about the 153 Welsh settlers who sailed
there in 1865 and whose descendants remain there, still speaking Welsh -
mixed with Spanish and a little English - holding eisteddfodau, singing
festivals and Welsh newspapers. Part documentary, part performance art,
Patagonia does honour to both Wales and to pioneers.
Its first parts remind me a lot of Martha Graham's greatest work, the 1944
Appalachian Spring. Like that, this shows the bare frame of a new homestead
against an open sky, the two women and two men of the new community, their
relationships and the religious practices they have brought with them. But
Patagonia is not a dance work, and it celebrates to a considerable degree
the way these Welsh Patagonians have kept the Welsh language alive. I have
no Welsh, but hearing the musicality of this Welsh, whether in speech or in
song, was one of the evening's pleasures.
This work is about history, the development of a community through the
generations and its commemoration of its past. We not only see and hear the
rites and customs of these emigres, we hear detached commentary too. A
narrator figure - who sits, with his back to us, at the front of the
auditorium, using the front of the stage as his desk - and the four onstage
performers tell isolated stories of specific families and their houses. We
hear how 'She is the museum. Women always carry the history,' how even these
Welsh became 'true conquistadors,' how 'In a land where nothing rots,
history spreads itself,' and how one of these stories was told to (among
others) Bruce Chatwin and became chapter 17 of his In Patagonia.
All of this is affecting and stimulating, and the simple elegance of the
staging is often marvellous. The four-part singing is excellent, the
speaking has dignity, the main gestures have breadth and power. The use of
sand on the floor provides a source of beautifully ambiguous symbolism -
sand as locale, sand as time, sand as omnipresent intrusion.
Best is the way that the staging frequently shows us two or more acts at the
same time or in quick succession. There are, however, a few longueurs, even
though the work lasts only 70 minutes. Certain inventories of local life
become ponderous, and the slow-motion treatment of one dramatic episode
manages to be both dull and obscure.
But Patagonia, a frequently poetic work, won my immediate respect and
interest. Brith Gof is a group new to me; I hope to encounter more of its
work before long. It is the first offering in the excellent three-week
Barclays New Stages season at the Royal Court, which presents some of
Britain's leading work in performance art, new dance and/or music theatre.
Philip Ridley's new play at the Hampstead Theatre until June 13 is short and
sour, variably funny and intermittently gripping. In outline the scenario
might suggest Joe Orton, but neither the writing nor the sentiments echo
that cheerful subversive at all. Structurally, the play is much nearer to
Pinter's Birthday Party - and not only because Ridley's centrepiece too is a
sinister party.
Here, the birthday is Cougar Glass's 'nineteenth': we gather he has had
several of those already. He lives with his sugar-daddy 'Captain Tock', a
cultivated, tragically balding antique dealer who likes clocks (Cougar hates
them, and cultivates nothing but his quiff and his artifical tan). The
parties are a device for luring beddable youths home; in due course the
Captain will make an excuse and leave.
The latest unknowing prey is Foxtrot Darling (Ridley's way with names is all
his own), for whom Cougar has become a a big-brother substitute. Foxtrot
arrives with not only a deeply unwelcome birthday gift, but his pregnant
fiancee Sherbet Gravel too; they call each other 'Babe' indiscriminately.
The Captain decides to remain, while Cougar leaves off his languid macho
preening and goes into a long, silent seethe. Sherbet soon sizes up the
situation all too well, and her bright chat turns again and again to
reflections upon mortality. Eventually there is a ghastly eruption, staged
for maximum theatrical impact by the director Matthew Lloyd.
Jonathan Coy (I think that is his real name) plays the Captain with some
delicacy, if slightly too much hair, and Con O'Neill (ditto) seethes well.
The kids are expertly cartooned by Jude Law, the lamb to the slaughter, and
clever Emma Amos. As tough old Cheetah Bee, the landlady of this
semi-converted factory (picturesquely devised by Moggie Douglas), Elizabeth
Bradley makes the most of her two appearances with Zimmer frame.
They all give the play a grounding in a plausible East End reality which
Ridley's text barely suggests, dreamily abstract as it often is. Curious
exercise] If it bears a moral, it seems too obvious to mention; but perhaps
there is a real-life Cougar out there somewhere, who is meant to be
pilloried here.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Technology: Cutting through the red tape - How fragmented
sectors, such as machine tools, can realistically carry out joint R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past few months, Europe's machine tool builders have been engaged
in characteristically low-pro-file talks with the European Community about a
possible industrial policy. In the depths of a recession that has damaged
competitiveness, the industry hopes for some stimulus to investment by its
customers in manufacturing, but also wants the EC to help create the
conditions that might address some of its longer-term problems.
At the top of the list is a very different approach to research and
development - aimed at stimulating better co-operation between companies in
the most strategically important areas of R&amp;D, and improving the unhappy
relationship between the industry and EC-funded research programmes.
The outcome of the talks is far from clear, but the industry's approach
raises questions about the nature of R&amp;D in a fragmented, intensely
competitive industry of some 1,500 independent producers.
How does such an industry achieve a balance between 'R' and 'D' when most
companies concentrate exclusively on the D? Where does the R get done, and
how does the industry benefit? How much R is necessary anyway?
For many machine tool builders, development work that is not linked to a
specific product or technology is rare, and 'blue-sky research' taboo. But
new materials, relatively new processes such as laser-cutting and the trend
towards standardisation of control systems, motors and drives all argue for
a significant research element in R&amp;D.
Inevitably, though, the recession has reduced the ability of machine tool
builders to do much more than plough their own development furrows.
Consequently, increased co-operation on higher levels of research -
broad-based and 'pre-competitive' but not 'blue-sky' - has become an even
higher priority for producers, users, institutions and universities.
But the industry and the EC industrial research infrastructure is poorly
matched. Most machine tool builders, for example, believe the structure and
content of the EC's Brite/Euram industrial research projects make it
difficult for them to participate.
'The research is too far removed from the market place to allow the
formulation of projects that can be useful in the medium- or short- term,'
says Mike Bright, chairman of Brighton-based FMT Holdings. 'It's the
Plesseys, Siemens &amp; Philips who are obtaining the funds. The SMEs (small and
medium-sized enterprises) are not getting a look in, and it's causing quite
a concern.'
Tony Balding, managing director of Norwich-based Beaver Engineering Group,
cites the intimidating amounts of paperwork involved in applying to join an
EC project. He warns too that small companies which do participate may find
their pace is inhibited by larger, slower-moving partners.
Continental machine tool companies have similar complaints. Sandvik of
Sweden has participated in Brite/Euram via EC subsidiaries, but Clas Ake
Hedstrom, president of the Sandvik Coromant metal-cutting tools division,
says that results have been limited so far, and some programmes are taking
longer than was originally anticipated.
The problem for the machine tool industry is that such EC projects were set
up to focus on what Nigel Eldred, chief executive of Amtri, the UK machine
tool research organisation, calls 'macro-technology'.
Consequently, small companies which have traditionally carried out strictly
targeted development work find it difficult to leap into these broader-based
projects.
However, the industry has reason to hope that EC-funded research may soon
become more user-friendly. Jean Heymans, secretary general of Cecimo, the
European machine tool trade association umbrella body, says the EC's current
Framework programme for Brite/Euram projects will be much more geared to
industry than to blue-sky research.
Cecimo, whose talks with the EC are backed by its 12 member countries, is
pushing for a policy designed to improve the SMEs' access to R&amp;D programmes
through measures such as increased funding for their projects, simplified
administrative procedures and enlarged Craft-type programmes.
Craft, an offshoot of Brite/Euram and currently at the pilot stage, is
likely to be more market-oriented than Brite/Euram itself, and could appeal
to SMEs. Administrative procedures should be simpler but, according to one
UK machine tool official, 'there will still be a whittling down process, and
unless you know the ropes, you haven't got a hope in hell'.
As long as the machine tool industry retains its current structure, though,
there will always be companies which will find it hard to benefit from the
EC's largesse - some Ecu 500m (Pounds 350m) spent on Brite/Euram in 1989-92
and Ecu 670m budgeted for the overlapping 1990-94 programme.
But the industry can, and is, participating in the pan-European Eureka R&amp;D
initiative, launched in 1985. This is intended to be more market-related
than Brite/Euram, but projects are narrower in scope and rely on funding by
national governments.
Speed is probably the biggest factor prompting some companies to consider
bilateral agreements on development rather than become involved in a
long-term project which offers little opportunity to cover administrative
costs and could be tantamount to 'buying a headache,' says Eldred.
But at least one larger UK machine tool company is happy to be taking part
in a Brite/Euram project, even if it did take months to get off the ground.
Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based grinding machine manufacturer, is
investigating the potential of cubic boron nitride for precision cylindrical
grinding at high wheel speeds via a four-year Brite/Euram project based at
Aachen.
The diversity of the project's participants is a new trend for machine tool
research and one which many observers believe should be encouraged. Apart
from Aachen University's machine tool research department, the other
partners are Brussels-based Diamond Boart, manufacturers of super-abrasive
wheels, and a user - the vehicle-parts and electricals group Robert Bosch.
In the UK, which has traditionally lagged behind continental Europe in
harnessing R&amp;D carried out by companies, universities and government-funded
research institutions, Amtri has been the catalyst behind a unique project
that follows a similar approach.
The Pounds 15m Machine Tool Technology and Materials Processing Programme,
supported by the Department of Trade and Industry, brings machine tool
customers, producers and part suppliers together in a series of separate
projects such as high-speed spindle research. The aim is for all the
technologies being developed in the programme to be combined in a
'multi-function machine tool'.
Eldred sees a key role for Amtri as a 'networker' to link companies with
universities and other bodies, and to keep its ear close to the ground in
relation to other European centres. As companies and institutions begin to
take a more international approach to research partnerships, the next step
is to help develop a more effective 'network of networks' in Europe,
according to Derek Palethorpe, Amtri's director of operations.
The overall aim should be to produce a more co-ordinated, broad-based
approach to R&amp;D in the European machine tool industry. In the background is
competition from Japan, which has always outshone rivals on product
development and exploitation but is also becoming more interested in
multidisciplinary international research.
Japan's proposed research project into intelligent manufacturing systems,
for example, is intended to have international participation. Some European
observers worry, therefore, that it may be no more than a Trojan horse
feeding on Europe's remaining areas of superiority in machine tool
innovation.
At the same time, industry critics say, more mergers and cross-border
co-operation among European machine tool builders would develop a mentality
that is better suited to participate in the higher reaches of EC research.
At least they would have more resources to handle the red tape.

An initiative to promote 'open' computer systems among UK small- and
medium-sized businesses is being orchestrated by the Department of Trade and
Industry as its Pounds 12m open systems technology transfer programme ends
this month.
The DTI has already held meetings with a number of large computer suppliers
who have pledged their support for a broad programme of measures to
disseminate information about open systems and their benefits.
The list includes ICL, IBM, Digital Equipment, Hewlett Packard, AT&amp;T,
Easylink, Unisys and Uniplex. While details of the initiative remain to be
settled, it seems likely it will include a 'hotline' number which companies
will be able to call for independent advice.
It is also likely to develop guidelines which will define a set of
attributes for openness which could be compared with suppliers' offerings.
Open systems are based on commonly accepted industry standards and usually
imply computers that can easily be connected together and run software from
any supplier following open systems rules.
Open systems offer significant possibilities for cutting costs once the move
from proprietary designs has been made, but DTI studies show that while the
message is well understood among very large companies - BP, Marks &amp; Spencer
and Lucas are enthusiastic supporters of the initiative  - medium-sized and
small companies are frequently confused by differing messages from suppliers
and have difficulty obtaining independent information on which to base
decisions. They are often too small to be able to afford to join one of the
big league self-help organisations such as the Butler Cox Foundation.
The DTI intends to inject some Pounds 2m in pump priming funds over the next
two years but otherwise will confine itself to acting as 'honest broker'
among the various factions and suppliers which make up the open systems
movement.
The idea is for the industry to take the lead in speaking to customers with
a single, unambiguous voice about open systems. The DTI initiative is backed
by lobby groups including X/Open, Uniforum UK, Unix International and the
National Computing Centre.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Getting corporate
projection in the Cannes - Professionals who beat a path to the film
festival but never watch the movies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
George Eccles managed to get to the showing of the movie 'Braindead', but
was soon slumbering. He observed the on-screen cannibalism and decided he
could use the sleep instead - 10 days' of marketing his accountancy firm at
the Cannes film festival is exhausting work.
Not to be at Cannes these days is more of a marketing than a social gaffe.
Europe's film industry now has an annual turnover of Dollars 1.4bn; this
year, three of the main four prizes went to European movies.
None of those are likely to match the commercial success of the latest US
box office hit, 'Wayne's World', which took more than Dollars 100m in its
first two months. Yet closer EC political and economic ties offer the
prospect of greater co-production funding and distribution deals within the
community.
That in turn creates a need for more efficient marketing. How to achieve
that is an open question; one answer for many is to go to the film, music
and television festivals held annually at Cannes.
Some 20,000 people go to considerable trouble to get to the Cannes festival
but many do not see even one film. Instead, they pay inflated prices for
accommodation and services to join in a 10-day marketing jamboree which they
hope will result in cinema-associated business.
The marketing moves at Cannes are mostly down to old-fashioned direct
selling, focused almost entirely on rented hotel suites and the esplanade
where the US, Canadian, Japanese and European pavilions house producers, tax
lawyers, accountants and assorted other fixers, all renting space or
sponsoring the pavilions to market their services.
Even the economic development department of Gwynedd county council in Wales
was there, dishing out brochures announcing: 'Fairytale lands . . . The
Great Wall of China . . . The dark depths of Transylvania . . . Gwynedd has
the film location you're looking for'.
Eccles heads the media group at accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. For
him, Cannes is 'a trade and marketing event. We are here to serve existing
clients and get new ones. It's impossible to know how much new business we
attract by being here. But we are now working for a client who has acquired
cable rights in Nigeria. He said he came to us because he picked up one of
our brochures in Cannes 11 years ago.' Coopers spends more than Pounds
20,000 to mount an exhibition with five staff at Cannes.
Eccles says it is 'very difficult for accountants to market ourselves and
our activities. We can't do blanket television advertising, so we have to
pick our marketing opportunities much more carefully.'
This year was the first at Cannes for Howard Bass, a partner at Ernst and
Young's New York office; clearly it will not be his last. 'We have at least
20 large clients here this year and it's important for them to see us.
'The cinema industry is a huge business for us, worth perhaps Dollars 100m a
year, so the investment of perhaps Dollars 60,000 to bring a small team here
and set up an exhibition is definitely worthwhile.'
But much more than that, Bass has a choice of spending perhaps Dollars
25,000 on a full-page advertisement in a glossy trade magazine which few
might read, or to shake hands in the most direct form of marketing
available. He opts for the latter and intends expanding Ernst and Young's
exhibition at Cannes 1993.
The European pavilion is organised annually by Button Eventures, part of the
Reed group. For Steve Jaggs, UK marketing manager for Agfa, the film stock
producer which is sponsoring the European pavilion, it is a vital aspect of
his marketing strategy.
'Cinema is something of a cottage industry and a people business, so
conventional advertising is not so appropriate.'
Jaggs says that some 20 per cent of Agfa's costs in the UK are on marketing
but he spends 70 per cent of his budget on event sponsorship and support for
professional cinema organisations, and only 30 per cent on conventional
advertising.
He hopes that by being highly visible at Cannes, Agfa will stick in the mind
of producers and film companies thinking of purchasing stock.
If Cannes provides a marketing forum for business, it is equally attractive
as a centre for marketing new productions and forging contacts. Nicholas
Steil, general manager of Euro Aim, an EC-funded organisation, regards
Cannes as the centre for plugging in to the European film industry.
In the end, 'Braindead' - in which 'a zombie mother interferes with the
course of true love' - will probably fade alongside hundreds of other movies
shown at Cannes. But the movie business itself is set to expand both in
Europe and elsewhere.
And as European integration speeds up, the leisure industry may find that
marketing events become an increasingly important means of making both
contacts and profit.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Burnt by over-exposure
in the Sun - Norwich Union has been fined Pounds 50,000 by Lautro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial services, it must be said, are not like floor wax. The fact that
four out of five housewives agree is not likely to persuade viewers to
purchase a complex financial product which may require investment over half
a lifetime.
Because the losses from choosing the wrong product can be great, there are
firm rules for what financial services firms can and cannot tell the public
about their products.
Last week, Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry,
slapped a Pounds 50,000 fine on Norwich Union for misleading advertising -
along with a bill for Pounds 15,000 in costs - underscoring the seriousness
with which breaches of advertising codes are viewed. The fine was the first
ever imposed by Lautro under powers it received last autumn.
The offending ad was a four-page pull-out in the Sun newspaper in April
1991. Lautro's main objection was that the advertisement looked just like
the Sun's editorial pages, and so gave the impression that it was a
journalist's account of a new product.
Furthermore, the ad, promoting a 15-year savings product, implied that
premium payments would remain constant when, in fact, they would rise by 20
per cent per year for the first five years in order to give the right
investment returns.
The ad also offended by suggesting that the illustrated investment returns
were conservatively estimated and were likely to be far larger in practice.
Although such breaches are worrying, they are rare. According to Kit Jebens,
chief executive of Lautro, instances of misleading advertising have fallen
over the past two years.
Indeed, only one of the eight or nine disciplinary cases still before Lautro
involves misleading advertising. Most of the others concern companies'
failure to control their so-called 'tied agents'. These are sales agents who
are self-employed but who agree to sell the products of one company
exclusively.
Significantly, Norwich Union's ad was not placed by the company itself, but
by one of its tied agents. The agent, a company called 'SunCare' was a
subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, the financial services broker, and was set up
for the sole purposes of running the advertisement. The company has since
ceased operations.
Companies are becoming aware of the high cost of misleading advertising and
steer clear of it, Jebens said. While Norwich Union has earned the first
fine, others have had to bear the cost of rewriting their advertising,
notifying clients of advertising errors and in some cases, they have been
forced to refund customers.
The regulation simply says that advertising must be 'fair, clear and not
misleading'. But that rule is backed up by guidelines which ban the design
of ads which are identical to a newspaper's editorial copy.
Other rules forbid companies from playing down certain information - such as
a 'health warning' that past investment performance is no indication of
future returns.
But while regulators may have stamped out the worst excesses in published
advertising, they have been far less successful in controlling the informal,
verbal advertising that goes on in private between a potential customer and
a commissioned sales agent.
'That's where the real sales pitch goes on,' said Jean Eaglesham, money
policy manager at the Consumers' Association. CA has sent actors posing as
potential customers to gauge how much misleading advertising goes on in
private.
A recent CA survey of 40 mortgage lenders found that all 'were selling
endowment policies very hard and were giving inaccurate information to
consumers.' For instance, the sales agents - employees of banks and building
societies - told buyers that endowment insurance policies were guaranteed to
pay off a mortgage upon maturity when in fact, they are not.
'I don't really know what you can do about that,' Eaglesham said. 'It really
needs radical reform of the commission system.'
The commission system, under which sales agents are allowed to keep a
portion of the premium payments from new customers, encourages a hard sell,
critics say. The life industry has adamantly opposed any reform of the
commission system, saying it would be a disincentive to sales agents and
that people who need insurance simply would not be encouraged to buy it.
Jebens admits that there is some merit in that view. 'Remuneration systems
are partly at fault here,' he said, 'but there's not a lot you can do about
it'. Commission, he says, is a commercial matter and cannot be subject to
regulation.
But Eaglesham argues that until misleading advertising transmitted by word
of mouth is made as costly as that delivered in print, there is little
incentive for companies to stop. Indeed, SunCare, Norwich Union's sales
agent, signed up 4,500 new customers with its ad in the Sun - and earned a
commission on every one.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rivers watchdog criticised on cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs HAVE strongly condemned the National Rivers Authority for weaknesses in
financial management that led to wasted expenditure of Pounds 1m and the
resignation of its first chief executive.
A report from the Public Accounts Committee published yesterday criticises
the Environment Department, Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the NRA, and his
board for failing to keep a sufficiently close eye on the water pollution
organisation's expenditure.
The primary reason for the outspoken criticism was evidence that rules for
spending large sums of money had been ignored in fitting out the NRA's new
head office in Bristol.
The project resulted in the wasting of about Pounds 1m out of a total cost
of Pounds 2.65m, and the resignation last June of Mr John Bowman, chief
executive, with a pay-off of Pounds 125,000. Two other senior executives
received written warnings for ignoring the financial procedures laid down
for the NRA.
In July, 1990, the NRA engaged Corporate Design Interiors (CDI) to advise on
relocating and to help choose contractors. It was also one of three firms
asked to tender for the Pounds 12,000 contract to design the layout of the
new offices.
The NRA then decided to combine the design contract with a much bigger one
for fitting out the building. Instead of asking several firms to tender, it
considered only two that had bid for the much smaller design job. The Pounds
2.65m contract went to CDC, a sister company of CDI, without Lord
Crickhowell, Mr Bowman or the NRA board being told.
An internal inquiry found that had the job been properly managed it would
have cost only Pounds 1.6m.
The NRA said last night there had been 'serious shortcomings' in the
management of fitting out the Bristol head office, which resulted in poor
value for money.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock calls for re-think on
'opt-outs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROMOTION of 'co-ordinated expansion' during the UK presidency of the
Community was urged on the government yesterday, by Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader.
Opening the debate for the opposition, Mr Kinnock argued that such an
approach was the only way 'to ensure vitality and confidence in western
Europe and to promote stability, hope and strengthened democracy in Eastern
Europe'.
The certainty of growing interdependence between EC countries made it
essential, he said, for the government to work towards promoting balanced
development and social cohesion.
He called on the prime minister to abandon his 'opt-out mentality' and
re-emphasised Labour's broad support for the treaty, He also emphsasised its
opposition to opting out of the social chapter and economic and monetary
union.
These 'opt-outs' are at the heart of the party's 'reasoned amendment' to the
bill. But if that amendment fails, Labour policy is to abstain on whether
the bill should proceed. That policy came under fire during the debate from
some Labour backbenchers.
Mr Kinnock called the terms in which minsters had attacked the social
chapter 'absolute fantasies' and warned that the government had indulged in
such fictions because it needed the false threat of disruption to cover up
its desertion of duty in failing to secure better rights for British
workers.
He said Britain was the example that poor labour conditions did not mean
necessarily superior economic performance, and called on ministers to end
efforts to make Britain 'the labour market bargain basement of Europe'.
Turning to economic and monetary union, he warned the government that as
early as 1994 it would have to make specific proposals so that preparatory
decisions could be taken. 'They won't be able to opt out of that', he said.
While Mr Kinnock was heard in a crowded Commons with little interruption,
there was discomfort for the Labour front bench from Mr Peter Shore.
The former Labour cabinet minister called the party's apparent readiness to
let the EC decide the future size of public borrowing under a Labour
government 'a total disgrace', and warned that opposition MPs had a duty to
vote against the bill itself.
He ridiculed the briefing from the party's Treasury frontbench team that the
mention of goals of sustainable growth and high employment early in the
treaty put those aims on a par with the aims of economic and monetary union,
and price stability in particular.
Mr Shore said the government had evaded the central issue of where Britain
should go when a majority of other EC member states wanted a different -
federal - destiny.
Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield) said it would be absolutely wrong for a step
of such magnitude to be taken without consulting the people who - because of
the transfer of more decision-making to Brussels - would lose democratic
rights.
Mr Austin Mitchell (Lab Great Grimsby) said the Bill would get a second
reading tonight not because the argument had been won but because the Labour
leadership had 'allowed it to go through'.

ASSURANCES by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the Maastricht treaty
marked the beginning of a reversal of the 'centralising trend' in the
European Community failed to satisfy prominent Conservative backbench
critics in the Commons last night.
Mr William Cash, MP for Stafford and one of seven Tory backbenchers who
called for the rejection of the Bill implementing the treaty, insisted that
it was a 'very centralising measure'.
A former cabinet minister, Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North) also
expressed 'considerable reservations' about the treaty.
He contended that it contained a great deal of senseless commitment to
centralism.
In a confident speech opening the two-day debate on the Bill, the prime
minister maintained that the treaty marked 'an important change in
direction' by enabling agreements to be reached by the member states of the
European Community outside the confines of the Treaty of Rome which
established it.
Dealing with another issue that has caused considerable concern on the
government back benches, he strongly reaffirmed Britain's determination to
maintain frontier controls to guard against illegal immigration from non-EC
countries, and to combat terrorism, crime and the traffic in drugs.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, argued that the issue of
immigration controls was one on which Britain could afford to make no
concessions and should fight in the courts if necessary.
Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East), a leading critic of the EC, and Mr Peter
Shore (Lab Bethnal Green and Stepney), a prominent opponent of the
Maastricht treaty, warned that the government's position on frontier
controls may be subject to legal challenge.
The prime minister promised Britain would 'fiercely' contest such
proceedings, citing the 1987 single European Act.
He said Britain would co-operate within the framework of international law,
but outside the framework of EC law.
Emphasising the significance of the distinction, Mr Major said: 'Any dispute
would go to the International Court of Justice, not the European Court of
Justice.'
The prime minister said the Maastricht treaty provided for those to be dealt
with either under the Rome treaty or through intergovernmental co-operation.
It also recognised that there might be circumstances in which 'the member
states can act better on their own'.
Underlining the negotiating objectives he achieved at the Maastricht summit,
Mr Major said the treaty set 'exactly the framework' Britain wanted for
economic and monetary union.
It ensured 'an absolute right' for the UK parliament to decide later, at a
time of its own choosing, whether Britain should move to the third stage of
economic and monetary union.
The prime minister hit out at Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, for his
condemnation of the carefully negotiated provision giving Britain the right
to decide whether or not to join a single currency.
Those who supported Mr Kinnock's view, he said, were commiting themselves to
'enter a single currency now in unknown economic circumstances in the
future, with the Community at an unknown size and with economic convergence
at an unknown level'.
Mr Major dismissed Labour's denunciation of the government's refusal to
accept the social chapter. He said signing the chapter would have removed
from British employers and their employees the right to determine working
conditions.
Mr Ray Whitney (C Wycombe) argued that the tenor of the debate was out of
tune with the mood of the country.
He said people outside the House were more disposed to accept the reality of
Britain's relationship with Europe.
In a maiden speech, Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (C Chingford) warned that the
treaty kept the door open to federalist centralisation and an uncompetitive
Europe which was clearly moving in the wrong direction from the rest of the
world.
Sir George Gardiner (C Reigate), who described himself as a
'Euro-pragmatist', said his support for the European ideal had never
embraced a federalist structure.
He deplored the efforts being made by some to force the EC step by step into
a 'federal centralised straitjacket'.

MR Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said that although the

European institutions it created, his party would still support the bill.
The Liberal Democrats believed the treaty was 'a step forward that must be

At Westminster last night, the party's MPs voted to replace European affairs
spokesman Sir Russell Johnston as deputy leader with Treasury spokesman Mr

FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Gould clash in debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIVAL candidates for the Labour leadership clashed last night in the
first and, possibly, the only head-to-head confrontation before the
electoral college ballots on July 18.
Their performances in a Fabian Society debate eschewed acrimony and were
held by many to have amounted to a draw. However, several rounds of applause
for Mr John Smith's staunch avowals of Labour's first principles may just
have given him a points victory over his rival, Mr Bryan Gould.
The loudest accolade came for the shadow chancellor's dismissal of a
suggestion that the party should appeal baldly to electors' self-interests.
'The philosophy of democratic socialism is about a moral view of life . . .
if there is no morality in it it is not worth having,' he said.
Mr Gould won acclaim too when he made clear that altruism was not enough and
that Labour needed to find new ways to appeal to a new and wider electorate.
Arguing that one path to victory was to defuse the concentration of power
among vested interests, he cited the aphorism: 'The great advantage of
socialism is it removes the need to be altruistic.'
In the event, the clearest exposition of the differences between the two men
came in their opening statements. Mr Smith spoke of building an opposition
from the anti-Conservative majority.
Promoting his plan for a Commission on Social Justice to examine tax and
benefits, he argued: 'We face a new challenge of designing a strategy for
social justice and economic opportunity that will benefit the minority,
while gaining the votes of the majority that will have to pay for it.'
Mr Gould offered a lightly veiled critique of his rival as a 'one last
heave' candidate.
The leadership needed someone with the experience to fight beyond Labour's
heartlands who could offer 'distinctive and positive reasons why people
should vote Labour.' That would involve a commitment to run the economy
differently and challenge monetarist orthodoxy, he said.
The differences between the two men in much of the question session that
followed was mostly mood music.
On Europe, Mr Gould rejected a purely 'monetarist' approach in the
convergence towards economic and monetary union. Mr Smith, instead, stressed
the need to discuss that question while progressing to the EMU goal.
On party reforms, Mr Smith argued that there should be a role for MPs in a
future leadership electoral college, whereas his opponent said a one-member,
one-vote system would lessen union unease.
Both agreed on the need for constitutional reform, especially devolution and
a consideration of electoral reform.
Mr Gould put greater emphasis on the need to promote full employment before
a redistributive tax policy, whereas Mr Smith suggested that such a goal,
although desirable, was no substitute for a clearly argued case for
redistribution.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN EVANS, the doughty anti-Militant campaigner, was first out of the
traps yesterday in the race to contest the post of Labour's chief whip with
the incumbent, Mr Derek Foster.
Within minutes of the campaign timetable being announced, the St Helens
North MP said his candidacy aimed to shake up the party's management of
parliamentary business, which, he claimed, 'was frequently criticised for
lacking logic or dynamism'.
Mr Jeff Rooker, the Birmingham Perry Barr MP, also confirmed yesterday that
he was discussing a bid with his colleagues. But the odds are still on Mr
Foster, who has held the post in spite of a series of challenges since 1985.
He is said to enjoy the tacit support of Mr John Smith, now seen as a
certainty for election as party leader.
Under the timetables announced to the parliamentary Labour party yesterday,
nominations for chief whip and the PLP chairmanship will open on June 18 and
close on June 25. An exhaustive ballot will begin on July 9, repeated, if
necessary, for each week that follows with the last-placed name dropping
out, until one candidate has secured 50 per cent of the vote.
That means the race will be completed before the electoral college meets to
conclude the leadership issue on July 18.
For the shadow cabinet elections, party officers have agreed a complex
arrangement that opens nominations on July 9 and closes them before the
leadership result is known on July 16. Voting for the 18 places will take
place up to July 23 to allow MPs to take account of the outcome.
Some MPs were complaining yesterday that the planning for the chief whip and
party chairmanship contest - each ex-officio shadow cabinet posts - further
helps the incumbents as backbench MPs must 'bid' for select committee places
 -in effect, decided by recommendations from the whips' office - from today.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher warns on transfer of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM BEYOND the Commons, Mrs Margaret Thatcher again entered the European
debate yesterday, warning that the EC should have acted more vigorously in
dealing with what was Yugoslavia, and that the Maastricht treaty was
particularly flawed in its transfer of powers to a centralised bureaucracy,
Alison Smith writes.
In an article in the current issue of The European newspaper, she supported
the government's line in strongly resisting any attempt by other EC member
states to dilute or remove border controls to deal with international crime,
immigration and terrorism.
The plight of what was Yugoslavia was used as an example of how the
provisions of the Maastricht treaty are 'not in tune with the instincts of
the people', who would like to help but see that the EC can do nothing.
Among the treaty's other failings, the article said, is that it would not
ensure or enhance democratic government because of the power it transferred
away from nation states, extending the areas of Community authority and of
majority voting.
Mrs Thatcher said she was 'very concerned' that the larger role of the
Western European Union in European defence arrangements might send the wrong
message to the United States about whether the EC wants American troops to
continue to be stationed in Europe.
The treaty's failure to tackle European protectionism and thus improve world
trade was also attacked.
On the subject of border controls, she defended the position she negotiated,
saying it is a matter of 'good faith (which) once lost is hard to regain'
that the other EC countries stand by the general declaration attached to the
Single European Act.
The Act said that the provisions for free movement of goods and persons
would not affect measures that individual countries thought were needed to
control immigration from outside the EC as well as to combat terrorism and
international crime.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots MPs backing referendum delay
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCENSED SCOTTISH Labour MPs delayed the start of the two-day Maastricht
debate by some 25 minutes yesterday, deploying a series of parliamentary
devices to stall scheduled Commons business.
The ruses culminated with Mr John McAllion, the Labour MP for Dundee East,
forcing a vote on the technical matter of whether 'strangers' or non-MPs
should leave the chamber. The Tories were the 'strangers' referred to, he
said, claiming the government was denying Scotland 'its democratic right' to
a referendum on its constitutional future.
The disruption followed a stormy session of Scottish questions in which the
government ridiculed repeated Labour and Scottish National party demands for
a referendum.
To have such a referendum now on 'vague and unspecific philosophical
concepts' would prove nothing and achieve nothing, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, said, claiming the demands were being made only to cover the
confusion over constitutional change in Labour ranks.
Prior to the general election, he said, Labour opposed a referendum and
planned to impose a Scottish assembly. The government was considering
whether there were ways of 'continuing to make the government of Scotland
responsive to Scotland's needs without undermining the unity of the UK.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said there was 'major room for
improvement and a shift in the balance of power towards Scots running their
own affairs within this country.'
Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said that the real reason the government
would not hold a referendum was that it had no confidence that its position
would 'carry the day'.
Mr Jim Sillars will stand down as deputy leader of the SNP when the the post
comes up for re-election in September. Mr Sillars, who lost his seat at
Glasgow Govan in the general election, said he intends to remain active in
the party.

FT  21 MAY 92 / The Finance Bill: MPs ready to enact Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, RICHARD WATERS, ANDREW TAYLOR and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCE Bill, published yesterday, enacts most of the Budget announced
by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in March.
The bill is likely to survive its parliamentary stages intact, although,
since the government majority is now just 21, there is scope for Tory
backbenchers to push their hobbyhorses, possibly winning some concessions.
It is difficult to predict where controversy might arise, but building
societies were already reacting angrily yesterday to the fact that the
government has not changed its stance on the societies' claim that they were
taxed twice during the introduction of composite-rate tax in the late 1980s.
Leeds Building Society said Clause 52 might spell the end of its attempts in
the UK courts to recover what it claims is Pounds 57m of overpaid tax.
Mr Mike Blackburn, Leeds chief executive, said: 'No single word adequately
describes the action the government is proposing. It is outrageous and
offensive to the rule of law. It makes a mockery of the Citizen's Charter
and shows the Inland Revenue's Taxpayer's Charter is not worth the paper it
is written on.'
Last year's Finance Bill contained retrospective legislation preventing
Leeds and others from following in the footsteps of the Woolwich, which had
won a similar action. This year's retrospective legislation might close the
door for good on action in the UK courts. If so, Leeds said it was prepared
to take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights.
The dispute stems from efforts by the government to bring building
societies' tax payments, previously made annually, into line with the banks,
which make their returns on a quarterly basis.
About seven sessions are expected to see it through to a third-reading
debate beginning in early July. It should pass into legislation around the
middle of July.
The new bill follows the Finance Act, which was given Royal Assent on March
16 and enacted the Budget's more controversial elements, including the new
20 per cent income tax rate on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income and
excise duty changes.
The bill is due to be debated in the Commons on June 2.
Finance Bill. HMSO. Pounds 13.10.
LABOUR is likely to raise the issue of stamp duty on house sales during
discussion of the Finance Bill, Andrew Taylor and Alison Smith write.
The move comes amid concern from housebuilders and estate agents that
reintroducing stamp duty may halt a fragile recovery in the housing market
when the concession ends in August.
Industry leaders have been lobbying the government to try to get the
concession on properties priced between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 250,000
extended. The concession was introduced at the end of last year to encourage
the housing market.
Some Tory backbenchers have said that the government would find it difficult
to re-impose the duty unless the housing market was showing clear signs of
recovery. Treasury ministers have made clear that there is no question of
extending the holiday.

FT  21 MAY 92 / The Finance Bill: Ex-rebel is 'no sloppy interventionist' -
The former health minister who will guide the proposals through the Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury is regarded as the rightwing redoubt of Mr John Major's
government. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is as dry on economic policy
as any member of the cabinet. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, is
as close as anything the Thatcherite wing of the party has to an
heir-apparent.
But every rule has its exception. In the case of the Treasury it is Mr
Stephen Dorrell.
The financial secretary, charged over the next few weeks with piloting the
Finance Bill through the Commons, is now firmly established among the rising
stars in the middle ranks of Mr Major's administration.
The responsibilities of the third-ranking member of the Treasury team
include the detailed tax work involved in Budget-making along with a brief
to give substance to Mr Major's pledge to create a nation of savers and
share owners. He is also the minister directly responsible for
privatisation, competition and de-regulation.
More immediately, Mr Dorrell's oversight of the Civil Service means that he
will have to grapple with what is shaping up as a bitter clash over pay with
the Whitehall unions.
His boyish looks belie a grasp of economics as well as politics that have
allowed the 'wringing wet' rebel of the early 1980s to become the Treasury
minister of the 1990s. If he proves his mettle over the next two or three
years, the reward should be a place on the shortlist for the next batch of
entrants to Mr Major's cabinet.
It is quite a turnround for the 40-year-old MP for Loughborough, the
youngest of the Tory arrivals at Westminster in 1979. He spent most of the
first half of the 1980s rebelling against his government's economic
strategy. He was once driven by Mrs Thatcher's faith in monetarism to
describe his party as 'the better of two evils'.
When Mrs Thatcher appointed him to the whips office in 1987, colleagues at
Westminster saw it as an inexplicable act of forgiveness by the prime
minister.
Mr Dorrell, long an acolyte of Mr Peter Walker, is refreshingly unfussed
about a past that embraced public opposition to Treasury cuts in
unemployment benefit and repeated defiance of Mrs Thatcher's opposition to
the European exchange rate mechanism.
In the present government the latter view - which in 1986 prompted a public
rebuke from Mrs Thatcher - has served to strengthen the relationship he
forged with Mr Major during his spell as the whip responsible for Treasury
affairs.
Like most attached to the One-Nation strand of Toryism, the financial
secretary's thoughts on economic policy have moved on: 'We all change, don't
we, as we respond to new influences. So, yes, they (his opinions) have
changed'.
Not all. He is still firmly wedded to the concept of a welfare state that is
more than a basic safety-net for the very poorest. 'I'm personally totally
committed to the principle, for example, that health and education are
services that we should seek to provide not as a safety net but as a
universal service . . . and they don't come free.'
As the former health minister who spent much of the past two years defending
the NHS reforms, though, he is convinced that those services cannot be
immune from the disciplines of the private sector.
'What we need to be doing is constantly testing which (public services) have
to remain in the public sector and ensure that the efficiency of those which
do remain there is constantly tested.' An official who worked with him
attests that he is 'no sloppy interventionist'.
A large shareholder in and former manager of his family's textile business,
Mr Dorrell insists that he has always been committed to low direct taxation
to sharpen the incentives that drive wealth creation.
He insists that there is no contradiction between the government's pledge
for better public services and his responsibilities as financial secre-tary
to find new ways of reducing the tax burden.
He displays little of the evangelical zeal of those in the party - including
Mr Portillo - who believe that a renewed drive to cut income tax must be
given priority over virtually all else.
Pressed on the right balance between public spending and taxation, Mr
Dorrell retreats to the pragmatic response that there is no 'final state of
knowledge' on where the line should be drawn.
He comments: 'Life isn't like that'.
Closer to home, Mr Dorrell is cautious about how the government will live up
to its promise to entrench the habit of saving among the less affluent as
well as the wealthy.
This year's finance bill is unspectacular in polit-ical terms, the
left-overs
Mr Dorrell's Treasury officials can be expected to explain that, even with
the next budget still nine months off, it is not quite as easy as it looks
to manipulate the tax system to turn us into a nation of savers.
For now, he is reluctant to pre-empt anything that Mr Lamont might have in
mind on the tax front. He is apparently unsure how to persuade a sceptical
City to support the government's efforts to provide new incentives for
individual shareholders.
That should not prove too much of a handicap to a man who is as astute a
politician as he is hard-working as a minister. It does no harm these days
to be seen as the young face of Majorism.

FT  21 MAY 92 / The Finance Bill: Capital gains to company cars: the bill in
detail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday set out the policies and effects of the 69 clauses
and 17 schedules of the Finance Bill.
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE
Abolition of fiscal frontiers: Clause 1 and Schedule 1 make provision for
Customs to fix the point at which the requirement to pay excise duty takes
effect.
Clause 2 makes provision for Customs to repay excise duty where the
commissioners are satisfied that goods chargeable with duty have not been,
and will not be, consumed in the UK.
Clause 3 and Schedule 2 are designed to protect the revenue derived from
excise duties, for example ensuring that duty is payable when goods leave a
warehouse and creating an offence of taking preparatory steps with a view to
evasion of duty.
Clause 4 limits Customs enforcement powers in relation to people or goods
entering or leaving the UK, so as not to prevent, restrict or delay their
movements between member states.
Clause 5 enables Customs to exercise powers in relation to transfer
passengers travelling by air when they reach their eventual UK destination.
Other provisions: Clause 6 abolishes excise duty on matches and mechanical
lighters.
Clause 7 makes provision to exempt members' clubs and similar societies from
liability to bingo duty.
Clause 8 modifies arrangements for determining the recommended retail price
on which the ad valorem element of cigarette duty is based.
Clause 9 rectifies minor omissions in regulations that will, after
introduction of the beer end-product duty system, make beer duty a
preferential debt.
Clause 11 sets rates of vehicle excise duty for classes of heavy goods
vehicle which will be able to operate in the UK from January 1.
Clause 12 repeals provisions relating to exemptions from vehicle excise duty
for disabled people.
Clause 13 makes minor changes to arrangements for special vehicle
registration marks.
VALUE ADDED TAX
Clause 14 and Schedule 3 introduce changes to VAT law necessary for
completion of the single market. Clause 15 ensures that matches remain
chargeable with VAT at the standard rate when excise duty on matches is
abolished.
CAR TAX
Clause 16 and Schedule 4 amend the Car Tax Act 1983 in preparation for
completion of the single market.
INCOME TAX, CORPORATION TAX, AND CAPITAL
GAINS TAX
Lower rate: Clause 17 makes technical consequential changes following the
introduction of the 20p lower rate of income tax.
Married couples allowance: Clause 18 and Schedule 5 set out arrangements for
couples to agree to allocate the allowance to the wife or to share it or for
the wife to opt for it to be split equally, with effect from April 6 1993.
Corporation tax charge and rate: Clause 19 sets the main rate of corporation
tax for the financial year 1992 at 33 per cent.
Clause 20 sets the small companies' rate at 25 per cent. It also sets at one
50th the fraction used for calculating marginal relief for companies whose
profits are in a band above the profits limit for the small companies rate.
That will be equivalent to a marginal rate within the marginal relief band
of 35 per cent.
Capital gains tax: Clause 21 provides that, where appropriate, a rate
equivalent to the lower rate of income tax will apply in charging an
individual's gains to capital gains tax.
Groups etc: Clause 22 and Schedule 6 amend the definition of share
arrangements for group relief and other tax purposes. It treats options to
buy and sell shares, in some circumstances, as if they had been exercised.
Clause 23 makes minor changes to ensure that a company leaving a group
cannot manipulate the provisions to avoid paying capital gains tax on
certain assets previously transferred to it by other members of the group.
Charities etc: Clause 24 reduces from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 the minimum
limit for charitable donations qualifying for tax relief under the Gift Aid
scheme.
Clause 25 relaxes the rules for tax relief for certain charitable covenants.
Clause 26 extends the power for the Inland Revenue to inspect charities'
records of Gift Aid donations.
Interest, dividends and distributions: Clause 27 changes rules for including
interest paid to people who are not ordinarily resident from returns to the
Inland Revenue. Henceforth, separate declarations of non-ordinarily resident
status will not be needed.
Clause 26 is required to implement the EC parent/ subsidiary directive,
which eliminates the double taxation of dividends and abolishes withholding
taxes on them when they are paid to a parent company in another member
state. The clause excludes from the charge on both paying and collecting
agents' dividends paid by a company that is not resident in the UK to a
company that is resident. Exclusion is subject to the latter company's
controlling, either directly or indirectly, not less than 10 per cent of the
voting power in the former company.
Clause 29 amends requirements for companies providing vouchers for dividend
payments, so that the shareholder will receive a voucher in all
circumstances, including electronic transfer.
Securities and deposits: Clause 30 and Schedule 7 take securities out of the
charge on deep gain securities where they may deliver a deep gain only by
operation of their event of default or event risk clauses.
Clause 31 and Schedule 8 prepare for 'dematerialised' certificates of
deposit under new arrangements that will eliminate in most cases the
creation of paper certificates.
Clauses 32, 33, 38 to 44 and 54 implement the EC mergers directive, which
defers certain capital-gains charges that might otherwise arise on a
cross-border reorganisation. Clause 32 brings capital gains provisions
concerning share exchanges fully into conformity with the requirements of
the directive.
Employee shares: Clause 33 removes the tax charge that can arise on the
trustees of an Employee Share Ownership Trust as a result of a
share-for-share exchange.
Clause 34 removes the charge to tax special benefits received by employee
shareholders where benefits are available to at least 90 per cent of
shareholders and a majority of shares are held by people who are not
employees.
Business expansion scheme: Clause 35 ends relief under the BES for shares in
unquoted trading companies after the end of 1993.
Clause 36 makes it easier for BES companies that raise money for private
rented housing to have a property management subsidiary. Clause 37 makes it
easier for them to operate mortgage rescue schemes.
Transfers of trade: Clause 38 defers capital gains charges where a company
resident in one member state transfers all or part of UK trading operations
to a company resident in another member state in exchange for securities
issued by the transferee company.
Clauses 39 and 44 permit the UK to tax gains accruing where a UK resident
company transfers a branch or agency situated in another member state to a
company resident in a third member state. Relief will be given for any tax
that, but for the EC Mergers Directive, would have been payable in the
member state where the branch or agency is situated.
Clause 40 introduces amendments to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992
consequential upon Clauses 38 and 39. Clause 41 replicates the relief
available under Clause 38. Clause 42 replicates the relief available under
Clause 39. Clause 43 is consequent upon Clauses 41 and 42.
Double taxation relief: Clause 44 in relation to Clauses 39 and 42, provides
for double taxation relief on the basis of the tax that would, but for the
Mergers Directive, have been payable in the member state where the branch or
agency is situated.
Clause 45 contains provisions necessary to implement the EC Arbitration
Convention, which sets up a mechanism for resolving transfer pricing
disputes within the Community.
Miscellaneous: Clause 46 introduces lower car fuel scale charges to tax the
benefit of free diesel fuel provided by employers for employees' private use
in company cars.
Clause 47 brings the activity of transporting oil or gas directly abroad
from an offshore field within the corporation tax 'ring fence', so that the
relevant costs may offset companies' UK oil production profits.
Clause 48 and Schedule 9 extend to a friendly society incorporated under the
Friendly Societies Act 1992 tax exemptions currently available to
unincorporated societies registered under the 1974 Friendly Societies Act.
Clause 49 changes, in certain circumstances, the rules for charging rent to
income and corporation tax in order to prevent manipulation of those rules
to secure a tax deferment. From March 10, where rent is payable in arrears -
directly or indirectly - between connected persons, the recipient will be
chargeable to tax in a particular chargeable period on the rent that has
accrued in that period, and not as at present on the rent the recipient was
entitled to receive in that period.
Clause 50 modifies, from a date to be appointed, the tax treatment of
maintenance payments to take account of the Child Support Agency.
Clause 51 and Schedule 10 alter the arrangements for accounting for tax
deducted by paying and collecting agents (mainly banks end stockbrokers)
from foreign dividends and interest. From October 1 1992 the tax is to be
paid to the Inland Revenue within 14 days of the end of the month in which
it is deducted. The schedule also abolishes the statutory remuneration
agents receive from the Inland Revenue.
Clause 52 confirms rates of tax charged on building societies, banks and
other deposit takers under the former composite rate tax arrangements for
the years 1986-87 to 1989-90.
Clause 53 and schedule 11 make tax changes affecting insolvent companies in
compulsory liquidation that were carrying on a deposit-taking business.
Losses brought forward and certain expenses can be offset against income
arising from the trade after it has ceased.
CAPITAL ALLOWANCES
Clause 54 defers capital allowance balancing charges and other balancing
adjustments where Clauses 39 and 41 apply.
Clause 55 provides for relief for capital expenditure on computer software.
Clause 56 and Schedule 12 amend capital allowances legislation applying to
expenditure on buildings constructed in enterprise zones. The Schedule
remedies a defect in existing legislation that denies enterprise zone
allowances to a purchaser of an unused building who buys it after expiry of
the 10-year life of the zone. It also provides that allowances will be
available on buildings sold within two years of being brought into use. It
restricts enterprise zone allowances to expenditure incurred within 10 years
of the expiry of the zone.
Clause 57 increases from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 the limit on the cost
of business cars above which capital allowances and tax relief for lease
rentals are restricted.
Inheritance tax: Clause 58 increases the starting point for inheritance tax
to Pounds 150,000.
Clause 59 and Schedule 13 make changes to the rates of relief from
inheritance tax for certain business assets and farmland - the higher rate
from 50 per cent to 100 per cent, the lower rate from 30 per cent to 50 per
cent. Shares dealt on the Unlisted Securities Market are treated as unquoted
for the purpose of the relief.
Petroleum revenue tax: Clause 60 and Schedule 14 provide petroleum revenue
tax relief for transporting oil or gas directly abroad from an offshore
field and make various consequential changes to the PRT rules.
General and special commissioners: Clause 61 allows the lord chancellor to
change the names of tribunals that hear tax appeals.
Clause 62 and Schedule 15 allow the lord chancellor to introduce procedural
rules for hearing tax appeals. Those are planned to came into effect in
April 1993. They will include powers for the special commissioners to award
costs where either party has acted unreasonably, and to publish selected
decisions.
Miscellaneous: Clause 63 and Schedule 16 provide for continuity of tax
treatment of Northern Ireland Electricity. on pre-privatisation and
reorganisation into successor companies.
Clause 64 removes the double charge to gas levy and PRT that would otherwise
arise when a PRT-exempt contract for sale of North Sea gas ends at a fixed
date predetermined in the contract.
Clause 65 amends Section 8 of the Treasury Bills Act 1977 to remove the
requirement that Treasury bills be countersigned by the comptroller and
auditor-general, bringing them into line with other government debt
instruments.
Clause 66 removes the requirement to publish National Loans Fund and Public
Works Loan Board interest rates in London and Edinburgh Gazette each time
they are changed.

FT  21 MAY 92 / CBI calls for series of interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called on the government to
pursue small but regular reductions in interest rates. It suggested they
might soon be capable of falling below those of Germany.
The CBI said further cuts in the cost of money would be possible without
prejudicing the UK's position in the exchange rate mechanism if Britain's
improved performance on inflation continued.
The organisation emphasised the need for caution but said interest rates
could be cut in the short term by as little as a quarter of 1 percentage
point to 'test the water' in foreign exchange markets.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic and finance policy committee,
told the organisation's governing council that continued cuts in interest
rates were the most important step towards encouraging the economic recovery
that appeared likely in the rest of the year.
Sir David said the CBI wanted to see sterling join the narrow bands of the
ERM, but there was no immediate pressure to do so, given the progress made
in cutting interest rates and the prospective improvement in UK
competitiveness in Europe.
Sir David emphasised that headline inflation in the UK was already below
that of Germany, where it was on a rising trend.
He stressed that a change of perception would be needed to establish the
view that UK interest rates could be below those of Germany. There was, he
added, some evidence that that was already taking place, but it could be
easily jeopardised by 'too hasty an approach to interest rate reductions'.
Sir Michael Angus, who retired as chairman of Unilever two weeks ago, was
yesterday elected president of the CBI for the next two years, succeeding
Sir Brian Corby.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Teacher vacancies well down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of teacher vacancies in England is sharply down on last year
according to government figures released yesterday.
The overall vacancy rate has fallen by nearly two thirds since last year -
from 1.5 per cent of all posts to 0.6 per cent - taking the number of
unfilled posts to 1,955. Overall teacher numbers are slightly up at 394,000.
The altered trend is particularly marked in London, where the vacancy rate
has fallen to 1 per cent, its lowest since 1988 - and the lowest for
secondary schools since 1984.
Vacancies in science subjects fell by two thirds, but the decline in other
shortage subjects was below par. Maths vacancies were down by half, and
unfilled posts in modern languages declined by only a third.
High levels of graduate unemployment account partly for the renewed
attraction of teaching, but substantial real pay increases in the past two
years, and promotion and bursary schemes to attract students in shortage
subjects, may also have made an impact.
Lady Blatch, schools minister, said: 'Any lingering claims that the national
curriculum cannot be delivered in full because of teacher shortages should
now fade away.'

FT  21 MAY 92 / 'Signs of life' in housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE has been a widespread increase in confidence among potential house
buyers and sellers since the general election, according to a survey of
almost 100 English and Welsh estate agents, published today.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the survey,
said the number of people making inquiries about properties for sale has
risen since polling day. 'The clearest signs of recovery are coming from
East Anglia, where increased sales are reported, particularly in Norwich and
Peterborough,' it said.
'The London housing market, worst hit by the property slump, also shows
greater signs of life, with more people house hunting and a detectable rise
in optimism. After several false starts, a recovery in the housing market is
at last within sight.'
The institution warned that it would take a long time before house sales
returned to normal levels.
The survey said 30 per cent of agents reported price falls in the three
months to the end of April, compared with 68 per cent who said prices had
remained static. Most agents expect prices to lag, even if sales increase
this year.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Rare fine art finds healthy market: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S fine art markets are in overdrive this week, with important
sales in London, New York, Geneva and Madrid. The results have been
generally encouraging, with collectors competing for rare and exceptional
works of art.
At Christie's in London yesterday, The Camerarius Florilegium, an
exceptionally rare manuscript, sold for Pounds 638,000 - comfortably above
its high estimate of Pounds 500,000.
The manuscript depicts 473 ornamental plants and 194 leaves that were in the
garden of the German botanist Joachim Camerarius in the late 16th century.
It is the only known surviving record of the contents of a garden of this
period. The buyer was the Oxford dealer Rosenthal, bidding on behalf of a
continental European - presumably German - institution.
In New York, Christie's sold the late Mr Bill McCarty-Cooper's collection of
tribal art. Mr McCarty-Cooper had been adopted at the age of 36 by Mr
Douglas Cooper, who possessed one of the finest collections of 20th century
French art. Under his influence, Mr McCarty-Cooper assembled an excellent
collection of tribal art, which raised Dollars 3.27m (Pounds 1.8m) on
Tuesday, with 11 per cent unsold.
A Fang male reliquary figure, 19 3/4 in high, carved about a century ago in
what is now Gabon in Equatorial Africa, sold for Dollars 550,000, at the
bottom of its estimate. A rarer Fang female reliquary figure beat its target
at Dollars 440,000.
Pacific art was the most sought-after sector and a Fijian headrest,
estimated at up to Dollars 20,000, sold for Dollars 77,000.
Sotheby's noticed Colombian bidders for the first time at its auction of
Latin American art in New York. This has been a strong market for the past
two years, but on Tuesday some of the leading artists, including Botero,
Matta and Lam, were out of favour.
The Mexican Diego Rivera remains popular, though, and his Mujer con
Alcatraces, depicting a peasant clutching a vast bunch of lilies, sold for
Dollars 2.8m (Pounds 1.5m), the second-highest auction price paid for
Rivera, indeed for any Latin American painting. The sale totalled Dollars
7.5m (Pounds 4.1m) but was 34 per cent unsold.
Edmund Peel in Madrid had mixed success with his auction of Spanish Old
Masters. A Goya portrait was unsold at Pounds 1.15m - although there were
hopes of a deal after the auction - but a still life of flowers by Juan de
Arellano made a record Pounds 673,000.
A Gainsborough drawing owned by the late Lord Clark is to be sold at
Christie's on July 14. A Peasant Family Going to Market is estimated at up
to Pounds 400,000, but may approach the record Pounds 616,000, which
Christie's set for a Gainsborough drawing last year.

FT  21 MAY 92 / BNFL to cut further 550 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) is to shed at least 550 jobs at its Capenhurst
uranium enrichment plant, in north-west England, because of the collapse of
the world market since the cold war ended.
The job losses are in addition to 400 last year, and a further 500 jobs are
under threat because of technological improvements.
BNFL also announced plans to sell enriched uranium worldwide through a new
joint venture with counterparts in the Netherlands and Germany.
Enriched uranium has been treated to increase the proportion of uranium-235,
the isotope that sustains chain reactions. BNFL produces U-235 by turning
uranium into a gas, then centrifuging out the heavier atoms of the unwanted
U-238 isotope.
Enriched uranium is used in nuclear power station reactor rods and for
military purposes. The end of the cold war has cut military requirements and
opened the world market for reactor rods to Russian producers with low
labour costs.
BNFL said yesterday: 'There is now worldwide oversupply and the competition
is becoming cut-throat.' BNFL, a public limited company with the government
as its sole shareholder, said it would have lost Pounds 6m in the current
year had it tried to carry on.
It is negotiating to convert Urenco, its partnership with Ultra-Centrifuge
Nederland, of Almelo, and Uran-Isotopentrennungs Gesellschaft, of Julich,
Germany, into a company.
Urenco was formed in 1971 after the British, Netherlands and West German
governments agreed to co-operate on commercial exploitation of the gas
centrifuge process. Ownership of the new venture will be split equally.
Capenhurst's military and civil uranium enrichment operations are being
split, with 600 staff being temporarily 'parked' in a new subsidiary until
they can be transferred to the European company.
The other 550 staff will stay with BNFL to dismantle and decommission
Capenhurst's old diffusion plant and carry on making enriched uranium for
the Ministry of Defence until the contract to do so expires next year.
Fewer than 100 people are likely to be needed at Capenhurst in five years,
when Urenco should have developed new, labour-saving technology.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Bank seeks tougher standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is pressing for a change in international banking
regulations to ban banks from branching outside their home countries if they
fail to meet certain standards.
The Bank's tough stance in talks with other regulators on the Basle
Committee for Banking Supervision emerged yesterday when the Bank published
its annual report and a separate report of its supervisory activities.
It is understood that Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's representative on the Basle
committee, hopes that by the end of the year bank supervisors from the big
industrial countries will have agreed to radical changes in the 1983 Basle
Concordat, which lays down a regulatory framework. Mr Quinn is believed to
support a proposal that bank supervisors should ban bank branches from their
countries if the branches' owner fails to meet standards laid down in the
concordat.
In the wake of last year's closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, a change in the concordat is likely to be that international
banks should submit to being regulated worldwide by at least one supervisory
authority. A second change to the concordat would be that banks must meet
the international capital adequacy standard, the Basle ratio, intended to
ensure that banks are robust enough to withstand shocks.
The Bank's reports contain much information on its work and views.
Highlights include:
The Bank criticises the 'lending criteria' observed in the 1980s. UK banks
expanded their lending portfolios very rapidly in that period and have
recently suffered big losses on those loans.
The Bank says it has encouraged UK banks to review their procedures for
making loans. However, it is adamant that in a market environment it would
have been inappropriate to prevent the banks from making such mistakes. It
discloses that it became concerned last year that small banks might run into
serious difficulties. Many small banks' access to liquid funds became
severely reduced because local authorities, public-sector corporations and
other professional investors transferred their deposits to bigger banks.
They made the transfers because of fears that small banks might fail as a
result of big losses on loans. Their concerns became even greater after the
closure of BCCI.
The Bank of England kept a very close watch on the small banks in this
period and believes they handled the crisis prudently. A few decided to wind
down their business in an orderly way and all were urged by the Bank to
explore whether they could reduce dependence on volatile sources of
deposits.
The Bank made an operating profit of Pounds 166m in the year to February 29
1992, 3 per cent up on the previous year. From that it paid the UK Treasury
Pounds 67.6m, down from Pounds 81.5m.
The number of authorised banking institutions operating in London fell from
530 to 518. The Bank of England revoked the banking licence of only one
institution, BCCI. The fall in authorisations was the result in part of
mergers of banks and reorganisations of international banking groups.
The Bank reiterates its view that the banks do not operate a cartel in the
small-business loan market. Nevertheless, it is concerned that
small-business customers may find it difficult to shop around for a new bank
because of technical difficulties in terminating an existing bank
relationship.
However, the Bank believes that competition in the small-business loan
market has increased greatly in the past decade, with the entry into the
market of TSB Group and foreign banks and the growth of the Scottish
clearing banks.
It has given those views to the Office of Fair Trading, which is deciding
whether Lloyds Bank's proposed bid for Midland Bank should be referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The Bank gives aggregated figures for the trading results of the big UK
banks - Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds, Midland, Standard Chartered,
Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and TSB Group. They show that the
banks collectively made record provisions to cover losses on loans of Pounds
6.8bn, up from Pounds 4.1bn in 1990.
The running costs of the banks as a percentage of total income fell, ending
a trend which began in 1985.
USE of the Pounds 20 note is increasing rapidly, according to the Bank of
England's annual report.  In the past year, 489m Pounds 20 notes were
issued, compared with 252m the previous year. The Pounds 10 note remains the
most commonly issued denomination, with Pounds 5.74bn worth of them in
circulation, compared with Pounds 5.29bn for the Pounds 20 note.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Retail sales in April show modest rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET sales rose modestly in April, suggesting that consumers returned
to the shops after the election - but not in large numbers.
The volume of retail sales in April grew by 0.8 per cent compared with
March. City analysts had been looking for more robust figures after a late
Easter and widespread claims of a spending surge after the election.
Although April's figure was slightly disappointing, it followed a revised 1
per cent fall in sales recorded in March.
The three-monthly trend continued to show volumes of sales still declining.
In the three months to April, retail sales fell by 0.3 per cent compared
with the previous three months. Compared with a year ago, the volume of
sales fell by 0.5 per cent.
Evidence that consumers are feeling more confident is gradually gathering
strength. Earlier this week, the Confederation of British Industry reported
the highest retail sales for two years in its quarterly survey of the
distributive trades industry.
The Treasury said the April figure was mainly a rebound from the fall in
March, and more evidence was needed to assess the exact state of consumer
demand in the post-election period.
According to yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office, sales
by food retailers rose 0.2 per cent in the three months to April and those
by mixed retailers 0.1 per cent. Sales by non-food retailers fell 0.6 per
cent.
In the non-food sector, however, sales of household goods rose 2 per cent in
the latest three months and were up 1 per cent compared with the same period
a year before.
Clothing and footwear sales fell 3 per cent in the latest three months
compared with the three months to January.
In value terms, sales in the four-week April period totalled a
non-seasonally adjusted Pounds 10.5bn, which was 4 per cent higher than a
year earlier.
Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said yesterday's
figures reinforced his view that consumer demand would be exceedingly slow
to revive.
Yesterday's figures were the first since measures designed to improve the
accuracy of economic statistics were introduced by the CSO. Previously,
3,500 retailers supplied data on a voluntary basis, but 5,000 are now
obliged to respond.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Lamont entered BCCI row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, was forced to intervene in a dispute
relating to the defunct Bank for Credit and Commerce International between
members of the Bank of England's board of banking supervision, it was
disclosed yesterday, Robert Peston writes.
The lay members of the board were concerned that Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
the Bank's governor, was likely to breach banking secrecy standards when
being interviewed last year about the collapse of BCCI by the Commons
Treasury and Civil Service Committee.
After widespread criticism, Mr Leigh-Pemberton wanted to give a detailed
account of the Bank's role to the committee.
The board's lay members felt that Mr Leigh-Pemberton was proposing to
disclose more than was allowable under the Banking Act.
The board's function is to review all aspects of the Bank's supervisory work
under the act. The chancellor was called to adjudicate on the issue. In the
event, he backed Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who on July 26 submitted to questioning
by the Commons committee.
It was the first time in the board's four-year existence that the chancellor
had been called to settle such a dispute.
The incident is alluded to in an annexe to the Bank of England's Banking Act
report - in which every year it discusses its role as a supervisor - which
was published yesterday.
In the Bank's annual report, also published yesterday, Mr Leigh Pemberton
said he believed the Bank's decision not to close BCCI till last year - and
all its other actions over the years as supervisor of UK operations - were
'correct at the time they were taken'.
The annual statement of the Deposit Protection Board, which is linked to the
Bank of England and provides insurance against possible losses to holders of
bank deposits, was also released.
The board said it had increased its borrowing powers to Pounds 125m in order
to meet claims for compensation from depositors at BCCI's UK offshoot.
The Bank expects the board to have to pay out no more than Pounds 95m to
BCCI depositors.

THE SIZE of the satellite television market in the UK has been significantly
overstated, according to a report.
GFK Home Audit, a market-research company, says 1.6m homes had satellite
television by the end of last year. That figure compares with the 1.8m
estimate by Barb, which produces the official viewing figures, and a figure
of 2.1m quoted by Continental Research, a research company regularly quoted
by the Financial Times and British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite
television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a

The GFK figure was based on interviews with 10,000 people last June and
updated with data from GFK Lek-Trak, which monitors more than 8,000
electrical retailers.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Tory MP Names attack Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Tory back-benchers called yesterday for criminal proceedings 'if
and where necessary' against any malpractice at the Lloyd's insurance
market, David Owen and Richard Lapper write.
The four MPs, three of whom are Names at Lloyd's, included Mr Paul Marland,
MP for Gloucestershire West. They met Mr Neil Hamilton, a junior trade and
industry minister, and urged independent regulation of Lloyd's. They also
argued that the authorities at the market were failing to honour the Lloyd's
Act because they were not looking after the interests of outside Names.
Names are the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the market.
The trade and industry department described Mr Hamilton's meeting with MPs
and a subsequent meeting with Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, as
'essentially a listening exercise'.
The MPs left Mr Hamilton with detailed questions about Lloyd's, and
suggested that he put them to Mr Coleridge. Their questions covered Lloyd's
brokerage charges and costs and the solvency of the market. They asked if
the Lloyd's central fund was still adequate to cover all Lloyd's cashflow
difficulties in the light of the forthcoming judicial review (being pursued
by some Names).
Mr Marland yesterday tabled a Commons early day motion alleging that
professionals at Lloyd's had 'favoured themselves and their close relations'
as well as other Lloyd's professionals by 'placing their own business on
highly profitable and safe syndicates ahead of outside Names'.
The motion mentions five leading professionals and notes that none is a
member of any of the catastrophe reinsurance syndicates managed by such
agencies as Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Devonshire and Rose Thompson Young. It
says, however, that some of the five placed external Names on those
syndicates. The five are Mr Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's and of the Sturge
agency; Mr JM Donner, chairman of Donner Underwriting; Sir Peter Miller,
chairman of Thomas R. Miller; Mr JP Tilling, chairman of Gravett and
Tilling; and Mr Murray Lawrence, chairman of Murray Lawrence Members'
Agency.
SG Warburg, the merchant bank, confirmed yesterday that it had been
appointed by Lloyd's to advise on 'narrow technical issues' arising from
work under way on a plan to help Names hardest hit by recent losses.
Warburg said yesterday that it was not playing a broad advisory role but
would be assisting on an ad hoc basis.
Lloyd's appointed the bank earlier this month. Mr Alan Lord, Lloyd's chief
executive, announced at the end of April that it was examining the
possibility of providing financial assistance to Names facing severe
underwriting losses.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Housing may be cut from RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING costs may disappear from the retail prices index if Britain is to
bring its measure of inflation more closely into harmony with other European
Community countries.
Half the EC's member states make no allowance for housing costs in their
calculations of the main inflation rate - only the UK and Ireland include
mortgage interest payments.
Other countries, such as Germany, measure home-owning housing costs with an
'imputed rent' system - the cost is treated as if the properties had been
rented.
That approach was used in Britain until 1975 but dropped because the private
rented sector was too small and unrepresentative a market on which to base
the housing costs of most of the population.
At the International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 1987, the
International Labour Organisation recommended that countries should provide
an all-items index that excludes shelter in order to ease international
comparisons.
The ILO said that although the exclusion of shelter from the all-items index
would not eliminate all the differences encountered when making such
comparisons, it would make rates of price change more comparable across
countries.
The recommendation stemmed partly from concerns about the different
methodologies used to calculate housing costs, but another concern was that
housing markets were distinctive to different countries. Whether because of
rental controls or tax incentives, markets did not behave in an identical
manner.
Although Eurostat, the EC's statistical office, has looked at the issue of
the harmonisation of inflation measures across the EC, little has yet been
heard of any definite proposals.
A report published by Eurostat in 1989 suggested that imputed rents could be
used as the yardstick for measuring owner-occupiers' housing costs.
The Confederation of British Industry, which criticises the inclusion of
mortgage interest payments in the calculation of the RPI, says that would
not be difficult to implement in the UK, since imputed rents are already
used in the UK's national accounts for measuring owner-occupiers' housing
costs.

FT  21 MAY 92 / A pervasive influence on the economy: The impact of the
retail prices index and the way in which it is calculated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETAIL Prices Index has become a pervasive influence in many aspects of
the British economy.
That is in spite of the existence of various other measures of inflation -
such as the GDP deflator, the producer price index for manufactured goods
and the pensioner price index - which may have theoretical advantages or be
more suited to particular purposes.
The RPI has become the dominant measure because it is rapidly available (by
about the middle of the next month), is adjusted in scope to reflect
changing spending patterns and is protected from undue political
interference by an advisory committee that includes independent members.
The RPI has an unrivalled effect on the level of pay increases - the average
level of pay rises is invariably close to the latest inflation rate.
Many wage bargainers, particularly among trade unions, would resist
reforming the RPI, but they would probably have little option but to
continue to use it as the main yardstick in negotiations.
Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said
yesterday: 'Mortgage rates are part of the cost of living. If costs go up
and are not reflected in the RPI then that would produce a horse laugh.'
But Mr Alastair Hatchett, of the Incomes Data Services pay research group,
believes negotiators would use the official RPI, however it was calculated.
Mr Peter Ball, deputy director-general of the Engineering Employers
Federation, said: 'There would be a lot of hot air spoken if the formula
changed but eventually people would follow it.'
A change in the RPI calculation would present difficulties for a sizeable
minority of companies that have negotiated long-term pay deals linked to
inflation. Those are far less popular than they were in the late 1980s, but
most car manufacturers, including Ford and Vauxhall, still favour two-year
deals, as do British Airways and the Civil Aviation Authority.
If the method of calculation were to change, there might be argument in some
companies over what the second-year rise should be.
Mr Hatchett said clauses laying down that inflation would be as calculated
at the time of the agreement were likely to grow in popularity, but would be
based on the assumption that the RPI as currently constituted would still be
available - which was by no means certain.
A potentially sensitive area is the impact of RPI changes on social security
benefits, including state pensions, unemployment benefit, income support and
housing benefit, which are upgraded annually according to the RPI.
Any suggestion that the government was trying to suppress statistical
evidence of rises in living costs would create a political storm. But in
some respects an index excluding mortgage interest would be a more suitable
determinant of the level of social security benefits.
Regulation of utility prices has also become an important area for the
application of the RPI. It forms the benchmark for regulating BT's main
prices, for example.
The price formulae are being reviewed by Oftel, the telecommunications
regulatory body, but it is almost certain that the RPI will continue as the
benchmark. Oftel has resisted switching to another index, arguing that RPI
is the only inflation measure widely understood.
BT and Oftel had no comment yesterday on the merits of excluding mortgage
interest payments from the RPI. It is thought, though, that in the long run
such a change would have little effect on the company's finances.
Ofgas, the industry regulator that devised the formula controlling British
Gas's price rises to domestic customers, said it was unlikely to revise the
formula if the RPI figure was calculated differently.
The RPI similarly plays a central role in the complex formula used for water
charges. The Office of Water Services said it was assumed that water
companies would have to take account of any new method of calculating the
RPI before deciding charges.
Investments such as index-linked gilts depend on the RPI for their value.
Index-linked gilts showed modest gains in prices yesterday, as investors
reacted to the possibility of the proposed change - both the repayment value
and the interest on the gilts are linked to changes in the RPI.
Prospectuses for index-linked issues have a clause saying that, in the event
of a 'fundamental change' in the calculation of the RPI which would have a
'materially detrimental effect' on stockholders, the stock might have to be
redeemed.
Since the index-linked issues currently trade at a discount to their
inflation-adjusted value, that would be expensive for the government.
According to the Bank of England there are about Pounds 19bn of index-linked
gilts in issue.
Since prices excluding mortgage costs are rising faster than the RPI, it
would be hard to argue that a change would be 'materially detrimental'.
National Savings said its index-linked savings certificates, which rise
according to the RPI, would simply adjust to reflect any change in the
index's constituents.
Indexation clauses also crop up in occupational pensions legislation.
Limited price indexation - inflation-proofing parallel with the RPI with a
ceiling of 5 per cent - applies to deferred pensions payable to workers who
leave a company before retirement age.
The same protection will one day be applicable to pensions in payment -
legislation is on the statute book but has not yet been implemented.
There is a pensioner price index that excludes housing and has consequently
been rising more rapidly than the RPI recently. This PPI is not applied to
pension benefit, although the changes might mean it would move more closely
in line with the RPI.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Threat to maternity-benefits plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VOTE by the European parliament to give women throughout the EC at least
14 weeks maternity leave at 80 per cent of pay is likely to be overturned by
European social affairs ministers next month, Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, indicated yesterday
The UK objects to the scale of the maternity benefits voted for by the
European parliament earlier this month. The government is prepared, however,
to accept reduced maternity payments equivalent to the level of sick pay.
In theory, the social affairs council of ministers may attempt to push
through the higher level of benefits on a qualified majority vote. To do so
might, however, jeopardise a compromise Mrs Shephard is offering on measures
to curb the working week.
The European Commission's working-time directive would mean a maximum
48-hour week - a ceiling unacceptable to the UK. Mrs Shephard says she would
now accept amendments enabling workers to choose to work more than 48 hours
if they want to. The issue is also due to be discussed by the social affairs
council next month.
On the maternity benefits proposals, Mrs Shephard said she had met Mr Jose
da Silva Peneda, president of the EC social affairs council, in London on
Tuesday. He had given his backing to the UK's position on the level of
benefits, she said.
Long negotiations on levels of maternity benefits were concluded at the end
of last year at the social affairs council. A delicate compromise of 14
weeks benefit at sick-pay levels was finally agreed, although the UK
abstained because it objected to the issue's being treated as a health and
safety matter and therefore subject to qualified majority voting. That
compromise has now been upset by the higher level of benefit voted for by
the European parliament.
Present UK maternity benefits provide for six weeks pay at 90 per cent of
earnings plus 12 weeks at sick pay rates of about Pounds 45 a week. However,
the only women to qualify for those full rates are those who have worked for
the same employer for at least two years by the 15th week before the birth.
The EC rules would cut the qualifying period to 12 months.

FT  21 MAY 92 / OFT condemns secrecy in credit decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDERS should be required to tell would-be borrowers why they have been
rejected, the Office of Fair Trading said yesterday.
It said it would consider whether legislation was needed if lenders could
not agree on a voluntary disclosure format. The OFT added in a comprehensive
report on the practice of credit scoring that it would consult the credit
industry on a format to let customers know why their requests for credit had
been refused.
'Should it prove impossible to implement this change by voluntary agreement,
the office will consider whether a legislative solution is appropriate,' the
OFT said.
Credit scoring systems allocate points to various characteristics of a
potential borrower. The characteristics, which include age, occupation and
residential status, are meant to have a correlation with an individual's
likelihood of repaying credit.
While bank and building society lenders usually inform applicants that they
have been refused credit on the basis of a previous adverse credit report,
they do not specify what the decision is based on.
The British Bankers' Association called the OFT's report 'a very balanced
contribution to the discussions'.
It said, however, that lenders were reluctant to tell those rejected for
credit on the basis of low credit scores the specific reasons for the
decision.
For one thing, it said, such information could assist a subsequent
fraudulent application. Also, a low score often reflects several factors and
those may be known only to the credit scorer, often an outside company.
Sir Gordon Borrie, OFT director-general of fair trading, said the confusion
and secrecy of the credit process was itself evidence of a difficulty.
'Of course, lenders have the right to decide whether or not to grant
credit,' he said. 'But that right does not justify secrecy in the
decision-making process beyond the need for lenders to protect themselves
from fraud.'
In its report, the OFT rejected the assertion that providing more
information would encourage fraud. It cited the US Equal Opportunity Credit
Act, which for years has allowed rejected credit applicants to learn the
basis of lenders' decisions, and said there was very little evidence that
those reports had led to fraud.
The US experience also suggested that it would be fairly easy to develop
software packages that will help lenders to inform credit applicants of the
reasons for their low credit score.
The OFT urged lenders to develop methods to detect incorrect information, to
offer applicants a simple explanation of how credit scoring works and to
give information about appeal procedures to those who have been rejected.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Nissan UK chiefs sent for trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO SENIOR executives of Nissan UK charged with multi-million-pound tax
evasion were yesterday sent to the Old Bailey for trial.
Mr Michael Hunt, 58, assistant managing director and deputy chairman of the
former importer-distributor of Nissan vehicles, and Mr Frank Shannon, also
58, the company's finance director, are alleged to have cheated the Inland
Revenue out of Pounds 170m.
It is alleged that the money found its way to them after false invoices were
filed for freight payments. Magistrates at Worthing, West Sussex, committed
the men for trial at the Central Criminal Court.
Mr Hunt, of Hove, East Sussex, and Mr Shannon, of Brighton, East Sussex,
were remanded on conditional bail until the trial.
Mr Hunt was granted bail on condition that he lives at his present address

FT  21 MAY 92 / TUC threatens to bar AEEU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Amalgamated Engin-eering and Electrical Union will be told today that it
will be unable to affiliate to the Trades Union Congress if it goes ahead
with a merger between its electrical section and the breakaway union Cabin
Crew 89.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, and Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, TUC
president, will tell AEEU leaders that affiliated unions should not
associate with breakaway unions. Cabin Crew 89 was formed three years ago by
5,000 former members of the TGWU general workers' union. Mr Bill Morris,
TGWU general secretary, has said that the TGWU will leave the TUC if the
merger between Cabin Crew and the EETPU electrical section of the AEEU goes
ahead.
Talks between the EETPU and Cabin Crew began before the electricians merged
with the AEU engineering workers at the start of this month. Although most
AEU executive members would be against a Cabin Crew merger, Mr Paul
Gallagher, EETPU general secretary, said last week that he would not allow
other unions to run AEEU affairs.
The talks were already likely to be tortuous before the Cabin Crew issue
emerged. Since the EETPU was expelled from the TUC in 1988, it has merged
with several breakaways from unions, most of which want their former members
back.
Moreover, leaders of both the AEU and the EETPU had questioned the value of
TUC affiliation. AEEU leaders have agreed not to go ahead with the Cabin
Crew merger while TUC discussions continue. However, a merger is not
possible until later in the year because Cabin Crew will have to ballot its
members about the move.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, who will attend today's talks, said
yesterday he was anxious to create a climate that would enable the EETPU to
rejoin the TUC.
The leadership of the Balpa airline pilots' union is to be contested between
Mr Chris Darke, who has been recommended for the general secretary's job by
the union's executive, and Mr David Lebrecht, an assistant general
secretary.

<TEXT>
MRS GILLIAN SHEPHARD, the employment secretary, yesterday announced the
creation of a group to advise her on women's issues. Its first task will be
preparing to carry out the manifesto pledge on after-school and holiday
child care.
She said the schemes would be set up through the Training and Enterprise
Councils, and emphasised that the approach to dealing with barriers to women
at work would be through persuasion.
'I don't think compulsion; legislation; extra burdens do anything to help
the cause of women,' Mrs Shephard said.
She did, however, indicate that she had already talked to the Equal
Opportunities Commission, and would look at its conclusions on how existing
legislation was unsatisfactory.
A cabinet committee on women's issues will be created from the ashes of the
former ministerial group on the subject. Members of the group to advise Mrs
Shephard are: Lady Elspeth Howe; Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the EOC; Ms
Sue Slipman, director of the Council for One-Parent Families; Baroness
Denton, a trade and industry minister; Ms Sue Rostad, chairman and managing
director of Poppies UK, a franchise cleaning company; Mr Peter Davis,
chairman and chief executive of Reed International; Ms Sheila Forbes, group
personnel director of Storehouse; Ms Kay Coleman, chief executive of
Harvey's &amp; Co (Clothing); Mr Graham Millar, managing director of Rowntree
Mackintosh Confectionery; Dr Susan MacRae, senior fellow of the Policy
Studies Institute; Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman and chief executive of the
Post Office; and Ms Margaret Seymour, who runs Seymour Swimming Pool
Engineers.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Momentum of recovery still in doubt: The strength of upturn
from economic recession in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW US forecasters envisage a repeat of last year, when a promising economic
recovery unexpectedly ground to a halt late in the summer. That said, this
week's report of a 17 per cent fall in housing starts in the single month of
April is not the kind of statistic destined to bolster confidence in the
economy's underlying momentum.
The drop in starts was partly a reaction to strong advances in preceding
months. But it was much more severe than expected, and by no means the only
discouraging news. Consumer confidence and car sales are still depressed;
claims for state unemployment insurance remain stubbornly high.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is again embarrassed by sluggish monetary
growth, a problem that has plagued it for two years. M2, the main measure of
broad money, is only just above the lower limit of its 2.5-6.5 per cent
growth target.
The signs of continuing fragility are offset by positive indicators, such as
last week's report of a solid rise in industrial production in April, the
third consecutive monthly gain. Employment and retail sales have also risen
substantially since the year began.
Few economists are thus inclined to revise their forecasts, which mostly
point to growth of about 3 per cent at an annual rate in the second half of
the year.
But the negative indicators are fuelling demands that the Fed buy a little
extra insurance by nudging the federal funds rate (the cost of money in the
interbank market) a quarter-point lower, to 3.5 per cent. A move in the next
few weeks would exploit fully the scope for lower short-term rates created
last December when the Fed cut the discount rate a full percentage point to
3.5 per cent.
The discount rate is the rate at which the Fed lends to banks, but it is of
largely symbolic significance because banks rarely borrow from the central
bank. Analysts believe another small cut in the federal funds rate would be
helpful because it would probably trigger a half-point cut in banks' prime
lending rates to 6.0 per cent. This would reduce the cost of a range of
consumer and business loans.
Encouraging recent figures for inflation are seen as enhancing the Fed's
room to manoeuvre. The core consumer price index (food and energy excluded)
is still rising at an annual rate of nearly 4 per cent, but other measures,
including the gross domestic product deflator and an index of employment
costs, point to an underlying inflation rate of perhaps only 3 per cent.
The counter-argument is that short-term rates are already at their lowest
level for a generation. The Fed regards the failure of long bond yields to
decline significantly below 8 per cent as the more important brake on
economic growth.
The risk in cutting short-term rates further, with the recovery already
under way, is that expectations of inflation will rise, putting upward
pressure on bond yields. The Fed's failure to move yesterday probably
indicates that it believes further easing would be counter-productive in the
absence of more conclusive evidence of economic weakness.
In the short run, growth estimates are likely to be revised up. Last week's
report of a sharp rebuilding of corporate inventories in March is expected
to prompt an upward revision of GDP in the first quarter, to show growth at
an annual rate of 3 per cent rather than 2 per cent. This would be by far
the best performance since President George Bush took office early in 1989.
Some bulls, such as Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in
New York, regard the first-quarter expansion as a launching pad for faster
growth - perhaps 4-5 per cent at an annual rate later in the year. But
others are more cautious. The fact that inventories have already rebounded,
say economists at JP Morgan, the New York bank, undercuts a potential prop
for growth in the second quarter.
Trade figures released yesterday were a warning that higher imports may
siphon off some of the stimulus from rising domestic demand. The trade
deficit widened to Dollars 5.8bn in March from Dollars 3.3bn, largely
because of a 4.5 per cent increase in imports.
Residential housing was the one sector of the economy to stage a 'normal'
recovery in the past year.
Rapid growth of personal consumption spending - another strong motor in the
first quarter - reflected special factors such as tax rebates and an
unsustainable fall in personal saving. The consumer is likely to remain
inhibited by historically high ratios of debt to income.
The biggest difference between this year and last is the substantially lower
level of short-term interest rates and a significant strengthening of
corporate balance sheets. This greatly reduces the risk of a 'triple dip'
into recession. But the Fed and other policy-makers would be unwise to take
the health of this erratic recovery for granted.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Perot scores with write-in primary votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MORE easy presidential primary victories for President George Bush and
Governor Bill Clinton in the US on Tuesday have again been overshadowed by
evidence of Mr Ross Perot's growing political appeal in the Far West and
nationally.
However, the Texan businessman was himself embarrassed yesterday by a
published report in which Senator Warren Rudman, a Republican from New
Hampshire, expressed his annoyance that Mr Perot seemed to have hired a
private investigator to make 'unauthorised inquiries' about his background.
Mr Rudman had been viewed as a possible vice-presidential running-mate for
Mr Perot, but said he had no interest in the prospect now.
The primary story from Oregon and Washington state was familiar. Mr Bush
scored 76 and 83 per cent respectively, against 22 and 13 per cent for Mr
Pat Buchanan, his remaining nominal challenger for the Republican
nomination. The president won 53 delegates in the two states to Mr
Buchanan's five, further padding his already sure majority to take to the
party convention.
Mr Clinton took 50 per cent of the vote in Oregon and 51 per cent in
Washington, against former California governor Jerry Brown's respective 35
per cent and 29 per cent, with former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas,
who has pulled out of the race, winning 11 and 16 per cent.
Washington state names convention delegates in separate caucuses. The 29 Mr
Clinton won in Oregon give him more than 1,850 of the 2,145 needed for the
Democratic nomination, which he may well secure in the final primaries -
including those of California, Ohio and New Jersey - on June 2.
Primaries next week, in Kentucky and Mr Clinton's native Arkansas, do not
award enough delegates to put him over the top.
However, in both the Democratic and Republican primaries this week, there
was evidence of a surprisingly large write-in vote for Mr Perot. Neither
state is obliged to disclose such votes immediately, but a CNN exit poll
suggested Mr Perot's support exceeded 10 per cent in Oregon and might have
carried some rural counties in Washington.
That said registered Democrats in Oregon preferred Mr Perot to Mr Clinton by
45 to 41 per cent. On the Republican side, 49 per cent went for Mr Bush and
40 per cent for Mr Perot.
The Pacific north-west has long been fertile ground for iconoclastic,
outsider politicians. In 1968, Oregon voted for Senator Eugene McCarthy over
Senator Robert Kennedy.
Several recent local polls have put Mr Perot ahead of the current pack.
The NBC-Wall Street Journal survey, out yesterday, had Mr Bush in the lead
with 35 per cent, followed by Mr Perot at 30 per cent and Mr Clinton with 27
per cent.
Moving closer to a formal declaration of candidacy, Mr Perot has now filed a
123-page financial disclosure statement with the Federal Election
Commission. This does not reveal a net worth - assumed to be over Dollars
3bn - but points to recent annual incomes from investments ranging from
about Dollars 25m to as much as Dollars 130m.
It suggests he has mostly been a conservative investor of his private
wealth, being heavily into tax-exempt municipal and utility bonds as well as
property, with some hedged bets in stock and currency options, and venture
capital partnerships. It was, according to the FEC, easily the largest such
statement of wealth received from a presidential aspirant.
It underlines his ability to finance a campaign from his own pocket without
recourse to federal funds.
The question of Mr Perot's ability to buy the presidency, as it were, may
become an issue late in the year.

FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Developing countries look for better deal
on trade - Why the Generalised System of Preferences is regarded as only a
qualified success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RICH and poor countries are meeting in Geneva this week to look at ways of
strengthening the preferential trading arrangements for developing nations
under the so-called Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).
The GSP, first introduced in 1971 under the auspices of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), provides for countries to
reduce or waive normal customs duties for Third World imports. As Unctad
shows in its latest review of the system, the GSP has been a qualified
success.
On the plus side, there are now some 15 schemes in operation, giving
preferential trade treatment to more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 33bn) worth
of exports a year from over 100 developing countries.
Preferential imports into the OECD countries grew roughly twice as fast as
total imports between 1976 (when the US introduced its scheme) and 1989 (the
most recent available year). Product coverage has been expanded, and an
increasing number of poor countries are benefiting from the schemes. That
suggests the GSP is working as intended: promoting development through
trade.
But both sides concede the system also has serious weaknesses. Unctad
estimates that in 1989 only half the Dollars 226bn worth of imports from
developing countries subject to duties were covered by the GSP schemes -
mostly manufactures and semi-manufactures. Only half of those actually
received preferential treatment.
In addition, because the scheme is designed to encourage industrial exports,
advanced developing countries have grabbed the lion's share of the benefits.
The US dropped the four Asian 'tigers' - Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and
South Korea - from its scheme in 1989.
Even so, the top 10 beneficiaries accounted for over 80 per cent of GSP
benefits granted by the US the following year, with Mexico alone garnering a
quarter.
Overall, the top 10 beneficiaries account for more than 60 per cent of GSP
preferences. The 40-plus least developed countries (LDCs), which are most
reliant on traditional commodity exports, had preferential exports in 1989
of a meagre Dollars 710m, or just over 1 per cent of total GSP exports by
all developing countries.
To remedy these deficiencies, developing countries, supported by the Unctad
secretariat, are pushing hard for broader product coverage of the GSP
schemes. These currently exclude many agricultural products and often
'sensitive' industrial goods such as textiles and footwear, the traditional
springboards for industrialisation. Third World nations also see expanded
coverage as partial compensation for the reduction in the value of
preferences that will inevitably follow from the general lowering of tariffs
now being negotiated in Gatt's Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
But for the first time developing countries openly acknowledge that the quid
pro quo for broader product coverage will be 'graduation' out of the GSP
schemes for the most successful Third World exporters. Australia is to
follow the US in graduating the Asian 'tigers' from 1993.
With the writing on the wall, developing countries are backing Unctad
proposals to draft multilateral 'graduation' guidelines in a bid to prevent
gross disparities between schemes and protect countries from arbitrary
delistings due to protectionist and other pressures.
In practice, many Third World nations see advantages in orderly graduation
in spreading GSP benefits more equitably. The indirect effects can also be
important. In Asia, the US decision has already led to plans for substantial
direct investment by South Korea and Taiwan in Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia to take advantage of trade preferences these countries still enjoy
in the American market.
The meeting is also discussing ways of remedying two other major defects in
the GSP scheme. The first is the fact that the schemes differ in operation
as well ascoverage. Thus the same good can satisfy origin rules for one
scheme and not for another. More difficult to tackle are differences due to
the use of GSP benefits to pressure countries over policies. The EC withdrew
GSP benefits for a time from South Korea in a row over intellectual property
protection.
The US routinely threatens to withdraw benefits to countries whose trade
policies it dislikes or which deny basic worker rights. Green criteria may
be added if US environmentalists have their way.
The second problem is the negation of GSP benefits by non-tariff measures,
which Unctad reckons (based on 11 OECD schemes) affect over one-fifth of
dutiable imports from developing countries. These measures can take the form
of quotas or ceilings, which limit benefits from preferences, or of
anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties which can wipe them out altogether.
In the 1980s the World Bank voiced the views of many development experts
that the Third World had made a 'Faustian bargain' by relying on trade
preferences that could be withdrawn at will rather than playing an active
role in multilateral trade talks.
This week's meeting has revealed a new consensus that, while the GSP and
other preferential arrangements are no panacea, and certainly no substitute
for Gatt, they are a useful and worthwhile form of development assistance in
their own right.

FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: EC warned not to cut tariff on chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN semiconductor industry would be unlikely to survive if it
dismantled its 14 per cent tariff on chip imports, a report by the industry
market research group Dataquest says.
The EC is being pressed by the US and Japan to dismantle the tariff. It is
the only main industrial region that has kept tariffs on semiconductors. The
US, Canada and Japan suspended theirs in 1985. The EC Commission has offered
to cut the 14 per cent tariff on imports of integrated circuits by a third,
to 9 per cent, in exchange for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers.
Such a cut could sharply reduce competitiveness of the European industry and
is unlikely to lead to lower prices. The declining trend in European
manufacturers' own share of their market and low market prices of many chips
in Europe have created a situation where dismantling the tariff overnight
'is likely to spell the death of the European semiconductor industry,' Mr
Byron Harding, industry analyst at Dataquest, asserts.
The EC, the US and Japan are discussing the issue in Gatt's Uruguay Round.
Calls have come from within the US to reinstate the suspended 14 per cent
tariff on chip imports if Europe fails to cut its tariff. EC chip users have
been urging a cut in the tariff, which, they say, damages their
competitiveness.
The study indicates that despite the EC tariff on imports, prices of certain
chips in Europe have been as low as, or at times lower, than prices in other
main markets. This is because foreign makers are ready to sacrifice profit
to revenue, to boost European market penetration, Mr Harding believes.

FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Investors 'avoiding cheap-labour states'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors are no longer hunting for cheap labour in developing
countries - they want big markets, quality infrastructure and high skill
levels, according to the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's
private lending arm.
Strongest growth in private investment has occurred in Chile, Papua New
Guinea and Thailand over the five years from 1986 to 1990, the study shows.
All three countries saw private investment more than doubled.
The strongest magnets for foreign direct investment are also countries with
high savings, the IFC says in its third annual study of trends in private
investment in developing countries.
'Most of the countries whose savings ratios improved, typically by virtue of
cuts in the public sector deficit, show a strong investment response by the
private sector,' it says.
Foreign investment has grown in the past decade, now accounting for 10 per
cent of all private investment in the 40 developing countries examined. Low
labour costs 'have been of diminishing importance', largely because they
account for a dwindling share of overall manufacturing costs, on average
10-15 per cent.
'Foreign investors are strongly influenced by structural factors such as
market size, the quality of infrastructure, the level of industrialisation
and the size of the existing stock of foreign investment,' the report adds.
Foreign investors display a 'herd' mentality in following where others have
invested. This is partly because the presence of other foreign companies
raises the likelihood of reliable suppliers and a pool of trained labour.
Political risk has not deterred investors where returns are sufficiently
high.

SIXTY-FOUR developing countries which have a trade and aid treaty with the
European Community will seek further assurances of continued preferential
access to the Community for important commodities when both groups meet in
Jamaica today. They will also be seeking more EC financial assistance.
Ministers representing the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group and
the EC will examine ACP concerns about the effects on trade and aid of the
creation of a single European market next year, and the move towards
deregulation of international trade under current Gatt proposals.
Mr Ralph Maraj, Trinidad and Tobago's foreign minister and president of the
ACP ministerial council, said the Lome Convention, the treaty between the
ACP and the EC, will have to be re-examined in the light of global changes
such as the dismantling of centrally-planned economies, the collapse of
apartheid, the 're-emergence of South Africa on the world stage', and the
'current international bloc politics portrayed by the Ecu, yen and dollar
zones'.

BRITAIN'S new trade commissioner in Hong Kong - equivalent to Britain's
ambassador to the territory - is to be Mr Stephen Day, a career diplomat who
has for the past five years been ambassador in Tunisia, writes David
Dodwell.
Hong Kong's anomalous colonial status, under which the governor is the
queen's representative in the territory, but at the same time speaks for
Hong Kong rather than Britain, makes Mr Day the UK's top spokesman for
British interests - particularly those of business.
Hong Kong is the UK's 15th largest export market and an important
springboard for business in the region.
UK visible exports to Hong Kong in 1991 were Pounds 1.38bn. The value of the
market would be even greater if invisibles, and goods transiting Hong Kong
for China, were included.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE every show in Thai cinemas the audience rises for the national anthem
and for a faded film showing King Bhumipol Adulyadej - officially dubbed the
'working monarch' - inspecting worthy rural projects throughout Thailand in
unremarkable civilian clothes.
The frowning, bespectacled man visiting irrigation canals in the countryside
looks like an ordinary, if particularly serious, Thai citizen. But both he
and the institution of the monarchy are revered by his subjects to an
extraordinary degree.
Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932 and the king's legal
powers are severely circumscribed. Yet he is regarded as a mediator and
arbiter of last resort at times of national crisis.
Like the government, the pro-democracy demonstrators who have confronted the
army in the past four days of disturbances in Bangkok have repeatedly and
publicly emphasised their loyalty to the king.
Thai academics appealed to the 64-year-old king to intervene, as he did in
1973 by meeting the leaders of the discredited authoritarian government and
student demonstrators, and finally by appointing a new administration.
Last night the king finally stepped in. State television showed him giving
an audience to Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the embattled prime minister, Mr
Chamlong Srimuang, on Monday, and Mr Prem Tinsulanonda, prime minister from
1980 to 1988 and now an adviser to the king.
The three men crawled into the room on their knees while the king sat on a
sofa - as a mark of respect for the monarch his subjects are obliged to keep
their heads lower than his.
Breaking his silence on the crisis, the king told the prime minister and
opposition leader: 'If you both continue to seek to win, in the end the
country will lose.' He urged them to turn to each other and seek compromise.
King Bhumipol has been on the throne for 42 years. Born in the US in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father was studying medicine at Harvard,
he went on to cultivate interests ranging from photography and jazz to
boat-building and painting.
As he grew older he developed an interest in rural development, initiating
more than 1,000 projects in the countryside and reinforcing his popularity
among the peasantry.
Although the king is held in profound respect - public criticism of the
royal family is forbidden and it is not unknown for people to be convicted
of lese-majeste - he is aware of the limitations of his power and of the
danger of different factions attempting to manipulate him.
'I am called a king, but my duty - you have noticed - is not the duty of a
king,' he said in a BBC interview 10 years ago.
'We keep in the middle, neutral and in peaceful co-existence with
everybody,' he said then when asked about his involvement in politics. 'We
could be crushed by both sides, but we are impartial. One day it would be
very handy to have somebody impartial.'
That day arrived yesterday.

PLANS to reconstruct the war-ravaged heart of Beirut have generated a

If successful, the Dollars 2.65bn plan will transform 135 hectares of
desolate ruins into skyscrapers, condominiums, parking lots and shopping
malls, complete with a 40-storey, twin-tower World Trade Centre, an opera
house, museums, an artificial island and a palm-lined avenue wider than the
Champs-Elysees.
The dispute has been the subject of television documentaries and impassioned
newspaper columns. It promises to generate legal battles for decades to
come.
Opponents have staged sit-ins and spread allegations of malpractice against
proponents of the plan, many of whom have ties to the Lebanese-born Saudi
billionaire Mr Rafiq Hariri.
Landlords claim that expropriation of their buildings in exchange for shares
in a property company constitutes theft and that archeological treasures
will be buried. Conflicting views of Lebanon's past and future, of the
rights of individuals and the public good, are tinged with religious and
class prejudice.
Opponents also object on aesthetic grounds to the architectural design,
which Lady Yvonne Cochrane, the aristocratic president of the owners' and
tenants' association, labels 'the dream of a retarded adolescent.'
Advocates insist that failure to carry out the project would doom the city's
centre to being a perpetual slum inhabited by refugees and squatters - and
prevent the rehabilitation of the entire country.
'The law has been passed,' says Mr Fadel Shallak, president of the Council
for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), the organisation responsible for
creating the new Beirut. 'These people who are still arguing six months
later are a continuation of the civil war. They lack discipline. They think
they are more important than the state. In doing these designs, we have
tried to express the future of a strong Lebanese state.'
Opponents say the plan contravenes the Lebanese constitution, which protects
private property. In exchange for their stake in the city centre, 127,000
landlords and tenants are offered 50 per cent of the shares in a real estate
company to be formed pending completion of a financial assessment. The other
half will be owned by investors, who will initially contribute capital equal
to the assessed value of the land.
The company is tax exempt for 10 years, and capital will be increased as
building progresses. Over the next 25 years, the real estate company will
sell off its property.
The CDR argues that no other solution could resolve claims of landlords and
tenants; the latter say they are being forced into a partnership with third
parties they do not know and who are not legally committed to completing the
project.
Although he avoids publicity, Mr Hariri is the central character in the
saga. The 47-year-old son of Sunni Moslem farmers from the southern Lebanese
port city of Sidon emigrated to Saudi Arabia 27 years ago. In a
local-boy-makes-good story that has endeared him to his supporters and
aroused the scorn and suspicion of his detractors, he won the favour of
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, purchased the French construction giant Oger and
proceeded to build much of modern Saudi Arabia.
Mr Hariri founded the Mediterrannee banking and insurance group and owns
significant shares in a half-dozen other international banks. This year he
established a media holding company for his radio stations and two planned
television stations. He established in 1984 a foundation which pays
university fees for 12,000 Lebanese students every year. According to one of
his aides, he contributes Dollars 87m to charities in Lebanon every year.
For his acolytes, Mr Hariri is a disinterested philanthropist; his enemies
say he is buying off public opinion - and the country. Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi lives in a building that is owned and maintained by Mr Hariri.
Mr Shallak, who began working for Mr Hariri in 1978, says that the CDR is an
independent, government-financed organisation, in spite of the fact that Mr
Hariri has made clear his intention to subscribe to the legally allowed
maximum of 10 per cent in the Beirut real estate company, paid for
renovation of the CDR's new headquarters and personally bankrolled two
master reconstruction plans, one for Beirut, the other for all of Lebanon.
The largest engineering consultant in the Middle East and the eighth biggest
in the world, the Lebanese company Dar Al-Handasah was given responsibility
for the Beirut plan. The Dollars 7.5m contract for the national plan was
split between Dar Al-Handasah and the US company Bechtel, which refused to
send any of its staff to Lebanon. Invitations to tenders for the first three
years of their Dollars 4.5bn national plan will be issued this month.
The Lebanese Parliament last autumn passed a law giving the CDR wide powers.
'We are free of all red tape and bureaucratic procedures,' says Mr Shallak.
'It is in our bye-laws that we should be given freedom to do our job.' He is
sensitive to accusations of conflict of interest, but says 'sometimes we
have to make a choice between what is good for the country and nice formal
aspects.'
Under the direction of the CDR, Oger Liban, Mr Hariri's company, is
supervising the dynamiting of unsafe buildings in the old city centre.
Before the work started, Mr Samir Rebeiz, an architect, photographed every
building. Although many no longer exist, he continues to classify them
according to historical period, architectural style, urban value, present
condition and the feasibility of restoration. 'Only 10 per cent of the
buildings were actually unsafe,' he says. 'They had to destroy them to
maximize the number of offices and apartments they can build.'
Mr Rebeiz particularly regrets the destruction of medieval vaulting in the
Tawile and Ayass souks, a 17th-century stone structure with a crenellated
roof, and an 18th-century Greek Orthodox monastery. He says that the master
plan would raze vestiges of the medieval city walls and build over an area
where ancient Canaanite artefacts were found before the civil war.
The CDR has asked Unesco to carry out archeological studies in line with Dar
Al-Handasah's master plan and invited the Lebanese Department of Antiquities
to excavate parts of the city. But archeologists say they have been given
permission to work only in 3m-wide segments of an unpromising area with a
high water table and six metres of surface sewage.
Mr Henri Edde, the Lebanese architect in charge of 200 Dar Al Handasah
consultants working on the Beirut project, brushes off the criticism: 'Can
you imagine that such a huge project would not have opposition? When the
French built the Pompidou Centre and the Louvre Pyramid there was an outcry.
Prince Charles argues with architects. We are not responsible for the
destruction of these buildings. It was the fighters in the war who did it.
The people who are now screaming 'Stop the bulldozers' didn't try to stop
them. If they delay reconstruction or make it impossible, they will be
judged by history.'

FT  21 MAY 92 / Filipinos show distaste for graft and patronage: The
presidential poll results are demonstrating a break with traditional
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOEVER wins the drawn out battle for the Philippines presidency, the result
will represent a repudiation of the traditional politics of patronage.
Analysts say the cry for a new type of leadership was evident in the heavy
turnout in what is regarded as the most peaceful and free election the
country has seen, despite complaints of fraud by some candidates.
By last night Mr Fidel Ramos, of the Lakas-National Union of Christian
Democrats coalition, was still in the lead. With 43 per cent of the 26.7m
votes counted, he had 2.56m votes against 1.95m for Mrs Mrs Miriam Defensor
Santiago, of the People's Reform Party.
Both Mr Ramos and Mrs Santiago had occupied various public offices - he is
the former armed forces chief-of-staff and defence secretary, while she used
to be a court judge and immigration commissioner. Neither has held any
elected position before.
Political analysts say the voter acceptance of Mr Ramos and Mrs Santiago
represents a rejection of the old-style politics of patronage and largesse
that had become fodder for corruption in the bureaucracy. Corruption in
government has been tagged as one of the main reasons for the Philippines'
inability to improve standards of living - 65 per cent of the 62m Filipinos
live below the poverty line - despite its resource-rich economy and a steady
flow of foreign aid.
Mrs Santiago pegged her campaign on an anti-corruption crusade while Mr
Ramos promised 'people empowerment' that will expand citizen participation
in government affairs. Their camps projected each candidate as a 'fighter' -
Mr Ramos against coup plotters who had repeatedly tried, but failed, to grab
power from President Corazon Aquino, and Mrs Santiago against 'the evil' of
corruption.
In the rest of the field of seven Mr Eduardo Cojuangco of the Nationalist
People's Coalition stood third with 1.85m votes. He is viewed largely as a
remnant of the autocratic government of deposed dictator Mr Ferdinand
Marcos, but has not done as well as foreign observers had expected.
Mr Ramon Mitra, of the dominant Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) party,
had been unable to shake off his image as a paragon of traditional
politicians, disparagingly referred to as trapos (old rags). He defeated Mr
Ramos in an LDP straw vote last November, but Mr Ramos left the party that
Mr Mitra helped organise in 1986 after his petitions for an investigation of
fraud charges were ignored.
Also trampled by the rush against traditional politicians was the career of
Mr Jovito Salonga, former Senate president, who stood on a strong
nationalist theme. Mr Salonga had topped all senatorial elections that he
ran in since the 1970s, but at the age of 71, his appeal to the voters had
obviously waned , although he continues to enjoy enormous support from the
intellectuals and certain middle-class niches.
By demolishing the traditional basis for political alignments, however, the
May 11 poll may have also created new elements that could be a drag to the
new administration. Mr Joseph Estrada, a film actor who became senator in
1987, appears almost certain to clinch the vice presidency.
Mr Estrada was originally one of the eight contenders for president but in
late March he joined Mr Cojuangco's camp as the Marcos crony's running mate.
Mr Estrada's nationalist beliefs could run into the more cautious approach
of Mr Ramos or Mrs Santiago. This fundamental difference could turn him to
another 'wallflower' vice president. Most of the country's presidents since
the 1950s had little use for their elected vice presidents who belonged to
rival political parties.
Even In the bicameral congress, the majority most of those winners ing the
election are from the LDP. In the race for the 24 seats in the Senate, the
latest count showed the LDP winning at least 17. The results for the
200-member House of Representatives will become clear by this weekend, but
many of the known LDP stalwarts were reported ahead leading in their
constituencies.
The bias against traditional politics extended to the voting in the Senate.
Another political upstart who originally gained popularity as a movie and
television actor, Mr Vicente Sotto III, appears to be headed to become the
runaway top-notcher from among the 168 candidates. Analysts see this also as
further evidence of voter preference for 'fighters' - as vice-mayor of
Quezon City, a Metro-Manila suburb, he led a campaign against drug abuse.
Observers are unanimous in crediting the Filipino people who jammed the
polling centres as the 'real winners' in the election.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Japan's land prices show record fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURVEY of Japanese urban property values has found a 12.3 per cent fall in
residential prices in the six months to the end of March, the largest fall
in the post-war period and an indication of the severe pressure on financial
institutions which have been big lenders to the property market.
The Japan Real Estate Institute said the national land price index,
including commercial and industrial property, fell by 1.9 per cent during
the same period to 108.4, the first decline in 17 years.
The institute's survey is regarded as a lagging indicator, and the 12.3 per
cent fall in the urban residential index to 83.8 does not reflect the
dramatic price plunges in some sectors, particularly the condominium market
on the fringes of Tokyo and Osaka.
Some Osaka condominiums have fallen in price by more than 40 per cent over
the past year, following a spate of speculative building from the late 1980s
until 1990, when there were a record 1.7m housing starts in Japan.
The figure fell to 1.37m in 1991, and property agents say demand appears to
have bottomed for well located apartments selling for around Y40m (Pounds
169,000). Housing starts in March were 2.6 per cent lower than the same
month in 1991, and leading apartment builders say their fast growing stock
of unsold apartments appears to have peaked.
However, developers holding highly priced properties in areas that were
thought feasible sites at the peak of the speculative era remain in serious
financial difficulty, and officials at the real estate institute indicated
that national property prices would continue to fall in coming months.
The institute found that the residential price index in central Tokyo was
down 12.2 per cent to 83.1 over the six month period, while in Osaka, the
index fell 14 per cent to 78.1 and in Nagoya, it was 2 per cent lower at
118.2.
Reuter adds: Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday
released revised figures showing a fall in industrial production in March of
2.6 per cent from the previous month.

<TEXT>
INDIA yesterday successfully launched a satellite into orbit using a locally
developed rocket. The launch follows two failures four years ago.
The launch of the rocket, the third version of the 'augmented satellite
launch vehicle', took place at the Sriharikota launching station of the
Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), north of Madras.
The satellite is part of a series launched by the Indian government for
research purposes. Although designed by Isro, components for the rocket and
the satellite were obtained from various sources, including the US which
last week banned exports to Isro because it had bought cyrogenic rocket
technology from Russia.
The ban is bound to slow India's space programme which the government claims
is for peaceful purposes and not for development of missile technology, as
the US alleges. Prof U R Rao, chairman of Isro, said after the launching
that it was a 'total success'.
The two tasks of proving the functioning of the rocket and orbiting the
satellite had been completed successfully, he said.
India issued charges yesterday against the head of a Sri Lankan Tamil
guerrilla group for the murder a year ago, of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former
prime minister, Reuter reports from Madras.
The special investigation team looking into Mr Gandhi's killing on May 21,
1991, charged Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, head of the Tamil Tigers, and his
intelligence chief, Mr Pottu Amman. India has asked Sri Lanka to arrest and
extradite Mr Prabhakaran.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Kings fall out over Jerusalem shrine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN ONE of those arcane and highly personalised disputes that swirl about the
Arab world, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and King Hussein of Jordan find
themselves in potentially bitter competition over renovations to Islam's
third holiest shrine after Mecca and Medina.
It is not clear who will emerge with the privilege of paying for repairs to
the Al Aqsa mosque and other holy places in Jerusalem, but the Saudi
monarch, whose personal wealth is put at Dollars 18bn, certainly has the
wherewithal.
The contest of the custodians of Islam's holiest shrines - the dispute owes
more to past rivalries than present differences - began earlier this year
when Unesco appealed for help to restore Al Aqsa's distinctive gold dome and
marble facade on the site where the Prophet Mohammed, according to Moslem
belief, ascended to heaven.
King Fahd responded swiftly, offering Dollars 70m for renovations to all
Islamic sites in Arab East Jerusalem. King Hussein, whose Ministry of
Religious Endowments is still responsible for Jerusalem's Islamic holy
places, felt obliged to try to match the Saudi monarch's largesse where Al
Aqsa is concerned. He offered Dollars 8.25m, and battle was joined.
Not that the two men are likely to be consulting each other. King Fahd has
not spoken to his Jordanian counterpart since King Hussein expressed
sympathy for Iraq's position early in the Gulf crisis. And worse from
Jordan's point of view, Saudi Arabia has cut off aid that had helped to keep
the impoverished Hashemite kingdom afloat.
Behind the battle of the dollars lies a complex story of family rivalries
that date back to early this century when Abdul-Aziz Ibn Saud, the
warrior-founder of the House of Saud, drove the Hashemites from their
strongholds in the Hejaz along the west coast of what is now Saudi Arabia,
including Mecca and Medina.
King Hussein re-opened wounds during the Gulf crisis when he asked subjects
to refer to him as Sharif Hussein in memory of his great-grandfather, Sherif
of Mecca, who helped inspire the Arab revolt against Ottoman Turks in 1916.
The dispute among Arab royalty has been further complicated by Egyptian
intervention, and more recently by the Palestinians in the person of Mr
Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation who is
risking an unholy row with King Hussein over his apparent endorsement of the
Fahd offer.
Egypt's press reported this week that Egyptian engineers, working under the
auspices of Saudi Arabia, were being despatched to Jerusalem to examine the
Islamic sites.
Jordan, which controlled East Jerusalem and the West Bank until the 1967
war, was not amused, and strong criticism was voiced in its press.
Enter, at this point, Mr Arafat, who expressed his deep gratitude this week
to King Fahd. 'In the name of our struggling Palestinian people. . . we
would like to express our many thanks and brotherly gratitude for your wise
decision,' he said in a message to the Saudi monarch.
Cynical observers might suggest Mr Arafat was trying to curry favour with
wealthy Saudis whose anger at PLO support for Iraq in the Gulf crisis knew
almost no bounds.

<TEXT>
THE German government said yesterday it would fight European Commission
proposals to cut capacity in the ailing east German shipbuilding industry.
The Commission agreed plans to lift the ceiling on state aid to 36 per cent
of contract value for yards opened before October 1990.
All aid would have to be paid before the end of 1993. But yards will have to
be closed and jobs cut to ensure shipbuilding capacity in the new German
Lander falls by 40 per cent before the end of 1995.
Other Community shipbuilders, notably the Spanish, have campaigned hard
against relaxing the rules for the east German yards.
The Bonn Economics Ministry said it could accept the increase in the
ceiling, which compares with an EC-wide limit of 9 per cent for production
aid. But a spokesman added: 'In the light of cuts already undertaken,
reduction of capacity on this scale will give us great difficulties.'
The proposals will be discussed by EC ministers next month. Germany alone
will be unable to block agreement by a majority of other member states.
The Commission said its proposals were in line with policy in other member
states and that apart from the increased ceiling, the normal rules on aid to
shipyards would be applied.
Lightning strikes among printers hit production of yesterday's German
newspapers after Tuesday's arbitration talks failed to produce a pay deal.
IG Medien, the main union involved, and one of the most militant in Germany,
said it would call a strike ballot immediately if there was no result from
conciliation talks scheduled for today. Further disruption was expected last
night.
The threat of strikes also loomed over paper manufacturing yesterday.

FT  21 MAY 92 / All eyes on German money supply: The broad M3 measure has
clearly grown more quickly than the Bundesbank would like, writes Andrew
Fisher in Bonn. Exactly why is not quite so evident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<TEXT>
IN THE PAST, not many people bothered with the German money supply figures.
German monetary stability was taken for granted. Those who watched to see if
the Bundesbank's carefully set monetary targets were met were only the
economists, bankers and financial market traders.
But that was before the costs of reunifying Germany knocked the country's
public finances sideways, with the money supply trend becoming a key factor
in its high interest rates. The Bundesbank lifted rates in December to
levels uncomfortably high for the rest of Europe, where economies remain
weak, and foreign politicians and executives are acutely aware of what
German money supply means for business abroad.
Today, when M3, the broad monetary aggregate, is racing away at a near
double-digit annual rate - twice the centre point of the target range for
this year of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent - and inflation is higher than in
Britain and France, Germany's money supply is one of the most closely
watched financial indicators.
However, while M3 clearly has grown much faster than the German central bank
would like, it is not so evident why. In March, the growth rate was an
annual 9.4 per cent after 8.6 per cent in February and 8.9 per cent in
January. The rate is expected to slow, but there is little likelihood the
Bundesbank will meet its target. The April figures will be out in the next
few days. Curiously, M3 was already out of line at the start of the year;
the target is based on the average for the fourth quarter of 1991, but
December's rapid growth put the 1992 starting point well above that level.
Nevertheless, the Bundesbank does not intend to make the target range higher
simply to make it easier to reach. Its goal for M3 (comprising mainly cash,
savings, and short-term deposits) is a firm expression of its intent to
maintain stability. Past targets have not always been met, but they acted as
beacons of monetary resolve to the financial world.
Why is the target not being met now? What's more, does it really matter?
Each year, the Bundesbank assesses Germany's potential for economic growth
and adds a few percentage points for expected inflation and the rate of
monetary circulation. The result is the M3 goal, with the range representing
acceptable upper and lower variations.
This time, however, unification has upset the calculations. The bank's
determination to stick to its target range is its counter-strategy to the
high, and inflationary, state spending and borrowing wave embarked on to
support the east German economy. Most of the funds going from west to east
still finance consumption rather than productive investment.
Even so, investment in the east is moving ahead. It is this factor which is
mainly behind the steep rise in the money supply. The benefit is that such
spending represents the rebuilding of east Germany. But much of it is
subsidised by soft loans, grants, and subsidies. Thus, credit demand from
the private sector, up at an annual rate of 12 per cent in the past six
months, is less subject to the Bundesbank's control.
Also helping propel M3 along more quickly than usual are: lower profit
levels, leading companies to borrow more at a time of economic slackness to
finance investments; increased lending for consumption and residential
property deals; and the effect of high interest rates in encouraging funds
to be placed in short-term deposits.
All this points to the question of how seriously M3's growth should be
taken. The bank lifted interest rates by an unexpectedly high 0.5 percentage
point in December, making it harder for other European countries to put
theirs down at a time when their economies needed a stimulus (although
Britain and France have just done so). Now, Germany's Lombard rate is at
9.75 per cent and the discount rate at 8 per cent.
The longer money supply keeps expanding quickly, the less likely the
Bundesbank is to cut rates. Inflation has moderated to an annual rate of 4.5
per cent in March, but the Bundesbank is obviously unhappy about wage trends
and the vigour of M3. Moreover, the German economy, though flaccid after a
lengthy period of growth, is resisting world recession and is expected to
perk up in 1993. So high interest rates, in the Bundesbank's view, do not
carry the risk of torpedoing the economy.
Of immediate concern is the impact of monetary growth on inflation, which
the bank wants to see below 4 per cent this year and around 2 per cent
later. In its January report, the Bundesbank stressed its legal obligation
to regulate money supply and credit to safeguard the D-Mark.
It noted: 'There is also a growing worldwide conviction that central banks
should primarily ensure stable prices. In this connection, managing the
money stock is of crucial importance, for there is broad agreement that
inflation is a monetary phenomenon in the long run.' In the 1970s, the
average rise in the money supply outpaced real potential growth in the
economy by more than 6.5 per cent. This was accompanied by high inflation;
prices increased by an annual average of 5.5 per cent. In the 1980s, M3 grew
less rapidly and so did prices.
These days, the link is less straightforward, partly because the D-Mark now
floats against the dollar; this influences import costs and delays the
influence of the money supply. 'Prices have tended to follow the growth of
the money stock with a lag of about two to three years,' the bank said. So
the full effect of what the Bundesbank is doing now may not show through for
some time. For those abroad chafing under high German rates, patience may
thus be the only response to the Bundesbank's stern policies.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Consumer credit rise adds to Bundesbank fears
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday again voiced concern about the rapid expansion of
German money supply, coinciding with a strong rise in consumer credit, and
weak growth in capital formation.
In spite of adjusting its calculation of money supply growth in March
downwards, from an estimated 9.75 per cent to a corrected annual rate of 9.4
per cent, the central bank emphasised that the expansion had accelerated
again: from a rate of 8.9 per cent in January, 8.6 per cent in February, and
now 9.4 per cent in March.
At the same time it published figures for the growth of west German private
indebtedness for consumption in 1991, showing that it expanded by DM28.6bn
(Pounds 9.7bn), compared with DM23.7bn in 1990, DM21.1bn in 1989, and only
DM13bn in 1988.
The other particular concern expressed in the Bundesbank's monthly report is
the failure of capital formation to match the growth in credit to the
private sector, underlining the fact that credit is being used primarily for
consumption.
The trend reflects in part the massive transfers of capital from west
Germany to the east, to finance consumption rather than a corresponding
expansion in investment there. But it also shows that western consumers are
financing their spending increasingly from credit, and not income - and that
easterners are rapidly acquiring the habit.
The pessimistic tone in a series of articles by the bank's economics
department underlines the determination of its governing council to maintain
a tight monetary policy until the growth of money supply and inflation are
brought down.
Even the fact that industrial production in the west expanded by 3 per cent
in the first quarter, compared with the last quarter of 1991, was
discounted: year on year, the growth was only 1 per cent, and the reason for
the strong recovery was a combination of unnaturally low production at the
end of last year, and a very mild winter, outweighing the normal seasonal
adjustment.
The independent German Economics Institute (DIW) in Berlin published its own
estimate yesterday of real 3 per cent growth in gross domestic product in
the first quarter - in spite of the fact that GDP in eastern Germany
actually fell by 2 per cent. The institute said that a sustained recovery in
the east German economy was still not in sight, although, thanks to the high
level of earning from 'commuters' travelling to west Germany to work, the
gross national product of the east actually increased by 4 per cent compared
with the first quarter of 1991.

FT  21 MAY 92 / European corps units to remain separate

<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany have agreed that their European defence corps, to be set
up by President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl tomorrow,
will consist of separate national units under a joint command.
Germany has rejected a French proposal to assign troops fully to the corps
in peacetime, insisting that they remain 'nationally assigned' just as they
are in Nato, Bonn officials said yesterday.
The corps is nonetheless seen as an important move in creating a European
defence identity, within Nato and complementary to it, but also capable of
being used in non-Nato operations within and outside the territory of the
alliance. The corps will be set up 'in the perspective of European union',
and put under the umbrella of the nine-nation Western European Union.
It is clear, however, that the German troops in the corps may not be able to
participate in all its potential operations because of the constitutional
restriction on combat missions outside the Nato area.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, believes it will be possible to
agree on a change in the constitution allowing use of German troops in
United Nations peace-keeping operations, without geographical restriction,
by the end of the year. But he admits it could be 10 years before they take
part in other activities.
The Franco-German agreement provides for three precise uses of the corps:
the common defence of the Nato allies, the maintenance and restoration of
peace, and humanitarian missions. A planning staff will be set up in July,
and the corps should come into existence in 1995, with a headquarters in
Strasbourg.
From the German point of view, a major benefit will be in bringing the
French troops in the corps openly under the Nato umbrella for the defence of
the allies.

FT  21 MAY 92 / US takes up offensive against Serbia: Washington revokes
landing rights as UN considers sanctions
</HEADLINE>

THE US yesterday revoked landing rights for JAT, Yugoslav airlines,
signalling the beginnings of a much wider diplomatic offensive to isolate
Serbia.
'Serbia has gone beyond the bounds of what is tolerable,' a senior western
diplomat said.
He added that members of the Islamic Conference, which includes Arab
countries, Malaysia, Pakistan and Indonesia, were shocked at the cruelty
inflicted on the Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and what might happen to
them in (Serbian-controlled) Kosovo.
Pressure to impose a comprehensive package of sanctions increased as masked
Serb gunmen yesterday held hostage in a sports stadium 5,000 people who are
mostly Moslem women and children. They are trying to escape from the
fighting in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
Western diplomats said the UN is considering a range of sanctions. These
include blocking off Serbia's air and surface transport links, imposing an
oil embargo and freezing Serbia's Dollars 2.9bn in assets which were in
western banks at the end of last year. But he did not say how these
sanctions would be implemented, and warned of the difficulties in
implementing them.
Some western diplomats said UN troops, backed by an air-defence system,
should be sent to gain control of Sarajevo airport. 'This has been
mentioned. But, as yet, there is no concrete proposal on the table,' a
diplomat said.
The UN still faces opposition from countries, including Russia, (it has
traditional Slav connections with Serbia), India, a prominent member of the
non-aligned movement, and Greece, which opposes independence for the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
'With growing pressure from the Islamic Conference, and the appalling evil
of the war, there is growing consensus to slap sanctions on Serbia and make
them stick. Serbia must be stopped. The war must not spread,' a western
diplomat said.
Yesterday gunmen fired a mortar at UN peace-keepers trying to free Moslem
refugees held hostage by Serbs outside the embattled city of Sarajevo. It
was the latest in a rash of assaults on international relief and
peace-keeping personnel in the Balkan state.
A volunteer for the International Committee of the Red Cross died on Tuesday
in a rocket attack on a humanitarian aid convoy.
Yesterday Serb irregulars demanded the delivery of food to besieged army
barracks in the centre of Sarajevo in exchange for the release of the
hostages held in Ilidza, a Sarajevo surburb.
Earlier Radio Sarajevo said Serb irregulars were launching mortar attacks on
the city of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia from the surrounding hills. It said
the railroad station was repeatedly hit. Hundreds of thousands of people are
stranded in the city without water or electricity. Food supplies are nearly
exhausted.

A SPECIAL cabinet meeting of the outgoing Italian government has been called
tomorrow to examine the economy following the EC's blunt warning that the
country risked being unable to meet the requirements for economic and
monetary union if it did not put its finances in order.
The meeting will be little more than a symbolic act as the outgoing
Christian Democrat coalition has been operating since last month's general
election in a caretaker capacity.
Yesterday Mr Guido Carli, outgoing treasury minister, sharply rebuked
Italy's politicri'The populist nature of the political parties ..has allowed

FT  21 MAY 92 / Swiss cultures clash over request to join Community: The
decision, says Ian Rodger, has aroused both joy and suspicion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWISS government's decision this week to make an early application to
enter the European Community may turn out to be a case where Swiss French
logic crumbles before Swiss German stubbornness.
Reaction to the decision has certainly been very different in the country's
two main linguistic communities. In French-speaking Romandy, which has long
had a cosmopolitan culture, there was near-unalloyed joy; in the more
inward-looking German-speaking cantons suspicion prevailed.
Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Zurich's leading newspaper, relegated the news to page
21 and grumbled about the 'undignified' way it leaked out. Even strong
advocates of joining the EC worried that the move was premature and risked
undermining public support for two other Europe-related plans which are to
be put to plebiscites later this year.
Most Swiss business leaders believe that their country must have closer ties
with the EC if the country's economy is to thrive, but they suspect that the
only way to convince the independent-minded German-speaking majority is by
proceeding very gradually.
That had also been the strategy until last October of the federal
government. With the governments of the other six member states of the
European Free Trade Association (Efta), Bern was negotiating a trade
agreement with the EC to create a European Economic Area (EEA).
Even that would be tough enough for many Swiss to accept. The idea was that
the Efta countries would take on the four freedoms of the EC's single
market, meaning Switzerland would open its doors to EC workers and home
buyers and remove several mechanisms that protected professionals and many
businesses from EC competitors.
If all that was accepted and implemented, there would be plenty of time to
try to cajole the Swiss into joining the EC itself. And even if they
ultimately decided not to join, the Swiss economy would already be getting
virtually all the benefits of membership.
But in October, the government announced that joining the EC was official
policy and that the EEA should be considered only a step towards it. From
there, it was, as Swiss President Rene Felber said yesterday, only logical
to actually send in an application.
Coming when the country is approaching two plebiscites on the EEA treaty,
this decision had the appearance of an attempt to get a Euro-bandwagon
going.
In September, a referendum is to be held on a proposal to spend SFr30bn
(Pounds 11.1bn) to dig two new rail tunnels through the Alps. This is part
of the EEA agreement intended to resolve the long-running dispute over
transit rights through Switzerland and Austria for EC lorries, and it was
always going to face strong opposition from both environmentalists and
people worried about the cost.
Then, probably in December, the referendum on the EEA treaty itself will be
held.
Both a majority of the population and a majority of the 26 cantons must
approve the proposals. Most cantons are German-speaking and their lingering
suspicion of international organisations was shown on Sunday when they
approved by only the slimmest of margins a proposal to join the
International Monetary Fund.
The IMF would not directly hurt any Swiss. The EEA, on the other hand, would
cause considerable upheaval, especially among the small and medium-sized
businesses that are the core of the Swiss German economy. As Mr Pierre
Borgeaud, president of the national business association, Vorort, pointed
out, 'the feeling of being threatened is most strongly felt in eastern
(German-speaking) Switzerland'.

FT  21 MAY 92 / ITV wants Pounds 304m football deal reopened over late offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE independent television companies are pushing to reopen the Pounds 304m
satellite television deal with English football's new Premier League because
British Sky Broadcasting was allowed to submit a secret last-minute improved
offer to freeze out ITV.
At least one football club chairman is calling for an official inquiry
because of what he said was the unfair and unethical way the negotiations
were concluded.
The agreement in principle - heads of agreement are now being drawn up  - is
controversial because only viewers with access to satellite or cable
television will be able to see live Premier League matches.
Chairmen and chief executives of the new league, which starts in August,
voted on Monday by the narrowest possible margin in favour of a joint
BSkyB-BBC deal worth Pounds 304m over five years.
Two of the 22 clubs present abstained and six voted against. The agreement
in principle needed two-thirds support. A detailed ITV offer worth Pounds
262m over five years was delivered by hand between 8am and 9am on Monday by
Mr Trevor East, executive director of ITV football, to Mr Rick Parry, chief
executive of the new league, and Sir John Quinton, its chairman, who is also
chairman of Barclays Bank.
Mr Parry handed out copies of the ITV offer to the premier league executives
as they arrived at London's Royal Lancaster Hotel for the 10am meeting.
Mr East says that just before 10am he overheard Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of
Tottenham Hotspur football club and of Amstrad Consumer Electronics, the
principal maker of satellite dishes, making a telephone call from a booth in
the hotel.
'He was very excited. He was saying things like: 'Don't you understand. You
don't seem to have taken it in. These are the figures. You've got to get
something moving quickly.'' According to Mr East, the Amstrad chairman
concluded by saying: 'Blow them out of the water.'
Asked yesterday if he had called BSkyB with details of the new ITV offer, Mr
Sugar said: 'It's none of your business who I was talking to. I might have
been talking to my girlfriend.'
BSkyB, it is believed, was also tipped off by sources other than Mr Sugar
that the ITV bid had narrowed the gap between the two sides.
ITV, which wanted 30 live games a season compared with the 60 in the BSkyB
deal, believes that if the difference had been less than Pounds 10m a year
the clubs would have accepted the greater visibility that ITV would have
given the new league.
A new BSkyB offer was put together at the last moment and sent to Mr Parry,
who did not join the meeting until nearly 10.40am. Mr Parry then relayed the
offer orally - there was no accompanying paperwork.
According to those present, no clue was given that there had been a
last-minute offer and ITV was given no chance to respond with a new offer.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London
Weekend Television, said yesterday Mr Parry had said on four occasions that
everything would be all right for ITV. Requests for a chance to make a
presentation to the league chairmen came to nothing.
Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, last night declined
to confirm or deny a last-minute revised offer.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Thailand's king seals accord to end violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KING of Thailand last night sealed an agreement between the government
and pro-democracy demonstrators to end four days of confrontation in which
at least 40 people have been killed.
King Bhumipol Adulyadej, the country's 64-year-old constitutional monarch,
summoned Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister, and Mr Chamlong
Srimuang, the opposition leader arrested on Monday, and told them to make
peace for the sake of the people and the economy of Thailand.
Both Gen Suchinda and Mr Chamlong were seen on television crawling on their
knees into the presence of the king.
In a televised address soon afterwards, Gen Suchinda said Mr Chamlong was
being freed, along with all others arrested during the bloody clashes.
MrChamlong, sitting alongside him, appealed to protesters to refrain from
violence.
The agreement will bring relief to Thais and to foreign investors, although
there are still many uncertainties.
Most Thais think Gen Suchinda will have to step down and may even have to
leave the country after presiding over the shooting of protesters, but he
and his supporters appear reluctant to relinquish control.
Gen Suchinda, the former armed forces chief appointed as premier by a
coalition of pro-military parties which won elections in March, is not an
elected MP and is likely to have to resign within a month. He may choose to
stand in a by-election to retain his post, although he has previously
rejected this course.
He said that he would ask parliament to meet on Monday to amend the
constitution, one of the key demands of the demonstrators, who want to
reduce the influence of the military in politics and restrict the post of
prime minister to elected MPs.
Mr Chamlong, himself a former army general but a man noted for his campaigns
against corruption, told Thais: 'I ask you not to support any people who are
being disorderly, so that the situation can return to normal as fast as
possible.' He added: 'The situation has eased because of the good offices of
the king.'
King Bhumipol told the two men to use the good offices of Mr Prem
Tinsulanonda, prime minister between 1980 and 1988 and one of his closest
advisers.
'You, especially you two, General Suchinda and Major General Chamlong, must
turn towards each other and not confront each other in order to solve this
problem,' the king said.
'In the end people no longer know why they are fighting. All they want is to
win and this is dangerous.'
Before the midnight announcement of a deal, there had been feverish
speculation in Bangkok that Gen Suchinda would be overthrown by disaffected
colleagues in the military.
Bangkok remained under a night curfew after the king's intervention and
troops continued to patrol the streets.
But thousands of demonstrators manned barricades around the Ramkamheang
University in the capital's north-east in defiance of the curfew.
Gunshots could be heard elsewhere, even after Gen Suchinda's announcement.

FT  21 MAY 92 / EC farm policy on verge of wide-ranging reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST radical reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural
Policy was within reach last night as EC farm ministers were locked in a
second night of hard bargaining.
Agreement on the reform would send a signal that the Community is at last
serious about restraining its chronic overproduction of food - now running
at about 20 per cent over consumption and rising.
A deal could also clear the way for a conclusion of the Uruguay Round
negotiations to liberalise world trade. These talks have been stalled for
the past 18 months because the US and other agri-exporters regard EC
commitments to cut farm subsidies as inadequate.
As well as clearing the food mountains, the reform could bring cheaper food.
It could also gradually bring about a cleaner rural environment by making
intensive farming less economically attractive.
Independent estimates calculate that the reform could cut Ecu15bn-Ecu20bn
(Pounds 10.5bn-Pounds 14bn) off EC food bills, with 15-20 per cent cuts on
pork and poultry, 15 per cent reductions on beef, 7 per cent cheaper butter
and 3 per cent off bread.
Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister, predicted that a CAP reform
deal was 'more likely to be late tonight than next time'. Mr Louis Mermaz,
representing France, the EC's agri-superpower, said that in broad terms 'we
accept the proposal . . we are very satisfied'.
The main obstacle to a deal was a brewing north-south row over demands by
Italy, Spain and Greece for the right to produce more milk than they are
allowed under the EC quota system - which none of the three has rigorously
applied. Their partners appeared likely to concede to Spain and Greece, as
relative newcomers to the EC, but remained obdurate on Italy.
Ministers were last night taking turns to negotiate bilaterally, on this
issue and other loose ends, with the European Commission and EC presidency,
before regrouping for a final push at about 4am.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Arlindo Cunha,
Portuguese farm minister currently chairing the council of ministers,
reached a compromise yesterday morning which preserved the radical structure
of the Commission's blueprint and offered a number of sweeteners to farm
interests.
The reform includes subsidised prices cut towards world market levels, and
full compensation paid directly to the farmer. For all but small farmers
this refund is conditional on their taking 15 per cent of their land out of
production. This scheme should slice into oversupply while buttressing farm
incomes.
'What we are involved in here is a totally different philosophy to what has
existed for 30 years,' said Mr MacSharry.
The main cut is likely to be a 29 per cent reduction on the subsidised price
of cereals over three years. This will virtually eliminate the export
subsidies at the core of the Uruguay Round impasse and looks set to be
endorsed in spite of the misgivings of Germany, whose inefficient
agricultural sector has dictated the high prices of the CAP.
Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the German farm minister, appears to have come to this
meeting with instructions to do a deal, and last night said he was ready to
conclude the reform debate.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Major and Thatcher clash over Maastricht: Prime minister's
assurances contradicted by predecessor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLASH of views between Mr John Major and Mrs Margaret Thatcher over
Maastricht's impact on European Community powers last night jarred with
government attempts to control today's expected revolt by Tory MPs over the
treaty's ratification.
Mr Major's predecessor as prime minister flatly contradicted his assurance
to those Conservative MPs worried about a European super-state that
Maastricht 'marks the point at which, for the first time, we have begun to
reverse that centralising trend'.
In The European newspaper today, Mrs Thatcher writes that Maastricht 'passes
colossal powers from parliamentary governments to a central bureaucracy'.
Mr Major, like Mrs Thatcher, favoured stiff resistance to the threatened
loosening of UK border controls. But his comments amounted to a rebuff to
his predecessor, implying she had overseen moves towards centralisation,
while he had reversed the trend.
He said the 1986 Single European Act and its accompanying declaration
recognised Britain's concern to keep border controls in order to stop
terrorism, illegal immigration and drug smuggling.
Mr Major told Euro-sceptics that Britain would 'fight for that position'
even if the dispute went to the European court.
In her article, Mrs Thatcher said she was 'amazed when I hear it suggested
that it (the declaration) does not have the force of law and can be ignored.
Upholding it is a matter of good faith and good faith, once lost, is hard to
regain'.
Up to 20 or 30 Conservative MPs, some heartened by Mrs Thatcher's
interventions, together with possibly a higher number of rebel Labour MPs,
are expected to vote against the government tonight. One potential rebel, Mr
John Biffen, former Conservative cabinet minister, expressed 'considerable
reservations' about the centralising impact of Maastricht.
But the bill is likely to pass its second reading comfortably. Labour MPs
are supposed officially to abstain and Liberal Democrats will support it.
Government whips have stepped up the pressure particularly on new Tory MPs,
warning that careers would be wrecked by opposing, or abstaining on, the
bill.
Mr Major sought to appease critics, saying that 'what we kept out of the
Maastricht Treaty is as important as what is in the Treaty'. There was no
Social Chapter, no diminution of Nato's role, no word 'federal', and Britain
retained 'an absolute right' to decide in its own time whether to move to
the third stage of economic and monetary union.
He added: 'Many in this house and throughout the country have expressed
anxiety that decision-making in the Community is becoming too centralised.
In fact, many of the issues which are most problematic for us . . . are ones
that arise from the application of the original Treaty of Rome, not the
Maastricht Treaty.'
Mr Major stressed the importance of the legally binding text he secured at
Maastricht on 'subsidiarity' - the principle of decisions being made at the
lowest possible levels.
If necessary, Britain could take disputes over its implementation to the
European Court of Justice, he said - angering those Scottish Labour MPs
calling for devolution.
The prime minister quoted Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president,
as saying that, 'if a success is to be made of Maastricht and the single
market, the Commission will have to comply fully with the principle of
subsidiarity. Indeed its future existence depends on this'.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, urged the prime minister to end his
'opt-out' mentality. But the opposition front bench also had to face tough
criticism from its own Euro-sceptics as the debate continued.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (16): From office to mosque - Religious
affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HAMDI MERT's office, complete with the standard portrait of Ataturk above
his desk and the Turkish flag beside it, looks exactly like that of any
other senior government official.
With a departmental budget this year of TL 2.3 trillion (Pounds 200m) and
84,000 personnel, it is a substantial government department by Turkish
standards. A glance outside the window, however, at the giant dome of the
Kocatepe Mosque, complete with an inscription in Arabic letters, quickly
reminds visitors that Mr Mert's office is not quite like any other
department of state.
He is deputy president of the Department of Religious Affairs, the state
body which administers all Sunni Shi'ite religious activity in Turkey, but
is also a spiritual body. About 69,000 of the department's staff are hodjas
(clergymen) serving mosques.
From time to time, Mr Mert himself puts aside his grey suit and tie and dons
religious garb. He then leads prayers in the mosque (where the president and
prime minister may be among the worshippers) and delivers sermons.
Is this a contradictory situation in a state which claims to be secular? No,
says Mr Mert. He believes that some sort of secularism, in the sense of a
division of duties between spiritual and worldly affairs, arises naturally
from the Islamic religion itself.
His superior, the President of Religious Affairs (PRA) is a direct successor
of the Seyhulislam, the traditional head of the Sunni Islamic clergy in the
Ottoman Empire. Religious and political boundaries, as elsewhere in the
Middle East, tend to overlap.
As Mr Mert sees it, the duty of the PRA is to attend to the religious side
of citizen's lives and to instil a sense of unity. 'We are all Muslims,' he
says, 'no matter what particular rite of Islam we happen to observe.' He
also believes in inter-faith dialogue: the PRA holds meetings with
representatives of other religions, including Christianity, from time to
time.
'Turkey is the only secular country in the Muslim world. We Turks are both
Muslim and secular, but the west doesn't seem to accept this fact,' he says.
Some Christian clergy serving the less than 1 per cent of Turkish citizens
who are non-Muslims but include ancient and exotic linguistic groups such as
the Chaldians and Syriacs alongside the better-known Greeks and Syriacs,
challenge this view.
'How can you call a country secular where religious education is
compulsory?' asks one Catholic priest, pointing out that during the 1980s,
Islamic religious education in schools was made compulsory not just to
secular Turks but also for non-Muslims. After discreet lobbying by the
French, the obligation was suspended two years ago.
Mr Mert says, however, that he believes that religious instruction is a
moderating force. 'Religious fanatics tend to come from those who do not
attend the religious vocational schools,' he says.
There has been a steady expansion of religious education in Turkey over the
last decade. About 350,000 students are now enrolled in religious secondary
schools, alongside the western-style lycee system, and they are now allowed
to enter universities though not the military cadet schools afterwards.
Alarm at growing fundamentalism, however, is less strong in Turkey today
than it was before the Gulf War. Turkey's western middle class is no longer
as fearful as it once of being swamped in a tide of religious revivalism.
'Fundamentalism has peaked in this country,' says one Istanbul professor
confidently.
It is, nonetheless, still a powerful force. Religious groups collect funds
to sponsor mosque-building and religious schools in the Turkish-speaking
republics of the former Soviet Union.
Proposals to revive the fetva, a formal Islamic comment on whether a course
of action is correct or not from the religious point of view, were mooted
recently and strongly condemned in the press.
The High Islamic Council, a committee of senior clergy and theologians, has
also been reactivated after more than a decade. Mr Mert denies Turkish press
reports that the council is planning any kind of religious reformation,
something that some Turkish nationalists have hankered after since Ataturk's
days.
'Our religion is an unchanging system. We believe it is the final revealed
religion, so reform is out of the question,' he says.
He is more coy about a surprising initiative taken by the PRA in the last
six months: the opening of a formal dialogue with representatives of
non-Sunni Moslems in Turkey. About one in five of all Turks are Alevis, a
version of Twelver Shi'ism.
Alevis do not worship in mosques but in cemevis or community houses, where
food and wine are passed around, and members of the congregation speak in
turn, rather as in a Quaker meeting, and there is dancing.
In addition, Alevis have an awkward relationship with the state. They are
given no money to finance their mosques or clergy - and their children have
to receive Sunni religious instruction in school.
There are deeper tensions below the surface. Alevis strongly supported the
secularising reforms introduced by Ataturk and they tend to vote for
centre-left political parties against Turkey's right-wing majority.
Some Sunnis regard Alevis as non-Moslem (though Mr Mert says he is not among
them) and there were outbreaks of intercommunal fighting before the 1980
coup when Sunnis attacked Alevi immigrants in some towns.
The attacks were promptly and effectively suppressed by the Turkish
military, but they reawakened old communal memories going back to the day in
the 16th century when the Sultan Selim the Grim slaughtered 40,000 Alevis in
a single night, accusing them of support for the Ottoman empire's Iranian
enemies.
'Some sort of recognition will have to be given to this country's largest
religious minority before much longer,' says one Alevi intellectual in
Ankara. Cultural associations - such as one to commemorate the work of Pir
Sultan Abdal, a politically radical folk poet who was hanged by the Ottoman
authorities - are now emerging, where only a few years ago plays and poems
about Pir Sultan were officially banned.
The dialogue with the state has exposed differences inside the Alevi
Community between conservatives (who seem to favour the new dialogue) and
radicals who suspect the PRA's motives. The ancient tensions may be
disappearing, but they are doing so only slowly.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (17): The neighbours are suspicious - The
biggest project in the Mediterranean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST kilowatt of electricity is expected to be generated later this
year as engineers open the flood gates onto the first of the eight
Swiss-built turbines installed on the massive USDollars 4bn Ataturk dam
complex in southern Turkey.
This dazzling engineering achievement has become a symbol of Turkey's
industrial self-reliance and long-term planning. It has also engendered the
suspicion of Turkey's neighbours downstream on the Euphrates.
The south-east Anatolian project or Gap, as it sometimes better known, is
currently the largest development project in the Mediterranean. When fully
implemented, it will comprise 22 dams and 19 power stations, providing a
third of Turkey's projected energy needs. It will account for half of the
country's irrigated land, with around 1.7m hectares under irrigation. The
project and the services attracted to the area in its wake will create jobs
for some 5m people.
Since the foundation stones were laid in 1981 the Gap project has absorbed
USDollars 9bn. By 2005 Turkey is set to spend a further Dollars 23bn while
another Dollars 10bn will be needed to complete the project sometime in the
next century.
The burden on the Turkish economy has been enormous. To date, almost all of
the funds have been raised by the budget without the assistance of donors
wary of touching a project which involves a riparian dispute.
Indeed, many economists believe it has been the single largest factor behind
Turkey's 70 per cent rate of inflation. Every year, the Gap absorbs 10 per
cent of total government outlays, which does not include the subsidies and
investment incentives given to private business to move to the area. 'What
we would like to see is all the power stations complete by 2005,' says Mr
Olcay Unver, president of the Gap authority in Ankara.
The politicians also have few doubts. Both Turgut Ozal, the president and Mr
Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, are engineers. As a young electrical
engineer, Mr Ozal cut his teeth working on the Keban dam. For this reason,
the project seems destined to be finished.
When Gap was first conceived, it was seen primarily as a way of providing
alternative sources of energy in the wake of the 1972 oil crisis. The
project was also set to transform this dry south-eastern corner of Turkey.
Today, the environmental effects are less clear. The social and political
benefits have still to be demonstrated, but Turkey's large construction
groups have gained invaluable experience. This is now paying dividends in
former Soviet republics and other regions.
The centrepiece of the project is the Ataturk dam, the fifth largest in the
world. It is close to completion. 'We need two or three average years and
the reservoir will be full,' says Mr Mustafa Buke of the state hydraulic
corporation DSI.
Engineers estimate, given the unusually heavy snow fall this winter, that
the water level could reach the required 513 metres by November and the
first turbines could then be brought into action. The current level is
around 503 metres. When it reaches 526 metres, the twin Urfa tunnels will
start to irrigate some 250,000 hectares on the Haran plain close to the
Syrian border.
Officials no longer hold out great hopes that it will contribute much to
resolving the crisis for the region's Kurdish-speaking population. They seem
increasingly disenchanted with the politicians in Ankara and now provide
growing support for the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), fighting for a separate
state in south-east Turkey.
The social benefits are also being reassessed. Officials say they hope only
to be able to stabilise the current population and stem the trend of urban
migration which has had such a devastating effect on city services in
Istanbul and Izmir in recent years. It is not even certain that the project
will help hasten the redistribution of land. Many officials concede that as
the areas move to more intensive farming methods and the need for greater
scale economies, there may be a case for the concentration of land holdings,
giving the aghas or hereditary feudal landlords even more control over the
area.
Internationally, the Gap project has also met with criticism. In 1987 Turkey
and Syria signed a protocol which guaranteed that 500 cubic metres a second
would pass across the shared border. The agreement stipulates that the deal
will last for as long as the reservoir is being filled 'or until a permanent
sharing of the water can be agreed'. The sides have not met since July 1990,
before the Gulf War, the last occasion for the trilateral technical meeting
between Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Iraq in theory is due to host the next
meeting in Baghdad but, while its international isolation continues, that
may be some way off.
The Syrians' concern is that Turkey's plans could jeopardise the efficiency
of their own hydro-electric dams which provide 75 per cent of the country's
power generation. Damascus also worries about the downstream effects of
pollution if Turkey uses pesticides and fertilisers in its irrigated land.
It argues that the Ataturk dam will take all the rich silt from the water
and thus make it less useful for downstream irrigation.
However, Turkish officials point out with some justification that the
Syrians started work on their own Taqba dam some 10 years before the
foundations were laid for the Ataturk, with similar effects. The Syrians'
long-term fear is that water could be used as a political and strategic
weapon. This explains their reluctance to attend last year's planned
international water conference to have been held in Istanbul which was
consequently cancelled.
Because of Syrian misgivings, many of the prospective international donors
have fought shy of the Gap project. The World Bank extends close to Dollars
1bn to Turkey every year, but has rules which exclude it from lending on a
project involving a water dispute between riparian neighbours. Japan
withdrew a Dollars 600m irrigation proposal. A Japanese official confirmed
that Tokyo would be unable to extend financing until a solution was achieved
over the water issue.
'This water is not a present of nature. We have to import equipment to clear
the snow. This means spare parts. We have to employee people,' says Mr
Ferruh Anik, the director general of DSI. 'Every Turkish citizen has a tax
on his water. This is not free water. What the Syrians and Iraqis are
getting now: that's free water.'

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (14): What to eat - and where to find it -
Food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER RYAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S pistachio crop is in, and the barrows of Eminonu are weighed
down by these deliciously salty nuts. Fresh dates have arrived from Tunis in
the Misir Carsi - the Egyptian market.
In Pandeli's, high above the Spice Bazaar, where in Ottoman times the
merchants sat watching for the grain ships to arrive from Alexandria,
tourists are now eating artichokes so huge they simply discard the leaves.
They then tuck into Black Sea turbot and a quince compote doused in kaymak,
the clotted cream made from buffalos' milk in the Belgrade Forest nearby.
As the blossom of the Judas tree falls on the slopes of Eyup, the city's
cooks look forward to the new season's ingredients - 'Napoleon' cherries as
big as golfballs, figs from Izmir, and the wild Ottoman strawberries which
are ever harder to find.
Perhaps the prize ingredient is the aubergine, which finds its way onto
restaurant tables in hundreds of different guises - as 'Patlican Salatasi,'
a delicious wood-smoky paste, or 'Beykoz Kebab' where it is wrapped around
tender chunks of milk-fed lamb.
The best-known aubergine dish is the one swimming in olive oil, called 'Imam
Bayildi' which, so the story goes, caused the Imam to 'faint' it was so
mouthwatering.
The variety does not stop there. In winter you can find quail and woodcock,
and steaming cups of sahlep, a warming drink made from dried orchid root,
which they serve on the ferries. Best of all is the Lufer from the
Bosphorus. Some think this fish rivals the Scottish salmon. Stambouli's will
tell you it betters it.
Locals eat where they always have, in the numberless small lokantas
throughout the city. Businessmen still lunch at the Borsa near the old Stock
Exchange at Sirkeci, or at Haci Abdullah's and Haci Salih's on Istiklar,
formerly la Grande Rue de Pera. The better-heeled often go to the Divan
Hotel where the Circassian chicken should not be missed.
In Istanbul it will be hard to go hungry - there is always the Doner Kebab
sold at every street corner or the rows of charcoal braziers underneath the
Galata Bridge where grilled fish is served on bread still warm from the
ovens.
Turkey's food is as varied as the many subjects of its former Ottoman empire
 -refined and sophisticated after 500 years of culinary indulgence. Today it
is widely acknowledged as one of the world's great cuisines.
The Sheraton Tower on Taksim Square was one of the first to offer
traditional menus. Revan, its restaurant, is renowned, and today takes its
cooks from Bolu, a town still famous for supplying chefs to the palace
kitchens in Ottoman times.
Even the newcomers are waking up to what local cooking offers. Swiss Otel,
Kempinski and Movenpick have recently opened, and already provide a wide
range of international cuisine, from Chinese to French &amp; Japanese. The race
is now on to bring the glories of Ottoman cooking to their tables.
Kazan at Movenpick is set to open later in the summer. A Turkish restaurant
is also planned at the Swiss Otel, with its staggering view of Topkapi, the
Blue Mosque and Aya Sofia to the Sea of Mamara beyond - breathtaking at
sunset.
Kempinski has recently restored the Ciragan Palace where Mr Joachim Schmitt,
the food and beverage manager, is endeavouring to rediscover the court
cuisine of Istanbul.
Original recipes of the palace kitchens are being translated with the help
of 90-year-old grandmothers, today the only people who can still understand
the imperial Turkish.
The Ciragan could not be a more authentic location. This vast and ornate
19th century palace on the Bosphorus is where Sultan Abdul Hamid II kept his
unwanted brother locked up for 30 years - just about enough time to try out
the recipe books.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (12): Controversy on how to cut the deficit
 -Tax reform prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TONGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ONCE, all economists are in agreement. Turkey's yawning public sector
deficit is the key cause of today's inflation. But questions of precisely
how big the deficit is and how to reduce it leave the country  - and its
economists - divided.
Official Turkish statistics show a public sector borrowing requirement
equivalent to a record 13 per cent of GNP in 1991. World Bank calculations
which strip out the contributions of public sector banks and financial
institutions put the financing requirement higher still, at 14 per cent. If
inflation is allowed for, the figure falls to 8.4 per cent but still shows a
clear jump in 1991, as it did in the previous election year of 1987. Buying
votes is a traditional pastime for local politicians.
It was, in other words, a tainted chalice which the Demirel government
inherited. The new government quickly declared a 1992 target of reducing the
PSBR from 13 per cent to 8.8 per cent. It also decided that increasing tax
revenues would be the central plank of its policies. But there continues to
be a major controversy over whether the measures it has proposed are
adequate.
Initially, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the minister of state responsible for the
economy, talked of tax reform. One adviser, taking this message seriously,
suggested a new tax on wealth.
But this caused such an outcry that he left his job. It soon became clear
that major reforms would be left for the future and that the present would
concentrate on minor reforms such as a withholding tax on government
interest payments, and reducing the tax loopholes for banks. In addition,
the government announced a tax amnesty, a measure which attracted more
criticism than might have been expected given the fact that in the past two
decades Turkey has averaged one such amnesty every 28 months.
The amnesty helped the Treasury by bringing in revenues which would not
otherwise have been paid. Its effects were felt in April, but despite this,
at the beginning of this month, the Treasury's borrowings from Turkey's
Central Bank stood at TL26,000bn (Dollars 4bn), only 17 per cent below its
legal limit for the year as a whole. The public sector thus finds itself
with its back to the wall and facing a simple but awkward choice.
Does it increase its borrowings from its domestic capital markets, thereby
driving up interest rates at a time when it is seeking to reduce inflation?
Or does it increase the prices of goods and services produced by the state -
which also makes inflation look as if it is rising?
A tax reform might alter the ground rules. At present the overall level of
taxation is around 19 per cent of GNP, around one half of the OECD average
of 37 per cent. Further, while there are a few highly publicised top tax
payers, including Madame Manukiyan, the local brothel queen, the large rural
population is exempt from direct taxation. Further, indirect taxation
accounts for a disproportionate share of tax revenue.
However, the underlying issue which the present government, like all its
predecessors, has yet to face, is the extreme overstaffing of the central
government and associated state economic enterprises. The Turkish prime
minister is, directly and indirectly, probably the largest employer in the
west. Ankara's present privatisation programme appears unlikely to alter
this.
Attempts to balance Turkey's budget are likely to remain a key issue
throughout the 1990s and inflation to prove a stubborn target.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (15): Take a fiver for a visa -
Businessman's guide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Travel
FOR THE European businessman reaching Turkey is easy, involving just a short
flight and a range of routes and airlines, including the much-improved
Turkish Airlines. The British are particularly well served, with Londoners
able to choose whether to travel and then work half the day, or vice versa.
But the British have to obtain a visa, which requires giving a Pounds 5 note
 -no cheques accepted - to the police officer on arrival.
Inside Turkey, Istanbul and Ankara are connected by regular air services
and, for the more curious, an overnight train. In winter the train is
recommended, not least because those who chose the site of Ankara's airport
disregarded a shepherd's warning that he often lost his sheep in the fog.
Other cities are also accessible by air, at reasonable prices.
On land, car hire is expensive, but taxis are cheap. Make sure the driver
restarts his meter, and do not be surprised when those in Ankara charge the
night rate for travel to and from the airport. Do be surprised, however, if
the driver understands your destination. He may well be from out of town
and, unlike his London counterpart, will not have had to do 'the knowledge'.
The A-Z of Istanbul is a good investment. It will also help you minimise
your time in the town's impressive traffic jams.
Accommodation
No longer a problem in any of the major cities in Turkey. In Istanbul, the
Swissotel and on the Bosporus, the Kempinski, are impressive while the
Hilton and Sheraton have their devotees. Also just opening, are a Movenpick
and Conrad. Good value can be obtained at the Divan, Marmara and Nippon. In
Ankara, the Hilton and Sheraton rise side by side, with the Sheraton well
served by the Ankara Business Centre. (Tel 420 3040).
Telecommunications
These are now good, with direct dial available from most hotel rooms.
However, the Turkish PTT likes to challenge the user's ingenuity. Its latest
move has been to change all Ankara numbers beginning with 1 so they now
begin with 4 and all Istanbul numbers beginning with 1 so that they now
begin with 2.
Contacts
Most major Western countries have commercial sections at both their
embassies in Ankara - chasing state contracts - and their consulates in
Istanbul. There are a number of Chambers of Commerce, of which the French is
among the most active, and the British is good on agency information. The
Austrian and German federations of industry have representatives in
Istanbul. The Americans are also strong.
On the Turkish side, foreign investors are advised to contact Yased, the
Association of Foreign Capital Co-ordination (Tel 272 5094), and foreign
traders, to explore the range of services offered by DEIK, the Foreign
Economic Relations Council (Tel 243 4180), which is particularly strong on
relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Independent consultants and research companies include IBS who are also
authors of the 600-page service, Doing Business in Turkey (Tel. 231 0481).
Other publications worth following are the OECD's annual surveys on Turkey;
the monthlies - Business International's Turkey Monitor (London 071 493
6711) and the independent Turkey Monitor (London 081 881 3199), and
Cornucopia, a striking Istanbul arts and life magazine (Istanbul 248 3607).
Entertainment
The Bosporus and old Istanbul are unique. Leave time to wander up and round
them, or call on the Kahriye with its superb mosaics on the way to the
airport. Ankara has less to offer but its castle and Museum of Anatolian
Civilisations are interesting.

TURKS HAVE been living with high inflation for so long that they tend to
take it for granted. Yet nowhere does the damage to the economy show more
clearly than in the country's stock exchange at Istanbul.
The market was set up in its present form in 1986 and, despite Turkish
misgivings about unfettered capitalism, the bourse has established itself as
a permanent feature of the country's business scene. Small investors quickly
took to the idea that there are times when company stock can offer a better
return than more familiar investments in gold, foreign currency, or one-year
bank deposits.
The number of companies whose shares are traded and the number of shares
traded has also been rising rapidly. The average number of shares traded
each day rose from 6,224 in 1990 to 18,345 in 1991.
Despite the striking increase in volumes, the market's best days came as
long ago as the summer of 1989 when it was one of the best-performing
markets anywhere. The last notable rally was in February last year. For most
of the first quarter of this year, the index has lingered around the 4,000
mark.
In April, Turkey was stuck at the bottom of the emerging markets performance
chart. Yet the country has obvious investor potential. Why the lacklustre
performance?
For much of the winter, political uncertainty was widely given as part of
the reason for the market's sluggishness. But Mr Demirel and his team have
turned out not to be foes of the exchange. Quite the opposite: the coalition
government plans to raise more funds than its predecessor did through
privatisation operations.
The main reason for the market's dull performance is that local investors -
most of them small short-term investors - have been putting their money into
other investments, ranging from treasury bonds to foreign currency deposits,
which offer a better return under present circumstances.
Considering that Turkey had something of a recession last year in which
manufacturing industry grew by only 2.6 per cent (a dire figure by the
standards of the last two decades), things might be worse.
There have been few share price collapses, but cement companies, the market
star performers in 1991, have done less well recently, and food and beverage
stocks have tended to lead the market.
All this is fairly discouraging to foreign investors, at least for the time
being. 'They are going to be loath to invest in Turkey until they see some
sign of a sustainable decrease in the country's inflation rate,' says Mr
Peter Bennett, portfolio manager of Morgan Stanley's Turkish Investment Fund
which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
He believes that sooner or later, Turkey will have to follow most of the
Latin American countries and take steps to bring down inflation and that
until then the market will not be able to tap its full potential.
That would mean a government decision to bring inflation well below 20 per
cent: something which does not seem to be in prospect at the moment, even
though some economists forecast a slight dip in Turkish inflation by the
year end.
Meanwhile the government has pushed through legislation which should help
the market grow. Companies will be able to raise funds by issuing futures
and asset-backed securities provided they have an approved rating.
The Capital Markets Board will be given new powers to curb irregularities by
brokerage houses, including the issue of forged share certificates.
Abuses such as insider dealing will become punishable for the first time and
independent auditors will be made responsible for any deficiencies in
company accounts.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (10): Cities try to close gap with Europe -
The quality of life in Ankara and Istanbul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 11m of Turkey's 58m inhabitants live in two cities, Ankara, the
national capital, and Istanbul, Turkey's main business centre and largest
city.
The citizens of Ankara and Istanbul make up the overwhelming majority of
Turkey's political and business class, its civil service and intelligentsia,
and its growing consumer middle class. They also pay most of the country's
taxes.
Until the late 1980s, however, it is probably fair to say that conditions in
both cities were more reminiscent of the third world than of the typical
European metropolis. Migration from the countryside enlarged their
populations by around 6 or 7 per cent each year. Most of the new arrivals
lived in vast shanty-town districts.
Services and urban infrastructure were correspondingly poor. Interruptions
in water and electricity supplies were more or less routine. Public
transport was limited and there was little public housing development or
planning.
Since the late 1980s, this picture has been changing. For a start, the pace
of migration has slackened slightly, though Ankara's 2.8m inhabitants are
still growing by an estimated 100,000 a year and Istanbul's 8m population
rises by over 6 per cent annually.
More importantly, the population of the two cities has come to expect
improved services. In both Ankara and Istanbul, social democrat mayors are
struggling to improve basic utilities such as water, sewerage, gas supply
and transport.
There have been some striking successes. The previous Motherland party
administration in Istanbul under former Mayor Bedrettin Dalan (who has since
switched parties and represents Istanbul for the ruling True Path party in
the present parliament) installed the city's first ever sewage treatment
plant and managed to improve the water supply.
In Ankara, the city's council, under a joint venture with British Gas, has
fitted 200,000 homes to take Siberian natural gas. A second stage is planned
shortly. As a result, this winter was Ankara's first without heavy air
pollution for half a century.
'My aim is to bring conditions in Ankara at least to the level of the
nearest European capital cities, such as Athens, over the next three to five
years. Ankara is going to be one of the best cities in the region,' says Mr
Murat Karayalcin, the capital's mayor.
In pursuit of this goal, Mr Karayalcin has drawn up a masterplan to take the
city, until now something of a Cinderella among those in the Mediterranean
basin, through to 2015 and is embarking on a range of projects, from a light
rail system and metro through to a new cultural and exhibition centre.
The city's annual budget of TL7 trillion (Dollars 1.2bn) includes investment
spending of between TL2-3 trillion. Spending on infrastructure has overtaken
that on new housing for the first time in Ankara's post-war history.
Revenues come almost entirely from a central government block grant:
municipalities in Turkey have very limited ability to raise cash through
local taxes.
The Ankara metropolitan municipality has also started tapping syndicated
loans on the international market and earlier this year raised Dollars 230m
in bonds and now has a credit rating in Frankfurt and Tokyo.
The challenge of developing Ankara, however, is relatively modest compared
with Istanbul, a city which takes in up to 500,000 rural migrants a year and
which has become a vast sprawling megalopolis, part of a conurbation in
which one can drive for over 50 miles without seeing the countryside.
'We would like to see the government developing new industrial centres in
other parties of Turkey such as Zonguldak and Bolu and in the eastern Black
Sea around Trabzon and Artvin to take some of the migrant pressure off
Istanbul,' says Mr Icen Bortucene, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's
deputy secretary-general.
Istanbul's development budget this year will be around TL5.9 trillion, and
it already has an international debt burden inherited from the mid-1980s,
costing it around Dollars 600m a year to service.
'It is relatively small. We certainly are not fearful about further foreign
borrowing for important projects,' says Mr Bortucene.
Asked how the city plans to spend its cash, Mr Bortucene has a simple
answer. 'We want to make life less intolerable for the ordinary citizen.
Quite simple investments in transport for example could stop large numbers
of our people losing up to three hours a day travelling to work and back.
Transport at present is so poor that sometimes you see clerical workers
hitching lifts to and from work.'
Like Ankara, Istanbul is also building its own light rail mass transport. A
first stage of 8km has already been completed and work is currently under
way to build a 26km extension. Work on a second tramway system also starts
this month, while the city's bus fleet has taken on an extra 800km capacity
with the purchase of a 845 new buses.
Again like Ankara, Istanbul's planners are ambitious. The city is competing
with other international cities to host the Olympic games early in the next
century.
'We want Istanbul to be a world metropolis, serving not only Turkey but also
the world as a whole. Its international economic, trading and political
importance has changed enormously since the break up of Soviet Union,' says
Mr Bortucene.
Shortage of cash is, however, not the only problem standing in the city's
way. The sprawling megalopolis is run by an equally unwieldy administration,
working more or less along Ottoman lines with paper dossiers travelling
slowly between departments inside the city's vast municipal headquarters.
Reliable statistics are scarce. Istanbul does not appear to have the tightly
focused urban development plans which have been produced in Ankara. It also
has other problems - including a powerfully entrenched local underworld or
mafia - which if it exists at all in the capital is far less effective.
Mr Bortucene believes some sort of administrative overhaul is long overdue,
especially in management and information technology. 'We lack a good
management information system, especially where specific projects are
concerned,' he says.
Just how swiftly such changes can be achieved remains to be seen. On the
other hand, Istanbul is a genuinely powerful and rich industrial city, where
average per capita income is around Dollars 10,000, much closer to the
income levels of a developed country than to those of the rest of Turkey -
even if income distribution is highly uneven.
That fact seems to be slowly driving the city to close the gap with Europe.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (11): Aiming to rise to the top - Profile,
Mayor Karayalcin of Ankara
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW JOBS in Turkey are quite as thankless as that of mayor of Ankara.
Trying to satisfy the insatiable expectations an electorate for rapid
benefits in the quality of life while having to rely on inadequate financial
and administrative resources is a daunting prospect for even the most
ambitious politician.
None of the mayors of the Turkish capital in the last 15 years has served
more than one term in office and none has made a successful transition to
national politics.
Even Mr Bedrettin Dalan, the ultra-popular Motherland party mayor of
Istanbul in the 1980s, sits as a backbencher in Mr Demirel's True Path
party.
At seven o'clock in the evening on a typical working day, Mr Murat
Karayalcin, Ankara's social democratic mayor, still has a chaotic and
gruelling schedule ahead of him.
Crowds of visitors mill around in the anteroom to the mayor's office. The
streets outside are even more chaotic: in normal times they are the main
arteries for the city's traffic.
Now, they have been closed to traffic for months. Only a few of them will
make it to the relative calm of the mayor's inner sanctum, a grandiose
dark-panelled room inherited by Mr Karayalcin from his predecessors.
Once inside they meet a quiet, unpretentious social democrat, who plays down
political antagonisms between himself and his predecessors and has more the
flavour of the civil servant or technocrat about him than that of Tammany
Hall.
Yet Mr Karayalcin is clearly an ambitious man, who is pledged to making
Ankara one of the best cities in the region and is widely tipped as an
eventual leader of Turkey's social democrats some day if he ever does make
the transition to national politics.
Meanwhile Mr Karayalcin is trying to leave lasting imprint on a teeming city
of 2.8m people. Though much smaller and more orderly than Istanbul, Ankara
lacks some of its rival's advantages: it is not primarily a business centre
but an administrative capital. There is much less wealth around and also a
less glittering cultural life, though Ankara has been a large and important
city since pre-Roman times.
Like most of his voters, Mr Karayalcin was not born in the city he now
presides over, but was brought up on the Black Sea coast, arriving in Ankara
in his late teens for high school and university.
He cut his political teeth in student politics in the late 1960s and early
1970s and graduated from the political science faculty of Ankara University,
the training ground of the Turkish civil service.
In the middle 1970s, he spent two years at the institute of development
studies of the University of East Anglia in the UK studying urban-biased
models for economic development. He retains fairly strong links with the UK.
When the social democrats were in office in Turkey at the end of the 1970s,
Mr Karayalcin became an undersecretary in the Ministry of Rural Affairs and
then worked in the city's municipal administration and was appointed head of
Batikent, a large co-operative housing development on the west of Ankara,
organising the construction of 200,000 housing units.
The aim behind the Batikent project was to develop services and housing well
outside the traditional boundaries of Ankara and so relieve pressure on the
congested centre of the city.
A year or two after the project got going, the 1980 Turkish military coup
swept away the country's civilian political system.
The social democrat mayor of Ankara was replaced by a retired general whose
most striking action as the capital's mayor was to order that all the houses
in the citadel should be painted blue, apparently to discourage rodents.
Mr Karayalcin kept a low profile through the years of military rule and
unlike almost every other social democrat official managed to remain at his
post. The Batikent project moved ahead.
When democracy began to make a gradual return to Turkey in 1983, Mr
Karayalcin rejected advances from the Motherland party and joined the
newly-founded Social Democracy Populist party (SHP) of Mr Erdal Inonu and in
1989, he ran successfully for mayor. He has generally supported Mr Inonu,
rather than his rivals in the fierce factional in-fighting which dogs the
SHP.
'Life is difficult at the moment for social democrats all over the world,
not just in Turkey,' says Mr Karayalcin. 'We have to work out some sort of
practical response to the ideological challenges we are facing.'
As mayor however Mr Karayalcin's sights have been set on less contentious
matters such as infrastructural projects, ranging from the conversion of
Ankara's gas supply to natural gas to new light rail and road systems. He is
a good administrator and the changes have meant less disruption to the daily
life of the capital's population than has been the case in Istanbul.
Nevertheless, his fortunes are clearly bound up with the future of Turkey's
ailing and bitterly divided social democratic movement.
Mr Karayalcin sees a fresh chance to reunite it in current efforts to revive
the pre-1980 Republican People's Party, shut down along with other parties
by the military junta in 1981 in what Mr Karayalcin describes as a legal
disaster.
'Its closure was a mistake and putting it right would be a suitable
opportunity to reunite the left-of-centre in Turkey,' the mayor says.
Founded by Ataturk, modern Turkey's founder and national hero, in 1923, the
RPP was Turkey's largest party in the 1970s and none of its post-coup
successors has ever managed fully to take its place. The parliamentary
centre-left in Turkey is currently divided into four or five bickering
factions, split between three parties.
So does Mr Karayalcin plan to go into national politics? Asked directly
about his intentions, he replies cautiously: 'A politician always has to be
ready to take on any position and rise in his own party as high as he
possibly can.'
If he ever does go into parliament, he may eventually emerge as a consensus
candidate for the eventual succession to Mr Inonu. But that is unlikely to
be in the lifetime of the present parliament. In the meantime, Mr Karayalcin
will have his work cut out making Ankara into the fairest capital city of
the Mediterranean.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (8): Banks start to catch up - The growth
potential of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE ARE the 73rd bank in the country,' explains Mr Ibrahim Betil, chairman
and chief executive of Bank Ekspres, a new Turkish bank which has just
opened its doors in Istanbul's business district.
Until last year, Mr Betil was general manager of Garanti Bankasi, one of
Turkey's larger private sector banks.
Then he decided to strike out on his own, raising Dollars 16m in capital
from a group of like-minded private investors, a move which is something of
a novelty in Turkey where private sector banks tend to be offshoots of an
industrial empire owned by a single individual or family.
Over the next five years his game plan is to target medium-sized corporate
customers and the retail banking market and build up a branch network of
between 40 and 50 branches, thereby establishing Bank Ekspres as one of the
main players in the Turkish market.
It is an extremely ambitious goal even for a banker who is already
well-known in his own market. Mr Betil, however, is not alone in believing
in the growth potential of the Turkish market where each year sees a few
more hopefuls, usually one-branch trade finance boutiques, being granted
banking licences.
Why is there so much interest in a banking sector whose operating
conditions, judged by the standards of the rest of the world, look extremely
daunting?
Because of Turkey's runaway inflation, interest levels are almost
stratospheric. The inter-bank overnight interest rate at the end of April
was 66.7 per cent. One-year retail deposits can earn up to 81 per cent from
some banks and US dollar deposits 11 per cent. Corporate borrowers pay
between 100 and 120 per cent. Borrowing rates have actually fallen in the
last year because customers are hard to find.
The margin may look still wide but it isn't. According to Mr Erol Sabanci,
vice-chairman of Akbank, Turkey's most profitable bank, required reserves,
taxes and staff costs eat up nine-tenths of every hundred lira held by a
Turkish bank. 'Deposit costs are just not under control,' Mr Sabanci says.
Banks make money not by lending but by holding treasury bonds or other
operations of which trade finance is the most lucrative. There is,
nevertheless, frantic competition for deposits, especially from the smaller
banks.
Deposit rate competition was introduced in Turkey in the late 1980s. Though
the large banks currently pay between 71 and 73 per cent on one-year
deposits (and between 55 and 60 per cent even on one-month money), the
smaller banks can beat this by as much as six percentage points.
Not surprisingly, once in a while savers get nervous in this market. In
early January, savers lined up outside branches of one of the smaller
Istanbul banks. The scare proved groundless and short-lived, but quite a few
savers seem to have been willing to forgo a year's interest just to get
their money back.
There have been no actual bank failures since the first half of the 1980s,
though the treasury monitors each bank's balance sheet and from time to time
stages discreet operations to help banks out of trouble.
There can also be other surprises. In mid-April, Ziraat, the state-owned
agriculture bank which is Turkey's largest, abruptly moved its rates to
depositors up by two percentage points, to the dismay of its main
competitors, Akbank and Turkiye Is Bankasi. Just why Ziraat selected this
moment to move seems to be something of a puzzle.
Mr Sabanci identifies high operational costs and low working capital as
chronic problems of the banking sector. In theory, all Turkish banks are now
moving gradually towards the international standards set by the BIS for
capital adequacy.
In practice, the strengths of the banks are rather more difficult to assess.
Ziraat this year has moved, for example, from being audited by the Turkish
offshoot of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to a small local accountancy house.
Mr Sabanci points out that the capital bases of many of Turkey's larger
banks look distinctly less impressive when real estate and equity holdings
are deducted, though this is not a requirement under the BIS rules.
The fact that the Turkish banking sector can be measured against
international standards is, nevertheless, a sign of how far it has come in
the last decade - and its success not just in piloting its way through a
hyperinflationary environment, but also in coping with high levels of
non-performing corporate debt throughout the 1980s.
Though most banks are still owned by industrial groups, there are some
changes in attitudes towards non-banking subsidiaries. Turkiye Is Bankasi,
for example, has sold off stakes in three subsidiaries in the past two
years, including most recently its stake in Unilever's Turkish offshoot,
which went to the international parent company for an undisclosed price.
Most of the infrastructure of a modern banking sector has been set in place,
though foreign bankers identify some continuing weaknesses.
'Taxes on inter-bank transactions are still holding back the inter-bank
market. With taxes on transactions and volumes, not on revenues, you do not
get a deep inter-bank market and without that bankers cannot develop
derivative products and sophisticated financial instruments to eliminate
costs,' says one American bank in Istanbul.
However, some parts of the banking sector are becoming much more like large
banks in a modern country. Akbank, set up after World War II, has already
overtaken the other large private sector and the public sector banks in
profitability and will probably pass in them in asset size in a few more
years.
It has a notably less bureaucratic atmosphere than that which still prevails
among some of its rivals. At one of Turkey's largest banks last month, the
deputy chief executive folded his arms and confessed nervously to the
Financial Times: 'I am just an appointed clerk. You can't expect me to be
able to comment on anything.'
But at the retail end of the market, changes are under way, driven by the
emergence of a consumer middle class and expectations of higher standards of
service than in the past.
The dozen or so largest banks are developing modern cheque clearing and
money transmission houses. An automated clearing house is being set up with
a pilot stage in Istanbul which will offer clearing one day in Istanbul and
three days across the entire country.
A new inter-bank electronic funds transfer scheme began operating on April 1
for corporate and retail customers, and BKM, an inter-bank ATM network
service, has also been launched.
Turkey has virtually nothing in the way of credit reference services. So a
limited debit card service which is being set up operates with all
transactions being authorised by computer at the point of sale.
Nevertheless, the plastic card market is growing rapidly. BKM expects that
there will be around 10m cards, the vast majority of them cashcards for use
in automatic teller machines, in circulation by the end of this year.
That sort of rapid expansion, originally led by the Yapi ve Kredi bank, is
proving to be more profitable than the other large banks expected.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (9): Where cost control counts - Profile,
Akbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BE THEY large or small, most Turkish banks operate from glitzy modern
headquarters designed to suggest vast opulence. Not so Akbank. Its
headquarters are a distinctly unpretentious 1950s building on a busy street
in Istanbul's Findikli district.
'The moment you set foot in that building you know you are in an environment
where cost control counts,' says one foreign banker in the city.
Eschewing the glitter, Ak, set up in 1948 and owned by the Sabanci Group,
one of Turkey's two main conglomerates, has set its sights over the past two
decades firmly on containing its costs and raising its profits. In doing so,
it has risen from the ranks of the smaller and medium-sized banks with 30
branches to become of the dominant players in the country's financial system
with 599 branches.
Still smaller by asset size than its main competitors, Turkey Bankas and
Yapi ve Kredi, Akbank was still far ahead of both last year with TL1,342bn
(Dollars 265m) in post-tax profits, up from TL733bn in 1991. Assets at the
end of 1991 were Dollars 3.65bn.
For the past seven years, Akbank has come out ahead of the rest of the
banking market in terms of net profit. Return on average assets was 9.17 per
cent last year and return on equity 57.7 per cent, figures which places
Akbank well ahead of many other European banks and not just its Turkish
competitors.
'It is fairly clear now that Akbank is on the way to becoming dominant in
the Turkish financial services sector,' says the general manager of another
Istanbul bank.
The results are achieved by fairly old-fashioned banking methods, combined
with a determination to see the bank and its profits grow. 'Other banks tend
to be satisfied with their results. We are not content,' says Mr Erol
Sabanci, the bank's vice-chairman and dominant figure.
During the mid-1980s, when most Turkish banks ran into trouble by lending to
companies which could not pay them back, Akbank managed to keep its
non-performing loans below 1 per cent of its loan book or less: no mean
achievement for a bank which is owned by and closely associated with a large
industrial group.
'We have known most of our customers for 20 or 25 years. We tend to be
cautious about lending to new businesses unless we are very sure about what
sort of management they have behind them,' says Mr Sabanci.
The same caution applies to new types of banking business into which Akbank
has moved in the past decade. It entered the field of trade finance and
merchant banking for example, by setting up a joint venture with Banque
Nationale de Paris and Dresdner Bank. In the UK it has a subsidiary, the
first Turkish bank in London, Ak International, with paid up capital of 65m.
When it became clear at the end of the 1980s that large Turkish banks would
have to invest heavily in money transmission and information technology in
order to tap the potential of an emerging domestic retail banking market, Ak
watched and waited to see how the experiments of its rivals would fare.
'There are advantages in going second or third into a new market,' says Mr
Akin Kozanoglu, the bank's head of retail operations and information
technology. 'We were doubtful whether or not automated teller machines would
be appropriate in Turkey for example,"
Once convinced that there were indeed profits to be made in retail banking,
Ak pushed ahead, setting up a network of 300 ATMS and spending up to Dollars
100m a year on software development, through its own software house, Aknet,
and developing on-line real time computerised links with all its branches.
As a result Akbank customers now enjoy some facilities not generally
available to European consumers: for example, they can dial a debit card
number and learn the balance of their account over the telephone.
The move into modern retail banking has brought other changes, especially in
the bank's management structure.
'Akbank used frankly to be a one-man show, with most of its top managers
relatively insignificant figures compared to Erol Sabanci,' says another
banker. 'You can see that he is now consciously trying to replace the
one-man show with young executives who are intended to be the backbone of a
new management team for the future.'
It may sound like a potentially difficult transition for a bank which was
only a small family business little more than a generation ago. But other
bankers point to the strong corporate culture which Mr Sabanci has developed
at Akbank.
'Akbank executives rarely move to other banks, and they tend to understand
what is expected of them much better than bankers in the other large banks.
It is an old-fashioned outlook, but also a very tightly focused one. If you
want to explain why Ak is probably going to go on outperforming the
competition, I think that tight focus is the main reason,' says one banker.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (7): Patience is a virtue - Relations with
the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAGA of Turkey's relationship with the European Community is now nearly
30 years old, but the final outcome is still unclear. The reasons behind the
failure to consummate this long and often difficult courtship are anything
but simple. A complex mixture of economic, political and even ideological
factors continues to bar the Community's door to the entry of a country
whose strategic value to the west was already indisputable during the cold
war and whose geopolitical importance has, if anything, increased following
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Communist system.
Successive Turkish governments, basing themselves on the argument that the
EC-Turkey Association agreement of 1963 specifically mentioned the
possibility of Turkey's eventual accession to the Community after a 22-year
transitional period, have never wavered in their ultimate objective. They
have insisted that by virtue of its strategic geographical situation, its
major contribution to western defence and the secular vocation bequeathed to
it by the founder of the modern Turkish state, Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's
fundamental eligibility for full membership could not be questioned.
Most EC member states, however, have never adopted such a straightforward
attitude. Though they have not said so frankly, it is an open secret that
there have always been serious reservations in the Community about the
desirability, or even feasibility, of integrating an Islamic state in the
EC. For Turkish President Turgut Ozal, that is the real reason why his
country has made so little headway in its attempts to join the Community and
that all the other obstacles enumerated by the Community are no more than
pretexts.
President Ozal is doubtless as mistaken in his incomplete analysis as those
who claim that Turkey's Moslem religion is a factor of no importance or
relevance whatsoever. Turkey's chequered political history over the past
three decades, including a military coup as recently as 1980, its poor human
rights record over much of the period, its relative underdevelopment, its
failure to implement some of the key provisions of the association agreement
and its protectionist economy, all provided sufficient grounds for putting
off any decision on its membership.
All these considerations, together with others of a much wider nature
arising out of the profound changes that had taken place in Europe following
the collapse of communism and the desire to give priority in the EC's
enlargement policy to the European Free Trade Association and eastern
European countries, were set out in the European Commission's 'opinion' at
the end of 1989 on Turkey's formal application for membership made two years
earlier.
Most of the points made are as valid now as they were two years ago. The
Commission stressed that, since 1980, the Turkish economy had made 'a
remarkable leap forward'. Its GDP had increased by an average of 5.2 per
cent a year for the period 1981-88, compared with only 2 per cent for the
Twelve. Indeed, it reached more than 9 per cent in 1990, before falling back
to about 2 per cent last year. Exports, including notably manufactures, had
increased very rapidly and their structure had been diversified. And in 1988
Turkey had managed for the first time since the war to register a current
account surplus, a result which was to be reversed two years later, however.
So much for the good news in the Commission's 'opinion'. The other side of
the coin was that, with a fast-rising population which would eventually be
greater than that of any Community member state - an estimated 68m in the
year 2000 - Turkey's general development was substantially lower than the
European average. Purchasing power was still only one-third of the Community
average. Both its industry and agriculture were characterised by very major
structural disparities, the level of industrial protectionism was very high,
while social protection was much lower than in the EC. In addition, the rate
of inflation was several times higher than in the Community - an
understatement, given that it reached 70 per cent last year, and only
marginally less the previous two years - and the rate of unemployment was
extremely high.
For good measure, the Commission threw in a number of political reasons why
it would be inopportune for Turkey to be granted early membership. While
conceding that Turkey now had a parliamentary democracy 'closer to Community
models', and that it had made progress in the human rights field and the
respect for minorities, 'these had not yet reached the level required in a
democracy'. It also stressed that the various disputes with Greece, in
particular over Cyprus, were additional obstacles to Turkish membership.
In short, the Commission concluded that it was not convinced that the
adjustments which would confront Turkey if it were to become a Community
member could be overcome in the medium term, despite the positive features
of recent developments in Turkey.
Whereas it was difficult to argue with many of the Commission's economic
arguments, the Turks were particularly irritated by the fact that the
Commission was laying down a new set of ground rules for the opening of
membership negotiations with Ankara. By stressing that it could not take any
decision until after the implementation of the Single European Act in 1993
and until it had fully examined the implications of enlargement for the
further development of the Community, taking into account all actual or
potential applications for membership, the Commission appeared to have found
a new reason for stalling. Indeed, Ankara rightly concluded it was being
relegated in the list of applicants behind Efta and the Eastern European
countries.
If Mr Suleyman Demirel's government has recently adopted a more
philosophical attitude towards EC membership, it is partly because the new
administration is more realistic than its predecessors about the substantial
macro-economic and structural adjustments that still need to be made before
Turkey can participate in a European economic and monetary union and before
its industry, except for the modern textile sector, can face the full blast
of EC competition. Turkey's new status as a pole of attraction and role
model for the new central Asian republics, with which it shares a common
cultural, linguistic and religious tradition, has also given it a fresh
regional political and economic vocation.
While no Turkish politician or official seriously believes that there is any
real long-term alternative to membership of the EC, which already provides a
market for 53 per cent of Turkish exports and is the source of 48 per cent
of its imports, it is now accepted in Ankara that Turkey is unlikely to
become a full member of the Community until the early part of the next
century.
Its hopes, in the meantime, reside in the 'substantial measures' proposed by
the European Commission to help Turkey's economic and political
modernisation process and to prepare the path to its eventual membership.
These include the completion by the beginning of 1996 of a customs union
between the EC and Turkey, the activation of the Association Agreement's 4th
Financial Protocol providing Turkey with Ecu600m (Pounds 420m) of financial
aid, the full association of Turkey with the EC's Mediterranean programme
and the stepping up of the Community's industrial and technological aid to
Turkey.
Most of the member countries are no longer prepared to tolerate the
political veto of some of the most important of these measures by Greece,
which has linked them to a settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Though not denying the importance of a Cyprus solution for Turkey's
long-term links with the Community, Britain, which takes over the EC
presidency in the second half of this year, is particularly anxious to
revitalise the EC's relationship with Turkey as quickly as possible. Indeed,
there is a growing feeling in Community countries that Turkey has reaped a
poor reward for its steadfast loyalty to the western alliance and that
Ankara needs to be reassured that it has not been permanently rejected by
the European partners it has wooed for so long.

   ONCE ONE of the world's great imperial powers, Turkey
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
like Britain and France - has never lost its conviction that it has a
special role to play in international affairs. Yet, in spite of its
strategic position at the hinge of Europe and Asia, these ambitions have
been frustrated since the final collapse of the Ottoman empire in 1923, by
Turkey's economic under-development, its political instability including
three military coups in the last 30 years and the restraints imposed on its
freedom of action by the military might of its former Soviet neighbour.
True to the ideas of the founder of the modern Turkish state, Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, Turkey has consistently attempted to project a western, secular
image, in spite of the fact that the vast majority of its inhabitants are
Moslems. Until very recently, however, its western allies have looked upon
it essentially as a rampart against Soviet military expansion, rather than
as an equal partner sharing their own democratic principles and traditions.
The considerable progress that has been made over the last few years to
transform Turkey into a genuine multi-party democracy, a market economy and
a society in which civil liberties and human rights are guaranteed are
beginning to change international perceptions, in spite of continuing
criticisms of the government's treatment of the country's Kurdish minority.
The European Community's gates will probably remain shut to Turkey until the
beginning of the next century (the reasons for which are examined in the
other article on this page). But, at a time when Turkey's international
credibility can no longer be based mainly on its former cold war role of
anti-Communist bastion and defender of Nato's south-eastern flank, it has
suddenly emerged as an invaluable partner of the west in preserving regional
political stability and preventing Iran from extending its influence and its
particular brand of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the area.
The Turks have found completely new foreign policy horizons opening up in
the aftermath of the cold war and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which
has led to the independence of central Asian republics, such as Azerbaijan,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. All these
republics, with the exception of Tajikistan, speak Turkic languages and
share a common cultural and religious tradition with Turkey. Though they
have shown no desire - as yet, at least - to become part of a pan-Turkic
union, they look upon Turkey, with its comparatively advanced economy and
mixed secular, Islamic tradition, as a model they would like to follow.
Their overtures have been followed up with alacrity by Ankara. Turkey has
offered help to modernise the central Asian states' telecommunications and
transport networks, has started beaming special Turkish-language TV
programmes to its 'sister states,' is giving scholarships to enable central
Asian students to study in Turkey and has even proposed aid for the
introduction of the Latin alphabet in states which have used the cyrillic
version ever since their incorporation in the Soviet Union.
So far, so good. All this cultural aid is more than welcome in most of the
countries of the region, where Islam and secularism find no difficulty in
cohabiting in an atmosphere relatively free of tension, as in Turkey. But
Iran and Saudi Arabia are pursuing a similar goal, in which religion plays a
much bigger, if not predominant part. Iran's proselytising zeal, backed by
the distribution of tens of thousands of copies of the Koran, is nowhere
more in evidence than in Azerbaijan, the only one of the mostly
Sunni-dominated republics in which the Shia Moslems are in the majority.
This competition for the hearts and minds of the former Soviet
transCaucasian and central Asian republics is equally intense in the
economic sphere. During a recent tour of the region, Mr Suleyman Demirel,
the Turkish prime minister, generously offered some Dollars 1bn worth of
loans and export credits. However, Turkey can ill afford such largesse,
given the need to put its own inflation and debt-ridden economic house in
order. Certainly, oil-rich Iran and Saudi Arabia are much more capable than
Turkey of granting substantial financial aid to the poverty-stricken central
Asian region.
Indeed, the Turkish leaders are constantly stressing that their country has
neither the ability nor the desire to act alone in the region, however much
it has taken the cultural high ground in wooing the central Asian states. It
is well aware that Turkey's own contribution can be no more than a drop in
the ocean compared with the total western financial aid required by the
region and that the problem is further complicated by the priority that has
been given by western donor countries to aid for other, politically more
important parts of the former Soviet Union, such as Russia.
For the Demirel government, the new focus on central Asia is clearly seen as
a useful means of diverting public opinion from more long-standing and
intractable problems such as the Kurdish problem and its implications for
Turkey's relations with Iraq and Syria, its tense relationship with Greece
and and the closely connected issue of EC membership.
These problems will not go away, however. Though Turkey, largely thanks to
President Turgut Ozal's persistence in the face of strong domestic
opposition, fully supported the US-led anti-Iraq coalition in the Gulf War,
it did so with a heavy heart. Iraq was one of its principal trading partners
before the Gulf conflict and Iraq exported much of its oil through a
pipeline across Turkey, before Ankara turned off the taps. Though it has no
intention of contravening the United Nations Security Council's economic
embargo on trade with Iraq, it is no secret that Turkey would like to see an
early end to sanctions.
'Our sincere wish is to see Iraq come back to the world community as soon as
possible,' Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister said in an
interview. 'Turkey is the country most affected, economically, politically
and socially by the sanctions (apart from Iraq). We have calculated that
Turkey lost about Dollars 15bn during the crisis and is continuing to do
so.'
Nor is there much official or public enthusiasm about the continuing
presence of US, British and French aircraft on Turkish air bases near the
Iraqi border, which are acting as a deterrent against any attempts which
might be made by President Saddam Hussein to oust the country's Kurdish
population from its protected zone in Northern Iraq. The chances that the
Turkish parliament will authorise in June an extension of this so-callled
'Operation Comfort' for another few months are considered to be good. But
there can be no guarantee that this permission will be forthcoming
indefinitely, or indeed, for very much longer.
At the same time, Turkey's European relations continue to be bedevilled by
apparently insoluble disagreements with Greece over Cyprus, the northern
part of which has been occupied by Turkish troops since 1974, the Aegean
continental shelf, territorial waters and air space and Greece's refusal to
give the green light to the EC's financial aid to Turkey.
Though there has been some improvement in the bilateral atmosphere since Mr
Constantine Mitzotakis's government came to power in Greece and since the
meeting of the Greek and Turkish prime ministers in Davos, Switzerland,
earlier this year, there is, as yet, very little light at the end of the
tunnel. The only hope lies in the renewed efforts of the United Nations
secretary-general to finalise a deal on Cyprus this summer. For, as the
Greeks constantly emphasise, it is Cyprus which holds the key to better
Greek-Turkish relations.
Yet it is clear that Ankara would rather accept a continuation of tense
relations with Greece than an unsatisfactory settlement which failed to
guarantee the equal rights of the Turkish population within a Cypriot
federation.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (5): Slow moves on asset sales - The public
deficit is spiralling, but privatisation is being held up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKISH POLITICIANS rarely discuss the issue with the zeal you find in
eastern Europe, or in Argentina where reformed Peronists are now rolling
back the frontiers of the state.
Today in Ankara, with a coalition government at the helm, the debate about
privatisation has been hijacked by bureaucratic infighting, and the
opposition of vested business interests, concerned at the growing foreign
presence in the country's economy.
It has always been easier to make the economic case for the privatisation of
Turkey's state-run industries. The state's interests in 235 enterprises,
either as the majority shareholder, as an affiliate or a minority partner in
a privately-managed concern, are responsible for up to a third of the public
sector borrowing requirement, which in 1991 was running at around 12 per
cent of GNP. They account for almost half of all fixed investment in Turkey
and employ close to half a million people.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics minister, has still to convince her cabinet
colleagues of the need for swift remedies if Turkey is to contain the
spiralling public deficit which is the main cause of the country's 70 per
cent rate of inflation.
The former Bosphorus University professor seems increasingly estranged from
the bureaucrats whose job it is to carry out her policy. The problems have
been exacerbated by her public differences with Mr Cavit Caglar, the state
minister who has repeatedly challenged her views on the economy.
In the eight months since the election, the government has yet to give a
clear signal on the issue.
The current privatisation programme is centred on the sale of the
government's minority stakes in a number of privately managed companies, the
details of which were already approved under the last government. While
moving ahead, it is little more than a revenue-raising exercise and does
nothing to transform the structure and ownership of Turkish industry.
Moreover, there are no plans regarding the main lossmakers - the railways,
the ports authority, Tek (the power utility), the grain board, the coal
corporation and the tobacco and alcohol monopoly.
A World Bank report called for a radical restructuring of the state sector.
Tusiad, the Turkish businessmen's association, also called for strong
action. The Bank suggested that many of the state companies would have to be
closed down. Others would be restructured, by selling their distribution and
marketing arms. All of the state enterprises needed to be brought under the
commercial code to instil the discipline of the market and allow the
managers to make decisions about price.
Two months ago, in a somewhat desperate gesture, Mrs Ciller asked Peugeot,
the French carmaker, to consider locating its new investment in the old
mining town of Zonguldak on Turkey's Black Sea coast. However, the French
company is expected to stick to its original plan to build the plant near
Izmir. The loss-making state-owned Zonguldak coal corporation, with its
payroll of close to 50,000 miners, is one of the principal drains on the
Turkish exchequer.
In April, after several months of exhaustive discussion, the Turkish cabinet
cleared the way for the creation of a new body to handle the disposal of
state assets. The idea was to put the state enterprises under the control of
an independent authority drawn from political but also academic, business
and labour circles. The plan was to restructure the companies in preparation
for a sale to the public. However, the powers of Toyok, as the agency is
known, have been severely curtailed. The council of ministers retains an
effective veto on key decisions, such as the closure of plant and staff
redundancies and lay-offs.
The privatisation programme was launched by the former Motherland party
government in 1986. The gains have been modest. Total revenue from the sale
of state assets either by public offering, by block share sales or
flotations on the Istanbul stock market, comes to less than USDollars 1bn.
Turkey's bid to revive the programme has now met with opposition from
businessmen, worried at foreign encroachment in a number of key industrial
sectors. The problem is in part a practical one. Turkey's infant stock
exchange will find it difficult to digest a large-scale flotation of
state-owned assets. On the other hand, few Turkish groups are in a position
to raise the sort of cash required to buy state shares in block, which is
currently the government's favoured method. In the short term, foreigners
may prove the only buyers ready to invest.
This year, the newly-created Public Participation High Council, the agency
entrusted with handling the sale of state assets to the public, expects to
raise Dollars 868m. Officials talk of selling off parts of PTT, the Turkish
telecommunications monopoly. The government says the company's cable, TV,
car telephone and computer networks are earmarked for disposal. Mr Yasar
Topcu, minister of transport, has all but ruled out the sale of Turk Hava
Yollari (THY). Any early moves to sell off Petrol Offisi, the state's petrol
products retailer, and Tupras, the state refineries corporation, have also
been put back.
Mr Ustun Sanver, head of the high council, says the government may sell some
Petrol Offisi gas station outlets. In the case of the refineries, the
government is more likely to look for a foreign investor to form a joint
venture with the existing plant.
In addition to the cement companies, Mr Sanver hopes to raise Dollars 25-27m
from the sale of block shares in Polinas Plastik, a packaging producer;
Seker Sigorta (insurance); Istanbul Demir Celik, a mining concern; Turk
Tractor, an agricultural machinery business; Trakmak, its marketing arm; and
Turk Otomotiv, the car parts manufacturer.
Several state companies are to be re-offered to the public, after the PPHC
rejected earlier bids. These include Ray insurance, Gima department store
and Meysu, a fruit juice and food producer. Mr Sanver expect these sales
will realise Dollars 28-34m.
There are plans for the public offering of the government's remaining 49 per
cent of Netas, which is part-owned by Northern Telecom of Canada. Mr Sanver
says preparations are under way for the sale of block shares in Teletas, the
telecommunications industry; AEG-ETI, the electric transformer maker;
Guneysu, the fruit juice producer; Tofas, the Fiat joint venture assembly
and its marketing arm; Aksaray Azmi, flour producer and Ankara, the flour
and bread producer.
In January, Citibank organised the sale of 51 per cent of Ipragaz for
Dollars 65m to the French company Primagaz. In March, Sabanci - Turkey's
largest industrial conglomerate - paid Dollars 22.5m for an 87 per cent
stake in Nigde Cimento, a local cement producer.
Cement has become the cause celebre with the French taking a commanding
position after the purchase by Societe Ciments Francais (SCF) of five
state-owned companies in 1989. Lafarge Coppee, the world's second largest
cement producer, and Societe Vicat have also entered the market.
It was Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, who opposed the sale to SCF,
arguing it contravened a 1987 law on privatisation as the shares had not
first been offered to domestic investors.
This month the role of foreign capital is again expected to come under
scrutiny when the PPHC offers block shares in a further 11 cement companies.
Mr Sanver says the cement sale is open to all investors, local and
international. Any hiccup at this stage could badly damage Turkey's
privatisation programme.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (4): Parliament comes back to life -
Politics / A change in mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU MIGHT think, looking at the political scene in Turkey, that nothing much
has really changed. The politicians have the same old faces. The issues are
little different from a decade ago. Even the excuses sound familiar.
But Turkey is experiencing an important change in mood. Amid signs of
increasing political violence, and a deteriorating economy, parliament - so
long ignored under the previous government - is enjoying a renewed lease of
life.
The 450-seat National Assembly is today the most eclectic gathering of
Turkish political opinion in the country's history. In all, there are six
parties representing every strand, from radicals of the Kurdish minority to
Islamic fundamentalists and extreme nationalists on both the right and left
wing.
In many countries, such a fiery political cocktail would be a recipe for
disaster. In Turkey a consensus has emerged, with a coalition government of
conservative and social democratic parties pushing ahead with what promises
to be the most thoroughgoing reform programme since Ataturk founded the
republic in the 1920s.
The man responsible is Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister and leader of
the right-of-centre True Path party, DYP. He knows only too well the
vicissitudes of Turkish politics. Six times prime minister before, he was
twice ousted by the military, the last occasion being in 1980.
The prime minister's bid to restore the effectiveness of parliament is
something of a personal crusade. More practically, it allows him to ignore
the constant jibes of President Turgut Ozal who has repeatedly used his
office for partisan political purposes in a bid to undermine the growing
public support for his long-time rival.
This uneasy cohabitation with President Ozal casts a deep shadow over
Turkish politics. But Mr Demirel has provided the president with just enough
rope to hang himself, by dangling the threat of a series of corruption
files, where official impropriety is alleged.
The prime minister's tactics are in some ways merely reflect the situation
that he does not have a sufficient majority to unseat the president by
changing the constitution. But many colleagues believe this measured
approach to Turkey's problems underlines Mr Demirel's determination not to
rock the political boat.
At 68, Mr Demirel wants to lay to rest his turbulent reputation and secure
an honourable place in Turkey's history. The real question is whether he can
match his enthusiasm with the necessary urgency to push badly needed
legislation through the house.
The result of the election in October, while reconfirming the strength of
the conservative vote in Turkish politics, did not provide Mr Demirel with
the outright majority he wanted. True Path emerged as the country's largest
party, winning widespread support particularly in the small towns of the
Aegean and central Anatolia. But the outgoing Motherland party, ANAP, also
did better than expected, polling strongly in the big cities where it
successfully harnessed the votes of the business community with its image of
a modern western-oriented Turkey.
The election result also underlined the demise of the left in Turkey with
the Social Democratic Populists, the main left-of-centre party, only too
happy to accept Mr Demirel's offer to form a coalition. The party has still
not resolved its leadership crisis, with Mr Deniz Baykal making a series of
so far abortive bids to replace Mr Erdal Inonu, the SHP leader.
Local elections on June 7 in many parts of Turkey are expected to reinforce
these trends. A strong swing to the DYP might even persuade the prime
minister to go to the country in the autumn in search of a clear mandate.
It is too early to claim what is happening is the renaissance of Turkish
democracy, as the government suggests. But parliamentary sessions now
receive extensive television coverage. The deputies have probably never
worked so hard. Indeed, the legislative timetable is now so congested that
the speaker has had to shelve plans for an early recess. The politicians may
find themselves confined to smoky committee rooms well into the summer
months.
To visit one of the many state ministers who share offices in the old prime
ministry in Ankara's Kizilay district is to run the gauntlet of a throng of
farmers, relatives and free loaders, all waiting for jobs and other official
largesse.
Mr Demirel indulges the electorate with regular audiences in the prime
ministry where, if you can brave the military police on the door, any Turk
can make his point to the prime minister - a custom which seems to have more
in common with the consensus-building traditions of Arab politics.
Another feature of the new parliament is the return of a number of familiar
faces from Turkey's turbulent political past. Mr Bulent Ecevit, the former
socialist prime minister, regained his seat in the mining town of Zongludak.
Mr Alpaslan Turkes, leader of extreme right-wing Turkish Labour party is
also back. The happy triumvirate is made up by Mr Necmettin Erbakan, the
Islamic leader who espouses, among other things, an Islamic common market
and an Islamic Nato.
There are newer faces too, including the attractive radical Kurdish deputy,
Mrs Leyla Zana, who created such a stir when giving her oath of allegiance
at the opening of parliament wearing a headband in tricolour of the banned
Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, which is fighting an increasingly violent
separatist war in Turkey's south-east region. She was one of 22 radical
Kurdish deputies who stood on the Social Democratic ticket - 18 of whom have
now resigned.
In the shifting sands of Turkish party politics, some of the other recent
alliances are already coming unstuck. Mr Erbakan and Mr Turkes, bedfellows
during the election, have already gone their separate ways. The landscape
could soon be changed further if parliament approves a draft bill submitted
in April which would lift the restrictions on political parties banned
following the 1980 military coup. That would allow these political groups to
lay claim to extensive property impounded under the military order.
There is talk of reconstituting the centre-left Republican's People's Party,
founded by Ataturk. There has even been some debate about allowing a Kurdish
party - a suggestion first made by Mr Mesut Yilmaz, leader of ANAP.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (2): Market reserves its judgment - The
economy / There are still clouds on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE LAST year, when Mr Suleyman Demirel's coalition government took office,
many Turkish businessmen made little secret of their misgivings. For Mr
Demirel was last in power 12 years earlier, when inflation soared to
three-digit figures, Turkey suffered its worst-ever balance of payments
deficit and industry was paralysed.
Nearly six months on, the market is still reserving its judgment, but it is
clear that times have changed. The Suleyman Demirel of the 1990s believes in
privatisation, realistic exchange rates and - in theory at least - fiscal
reform. Turkey does not look as if it is about to be plunged into a fresh
economic crisis.
That said, there are still plenty of clouds on the horizon. Though Turkey is
managing to keep its external payments under control and last year ran a
surplus of Dollars 272m on its current account, the economy failed to shake
off a recession which began with the Gulf War.
Gross National Product grew by only 0.3 per cent in 1991 in an economy where
growth has averaged between 5 and 6 per cent a year over the past three
decades. Worse still, inflation went up to 71.1 per cent from 60.4 per cent
in 1990 and from the middle of the year, monetary disciplines were abandoned
as it became clear that there would be a general election.
Six months on, monetary self-restraint has not returned. Consumer prices
jumped by an alarming 9 per cent in January, by 5.4 per cent in February and
4.9 per cent in March, taking inflation to 78.7 per cent for the previous
12-month period.
Does this mean that Turkey is on the way to triple-digit inflation? Probably
not, says Mr Deniz Gokce, professor of economics at the Bosphorus University
in Istanbul. He predicts that inflation will slacken this year though
probably not as sharply as official forecasts, but that GNP growth will also
be relatively disappointing.
On the other hand, Turkey's balance of payments seems to be under control
despite a foreign debt burden of around Dollars 43bn.
Turkey's trade deficit fell by 20 per cent in 1991, largely because demand
for imports was very slack. Exports rose by 4.9 per cent to Dollars 13.6bn
(1990: Dollars 12.96bn) while imports dropped by 5.7 per cent from Dollars
22.3bn to Dollars 21.04bn.
As a result, the trade deficit was down from Dollars 9.3bn in 1990 to
Dollars 7.4bn.
Despite this improvement, foreign currency reserves held by the central bank
have slipped by about Dollars 1bn from Dollars 5.1bn at the start of the
year to Dollars 4.08bn, mainly because Turks are selling Turkish liras and
buying foreign currency as the local currency plummets ever further and
faster against the US dollar and the Deutschemark.
The main reason for the currency's ever-faster decline appears to be the
widening public sector deficit.
The 1992 budget has been set at TL208 trillion, and an unchanged TL32
trillion deficit is planned, a target which bankers drily describe as
'implausible' since it would mean a reduction of about a third in the
deficit in real terms at a time when government spending is shooting upwards
and public revenues are languishing.
Official projections are that tax revenues should be TL175.9bn, or about
four-fifths of total government revenues. Around TL3.5 trillion will be
raised from privatisations.
Whether things will work out quite like this is another matter. There are
few candidates for quick, profitable privatisations and the government does
not seem to have the stomach to introduce unpopular new taxes in what may,
after all, turn out to be another election year.
The government announced a new package of tax reforms and other economic
measures on January 17. The main feature appears to be a sharp increase in
indirect taxation. It has also launched a controversial tax amnesty,
intended to enable the Treasury to get at least part of the unpaid taxes it
is owed. Both sets of measures have yet to prove their effectiveness.
The government wants to press ahead with privatisation operations, but five
agencies will not be sold off: TMO (the state grain organisation); TEK (the
electricity authority); PTT; TCDD (state railways); and Tekel, the alcohol
and tobacco monopoly. The trouble is that this list includes the main
loss-makers.
If these cannot be privatised, perhaps some of them at least - for example,
the Zonguldak coal mines - could be shut down. That solution would please
international agencies such as the World Bank, but it is probably too
radical for Mr Demirel to contemplate.
The burden of public sector losses is a heavy one. Most of Turkey's larger
industrial enterprises were set up by the state between the 1930s and 1950s
and were never designed to run at a profit. More than TL11,997bn was lost by
18 state industries in 1991.
The top loss-makers were TEK (the electricity authority) which lost
TL4,326bn, TCDD (state railways) TL3,269bn; and the Turkish Coal board
(TL3,264bn) and the TD (iron and steel works which lost TL2,619bn). But not
all the public sector industries make a loss. Eight state industries made
money: Tekel, the state alcoholic beverages and tobacco monopoly made a
profit of TL1,378bn, while TPAO, the petroleum prospecting agency made
profits of TL1,289bn and the Post Office made TL1,229bn.
The complaint most generally heard is that Mr Demirel's economics team makes
grandiose promises but is short on a focused economy strategy. Mrs Tansu
Ciller, minister of state in charge of the economy, does not seem to have
the clout (or familiarity with the labyrinthine ways of the Turkish
bureaucracy) to match the men who dominated the Turkish economy in the Ozal
era.
Instead she seems to be losing ground to Mr Cavit Caglar, another minister
of state and president of the High Council on Credit and Mr Tevfik Altinok,
the undersecretary of the treasury and foreign trade, a veteran treasury
official who has spent most of the past decade working in Istanbul with Koc,
Turkey's largest industrial conglomerate.
Few of the new appointees have the international whizz-kid touch which
distinguished the top economic officials in the Ozal era and though statism
is out of fashion as an economic philosophy in Ankara, there also seems to
be little enthusiasm for exposing the economy to more competition,
particularly from the outside world, though on the foreign trade front,
Turkey is pledged to achieving a customs union with both the European
Community and Efta by 1996.
Only one of Mr Ozal's men, Mr Rusdu Saracaoglu, the 43-year old central bank
governor, has survived and his prospects look uncertain.
The hardest choices probably still lie ahead. If Mr Demirel truly wants to
stabilise the economy, he is going to have to turn a deaf ear to the pleas
of state employees and farmers for more pay. A fresh round of public sector
pay negotiations got under way this spring and the coalition government's
social democratic minister of labour is planning changes to the law which
would give unions much more power than they have enjoyed in the past.
Agricultural support prices may prove an even trickier issue. Mr Demirel's
main power base is the farming population of western Turkey. Once upon a
time, Turkish farmers could count on the government to hold agricultural
support prices high, allowing (untaxed) rural incomes to rise.
The military and Mr Ozal put a stop to that way of doing things after the
1980 coup. If Mr Demirel reverses that trend this summer to please the
farmers, Mr Altinok and the Treasury will face a gruelling time in 1993. But
there is no way that the main reforms of the 1980s can be reversed, even if
there is still plenty of scope for opening up the economy to genuine market
competition.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (1): A worrying indecision - Though the
country has enhanced its reputation as a stable influence in a volatile
region, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, faces growing pressure to
deliver on his electoral promise of political and social reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MIGHT seem like a sentimental indulgence, but the Turks are greatly
flattered that their country, once dismissed as the sick man of Europe, is
now held up as a model by the newly-emerging states of central Asia.
Today the attentions of these distant cousins is welcome vindication of
Turkey's own moves to look west, a policy set in motion by Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, which has taken on a new urgency in the last decade.
The recognition is particularly timely during a period of deepening troubles
at home, where indecision at the centre threatens to spoil Turkey's best
efforts at reform.
A resurgence of urban terror groups provides a chilling reminder of the
political instability which led to the military's intervention in 1980.
Inflation is running at more than 70 per cent, with the next wage round
looming. More worrying, for the first time, the Kurdish problem challenges
the very basis of this nation state carved from the ruins of Ottoman empire.
But Turks are great survivors and no politician better illustrates this than
Mr Suleyman Demirel, the veteran conservative who became prime minister for
the seventh time following the general election last October.
His return 12 years after he was ousted by the military - for the second
time - is seen as the best hope of restoring the country's fortunes. The
coalition government he leads is described by one western ambassador as 'the
most reform-minded, liberal and democratic in Turkey's history' - not such
an extravagant claim given Turkey's recent political turbulence.
Mr Demirel is best described a patronage politician, never more at home than
when manipulating the small business and farmer groups which control his DYP
party. Today he has also developed a strong instinct for the populist
gesture, epitomised by his election slogan to build the police stations out
of glass. It remains to be seen whether his fragile coalition has the
self-assurance to administer the radical reforms which Turkey so badly
needs.
The search for consensus between Mr Demirel's True Path party (DYP) and the
Social Democratic Populists (SHP) of Mr Erdal Inonu is already proving
painfully slow. Even when legislation makes it through cabinet, it is
destined for a rough ride in parliament where deputies are enjoying the
restoration of those traditional powers largely ignored by the former
government. However, with Turkey taking on the presidency of the Council of
Europe this month, the prime minister is pushing on a broad front of
political and legal reforms before the summer recess.
A draft bill on human rights has been submitted. Its main provisions aim to
combat the prevalence of police torture, which continues to be the single
greatest blight on Turkey's image abroad. Labour laws are being tailored to
bring the country in line with International Labour Organisation
conventions, while proposals for the country's Kurdish minority follow
Turkey's signature of the 1990 Paris Charter on human rights.
Mr Demirel faces a number of other challenges, domestic and foreign. On its
borders, Turkey confronts growing instability in the Caucasus, with
accompanying fears that it could be drawn into defending the rights of
Moslem against Armenian. In North Iraq, the evolution of some sort of
autonomy for the Kurds might encourage similar aspirations from Turkey's own
Kurdish minority.
In Europe, Turkey is anxious not to be isolated by the process of economic
and political union. The Turks have been associate members of the European
Community since 1963, but the current government increasingly accepts that
chances of full EC membership in the foreseeable future are slim. At
Maastricht, Turkey was offered associate membership of the nine-nation
Western European Union defence association, while the Greeks were invited to
become full WEU members. Given Turkey's long-standing disputes with Greece,
the legacy of more than 600 years of shared history, the government will
have a hard task recommending the EC's offer to parliament.
There are problems, too, on the EC trade and investment front. More than
half Turkey's trade is with the Community and Turkey is still broadly on
target for customs union with Brussels in 1996. But there are renewed calls
for protectionism from Turkish business groups concerned at the growth in
foreign competition which has resulted from liberalisation. There are even
those who question whether Turkey will ever implement all the tariff cuts
necessary for customs union, particularly given its needs on the revenue
side.
Turkey alone cannot resolve these issues, and Mr Demirel acknowledges that,
to receive a better hearing, Turkey must first tackle a series of domestic
problems that increasingly impinges on relations with the world at large.
This has been dramatically shown by the Kurdish issue which has taken on an
international dimension since allied intervention to help the Iraqi Kurds.
Recognising this, the government has embarked on a new policy initiative. A
package of economic measures is being introduced to tackle the south-eastern
region's high unemployment, while a Kurdish institute and two Kurdish
newspapers have been established. The government's junior coalition
partners, the SHP, are now openly debating the broader constitutional
question of devolved powers as a means to win back moderate Kurdish opinion
and undercut support for the rebel Kurdish Workers Party (PKK).
The authorities are steering a narrow course, offering liberal reform, yet
giving the military an apparent carte blanche to combat the separatists.
This could prove a difficult line to maintain as the PKK intensifies its
campaign to force further reprisals from the security forces.
Mr Demirel has the added disadvantage of a simmering feud with Mr Turgut
Ozal, who became president in 1989 after dominating Turkish political life
for most of the 1980s. It is on the Kurdish issue that the president has
been most vocal, urging Mr Demirel to introduce Kurdish television for the
south-east where the majority of Turkey's 10m Kurds live.
The president has also used his veto to block key appointments and openly
voiced disagreement with the government on a number of issues, particularly
on the economy where he has accused the coalition of undoing the good work
of the past decade, when he was prime minister.
Turkey's economy is in recession. While the population increases by 2.2 per
cent every year, Turkey's gross national product grew in 1991 by 0.3 per
cent, the slowest rate in more than a decade. This year the picture will be
barely improved. While Turkey remains the least taxed of OECD economies, all
talk of tax reform flounders. Privatisation of the government's minority
shares in privately-run companies still leaves the giant utilities and the
other main loss-making enterprises burdening the exchequer.
On the key issue of wages, so instrumental in Turkey's export drive in the
1980s, the unions are using SHP support to win further concessions, which
economists fear could result in a loss of competitiveness for Turkish
industry.
The policy indecision is now filtering through to the money markets, where
confidence in the Turkish lira looks increasingly shaky. A major
intervention by the central bank in the first quarter of this year
under-lined the vulnerability of the Turkish lira. Stability will be
especially critical now that Turkey is going to the commercial markets for
more than USDollars 1bn and floating bonds for the first time since 1990.
Meanwhile, Mrs Tansu Ciller has progressively lost her authority as chief
economics minister. Her inexperience in dealing with the bureaucracy has
surfaced in a series of embarrassing public disagreements with Mr Rusdu
Saracaoglu, the central bank governor and one of the few top civil servants
to have survived the change of government.
Turkey's promised land is some way off. For many of the country's 58m
inhabitants, a 10-year diet of economic deregulation has been hard to
digest. High inflation is eroding the standard of living of those on fixed
incomes. Investment has dropped while foreign and domestic business waits to
see whether Mr Demirel has the necessary courage to deal with Turkey's
fundamental problems, and allow it to regain its natural position as leader
in the region.
Unless the government can tackle the question of the economy, all Turkey's
problems will get worse. If it fails to do so, even the Central Asian
republics could look elsewhere for their model - a prospect that neither the
west nor Turkey relishes.

FT  21 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson rumour lifts BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET was set alight in early trading with rumours that Hanson had
moved to buy the Kuwait Investment Office's 9.8 per cent stake in British
Petroleum - provoking speculation that the conglomerate was setting its
sights on the troubled oil company.
No basis could be found for the story, although the repercussions acted on
both companies' shares all day, with BP up 10 at one stage before retreating
to close at 261p, a gain of 5 on the day. After an initial rise, Hanson
slipped back to close 3 off at 228 1/2 p. A bulky 22m shares were traded in
BP.
Most analysts were sceptical that Hanson would consider BP, either as an
investment or a bid, because of the illogical fit with its present strategy
and portfolio - although a trader said yesterday's story was the third in
recent weeks linking the two groups.
Argyll retreats
Food retailer Argyll Group was one of the worst performers among the FT-SE
100 constituents as its results failed to excite and a large line of stock
looking for a home held down the share price.
The full-year figures were within market expectations, but after last week's
sparkling results from rival J. Sainsbury, the lack of surprises yesterday
dulled the response. The stock was further undermined by a securities house
having some problems placing 3.5m Argyll shares. However, turnover of 10m
shares by the close, more than twice the usual volume in the stock,
suggested that the house was finally successful.
While the increased dividend helped sentiment, Argyll's current trading was
below some forecasts. One analyst also complained that the group
concentrated too much at its presentation on plans for the Lo-Cost
supermarket operations rather than on the upmarket Presto chain. The shares
declined 10 to 357p.
Composite insurer Commercial Union, which reported first-quarter results
yesterday, and launched a preference share issue, retreated 6 to 504p as
word went round the market that Sun Alliance was about to place its stake in
CU of around 14.5 per cent.
Among those to discount the talk was Mr Steven Bird, of Smith New Court, who
said the stake was 'unlikely to be placed at the moment'.
The market was, however, pleased by the trading performance at CU, which
revealed losses 20 per cent lower at Pounds 19.2m, and at the same time
launched a Pounds 100m preference share issue, to be placed through Hoare
Govett and Cazenove, to finance expansion.
BZW said it remains a seller of the shares 'because we believe they are
over-distributed on the dividend front and are trading above net asset
value'.
On the bull side, Smith said: 'The company has got a superior underwriting
record. Unlike others in the sector, it is looking to make substantial
profits in two years time.'
Profit-taking weakened Sun Alliance, which finished 3 lower at 321p in spite
of an upbeat annual meeting.
Well-received results from Land Securities lifted the stock and other
leading property shares, although there was little news to cheer those
looking for a revival in the sector.
Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest said: 'There were glimmers of hope in
the retail market outside of the south-east, but these were cancelled out by
the depressing picture elsewhere, particularly in the central London office
market.'
He has reduced his profits forecast for next year to Pounds 233m from Pounds
239m, citing the cost of the group's move away from offices and more into
retail. The shares rose 9 to 440p.
Some investors looked to switch out of Land Securities, preferring instead
British Land, up 11 at 214p, MEPC, 9 ahead at 346p, and Slough Estates, also
9 to the good at 196p.
In spite of figures below expectations, Ranks Hovis McDougall moved ahead as
spurious bid talk was again heard. Analysts were particularly disturbed by
the downbeat theme adopted by the company on present trading conditions,
plus the 62 per cent fall in milling and breadmaking revenue.
Smith New Court pared its current year profits forecast by Pounds 7m to
Pounds 98m, while Nomura reduced its estimate by Pounds 12m to the same
amount. Next year, they forecast Pounds 105m and Pounds 109m respectively.
The shares put on 5 to 234p.
Brewer Bass turned in positive interim results, the shares advancing 11 to
631p. County NatWest is looking for Pounds 528m for the full year and Pounds
638m in 1993.
Talk of a price war in the food retail market led to weakness in the sector.
J. Sainsbury slipped 2 1/2 to 465p, Tesco 8 to 280p and Kwik Save 5 to 625p.
Asda, however, continued to benefit from bid talk, edging 1 1/2 higher to 33
1/4 p in volume of 28m.
The creeping pace of recovery in the hotel market was behind two forecast
downgrades in Forte, which dipped 4 to 245p. Kleinwort Benson cut its
current year estimate by Pounds 10m to Pounds 115m, while another house was
reported to have come down to Pounds 125m.
Turnover in Pilkington rose to 11m and the shares firmed 2 to 161p, after
two blocks of 7.7m and 2.7m respectively went through the market. The bulk
of the volume was said to have arisen from BZW selling the remainder of the
31m shares bought from BTR earlier this month.
The reiteration of a buy recommendation by Kleinwort Benson on Inchcape
boosted the stock, which climbed 12 to 513p on turnover of 1.8m.
Bowater rose 12 to 850p. The shares are favoured by BZW, which has issued a
weighty document on the stock that is due to land on investors' desks today.
The broker lifted its current year forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 155m and
the following year's by Pounds 12m to Pounds 188m.
Fears that bankers to Eurotunnel could withdraw funding unless the company
settles a dispute with the tunnel's contractor TML by August hurt the
shares, which shed 8 to 380p. British Airways continued to bask in the glow
of its spectacular results aired on Tuesday. The shares added 13 at 380p on
some 10m traded.
A badly handled order in NFC caused the shares to lose part of an earlier
gain. They ended 9 up at 282p.

FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler helps Frankfurt to
21-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APART from some weakness in Scandinavia, continental bourses were mostly
firmer, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose to a 21-month high as domestic and foreign investors
responded to this week's engineering and construction pay deals, and
positive comments from Daimler-Benz on Tuesday.
Volume rose to DM9.9bn from DM7.2bn. After a 6.84 rise to 717.40 for the FAZ
index at midsession, the DAX ended 24.24, or 1.4 per cent higher, at
1,787.50, its highest close since August 3, 1990. Some analysts expect it to
approach its all-time, March 1990 high of 1,976.43 within six months.
Optimism hinged largely on Daimler's expectation that 1992 results will be
above those of 1991. In a broadly based gain taking in carmakers and
chemicals, steels and some engineers, both Daimler and AEG were boosted by
the former's statement that it did not expect to book an AEG loss in 1992.
AEG rose DM6 to DM212 and its parent by DM16.50 to DM804.
Construction stocks liked the wage deal, and forecasts of further growth in
the sector. Bilfinger &amp; Berger led them up with a rise of DM24.80 to
DM1,060. Retailers were mixed: Karstadt put on DM24 or 3.8 per cent to
DM655; but Douglas closed DM26 lower at DM615 on a forecast of flat or lower
earnings this year, after an early rise of DM14 to DM655 on higher profits
for 1991.
PARIS inched higher after Tuesday's drop but dealers said investors were
getting cautious after the market's recent rally. The CAC-40 index ended up
7.71 at 2,030.84 in modest turnover of FFr2bn.
Alcatel Alsthom was one of the day's more prominent losers, as the stock
touched a low of FFr639 before closing FFr12 to FFr646 on news that it had
placed 10m American Depositary Shares in the US at Dollars 23 5/8 each,
which traders said was the equivalent to FFr635 in the French share price.
In the afternoon, it was reported that a block of 290,000 American
Depositary Rights in Elf Aquitaine were traded at Dollars 36 1/8 . In Paris,
the shares closed FFr5.20 higher at FFr387.10.
MILAN was enlivened by industrial stocks. The Comit index rose 2.21 to
475.01 in turnover estimated at L95bn after L76bn on Tuesday.
Olivetti added L112 or 3.7 per cent to close at a 1992 high of L3,144, while
Fiat broke through L5,000 on the kerb, having closed L19 higher at L4,960.
Montedison added L10 to L1,475.
The banking sector recovered as Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) rebounded
L49 to L2,967 after its 4 per cent plunge on Tuesday.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 130.2 on foreign institutional
interest. There was active buying in Buehrmann-Tetterode on reports of a buy
recommendation from a UK brokers and it closed up Fl 1.70 or 3.5 per cent to
Fl 49.80.
KLM remained a favourite on renewed speculation that merger talks with BA
had been reopened. It gained 70 cents to Fl 40.10.
Polygram rose 70 cents to Fl 50.90 on news that it had formed a joint
venture with Universal Pictures for the distribution of films in the US,
while Heineken took comfort from the hot weather in Europe and was Fl 2
stronger at Fl 165.
ZURICH brokers said that continuing high Swiss interest rates were keeping
some investors away. The market gave up some earlier gains on a lack of
buying interest, as the SMI index of leading shares rose 5.4 to 1,933.4 in
quiet trading.
Winterthur bearers fell SFr20 to SFr3,350. After the close the insurer said
it would raise dividends after an 112 per cent increase in 1991 profits, and
that it was opening up its share register to foreigners.
STOCKHOLM was little changed as in Astra led most blue chips higher,
balancing declines in domestic stocks and Volvo, where the B free fell SKr8
to SKr423 after Tuesday's SKr248m first quarter loss. The Affarsvarlden
General Index rose 0.9 to 999.3 in heavy turnover of SKr900m.
Astra accounted for SKr360m of total turnover, as the B unrestricted shares
advanced SKr19 to SKr547 after Tuesday's favourable first quarter earnings
report. The company also raised its forecast for full year profit growth to
more than 25 per cent.
BRUSSELS was firmer as dealers squared positions on the last day of the
forward account. The Bel-20 index advanced 4.05 to 1,224.19.
Petrofina rose BFr75 to BFr11,400 ahead of today's dividend payment.

FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late fall in futures
causes Nikkei to change course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE afternoon profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling erased initial
gains, and share prices lost ground in tandem with the futures market,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average was down 79.18 at 18,674.93 after a high of 18,927.64 in
the morning and a low of 18,635.89 in the afternoon.
Investors were encouraged at the start by the overnight high on Wall Street,
and sought issues with favourable earnings prospects. However, share prices
receded in the afternoon as a fall in the futures market prompted arbitrage
selling.
Volume declined to 300m shares from 340m. Rises retained a narrow lead over
falls by 497 to 488, with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 1.20 to 1,394.51, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
ended just 0.66 up at 1,107.10.
Traders said that, in the short term, the market looked vulnerable because
of the high margin activity recently, especially in speculative or 'theme'
stocks. In the longer term, however, fears of a loss of support at the
18,000 level seem to have subsided.
Corporate results have had a substantial effect on some stocks. Surprises on
the negative side stem from losses on securities investments and real estate
development.
Investors have been discouraged by losses at companies which had been known
for their profitable business operations. Shares in Sekisui Chemical, which
reported a 17 per cent fall in pre-tax profits due to losses at its
financing affiliate, have dropped 21 per cent since the results were
announced two weeks ago. It closed Y29 down at Y871 yesterday.
Sato Kogyo, the civil engineering group, slipped Y70 to Y1,080. The company
suffered an extraordinary loss of Y2.3bn in its last fiscal year due to loan
guarantee payments to a resort construction affiliate.
On the other hand, better than expected earnings announcements were
appreciated. Nippon Meat Packers, which saw a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y28.5bn on a 7 per cent increase in sales to Y585bn, responded
with a gain of Y30 to Y1,770.
Short-term trading in theme stocks led activity. The most active issue of
the day was Mitsubishi Kakoki, an industrial waste water treatment equipment
maker, which rose Y90 to Y1,190 on the environmental theme. Traders are also
promoting the stock as an Aids-related issue, due to increasing sales of its
condom production facilities.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained a slight 0.73 at 21,348.15 in volume of
20.5m shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim was generally firmer as international funds were switched
out of Thailand into neighbouring markets.
HONG KONG rose sharply on speculation that interest rates would be cut by
the weekend. The Hang Seng index advanced 111.52 to 5,753.76 in turnover of
HKDollars 3.91bn.
HSBC Holdings led the rally, rising 75 cents to HKDollars 44 on news that
the Bank of England would not object to the group's proposed bid for Midland
Bank.
BANGKOK rallied on bargain hunting following Tuesday's 8.9 per cent drop.
The SET index gained 9.53 to 677.37.
SEOUL lost ground, with sentiment depressed by rumours that the tax affairs
of some individual investors were to be investigated. The composite index
fell 8.06 to 579.91 in turnover of Won400bn.
MANILA was stronger on selective buying of commercial and industrial stocks.
The composite index appreciated 19.25 to 1,358.20 in turnover of 182m pesos.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone gained 25 pesos to 1,090 pesos.
TAIWAN extended Tuesday's advance and the weighted index put on 59.18 to
4,560.00 in turnover of TDollars 30bn.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index climbed 3.18 to 594.09 in turnover of
MDollars 138m. Telekom moved ahead 20 cents to MDollars 12.70, with some
549,000 shares traded.
AUSTRALIA advanced in strong trade. The All Ordinaries index gained 15.7 to
1,682.0 in turnover of ADollars 205m.
Westpac shed 5 cents to ADollars 3.89 before reporting a loss of ADollars
1.67bn for its fiscal first half. The bank also announced an ADollars 1.2bn
rights issue.
Elsewhere, BHP moved forward 14 cents to ADollars 14.28 and News Corp put on
48 cents to ADollars 22.10.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 3.07 to 1,472.87 in dull
trade, with most institutional interest focused on Hong Kong.
NEW ZEALAND declined as investors took profits. The NZSE-40 index retreated
5.26 to 1,547.43 in NZDollars 19.4m turnover.

FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: New equity inflow weighs on Milan -
Rights issues are being criticised for their timing and quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the bad sentiment on the Milan bourse that last Friday's
38 per cent cut in Fiat's ordinary share dividend was greeted with relief
rather than rancour.
So negative have attitudes towards Italian equities become that even the
wildest rumours are being given credence. The possibility that a bellwether
company like Fiat might swell the list of rights issues overhanging the
market was one of the factors behind last week's plunge in the Comit index
through the psychologically important 480 barrier.
In the event, Fiat produced neither a rights issue, nor a dividend to be
paid partly in shares and in cash - the other possibility haunting brokers.
The news helped the market regain some ground at the start of the new
trading account on Monday, but the recovery was short-lived.
In spite of Fiat's temporary relief, Milan remains shell-shocked. While
trading volume has risen above L100bn (Dollars 83m) on most days, almost
every Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new broking and
fund management hybrid, is thought to be losing money on equities.
Funding moves are the latest culprits. How, brokers ask, can companies
expect the bourse to absorb trillions of lire in rights issues when trading
is barely ticking over?
In the past three weeks, Italcementi, Ras and Assitalia have announced big
rights issues amounting to L1,776bn. Meanwhile, Iri, the state holding
company, hopes to raise around L1,750bn by a secondary placing of shares in
the Stet telecommunications holding group. Further down the line are likely
flotations of Iri's Finmeccanica engineering arm, Eni's Agip and Snam
subsidiaries, and just possibly, Iri's Ilva steel-making subsidiary.
It is Iri's plans, bunched in the second half of the year, which have most
depressed the market. Hit by the clampdown on government funding, Italy's
biggest state holding company has turned to the market in virtual
desperation. With its cash-raising ambitions in mind, some private sector
companies may be trying to nip in first.
Sentiment was already depressed before the latest money-raising cycle.
Disappointing 1991 company results and limited scope for improvement in 1992
had crushed the market. Politically, delays in electing a president and
forming a new government have postponed the likelihood of Italy getting to
grips with its myriad economic problems.
Foreign investors have taken cover, while domestic mutual funds have failed
to step into the breach. Equity holdings by Italian unit trusts have reached
a historic low as funds have switched to bonds or cash. Last month, the
funds' net equity sales amounted to L150bn.
The latest cash calls have been attacked both for their insensitive timing
and poor quality. While Italcementi's purchase of control of Ciments
Francais was applauded, its subsequent two-part rights issue was not. The
company is charging the same price for ordinary and non-voting savings
shares in the first half of the deal, while it is only offering
non-franchised savings shares in the second.
The move by Ras, Italy's second biggest insurer, which is controlled by
Allianz, of Germany, to raise more than L800bn through a mixed share and
warrant bond issue was equally unpopular. Its claim that funds were needed
to build up the life insurance side was viewed sceptically, and the price of
Ras's savings shares collapsed.
Lack of information and poor investor preparation were the criticisms
levelled at Iri for its Stet deal. In other circumstances the transaction
might have gone down well: once completed, Iri will have only 53 per cent of
Stet's ordinary shares and just 1 per cent of the savings stock, bringing
true privatisation within sight.
By half-heartedly releasing the news on the eve of a public holiday,
however, and just days after repeated denials that such a transaction was
imminent, Iri left the market feeling bitter and misled. With no sign of an
upturn in investor confidence, and a host of public sector flotations to
come this year, it is a lesson companies need to learn fast.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudi oil minister fails to
turn up at Opec summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HISHAM NAZER, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, yesterday failed to turn up
at the ministerial summit of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Vienna in a move which surprised and disconcerted other
delegations, but which the Saudis said signalled no change in the Kingdom's
oil policy.
A Saudi delegate said that Mr Nazer was simply 'a little bit exhausted'
after an intensive series of overseas meetings.
Although some oil analysts suggested that Mr Nazer's absence, his first from
an Opec meeting since he replaced Sheikh Yamani as the kingdom's oil
minister in 1987, could be interpreted as a 'slight' towards delegations
favouring a higher-price Opec policy, diplomats in Riyadh who met Mr Nazer
yesterday said they believed he may genuinely have been over-tired.
The diplomats said that there was no indication that Mr Nazer's post as oil
minister was threatened, or that his absence indicated a shift in oil policy
from Riyadh. They said he had appeared intent on making the trip to Vienna
when they met him, but that 'he had no appetite for the journey'.
Mr Nazer, they said, had spent 25 hours without sleep during talks late last
week in Kuwait between EC ministers and those of the Gulf Co-operation
Council on which the EC's proposed carbon tax was high on the agenda. Saudi
Arabia is leading an Opec lobby against the imposition of such a tax.
Mr Nazer's place at the summit was taken by Mr Fayez Badr, a minister of
state with responsibility for the Saudi Ports Authority and a man with no
clear oil expertise.
Saudi Arabia has widely flagged before the Opec summit, which begins in
earnest today, that it would be seeking a 1m barrels a day rise in the
cartel's production ceiling for the third quarter from the 22.98m b/d agreed
for the second in February.
Iran, among several other delegations, opposes such a move and would prefer
to see Opec restrain output to force prices towards the cartel's formal
reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel. Mr Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil
minister, told reporters curtly yesterday: 'I want a cut in the ceiling.'
Oil analysts suggested that Mr Agazadeh may have simply been stating an
opening bargaining position for the talks and that a cut in the February
ceiling was unlikely. But many equally suggested that Mr Nazer's absence
might indicate that Saudi Arabia would be likely to press less forcefully
its argument for a rise in the ceiling for the third quarter and that,
despite its opening position, the Kingdom may settle for a roll-over of the
present ceiling.
Saudi Arabia estimates the call on Opec crude to reach 24.2m b/d for the
third quarter, but actual production for the second has neared 23.5m b/d
rather than the nominal February figure, due largely to Kuwait's accelerated
output and a Saudi refusal to cut production below 8m b/d - as was
notionally allocated.

ALUMINIUM closed ahead on the LME after three-month metal hit stiff
resistance around Dollars 1,360 a tonne. The overall steadier trend was
prompted by a constructive close on Tuesday and by speculative interest. TIN
came under profit-taking and technical selling in the afternoon, prompted by
the failure of three-month metal to test Dollars 6,300 a tonne after hitting
a new 18-month high of Dollars 6,290 in the morning. But the selling was
well absorbed, with underlying interest evident below Dollars 6,250.
PLATINUM held at Dollars 361 an ounce on the London bullion market after
earlier falling on reported Middle East sales and a technical correction to
Tuesday's rally. Analysts said the market had been overbought on its rise to
Dollars 364, but sentiment was bullish on Nymex, where platinum futures were
higher at midday, again outperforming Comex gold and silver. Optimism that
economies worldwide are recovering sparked buying. Analysts also cited
continued concerns over the availability of supply in the physical markets.
Comex GOLD futures were weaker at midday on selling by players disappointed
at the failure to surmount resistance levels on Tuesday.

The importance of selection in realising better prices for wool was
illustrated at the Goulburn auction in Australia on May 20. Better style
merino fleece of good length and soundness attracted very good competition
and prices moved up by 10 to 30 cents a kg. compared with the previous week.
Otherwise the market was firm. The market indicator rose 6 cents to 588
cents a kg. Offerings in all primary producing markets are declining in
selection and quality at this stage of the season, with drought a
contributory factor leading to lower offerings this season.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Newmont's gesture fails to
convince gold market - Why the producer's symbolic purchase has so far not
succeeded in lifting prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS meant to be a big, symbolic gesture by Newmont Mining, North
America's biggest gold producer. Newmont wanted to send, with a flourish and
fanfare, a clear message to the market and other producers that it was sure
the gold price was at or very near its lowest point.
Newmont bought 375,000 troy ounces (or 11.7 tonnes) of gold at a cost of
nearly Dollars 126m on April 29 - the day the gold price was fixed in London
at its lowest point for six years. But the impact of the news was dampened
because it became fouled up by US stock market disclosure regulations. These
forced the group to include details of the gold deal in its report on
financial results for the first quarter.
The gold deal was completed on the day those results were due to be revealed
and Newmont was obliged to tell its shareholders immediately. After all, it
was locking in a net profit of more than Dollars 40m.
However, even allowing for the lack of razzmatazz accompanying Newmont's
announcement, some gold bulls have been disappointed by the market's
reaction. Newmont bought its gold at Dollars 335.95 a troy ounce, and two
weeks later the gold price still languishes at Dollars 337.30, near its
lowest for 16 years in real terms, when inflation is taken into account.
Some bullion dealers were also perturbed by the comparative lack of impact
Newmont's buying spree had on the market at the time. Sellers, particularly
from Europe, swamped Newmont's attempt to give the gold price a push in an
upward direction. However, as the price had drifted to a low of Dollars 333
an ounce on April 29, Newmont managed to lift it by a dollar or two.
Some observers contrast this with the market's reaction in February 1988
when Newmont announced it had completed the biggest gold loan ever  - of 1m
ounces or 31 tonnes. Perhaps unfairly, this move was blamed for starting the
steady fall in the gold price which continued through the following four
years.
In a gold loan operation a mining company borrows metal from a commercial
bank or syndicate which has, in turn, borrowed some from a central bank. The
mining company then effectively sells the gold in the market for cash which
is then used for a designated purpose. In the opinion of some analysts,
Newmont signalled in the most dramatic way in 1988 that the gold price had
reached its peak and, once the news was out, the price took a tumble.
Mining companies pay back gold loans, both principal and interest, usually
in gold but occasionally in cash.
Gold loans are mainly used to finance new gold mining projects, but
Newmont's was arranged to take advantage of the low interest rates offered,
roughly 3 per cent at that time, compared with the money markets. The group
was under tremendous pressure to reduce the burden of its Dollars 1.6bn
debt, most of it taken on to ward off the unwelcome overtures of marauders
led by Mr T. Boone Pickens, the well-known corporate raider.
Newmont bought gold at Dollars 449 an ounce for its five-year loan and was
repaying at the rate of 62,500 ounces a quarter. By the end of last year
about half the loan had been repaid.
Mr Jim Hill, Newmont's vice president, corporate relations, says the company
'is neither disappointed nor surprised' by the reaction so far to its
announcement about the early repayment of the rest of its gold loan. 'Gold
analysts reacted very positively,' he says.
'We felt that, whereas the gold price might go down a few more dollars, the
trend from now on would be up. So we decided to pay off our gold loan and
lock in a net profit of about Dollars 100 an ounce.'
Newmont is not the only producer to repay a gold loan before the due date.
And an analysis by Ms Jessica Jacks, analyst with the RTZ Corporation, the
world's biggest mining company, shows that at the end of 1991 total gold
loans outstanding involved 330 tonnes compared with 391 tonnes in December
the previous year. Therefore a net 60 tonnes of gold (1.9m ounces) was
repaid last year.
Yet a large number of professionals operating in the gold market seem to
believe that the price has not yet touched bottom. Most of the commodity
funds, for example, are selling the metal short - they have contracted to
sell gold they do not yet own in the expectation that they will be able to
buy it at a lower price when they need it.
Sceptics also point out Newmont's move seems to bear the mark of Sir James
Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, who is one of the greatest bulls of
gold. Much of his fortune is wrapped up in Newmont. His General Oriental
Investments, where he has a two-thirds stake, owns 42 per cent of Newmont.
Sir James is also chairman of the group's new strategy committee.
Yet it is clear Newmont did not just play a hunch. Mr Paul Maroni, Newmont's
chief financial officer, lists some of the factors pointing to a gold price
rise soon: production is tailing off; new gold is expensive to find and to
produce; demand from the jewellery industry (which has been buying more gold
than is newly-mined each year) remains buoyant.
Mr Maroni suggests those producers who continue to sell when the price rises
 -and effectively 'cap' any substantial increase - are mainly high-cost
producers who could not survive without this form of insurance. The time
will come when their ability to survive will be called into question, he
suggests.
Also, the extraordinarily high level of gold sales from the former Soviet
Union which helped to drive down the price in the past two years cannot
continue because its stocks have almost run out and production is now
relatively modest.
Mr Maroni says there is also a potential 'wild card' which might benefit
gold - a 'meltdown' of the world's financial system. Sir James has recently
forecast such an event, which he suggests will see investors returning to
the security offered by gold. Mr Maroni echoes this view: 'We don't think
the world financial system is in very good shape.'
Leaving that 'wild card' aside, many analysts agree with Mr Maroni's
analysis. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of the
Banque Bruxelles Lambert group, says: 'We agree with the view that this is
the bottom of the gold market.' But she warns: 'Recovery will be a slow and
painful process.'
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, also says the gold
price is likely to be higher at the end of the year than it is today -
perhaps by Dollars 30 or Dollars 40 an ounce. 'But it won't move for a month
or so and it might not stay there when it gets there.'

FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Basis of a deal on radical CAP
reform in sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fifth attempt this year to synthesize the vested interests of the EC
farm sector around a genuinely radical reform of the creaking Common
Agricultural Policy was finalised early yesterday morning, giving the basis
for a deal.
Although it festoons most member states with sweeteners to help them digest
severe cuts in subsidised prices, the structure of the European Commission's
bold attempt to overhaul the CAP is still intact.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner who has cajoled,
bludgeoned, and horse-traded with the 12 farm ministers for 18 months to
bring them this far, said yesterday: 'What we're involved in here is a
totally different philosophy to what has existed for 30 years.'
Agreement is now in view - and as ministers settled into their second
consecutive night of negotiations, there was hope for a deal either today or
tomorrow.
Yet despite general conviction that the fifth compromise paper presented by
the Portuguese presidency constituted the basis for settlement, a major
North-South row over plans to concede more milk quotas to Spain, Italy and
Greece gathered pace through the day and could delay the denouement.
The central element in the overnight compromise was the cereals price. Mr
MacSharry persuaded the Portuguese presidency to retrace its steps and
deepen the planned cut in subsidised grain prices to 29 per cent.
The Commission had wanted to drop the cereals price by 35 per cent, from
Ecu155 per tonne now to Ecu100, though it drew its public line at Ecu105,
with the tacit understanding that Ecu108 a tonne was its limit. Mr Arlindo
Cunha, the Portuguese farm minister, had tried to break the logjam by moving
towards Germany, which insisted on settling as near as possible to the 20
per cent cut in domestic subsidies demanded by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round.
Mr Cunha last month proposed Ecu112 per tonne, and received an unprecedented
and public rebuff from Mr MacSharry. On Tuesday they split the difference
and settled at Ecu110 - a 29 per cent cut close to the 30 per cent the
Commission had always set out to achieve, with a 1 per cent psychological
sweetener to enable Germany to feel it was in the '20s'.
The compromise on cereals looked set to harden into a deal acceptable to the
Twelve last night, opening the way to agreement on the rest of the reform
structure for which it is the foundation.
It will enable a market with a production overhang of around 20m tonnes (as
well as similar amounts in intervention stockpiles) to come back into
balance. It will make EC grains competitive, without the need to dump
abroad, and should all but eliminate cereal export subsidies - the real rock
on which the Uruguay Round is foundering.
Within the CAP reform structure itself, it will enable significant price
cuts in the livestock and dairy sectors, which will be part compensated by
lower cereal feedstock prices.
The Commission also won back its own compromise position on how the scheme
is to operate.
In essence, the reform moves away from price support towards direct payments
to farmers. All farmers will get a full refund of the price cuts paid
directly to them, contingent for all but small farmers to their taking 15
per cent of their land out of production. All farmers will also get
compensation for this 'set-aside', whereas the Commission had wanted to bite
further into overproduction by excluding the biggest farms.
Ministers had also rejected the Commission's plan to monitor set-aside by
individual farms, which Mr MacSharry and his colleagues insist is the only
way of making farmers take responsibility for their production. The
presidency opted instead for county-size regional units  - but on Tuesday
the Commission got the individual farm unit reinstated. Senior officials say
farmers will eventually bridle if they are penalised as a region because
some farmers within it flout the land in production limits. These officials
believe they have established a transitional regime to the effective
controls they were seeking.
Against this, scattered over the compromise are concessions for dried fodder
and cereals grown for silage; for France's maize growers and the South's
hard wheat growers; for tobacco producers and hill sheep farmers.
Germany, which is likely to be allowed to pay a one-off national subsidy to
its farmers this year, has also been granted special treatment for the
eastern Laender. Some formula of future yield will be the yardstick for
compensation for price cuts there, against fixed, past production reference
periods for the rest of the EC - another critical weapon in the fight
against oversupply.
Ireland has scored a signal victory with an easing of what was to have been
a very severe contraction of the intervention regime, which currently
absorbs about four fifths of its beef produce. The compromise recognises the
fact that Irish (and French) farmers slaughter their herds later in the
year, and ensures they do not lose out in case those who slaughter earlier
get into what will be finite stockpiles first.
The UK, which at times over the last 18 months has suggested MacSharry was
trying to refashion EC agriculture on a backward Irish model, was said by
Irish farm minister Joe Walsh to be seeking the same regime for Northern
Ireland.
A British special case - providing half-subsidy for sheep farmers in
disadvantaged areas over the 1,000 per flock limit - was also in the
compromise, although British ministers were fighting for more.
But the extra milk quota for Italy, Spain and Greece remained a big
stumbling block, opposed by the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and
Luxembourg. This was enough to block the concession, but as the evening wore
on, it seemed likely that all but the three recipients would come out
against it.
'It's going to be very hard to get round that one,' predicted Mr David
Curry, the UK deputy agriculture minister.
The three countries have applied the milk quota regime only loosely, and are
looking for extra quotas to soak up some of their existing excess
production. The Commission reasons that this is a worthwhile price if these
countries are now obliged to implement and monitor quotas. There were few
signs last night that such reasoning was percolating through the rest of the
Council.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Explaining the mixed record of global
penetration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETIMES the simplest calculations can provide the most revealing results.
Among 300 dense pages of statistics and graphics in a new compendium of
accountancy data*, one table sticks out from the rest, showing the relative
grip of accountants on national economies.
As the table shows, dividing accountancy fee income by gross domestic
product (1990 figures) throws up tremendous variations. If the US economy is
 -as sometimes claimed - being drained by lawyers, then accountants cannot
be far behind. Elsewhere, the patterns are equally revealing, ranging from a
low of 0.01 per cent of GDP in Japan to a peak of 0.63 per cent in Ireland.
Lafferty's 'International Accounting Databook' puts a brave face on the
proportions at the lower end of the spectrum. 'On the assumption that the
accounting firms in other countries will be able to develop in the same way
as British, Irish, Dutch and Swiss firms, it would appear that the potential
world market for accountants' services is enormous,' it says. 'For example,
the Italian market could increase 20-fold.'
The Sony chairman, Mr Akio Morito, who has recently been outspoken in his
criticism of the role of accountants in senior positions in business, might
put a rather different perspective on the figures, and be gratified at his
country's lowly position.
At the other extreme, explanations for the position of Ireland and the
Netherlands are hard to come by. Switzerland is also very high, at 0.5 per
cent of GDP. This, the report suggests, may reflect the wide range of
services offered by Swiss firms, as well as relatively easy access to
outside capital.
On home ground, theories are rather easier to develop. The UK comes in third
highest, at 0.54 per cent. The survey suggests that the power of the
profession reflects the UK's history as the birthplace of accountancy. It
argues that the large number of companies subject to statutory audits and
their control of the 'insolvency franchise' leads to the substantial fees
generated.
The firms have also been free to develop roles as tax advisers and general
business consultants. 'Accountants are moving away from being a profession,'
says Michael Lafferty, editor in chief of Lafferty Publications, 'they are
becoming a business.'
It no doubt also reflects the important role in the UK played by capital
markets and the industries they sustain - corporate finance, financial
reporting, due diligence work and so on - which are in their infancy across
continental Europe.
By comparison, tax and insolvency work in other countries including the US
and Scandinavia is controlled by the legal profession and produces far less
income for accountants.
In some countries there are restrictions on accountants' business which may
restrict the volume and value of work they conduct, such as compulsory
rotation of auditors, or bars to prevent auditors conducting non-audit work.
Overall, there is obviously a clear relationship between fee income
generated and the number of qualified accountants. This raises the question
of which came first: the accountants or the work to satisfy them?
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has about 97,720
members and this is rising by 2.9 per cent per year - considerably faster
than GDP. In addition, the four other professional accountancy bodies have
more than 70,000 members.
Only Ireland can compete with that figure in Europe. There, 0.597 per cent
of the population were certified or chartered accountants in 1990, against
0.572 per cent in the UK. (Third, at just 0.275 per cent, was Gibraltar.)
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, chief executive of the English Institute, says: 'I see
accountants as part of the invisible infrastructure essential to making a
market economy work. They have a real economic role for invisible earnings -
although it is difficult to quantify.'
Analysts could nevertheless have a field day scrutinising the over-staffing
of accountancy firms across borders, by examining countries in which
professional fees as a proportion of GDP exceeded the number of practising
accountants per capita.
They might also do more to assess the contribution the firms truly make to
national product - since there seems to be little clear correlation between
the proportion of GDP consumed, and economic growth rates in the countries
shown.
Other figures in the Lafferty compendium bear witness to the remarkable
growth and change taking place in accountancy firms around the world. Fee
income from the main accounting networks in 1991 grew by 13.4 per cent
worldwide. Fee income shot up by more than 17 per cent in Europe, compared
with just 2.6 per cent growth in the US, making the markets now almost
identical in size: the US and Canada together contributed Dollars 14,096m
last year, against Dollars 13,833m in Europe.
Gross fees per partner from the firms in the top networks averaged just over
Dollars 1m, and ranged from Dollars 1.45m in Germany to a low of Dollars
750,000 in Japan.
There are plenty of other statistical manipulations that could be done on
the figures - enough, in fact, to keep an army of unemployed accountants
busy for months. No doubt Mr Morito would be among those recommending that
they might more usefully spend their time retraining in different, more
useful, skills.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Spain launches Ecu250m MTN
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALREADY hazy distinction between traditional Eurobonds and medium-term
note issues was further blurred yesterday, when Spain launched Ecu250m
two-year paper under its MTN programme, writes Simon London.
The issue, fully underwritten by Lehman Brothers and the four other dealers
to the programme, is the largest of its type in the Euromarket.
An MTN programme provides a legal framework under which a borrower can issue
bonds in a range of currencies and maturities. MTN issues are normally small
and not underwritten, with dealers placing paper where they can identify
pockets of demand for securities.
However, increasingly large bond issues are being made under the umbrella of
MTN programmes. Until yesterday, the largest issue was a Dollars 153m deal
launched by Eurofima.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Toyota launches record Dollars 1bn
Eurobond deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the Japanese motor group, launched its Dollars 1bn Eurobond issue
yesterday, the largest offering by a company in the international bond
market and the second large deal to hit the market this week after the
Province of Ontario's Dollars 2bn global offering on Tuesday.
The deal was well received in the market, with syndicates reporting strong
demand for the AAA rated paper. The five-year bond has a coupon of 6 7/8 per
cent and was launched at a fixed reoffer price of 99.58 to yield 38 basis
points over the five-year US Treasury bond, but in the course of trading the
yield tightened to 35-36 basis points, traders said, with the bond priced at
99.50-99.55.
Nomura and Merrill Lynch, the joint lead managers, said the deal was
fully-placed, with European pension and insurance funds buying about 40 per
cent and the rest going to Japanese and other Far Eastern investors such as
investment trusts.
The deal was seen as fairly priced, and traders said the combination of a
bullish tone in the underlying government bond markets yesterday and the
fact that the lead managers had two full days in which to market the issue
contributed to its success. Toyota is one of several Japanese companies
which currently face having to refinance equity warrant issues.
The US dollar sector of the international bond market saw a heavy load of
issues yesterday, with a Dollars 100m deal from Telebras, the Brazilian
telecommunications group, and a Dollars 500m deal from Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, the large Swedish bank.
Telebras' five-year bond carried a coupon of 10 per cent and was priced to
yield 365 basis points over the US Treasury bond, which dealers say should
make it appeal to investors in search of high-yielding paper.
Dealers point out that successive Telebras bond issues are being priced more
aggressively: a three-year bond from the same borrower launched in February
was priced at 450 basis points over the three-year US Treasury bond. 'The
market for LDC debt has come in dramatically in recent months, and you can
now price these deals more aggressively provided there is a 10 per cent
coupon,' claimed one dealer.
S-E Banken increased its bond offering from Dollars 300m to Dollars 500m
shortly after the deal was launched. Credit Suisse First Boston, the lead
managers, said the five-year bond was priced at 78 basis points over the US
Treasury, narrowing to 76 basis points over. The bond was trading at about
99.90 by late afternoon and the proceeds were swapped into floating rate
dollars to produce a floating rate asset with a coupon of Libor plus 45
basis points.
Outside the dollar sector, Credit Local De France launched a FFr2bn zero
coupon issue which, with a maturity of 15 years is the longest-dated zero
coupon bond in this currency sector.
BNP, the lead managers, claimed there was strong demand for long-dated
zero-coupon issues: retail investors buy this kind of paper for tax reasons
while institutional investors are more likely to buy it for the combination
of maturity, currency and leverage. Launched at the reoffer price of 28.299,
the bond traded at 28.27-28.32 by late afternoon.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Commercial Union joins
preference share issuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION yesterday became the latest in a line of UK financial
sector companies to strengthen its balance sheet without resorting to a
rights offer by issuing preference shares.
Although the Pounds 100m issue is the first in recent years by a UK
insurance company, banks and building societies are increasingly turning to
preference shares for quasi-equity funding.
Until last year, preference share issues were very rare. Most companies
preferred to issue either straight equity or debt securities. Bank of
Scotland was the only issuer, tapping the market in 1988 and 1990.
However, last September National Westminster Bank raised Pounds 140m capital
from an issue of undated preference stock. In February, it was followed by
Bank of Ireland, which raised Pounds 110m.
Building societies have followed a similar route by issuing Permanent
Interest Bearing Shares (Pibs). Like preference shares, Pibs pay a fixed
dividend, have no redemption date and are deeply subordinated in the manner
of equity.
Preference shares are popular with financial sector borrowers because they
count as core capital for regulatory purposes. Financial institutions have
been able to improve balance sheet ratios without asking shareholders for
additional funds.
Commercial Union said that yesterday's issue would count as core capital
under both current UK government regulations and draft EC directives for the
insurance industry.
As a result, the company's solvency ratio - the ratio of premium income to
capital used by investors and regulators as a measure of balance sheet
strength - improved from 41 per cent to 44 per cent. In the late 1980s,
Commercial Union had a solvency ratio comfortably over 50 per cent.
Preference capital is more attractive because the cost has fallen steadily
in line with interest rates. Because preference shares pay a fixed rate of
interest, they are priced against UK government bonds.
For example, Commercial Union's preference shares pay a gross annual rate of
11.5 per cent, compared with 12 per cent on the National Westminster paper
issued last autumn.
In contrast, the cost of 'pure' equity capital has remained high. Corporate
financiers noted yesterday that equity investors had not scaled back
expectations of dividend growth substantially from the levels of the late
1980s.
Mr Peter Foster, general manager for finance at Commercial Union, said: 'We
had no urgent need for capital, but the issue gives us permanent additional
capital at a cheaper rate than equity over the long term.'
However, bankers are not predicting a rush of new preference issues. The
market for preference shares remains limited to UK institutional investors
with long-dated liabilities, such as pension funds and insurance companies.
Moreover, insurance companies are loathe to buy paper issued by their
competitors. Not all insurance companies with declining solvency ratios will
be able to tap the market.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Factory automation group
confident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLEN-BRADLEY, the factory automation company owned by Rockwell of the US,
hopes to double its share of the market for computer numerical control (CNC)
equipment over the next five years, according to Mr Don Davis, president.
Leadership of the world market for CNC equipment, used to run machine tools,
has passed from the US to Japan and Germany over the past 15 years, in line
with trends in the machine tool industry.
However Allen-Bradley plans a comeback. Earlier this year it launched a new
CNC range, the 9/Series, which Mr Davis hopes will help it raise world
market share from about 6 per cent. 'I would be very disappointed if we
can't double that,' he said.
Mr Davis admitted Allen-Bradley had struggled in the past because of the
dominance of Japan's Fanuc, which has about 50 per cent of the world CNC
market, and Germany's Siemens.
CNC is crucial in factory automation, and is increasingly bought by the
machine tool industry as a package.
'I can't say we will regain leadership, but a lot of customers are looking
for an alternative,' Mr Davis said.
The new range had been well received in Japan and Germany, respectively the
largest and second largest machine tool producers.
Allen-Bradley has until now had difficulties penetrating both these markets,
but it now plans to expand its presence. It has largely missed out on the
CNC market in Japan and eastern Asia, which account for between 35 and 40
per cent of consumption and could become increasingly important as machine
tool builders in countries such as Taiwan and South Korea seek to increase
exports.
Mr Davis also hopes the CNC business will be strengthened by a recent
reorganisation combining CNC and all other motion control products into a
new division based in Italy. The move coincides with Allen-Bradley taking
full control of Osai A-B, a CNC joint venture with Olivetti.
Allen-Bradley, formerly privately-owned, was bought by Rockwell for Dollars
1.6bn in 1985, after a keenly-contested auction. The US aerospace,
electronics and vehicle parts group narrowly beat a bid from Siemens. The
deal brought Rockwell a new 'leg' and Allen-Bradley financial stability in
an era of intensifying competition.
Mr Davis said the two companies were just beginning to see real benefits, in
technology terms, from the takeover. Apart from joint developments,
including work on so-called 'fuzzy logic' - software that can help make a
decision from unclear information - Rockwell had helped Allen-Bradley in
advanced areas such as neuro-networks and artificial intelligence.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: EBRD plans to set up finance
advisory brokerages in E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) plans to set up
two corporate finance advisory boutiques in Eastern Europe which may
eventually be launched as financial institutions in the private sector.
Mr David Hexter, head of the EBRD's Financial Institutions Group, said the
bank is keen to establish the new corporate finance advisory brokerages, as
these would help to select and identify new projects in Eastern Europe for
the EBRD and others.
The two projects still need the EBRD board's approval. The projects would
require only a small amount of capital at first.
Once they were established as fully fledged financial institutions, however,
the EBRD said it would probably reduce its involvement by selling, or by
reducing its participation.
Mr Hexter said: 'In both cases we have identified locally committed people
who are prepared to run with the idea'. The EBRD plans to provide help such
as credit analysis, training, and computer systems. He added that ideally
the EBRD should play the role of a 'catalyst', encouraging foreign banks to
participate in banking joint ventures.
Mr Hexter, who previously helped to set up banking ventures in Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary while he was working at Citibank, said that he
was impressed by the willingness of Eastern European bankers to learn and to
adapt to market conditions.
The EBRD is working to develop banking systems in many Eastern and Central
European economies. An estimated 90 to 95 per cent of the banks in the
region are state-owned. The EBRD wants to promote the development of private
sector banks.

TOYO Sash, Japan's top maker of aluminium housing products, revealed a 14.6
per cent drop to Y32.5bn (Dollars 244.36m) in non-consolidated pre-tax
profits for the year to end-March.
Net profits also fell sharply, by 28.6 per cent to Y14.8bn, although sales
climbed a modest 4 per cent to Y481bn.
A sharp drop in demand in the second half - reflecting the nation's stock
market troubles - and a private sector spending downturn were behind the
profit retreat, the company said.
Sales of housing sashes, which account for over half of company sales, grew
1.1 per cent to Y280bn. Building sash sales grew 10.6 per cent to Y148bn,
due largely to new products for high-rise structures.
Turnover of housing equipment and other products also gained 11.5 per cent
to Y14bn. However, construction material sales were off 0.2 per cent to
Y38.7bn.
Toyo Sash, which sells all of its products domestically, is planning to
change its name to Tostem after July 1, to reflect a shift to more
diversified housing products manufacturing.
The company said the outlook for the current year for another official
discount rate cut was unlikely to push housing investment sharply higher and
spark a rebound in its results. Toyo Sash expects a 6 per cent gain in sales
to Y510bn. Pre-tax profits are expected to rise 1.5 per cent to Y33,000bn,
and net profits 11 per cent to Y16,500bn.

MITSUBISHI Petrochemical, a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Royal Dutch
Shell, suffered a 35.6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, to Y30bn (Dollars
225.56m), for the year ended March.
The economic slowdown in Japan and abroad, and inventory adjustments cut
petrochemical demand, the company said. Lower product prices were also
accompanied by higher operating expenses.
Sales at Mitsubishi Petrochemical, Japan's industry leader, were off 6.4 per
cent to Y407bn, while net profits declined 40.2 per cent to Y15.4bn. By
sector, sales of resins were up 1.6 per cent to Y167bn and fine chemicals
34.8 per cent to Y27bn. Sales of plastics, however, fell 18.6 per cent to
Y161.5bn and special chemicals 1 per cent to Y50bn.
The company's current assets declined 31 per cent to Y348bn, including a
fall from Y186bn to Y118bn in cash holdings and from Y42bn to Y35bn in
investment securities.

<TEXT>
TORAY Industries, Japan's leading synthetic fibre maker, yesterday posted
falls in consolidated earnings for the full year to March. It blamed
sluggish demand for its synthetic fibres, and lower profits at its
construction affiliate.
Pre-tax profits fell 11.4 per cent to Y64bn (Dollars 481.20m) on a 6.5 per
cent increase in total sales, to Y976.7bn. After-tax profits plunged 26.2
per cent to Y27.7bn.
The company's fibre sales grew 10.1 per cent to Y489.9bn. However, the
company said demand for nylon used in tyre cords and fishing nets declined.
Sales of chemicals and new businesses declined 0.5 per cent and 2.4 per cent
respectively.
Nylon resin sales slowed because of sluggish demand from the automotive and
electronic industries. Polyester film sales also decreased because of low
demand and increasing price competition from film for magnetic tapes and
industrial materials.
Sales of the housing and engineering division rose 7.8 per cent to Y219bn,
but operating profits fell 3.2 per cent to Y7.6bn.
Toray's non-operating deficit widened by 47 per cent to Y11.9bn, as interest
and dividends received fell 24.4 per cent to Y18.6bn. The company's cash and
deposit balance plunged 23.8 per cent to Y100bn.
The company also posted extraordinary losses on stock holdings of Y2.1bn.
For the current year to March 1993, Toray expects further price competition
to squeeze earnings, and forecasts a 2.4 per cent drop in consolidated
pre-tax profits to Y63bn, on a 4.4 per cent rise in sales to Y1,020bn.

HASEKO, a leading Japanese condominium-builder, was hit by the worsening
domestic economy. Reporting a sharp drop in profits, the company pointed to
an especially harsh environment in the real estate and construction
industries, with investment down sharply in office buildings and large
apartment complexes.
It posted a non-consolidated Y25.2bn drop in pre-tax profits, to Y25bn
(Dollars 187.96m), and a 42.8 per cent fall, to Y8bn, in net profits in the
year ended March. Sales increased 1.5 per cent to Y529bn.
Haseko's construction sales were up 6.8 per cent to Y328bn, and management
income 3 per cent to Y19.4bn. Design management sales, however, fell 9 per
cent to Y7.1bn. Real estate was down 7 per cent to Y174bn. Order receipts
declined 33.4 per cent to Y280bn.
Haseko drew down current assets Y47bn to Y839bn, including a drop in cash
reserves of Y32bn to Y96bn and a sell-off of its entire Y1.5bn securities
portfolio. Current liabilities were off Y85bn to Y646bn.
With no signs of a pick-up in private capital investment or consumer
spending, it expects continued hard times for construction orders and real
estate activities. For the year ended March 1993, it expects its first sales
decline in nine years, of 9.2 per cent to Y480bn. Pre-tax profits are also
seen falling 40 per cent to Y15bn, and net profits 54 per cent to Y6.5bn.

YAMAHA, the world's leading musical instrument maker, logged a 37.6 per cent
drop in non-consolidated pre-tax profits, to Y6.8bn (Dollars 52.6m). Net
profits fell 29.4 per cent to Y2.8bn in the year ended March. Both figures
were down for the second consecutive year.
The Shizuoka-based company blamed sluggish demand for pianos and other
musical instruments for the declines.
Overall, sales for the year edged up 0.1 per cent to Y383.7bn after a slight
decline the previous year.
Domestic sales, however, gained 1.3 per cent to Y272bn, despite weak demand
for synthesizers and other electrical instruments.
The negative effect of the yen's rise contributed to a 2.8 per cent drop in
exports, to Y111.5bn, despite the start of piano shipments to Steinway of
the US during the second half of the year.
Piano sales fell Y7.4bn to Y60bn, electronic instruments Y3.2bn to Y68bn and
audio equipment Y3bn to Y29bn. Sales of other instruments gained Y1.4bn to
Y50bn.
Yamaha's current assets slipped Y12.6bn to Y150.6bn, including a drop of
Y518m in its securities holdings, to Y890m.
For the year to next March, Yamaha expects sales and profits to decline
further, largely because of a planned shift of household equipment
operations to a subsidiary.
Pre-tax profits are expected to fall 48 per cent to Y3.5bn and net profits
47 per cent to Y1.5bn, on a sales drop of 10 per cent in sales to Y345bn.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Indonesian banks in merger
discussions
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Indonesia's largest banks are discussing a merger in what, bankers
believe, may be the first step in the restructuring of PT Astra
International, Indonesia's second largest public company.
The banks, Bank Danamon and Bank Summa, are the country's second and 11th
largest respectively, excluding the five state-owned commercial banks.
Bank Summa is part of the Summa Group which, bankers say, is controlled by
the Soeryadjaya family. The family owns about 75 per cent of Astra, which is
responsible for over half of Indonesia's total vehicle sales, in addition to
interests in financial services, timber and agribusiness.
Brokers estimate, however, that vehicle sales have declined more than 40 per
cent since 1990. Last month Astra, which has a market capitalisation of
Rp3,025bn (Dollars 1.5bn), announced 1991 net profits of Rp210bn, down 11
per cent on 1990.
Brokers are forecasting a further 15 to 20 per cent fall in profits this
year. Astra had total borrowing of Rp2,247bn (over 50 per cent short-term)
at the end of 1991.
'The merger itself has not been discussed by the board (of Bank Summa). It
is up to the shareholders,' Bank Summa said yesterday. It would not confirm
local press reports that Summa has received a Rp100bn loan from Danamon.
Bankers say a merger may be tripartite and include Universal Bank,
Indonesia's 14th largest private bank and one 51 per cent-owned by Astra
International.
Bank Danamon's total assets are estimated at about Rp3,700bn. It had a
pre-tax profit in 1991 of Rp75bn. Bank Summa, with current assets of
Rp1,700bn, recorded pre-tax profits last year of just Rp3bn, brokers say.
Bankers believe Summa has been hit by clients defaulting on car purchase
loans and a sharp fall in the property development market. Shareholders
recently injected Rp300bn into the bank to enable it to meet a capital
adequacy requirement of 4.75 per cent of total assets.

ABITIBI-Price, 80 per cent owned by the Reichmann brothers through Olympia &amp;
York developments, is selling its printing and industrial paper products
distribution business in Canada and the US to Alco Standard for CDollars
340m (USDollars 285.7m) cash.
The deal includes four Abitibi units: Inter City Papers, Barber Ellis Fine
Papers and Price Daxion in Canada and Whitaker Carpenter in the US.
Mr Ron Oberlander, president of Abitibi, said the proceeds will be used to
reduce Abitibi's debt. He stressed that Abitibi had no intention of paying a
special dividend.
'We are carrying out our strategy to sell non-core businesses,' he said.
'The four businesses now being sold have annual sales of CDollars 850m, are
profitable and represent most of our diversified products group.' Last year
Abitibi, one of North America's largest newsprint producers, had sales of
just over CDollars 3bn.
Mr Oberlander said Abitibi wants to sell its building products business,
several paper converting units and an office products distributor when the
timing is right.

RH MACY is to close eight underperforming department stores by August 1 in
order to strengthen its overall performance, AP-DJ reports from New York.
The US stores group, in Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, said the
decision to close the stores followed a review of the company.
The review was based on several factors, including unsatisfactory
profitability and productivity, a declining sales trend and a lack of growth
potential in the market.
Macy's has notified the bankruptcy court and its creditor groups of its
decision.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Honda hit by fall in domestic
sales - Changes planned to give local management more autonomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HONDA Motor, the Japanese car maker, yesterday reported a 1 per cent fall in
consolidated pre-tax profit to Y130.76bn (Dollars 1.01bn), and announced
changes to its management structure to give executives in the US and Europe
more autonomy.
In common with other Japanese car makers, Honda has suffered from the
downturn in the domestic market, where new registrations were 5.1 per cent
down January to April, compared with the same period last year. But the
company is still planning to expand its share of foreign markets.
It said net profit for the current year is likely to fall by about Y5bn from
last year's Y64.9bn, itself down 14.9 per cent, partly because of costs
related to the commencement of UK production, scheduled for this October.
A series of management promotions and title changes have created four clear
divisions of Honda's car business, covering Japan, the US, Europe and
'others,' with each of the regions apparently given more control over local
design, research and marketing.
'We felt that we had to make our management more flexible in these regions.
Basically, the international car market is very stable, with no area
promising rapid growth, and we have to adjust to this stable growth era,'
Honda said.
The company's consolidated sales rose 2.1 per cent to Y4,391bn, with a 3.9
per cent increase in car sales and a 2 per cent fall in revenue from
motorcycles, even though there was a 6.4 per cent increase in sales by
volume.
The company said motorcycle sales were helped by strong demand from other
Asian countries, although revenue was hurt by an appreciation of the yen.
Parent company pre-tax profits, more exposed to the weak domestic car
market, fell by 21.3 per cent to Y66.9bn on a 4 per cent increase in sales
to Y2,911bn. For the current year, the parent is expecting slight sales
growth at Y2,920bn and profits flat at Y67bn.
'We are not very optimistic in our estimations for the domestic market this
year. Total sales in the market will probably be at the same level as last
year's 7.43m units. Sales will be at that level or a little lower,' the
company said.
The company sold about 669,000 cars in Japan last year, unchanged from the
previous period, 953,000 in the US, up from 952,000, and 196,000 in Europe,
up from 173,000, while the 'others' accounted for 143,000, an increase of
22,000 units.
As with many leading Japanese companies, Honda is planning to reduce capital
spending, with the target this year Y200bn, down from Y237.8bn last year.

<TEXT>
MAPLE Leaf Foods, the Canadian food-processing subsidiary of the UK's
Hillsdown Holdings, has again overcome weak markets to post a 31 per cent
rise in first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings from continuing operations climbed to CDollars 12m (USDollars
10), or 15 cents a share, from CDollars 9.2m, or 14 cents a share, a year
earlier.
Sales dropped to CDollars 638m from CDollars 747m, due largely to the
surgery which has transformed Maple Leaf, formerly Canada Packers, over the
past 18 months into a more tightly focused and aggressive company.
Mr Charles Bowen, recently appointed chief executive, ascribed the improved
earnings to continued cost-cutting, lower interest expense and wider margins
as a result of a greater emphasis on value-added products.
The company earned net interest of CDollars 1.9m this year, compared with
debt-service charges of CDollars 3.7m in 1991.
Maple Leaf, which has virtually no long-term debt and net cash reserves of
over CDollars 200m, has recently switched its focus from reorganisation to
expansion.
It has signed a flour-milling joint venture with ConAgra, the big US
agri-business group. The company reported sharply higher first-quarter
earnings from its milling opera-tions.
Maple Leaf has also proposed buying out the minorities in Corporate Foods,
its baking subsidiary, as a first step towards North American expansion.

CDollars 5.7m

<TEXT>
MITEL, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker controlled by British
Telecom, has enjoyed its best quarter in several years, but posted a loss
for fiscal 1992 as a whole.
The company, based in Ottawa, also warned that, despite a return to profit
in its fourth quarter, strong competitive pressures remain. It indicated it
was unlikely to repeat the past three months' results for at least the next
half-year.
The net loss for the fiscal year ended March 27 was CDollars 5.7m (USDollars
4.78m), or 12 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 107m loss, or CDollars
1.41 a share, in fiscal 1991. Revenues slipped to CDollars 406.1m from
CDollars 431.3m.
Operating losses, excluding extraordinary charges, were cut from CDollars
31.8m to CDollars 8.1m.
The fourth quarter, however, produced a CDollars 5m profit on record sales
of CDollars 121.7m. Much of the recent improvement is due to intense efforts
to contain costs.
Sales of the GX5000 office switchboard more than doubled to CDollars 7.1m
last year.
BT has been seeking a buyer for the past two years for the 51 per cent stake
in Mitel it bought in 1985.

SWISSAIR and Austrian Airlines are to operate jointly customer service

to intensify co-operation and reduce costs.
The remaining offices, including agencies of the two airlines in border
towns of neighbouring countries, will be operated by the home airline.
Passenger and cargo handling at Swiss and Austrian airports will pass to the
home carrier from September 1.
Austrian Airlines and Swissair, together with Scandinavian Airlines System
(SAS), formed the European Quality Alliance in 1989 to share facilities and
improve their competitiveness.
The three recently set up jointly operated stations in some eastern European
cities.
Further links among the three were possible, said Mr Otto Loepfe, chief
executive of Swissair, but he ruled out mergers.
'Generally we have said that, short of merger, all possibilities are open,'
he said at a Zurich press conference.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COFINEC, the central European investment vehicle of Mr Carlo De Benedetti,
the Italian financier, has taken control of Kner, a Hungarian printing
group. The move is Cofinec's latest step towards its goal of building a
Hungarian packaging business with annual turnover of Dollars 100m.
Cofinec - controlled by Mr De Benedetti's Cerus investment arm - and the
Hungarian Investment Company - the country fund managed by John Govett of
the UK - bought 85 per cent of Kner in an investment worth Dollars 20m.
The acquisition follows last year's purchase of Petofi, Hungary's most
important packaging producer. Cofinec said that Petofi was in the
international equity market and that a transaction would be announced soon.
The Petofi offering comes after investments by the Hungary country funds and
international institutions such as the Hungarian American Enterprise Fund
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Petofi was the
first industrial company in eastern Europe to receive credit from the EBRD,
which has given priority to eastern Europe's underdeveloped packaging
industry.
Mr De Benedetti's group has been encouraged by rapid improvements in
productivity and exports at Petofi. It is looking to build a more extensive
packaging and printing business in central Europe.
'Hungary is still a low-cost country and close to markets which we want to
penetrate very much,' explained Mr De Benedetti yesterday. 'This started as
an investment opportunity and turned into a business opportunity.'
Mr De Benedetti also said that Olivetti, the Italian computer company he
controls, was working on additional orders for systems from Hungarian banks.
Olivetti already has a contract with Hungary's National Savings Bank.
However, Mr De Benedetti said that Olivetti was not planning any
acquisitions in eastern Europe, in spite of a recent decision by
International Business Machines to take a minority stake in Muszertechnika,
Hungary's leading computer company.

FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Court ruling angers Price
Waterhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE, the New York based accountancy firm, has been angered by
an Arizona court decision calling upon it to pay Dollars 338m in damages to
Standard Chartered Bank of the UK. The ruling, late on Tuesday, relates to
negligence in past audits of a US bank acquired by Standard Chartered.
The jury decision, which blamed Price Waterhouse for negligence and breach
of fiduciary duty, is thought to be the biggest award ever levied against an
accountancy firm in the US.
The court finding stems from a lawsuit brought in 1988 by Standard
Chartered. The suit claimed Price Waterhouse had failed to identify and
report 'material deficiencies' in the loan portfolio and internal controls
system of United Bancorp, an Arizona bank bought by the UK bank in 1987.
Standard Chartered paid Dollars 335m for United, made heavy losses, and 18
months later sold it to Citicorp for Dollars 207m. The UK bank's lawsuit
claimed that Price Waterhouse was negligent in its 1985 and 1986 audits of
United Bancorp.
Price Waterhouse admitted yesterday its insurance coverage would cover an
amount of more than Dollars 100m in damages, but not the full Dollars 338m
awarded by the court. Ms Erica Baird, a Price Waterhouse executive in New
York, said, however, that 'our net worth is greatly in excess of the
difference'.
Ms Baird described the court decision as 'outrageous'. She said Price
Waterhouse had played no role in the 1987 acquisition by Standard Chartered.
'I am confident we will never pay this award,' she said.
In a memo to Price Waterhouse partners in the US, Mr Shaun O'Malley,
chairman, called the verdict 'unfair and unjustified'. He said Price
Waterhouse would move immediately for a new trial.
Price Waterhouse said it was heartened that the Arizona jury had not found
it guilty of violating the state's Civil Racketeering Act, which would have
permitted damages to be trebled to more than Dollars 1bn.
Mr O'Malley called the verdict 'completely contrary to the evidence' and
claimed that United Bancorp's 1985 and 1986 financial statements 'were
presented fairly even with the benefit of hindsight'.
The Price Waterhouse chairman also assured partners that 'knowing the risks
of a jury trial, we have been preparing for all contingencies and believe we
can have the judgment stayed, pending appeal'.
In London, the UK sister firm is facing a separate and unrelated charge of
negligent auditing, this one contained in a writ filed by the liquidators of
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).
Price Waterhouse has denied the charges contained in the BCCI-related writ,
which claims Price Waterhouse was negligent as an auditor of BCCI and failed
to spot serious irregularities in audits it performed before 1987.

POLYGRAM, the London- based music and entertainment company which is 80 per
cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, has formed a joint venture with
Universal Pictures of the US for the distribution of films in North America.
The North American distribution venture marks a further step in the
company's efforts to increase its presence in the film industry.
The joint venture, to be called Gramercy Pictures, will be based in Los
Angeles.
It is aimed at marketing medium-budget films supplied by both Polygram and
Universal.
The company intends to handle the release of an initial eight films a year,
with more expected as the joint venture grows.
PolyGram and Universal, which is part of MCA, the US film subsidiary of
Matsushita of Japan, will continue to handle their own distribution in
markets outside North America.
The new company was formed because the partners believe the marketing of
medium-budget films requires a different approach than the saturation
advertising often available for big-budget, blockbuster films.
'Many good movies, with enormous box office potential, require a more
nurturing marketing and distribution process. This new company was
especially created to do just that,' said Mr Tom Pollock, chairman of the
MCA Motion Picture Group.
PolyGram said the joint venture was part of the company's Dollars 200m
programme of investment in the film business.
The investment programme was announced in September, when Polygram took
majority control of two film production companies, Propaganda Films and
Working Title.
At the time, Polygram said that its plans for distributing medium-budget
films in the US might involve setting up such a joint venture company.

investment
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON, the fund management group, is seeking at least Pounds 20m from
the launch of an investment trust specialising in European equities. It is
the second new European investment trust to be announced this week.
Henderson EuroTrust will have a split capital structure, with 75 per cent of
the issued capital in ordinary shares, and the rest in zero-dividend
preference shares.
It is hoped that this structure will stop the shares from moving to a
discount to net asset value.
The company has a 10-year life until the annual general meeting of October
2002, when the zero shares will be redeemed at 70p.
This is equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 10.2 per cent. Projected
initial gross yield on the ordinary shares is 5 per cent.
During the launch issue only packaged units, consisting of one ordinary
share and one zero at a price of Pounds 1, will be available.
Total launch expenses have been fixed at 4.5 per cent, with an annual
management fee of 0.85 per cent.
The trust is aimed at small investors, via brokers, and smaller
institutions. The fund has a minimum holding in bonds of 15 per cent, and
can invest up to 10 per cent of its assets in derivatives. It hopes to use
this combination to deliver both income and capital growth.
The prospectus will be available on June 8, and applications for Personal
Equity Plans will close on June 22. The offer closes on June 30, with
dealings in the shares starting on July 6.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ferguson International declines to Pounds
6.63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVERSELY affected by trading conditions world-wide, but particularly in the
UK, Ferguson International Holdings saw pre-tax profits shrink by 43 per
cent from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 6.63m in the year to Feb-ruary 29.
However, Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said he had detec-ted 'some encouraging
stirrings' in trading since January and especially in March and April.
Trading profits were eroded in all of Ferguson's four legs. Mr Cassidy
singled out the recessionary impact on UK retailers for the falls in the
labels and hangers divisions - down 20 per cent to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds
5.88m) and 15 per cent to Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 3.08m) respectively.
The chairman cited the tightened advertising expenditure for the decline in
printing and publishing, which suffered the deepest fall - 44 per cent to
Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 1.45m).
Trading profits of the communications components side, supplying cable TV
parts in the US, slipped to Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 1.7m), but showed a 47 per
cent return on capital employed and was, said Mr Cassidy, a strong cash
generator.
Group trading profits on continuing activities were down 20 per cent to
Pounds 9.7m, an improvement on the 28 per cent reduction at the halfway
stage.
Boosted by two acquisitions - Interstate Cable Enterprises of the US and
Globus Druck of Germany - turnover on continuing activities rose 6 per cent
to Pounds 114.9m.
Interest payable was cut by 56 per cent to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 2.54m) and
there were exceptional costs of Pounds 1.6m relating mainly to the closure
of Harkwell Labels &amp; Tags. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.14m derived
from the disposal of non-core businesses.
Earnings emerged at 13.5p (22.7p) per share and the directors have proposed
holding the final dividend at 8.25p for a maintained 12.5p total.

Barrett
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Henry Barrett Group fell 6p to 26p yesterday, close to an all-time
low, after the the steel and industrial fasteners company announced an
interim loss and expressed caution about the immediate outlook.
Barrett, which has been forced to rein back after rapid expansion in the
1980s, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.19m in the six months to February
29, compared with a profit of Pounds 272,000.
Turnover fell to Pounds 49.4m, against Pounds 57.4m, which included Pounds
11m relating to discontinued activities or businesses for sale.
Mr James Barrett, group chief executive, said stockholding and industrial
fasteners were profitable. But the construction division, mainly involved in
structural steelwork, lost money because of pressure on margins.
'We're looking for margin not volume recovery,' he said.
Losses per share were 3.47p (earnings 0.37p) and no interim dividend is
being paid. However, the company said it would pay a nominal final dividend
because several shareholders are trusts which have to sell shares if no
dividend is paid.
Barrett has continued to sell loss-making businesses, leading to an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.7m. Last month Park Pallet, which is
involved in materials handling, was sold for Pounds 168,000.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 295,000 covered redundancies in ongoing
businesses. Once Barrett's disposals and cuts are complete, the workforce
will fall to 800, compared to 1,350 a year ago.
Net borrowings remained high at Pounds 19.9m at the end of the period,
equivalent to 87 per cent of shareholders funds (74 per cent). Mr Barrett
said gearing should fall towards 50 per cent by the year end as cash flow
was expected to turn mildly positive and some property sales were pending.
Interest costs were unchanged at Pounds 1.18m.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Price war cuts RHM to Pounds 49m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RANKS HOVIS McDougall, the UK's largest baker, yesterday revealed the
effects of the deepening bread price war with a sharper-than-expected 36 per
cent drop in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 48.5m.
The group also indicated that trading in the second half remained difficult
and said annual profits would be significantly lower than last year.
Analysts, surprised at the depth of price-cutting and at difficulties in
RHM's US market, cut full-year forecasts from Pounds 110m to between Pounds
95m and Pounds 98m. Although the company had warned in January of lower
profits, analysts said the indications were that price-cutting was
deepening.
Mr Paul Coker, managing director, said the company intended to pursue
volume, even at the expense of margin. 'If you haven't got volume you
haven't got a business,' he said.
RHM, which entered the bread price war in the new year, had begun to rebuild
the volume lost when it refused to cut prices last autumn, Mr Coker said.
Turnover for the six months to February 29 rose by Pounds 7.4m to Pounds
773.7m.
RHM did not intend to close any more of its 18 bakeries, he added. 'If there
has to be capacity taken out, others can do it.'
The milling and bread baking division, the group's largest business which
includes brands such as Hovis, saw pre-tax profits drop by 62 per cent to
Pounds 12.6m. The cakes business, home of Mr Kipling, also suffered from
price-cutting and profits fell from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 5.1m.
In the US, RHM suffered the effects of higher peanut prices and a surplus of
tomatoes, which resulted in a squeeze on ketchup margins. Pre-tax profits in
North America fell by 84 per cent to Pounds 900,000.
Both grocery products that and food services increased profits through
cost-cutting and rationalisation, Mr Coker said.
Earnings dropped by 35 per cent to 9.6p but the interim dividend is
maintained at 3.82p.
COMMENT
RHM's shares proved remarkably resilient despite the results yesterday,
closing up 5p at 234p. This has less to do with bullish sentiment than the
fact that RHM maintained the interim dividend, making the yield a healthy 8
per cent.
Yet, on full year estimates dividend cover falls to about 1.5 times -
compared with a sector average of more than two times - and only marginally
higher for 1993.
There is also the threat that RHM is not generating enough profit to make
the pay-out and it will have to use cash balances to do so.
On full-year forecasts of Pounds 95m, the prospective p/e of 12.1 times
leaves little reason to buy. Given next year's outlook there appears to be
even less reason to hold.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Currie has 65% of Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARTIN Currie Pacific Trust said that it has received more than 65 per cent
acceptances for its offer for Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, which is
managed by Jupiter Tyndall.
Valid acceptances have been received for 65.79 per cent of the ordinary
shares and 44.55 per cent of the warrants.
A further 4.92 per cent of ordinary shareholders and 6.46 per cent of
warrant holders have sent in acceptances, which are in the process of being
validated. The offer has been extended until June 2.
Jupiter Tyndall has been battling to block the takeover and has assembled a
25.1 per cent stake in the trust's warrants. Last week, it voted down a
resolution which required a 75 per cent majority of warrant holders. As a
result, Martin Currie dropped an improved offer for the ordinary shares of
Pacific Horizon.
Jupiter has said that it will put forward its own propo-sals to enhance
shareholder value and enable share and warrant holders to receive cash for
all or part of their holdings.
Jupiter has a 15.4 per cent stake in the ordinary shares and has said that
it will not accept the offer, thus preventing Martin Currie from passing the
90 per cent mark at which it could compulsorily acquire the outstanding
shares.
In these circumstances Jupiter says that the rights of the warrant holders
will have to be substantially enhanced; Martin Currie Pacific says it has
received legal advice that this is not the case.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Compass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESILIENT demand helped Compass Group, the catering and hospitals concern,
to increase pre-tax profit by nearly 10 per cent, from Pounds 15.5m to
Pounds 17m, in the six months to March 29.
Turnover advanced at a similar rate to Pounds 177m (Pounds 161m). Mr Francis
Mackay, chief executive, said both divisions had achieved record sales and
profits.
In contract catering, operating profit rose to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 12.7m)
on sales of Pounds 146m (Pounds 132m). The margin was reduced by a large
contract with British Telecom, announced at this time last year. It
contributed about Pounds 20m to turnover but the margin was much lower than
with established contracts.
Fewer new contracts were signed and more were lost as sites closed, leaving
a net gain of only seven. Redundancies also reduced traffic through some
canteens.
Opportunities were opening up in public sector hospitals and schools. The
catering market in health and education was worth about Pounds 3.3bn, more
than twice the corporate market. However, only 5 per cent was contracted out
compared with 50 per cent in the business sector.
The purchase of four hospitals early in 1991, taking the total to 15, helped
the healthcare division to increase operating profit to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds
5.6m) on sales of Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 26.1m).
Although average occupancy fell from 57.5 to 50 per cent because of the
acquisitions, improved efficiency enabled overall margins to rise slight-ly.
Net debt fell to Pounds 36.5m, against Pounds 41.1m at the year-end.
However, last year's acquisition-led spending bulge was in the first half,
whereas most of this year's investment in hospital expansion will come in
the second half.
Earnings per share rose to 16.8p (15.4p) and the interim dividend goes up to
4.19p (3.85p).
COMMENT
While scope remains for improving margins at BT and the acquired hospitals,
short-term growth in catering will be limited by the lagging recovery in
employment and by the time taken to win public-sector contracts. A move on
to the continent also looks medium-term, unless some acquisition is in its
sights. Market rumours have resurfaced that it may be interested in its
rival Gardner Merchant. While Forte would consider a rich offer, Compass is
unlikely to pay over the odds and there would be a monopoly issue in the UK,
where the two have 50 per cent of the corporate market. A full-year pre-tax
profit of Pounds 35m gives a prospective multiple of about 15 on yesterday's
close of 519p, down 8p as expectations were a little dampened. While Compass
has no trough to bounce back from, it deserves a premium for its sustained
growth record and for the bright prospects in both its markets. After a good
run, the shares still look a strong hold.

Monument Oil and Gas, the independent exploration and production company,
has agreed to sell its 3 per cent interest in the Markham gas field in line
with its strategy of disposing of licences in which its interest is
relatively small.
Wintershall (UK) is paying some Pounds 10.4m cash for UKCS License P701.
This includes the reimbursement of certain development costs incurred by
Monument. The agreement provides for adjustment of the settlement subject to
a redetermination of field interest between the participants.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Miller hit by write-down of Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Miller Group, one of the UK's biggest privately-owned
construction companies, tumbled from Pounds 10.75m to just Pounds 537,000 in
1991 as the recession continued to hit property values.
The figures were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 6.45m
arising from land and property write-downs and the closure of a specialist
subsidiary. This followed an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.5m in 1990.
The group has interests in civil engineering, general construction, mining
property development and housebuilding.
It recently appointed Mr David Cawthra as chief executive to assist with its
expansion plans. Mr Cawthra was previously chief executive of Balfour
Beatty, the construction arm of BICC the large engineering group.
Turnover of Miller last year was virtually static at Pounds 238.03m against
Pounds 235.38m. After tax of Pounds 210,000 (Pounds 4.16m) and dividends the
group suffered an overall loss of Pounds 314,000 (Pounds 5.91m profit).
Mr James Miller, chairman, stressed the strength of the company's balance
sheet.

<TEXT>
YOUNG &amp; Co's Brewery, the south-London based independent brewer, increased
profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 5.59m pre-tax in the year to March 28.
Trading profits rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 8.03m on turnover 16.4 per
cent ahead at Pounds 68.14m.
Earnings declined from 28.38p to 27.51p but a final dividend of 7.5p (7p)
lifts the total to 14.5p - a rise of 11.5 per cent.
Trading profits were helped by the Pounds 12m acquisition last August of the
HH Finch chain of 22 pubs and six wine bars and restaurants. These outlets
contributed profits of Pounds 541,722 on turnover of Pounds 5.39m.
Additional borrowings increased interest charges from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds
2.68m.
Revaluation of the com-pany's property assets at the year end resulted in a
surplus of Pounds 18m over book value.
Sales of assets during the year realised gains of Pounds 244,000.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire TV 55% ahead to Pounds 9.36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Television yester-day announced a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax
profit to Pounds 9.36m for the six months to the end of March.
Sir Derek Palmar, the Yorkshire chairman, yesterday described the result as
a good increase in a period of recession that reflected the group's
decentralised divisional structure 'which encourages management at all
levels to maintain constant pressure to reduce costs in all areas.'
The result was achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 95m to Pounds 102m.
Yorkshire, like other ITV companies, benefited from the government's
decision to reduce the exchequer levy in the last year of the old franchises
before the survivors started paying the Treasury the money they bid to
retain their franchises.
Yorkshire's profit before levy rose from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.7m but
the company only paid Pounds 3.38m in levy in the half year compared with
Pounds 5.61m in the same period last year.
Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire's managing director, said that the rise in
operating profit had been the best in ITV.
Yorkshire, a company in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
20 per cent stake, successfully retained its licence against two rivals but
with a bid of Pounds 37.7m a year.
The payments, in monthly slices, start in January together with 7 per cent
of qualifying advertising reven-ue.
Mr Leach said yesterday that Yorkshire had already achieved its 1993 cost
structure - eight months ahead of schedule.
The company had a net cash balance of Pounds 13.1m at the end of March.
Earnings per share improved from 10.1p to 16p and the interim dividend is
being maintained at 3.3p.
Yorkshire said yesterday that there had been vigorous discussions with some
advertisers designed to 'raise the value of the company's airtime in the
market to bring it more in line with our high audience delivery in
preparation for 1993.'
Despite difficulties Yorkshire improved advertising revenue to Pounds 75.8m
(Pounds 71m) and the sales of programmes increased by 8.7 per cent from
Pounds 23.87m to Pounds 25.95m.
Margins however remained depressed and further steps were being taken to
improve profitability.
Yorkshire said the outlook for advertising revenue was encouraging and the
company was confident that its position as a strong ITV licensee was
assured.
The share price rose 3p to 193p.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: A future based on a dual-track strategy for
growth - Vital changes that have transformed Courtaulds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS new headquarters in London's west end Mr Sipko Huismans was in
ebullient mood as he announced an 8 per cent improvement in Courtaulds' full
year profits.
The move to the smart new offices symbolises the changes at Courtaulds since
it demerged its textiles operations two-years ago, according to Mr Huismans.
'We've moved the group from a tired, beaten up textile company in dingy
surroundings into a modern up-to-date entity which has taken a grip of its
destiny,' he says. 'We were described as a rat-bag of industries ripe only
for takeover. Now we have demonstrated we have critical mass.'
Courtaulds' ability to shrug off the recession has been dependent upon tight
financial controls and its ability to manage high-margin businesses, Mr
Huismans says.
The company has cut its workforce from 23,550 last year to 22,700 and
further cost savings are inevitable. Any company executive who reckons his
company is efficiently run is a fool, argues Mr Huismans. Courtaulds has
managers who cannot manage and there is lots more room for profits
improvements, he adds.
For the future, Mr Huismans has developed a dual-track strategy for growth
through the exploitation of a new material called Tencel and through the
replication of businesses on a global scale. Geographical expansion will
mainly be in the Far East.
He says he is not looking at diversification in any circumstances and that
any acquisitions would be add-ons. Mr Huismans says that during his tenure,
he would like to more than double turnover in the Far East. At present the
region generates about 6 per cent of sales and he would like it to reach 15
per cent.
Mr Huismans, who has been chief executive for nearly two years, reckons
managers can achieve about four or five things over about half a dozen years
before running out of steam.
Meanwhile, Tencel, a man-made fibre aimed at the high-quality cotton market,
remains one of Courtaulds' chief hopes. Its main advantage is that it does
not need dry cleaning, can be laundered like cotton, but unlike cotton it
can be produced when needed.
A first Tencel plant, costing about Dollars 85m, is on-stream and should
make every existing plant for cellulose fibres obsolete, according to Mr
Huismans. The process also has a minimal environmental impact, he adds. He
wants Courtaulds to reap the full benefits from Tencel, rather than
setting-up co-marketing agreements.
As for threats, the main one - according to analysts - is a Taiwanese
investment for additional viscose production in the US which threatens to
flood the market there, potentially undermining margins of between 20 and 25
per cent. But Mr Huismans reckons any investment would not come on stream
for five years and the permits for the necessary pulp plant have not even
been given yet.
'We've made mistakes,' admits Mr Huismans. 'I can name half a dozen without
even thinking.' When pressed for examples he says it would be invidious to
give details, but adds that all of them were because the group failed to
understand the market or underestimated the reaction of the competition. 'In
the end, you have to be an optimist, otherwise you end up as a gilts
investor,' he concludes.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Courtaulds improves 8% to Pounds 201.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS, the specialist materials group, yesterday reported an 8 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 201.4m for the year to March 31,
writes Paul Abrahams.
Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said the difficult economic conditions
of the past two years were showing some signs of easing.
The results were achieved on a turnover of Pounds 1.94bn compared with
Pounds 1.91bn. The tax charge in the UK was Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 21.5m)
while non-UK tax was Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 18.2m).
Earnings per share increased from 36.5p to 38p. A final dividend of 9.35p
makes a 13p (12p) total.
The improved results mostly reflected a sharp rise in the films and fibres
division where operating profits surged from Pounds 61m to Pounds 74m on
turnover of Pounds 647m (Pounds 667m). Mr Huismans said the improvement
resulted from the withdrawal from loss-making businesses such as
carbon-fibre, advancements in the demand-supply balance and productivity
gains.
Operating profits at the coatings division increased from Pounds 56m to
Pounds 59m on turnover of Pounds 678m (Pounds 640m). More than 20 per cent
of sales growth was in the Far East. The worldwide marine business performed
well, but results at protective coatings were described as sluggish.
Performance materials were adversely affected by the poor state of the civil
and military aviation industries. Weak demand in the US construction
industry also affected the sealants market. The division made operating
profits of Pounds 12m (Pounds 15m) on turnover of Pounds 183m (Pounds 179m).
The packaging division reported operating profits of Pounds 25m (Pounds 21m)
on turnover of Pounds 244m (Pounds 235m).
Mr Huismans said margins had increased to take the overall return on sales
to 10.2 per cent compared with 8.9 per cent last year. He added that greater
efficiency and an improving mix of business had helped.
The chemicals division made an operating profit of Pounds 42m (Pounds 38m)
on turnover of Pounds 233m (Pounds 232m). The acetate operations had
recovered from difficult operating conditions in the first half of the year
and cigarette tow, used for filters, had continued to expand and make good
margins.

<TEXT>
GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment company yesterday announced a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.46m to Pounds 2.39m in the year to March 31.
The company blamed lower interest earnings of Pounds 693,000 (Pounds 2.94m)
and a lack of abnormal items, against Pounds 5.8m last time. Profits before
interest and abnormals increased from Pounds 728,000 to Pounds 1.69m.
The shares have been suspended since December 1990 because the company was
thought to be a 'shell'. Attempts to lift the suspension had so far proved
unsuccessful. Sir Ron complained of a 'Kafkaesque, impenetrable bureaucratic
maze' at the Stock Exchange.

GROSVENOR INNS was yesterday launched on the USM, with 6m ordinary shares
being placed by Rea Brothers at 105p. Dealings in the shares will begin on
May 27.
With the net proceeds of Pounds 5.7m, Grosvenor is to expand its portfolio
of pubs by acquiring two London pub retailing operations - Slug &amp; Lettuce, a
group of 13 pubs, seven of which trade under the Slug &amp; Lettuce name, for
Pounds 4.46m cash, and the Hutchison Houses, two City pubs, for Pounds
640,000 cash.
At the placing price Grosvenor is valued at Pounds 8.1m and the shares being
placed represent about 78 per cent of its enlarged capital. Broker to the
issue is Panmure Gordon.
The acquired 15 pubs will boost Grosvenor's total estate to 30. On a pro
forma basis, the net assets of the enlarged group will be about Pounds 7m.
Mr Tim Thwaites, non-executive chairman, previously worked with the four
executive directors at Grand Metropolitan. Mr Thwaites was managing director
of Chef &amp; Brewer and then chairman of Whitbread's retail division.
Mr Peter Whitehead and Mr Gary Pettet are joint managing directors. The
former left GrandMet in 1985 to establish Cromwell Taverns with Mr Michael
Mills, Grosvenor finance director. The latter became a Cromwell director in
1988.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Commercial Union raising Pounds 100m and
counts bomb cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION yesterday signalled its intention to increase its share of
the UK insurance market by raising Pounds 100m through a preference share
issue.
The group, the most successful of the UK's composite insurers in recent
years, also reported reduced pre-tax losses for the first quarter of 1992
and could be back in the black by the end of the year.
Net losses (after reinsurance recoveries) from damage caused by the IRA bomb
to CU's London headquarters and other buildings in the capital amounted to
Pounds 15m, which would be taken in the second quarter. CU said it hoped to
move back to its headquarters in a year.
Pre-tax losses for the three months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 19.2m,
compared with Pounds 24.2m, but losses per share rose to 5.3p (4.3p) after a
charge for tax and minorities of Pounds 3.9m against Pounds 4.5m credit.
Cazenove and Hoare Govett are brokers for the issue of Pounds 100m
cumulative irredeemable preference shares, which have been placed.
Mr Tony Wyand, executive director, explained that the intention was to
reinforce the capital base in view of the rapid growth of the group's life
business and the hardening in the UK non-life market.
The extra capital would strengthen solvency and allow CU to increase
non-life premium income by between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m, he added.
In the UK where rates have been increased for most lines income rose by 24
per cent to Pounds 473.2m (Pounds 380.1m), while total premiums rose by 16
per cent to Pounds 1.28bn (Pounds 1.11bn)
According to Mr Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, CU was the only
composite expanding its market share. Premium growth was particularly rapid
in UK private motor, up 52 per cent to Pounds 48.9m, and London market
marine and aviation (up 44.1 per cent to Pounds 80.2m).
CU is also bullish about its life business, reporting new business growth of
46 per cent and an increase in life profits to Pounds 27m (Pounds 26.5m).
Life premiums now account for 35 per cent of business compared with 18 per
cent in 1982 and the group aims to increase the share to 50 per cent by the
end of the decade.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon hit by lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>

Lower interest rates and continued flatness in US insurance rates were the
main factors pegging back profit growth at Willis Corroon, the insurance
broker, where pre-tax profits dipped by 4 per cent to Pounds 42.1m in the
first quarter.
Brokerage and fee income rose to Pounds 165.6m (Pounds 146.5m) in the three
months to March 31, with an underlying growth of 3 per cent when the effects
of acquisitions and currency movements are stripped out), contributing to
higher turnover of Pounds 175.1m (Pounds 163.7m).
However interest and investment income fell to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 18.4m)
and expenses rose to Pounds 142m (Pounds 126.5m).
Underwriting claims fell to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 12.6m), leaving operating
profit at Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 43m). The share of associates' profits rose
to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.5m) and interest payable fell to Pounds 1.2m
(Pounds 1.5m).
Mr Roger Elliott, executive chairman, said: 'Conditions for our UK
operations have improved . . . (but) there is no evidence of such an
improvement emerging in the USA.'

<TEXT>
QUADRANT Group, the photographic materials and video company, yesterday
announced it is to close three photo-processing laboratories with the loss
of 220 jobs.
The laboratories, in Chalgrove, Braintree and Yate, are being closed as part
of a reorganisation of Quadrant's photo-processing business. The division,
which mainly provided photo-processing for estate agents, has been affected
by recession and the slump in the property market.
Quadrant has decided to continue to market the estate agency services, but
transfer the processing to ColourCare International, a subsidiary of London
International Group.
Quadrant also reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.78m to Pounds
1.41m for the year to February 29. Turnover fell to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds
54.5m). At the operating level the loss was reduced from Pounds 386,000 to
Pounds 360,000. Net interest receivable fell by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.08m.
The final dividend is again 2.35p for an unchanged total of 4p.
The company said Lord Rees, the former cabinet minister, will become
chairman 'when his existing commitments permit'. He will replace Mr Robert
Brothers, who will also retire as chief executive officer in favour of Mr
Andrew Douglas, chief operating officer.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bass advances 20% to Pounds 271m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A REDUCTION of Pounds 48m to interest charges of Pounds 27m enabled Bass,
the UK's leading brewer, to raise half-year pre-tax profits by 20 per cent
from Pounds 225m to Pounds 271m.
Apart from the benefit of reduced borrowings due to the rights issue, the
result was helped by the deferral of capital investment programmes 'pending
more favourable opportunities' though spending still rose from Pounds 166m
to Pounds 252m.
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, said that while consumer confidence appeared
stronger in the UK, there was 'little evidence of any increase in demand in
our principal markets.'
Earnings per share for the six months to April 11 fell to 22.5p (22.7p). But
the interim dividend was increased to 5.25p (4.95p).
Operating profits rose marginally to Pounds 286m (Pounds 282m) on turnover
down slightly at Pounds 2.23bn (Pounds 2.25bn) in spite of the disposal of
1,500 pubs.
The brewing division benefited from reduced costs and lifted operating
profits from Pounds 83m to Pounds 99m on turnover of Pounds 843m (Pounds
820m). Strong gains in the free trade limited the overall decline in beer
volumes to 2.3 per cent against a 4.4 per cent fall in the market. Tennent's
pilsner and super lagers, and Bass, Stones and Worthington ales increased
volume sales. The charge for bad debts was raised from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds
9.7m.
Britvic, the soft drinks business, held turnover at last year's level of
Pounds 205m, but profits fell to Pounds 7m (Pounds 8m) after increased
marketing costs.
Profits from pubs fell by 25 per cent from Pounds 118m to Pounds 88m - about
Pounds 21m of the decline was accounted for by pub disposals.
The group has now sold, or agreed sales on, all but 290 of the 2,740 outlets
it is required to free under government orders. The sales, at average prices
20 per cent above book value, have raised Pounds 380m gross, of which Pounds
125m was accounted for in the half year.
The introduction of electronic sales equipment in the group's 3,000 managed
pubs will increase costs during the next two years, but is expected to
reduce staff by 700.
Leisure operations showed a 31 per cent increase in operating profits to
Pounds 34m (Pounds 26m), due mainly to the performance of the enlarged chain
of bingo clubs.
Holiday Inn Worldwide raised operating profit by 26 per cent to Pounds 54m
(Pounds 43m) on turnover of Pounds 255m (Pounds 274m). Revenue per available
room in managed hotels in the US increased 2.2 per cent, against a 0.2 per
cent rise in the franchised hotels. In the rest of the world, the
improvement was 3.4 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively.
COMMENT
Headline profits may owe a lot to the interest charge reduction, but there
are some encouraging signs at the trading level. Bass has retained 70 per
cent of the beer volumes in the 2,450 pubs it has sold and is gaining
strength in the rest of the free trade. Business through free trade pubs is
10 per cent higher, and there has been a 7 per cent improvement in the
take-home market. The figures suggest the gains are not being made by giving
the beer away. In present conditions, a 5 per cent improvement in Holiday
Inn margins is quite an achievement, and promises rapid progress when the
recovery eventually comes. Analysts are forecasting full-year profits of
about Pounds 570m, a 33 per cent increase. On a prospective p/e of 13.4, the
group stands at a 10 per cent discount to the market and appears
significantly under-rated.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance in closer ties with top Swiss
insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's largest insurance company, will today sign an
agreement with Helvetia, one of Switzerland's top five insurers, to jointly
develop international commercial lines business.
The deal, which the managing director designate of Sun Alliance
International, Mr Peter Foreman, expects to sign in St Gallen, Switzerland,
today, formalises a co-operation agreement which has been in existence for
ten years.
It should boost the profile of both companies in the highly competitive
market for providing multinational companies with worldwide insurance
programmes.
Increasingly companies with strong international networks - such as American
International Group, Zurich, Union des Assurances de Paris and Allianz -
have been able to dominate the market.
British companies, which lack comparable international networks and do not
have the available available to make acquisitions, have been increasingly
forced to join forces with international rivals.
Sun Alliance itself has forged links with Taisho of Japan and Lucky
Insurance Company of South Korea, while both Royal Insurance and Commercial
Union have also formed long-term links with Japanese companies.
Sun Alliance also has less formalised accords with Vesta Group in Norway and
Atlantica in Sweden. More recently Royal agreed to merge its European
operations outside the UK with Aachener and Munchener of Germany and
Fondiaria of Italy.
According to Mr Paul Cusition, manager international insurances at Sun
Alliance International, says that by acting more closely together the
companies have already been able to win the custom of one Swiss
multinational.
Mr Cusition says that the arrangement is seen as long-term and strategic.
Contracts signed by the two companies allow for a six month notice period if
either party opts to terminate the deal.
Mr Cusition says it will strengthen Sun Alliance's ability to service
multinational clients in both Switzerland and Germany, where the Swiss
company is well represented.

FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Speyhawk sees no reason for share price
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEYHAWK, the property company with liabilities which exceed its assets by
Pounds 70m, yesterday stated that it saw no justification for the increase
in its share price.
The shares closed yesterday at 18 3/4 p, up from 17p. This compares with a
low of 2 1/2 p at the start of last month, when the company announced a
Pounds 216m annual loss and restructuring talks with its banks concerning
more than Pounds 300m of debt.
When it announced the result, it said that 'the lead banks have agreed in
principle to proposals for a restructuring covering Speyhawk's entire bank
debt . . . the principles of which are at an advanced stage of negotiation'.
Speyhawk said yesterday its position was unchanged.
One analyst ascribed the share price surge to speculators who were unaware
of the gravity of the company's financial state.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Fund managers take stock of weighty issues: The availability
of investment cash for the equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every time the equity market hits new highs company finance directors rub
their hands in glee. The higher the market, the more they can raise through
rights issues or flotations.
Last week BICC, the UK cables and construction group, took advantage of the
rise in its share price since the election to launch a Pounds 154m rights
issue, taking the total value of rights issues so far this year to more than
Pounds 1bn.
It is not only quoted businesses that are looking to take money from the
stock market. There is a lengthening list of private companies planning to
sell their shares.
And the government is not missing out either. Its privatisation programme
may be going through a quieter patch, but the exchequer's coffers still need
filling and gilt sales will be higher than for many years.
All these calls on the market could begin to put a strain on investors'
cash. The fear is that if their available cash is all absorbed by capital
raising issues, there will not be sufficient money invested in existing
shares to keep the market rising.
The 'weight of money' argument is an old favourite in the stock market,
often used to support forecasts of rises or falls in the market when
commentators have run out of other reasons.
The argument depends on weighing up the supply of cash available to invest
against the demands on that cash. If supply exceeds demand, the theory goes,
the market will rise. However, accurate figures for both sides are hard to
forecast, with official statistics for last year subject to revision.
Mr Mark Brown, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, has
estimated the notion-al excess demand for equities in real terms since 1978.
His chart suggests there is an increasing level of excess cash to invest
which he says is a favourable influence on the equity market.
On one side of the scales is the money coming into the market as
institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance groups, receive
cash to invest. Although pension funds' cash inflows have been depressed by
contributions, holidays and redundancies, the picture is brighter among
insurance companies, for instance as people set up personal pension schemes.
Between them institutional investment reached Pounds 38.3bn in 1991.
Estimates are for a similar level this year.
There are other sources of funds. Private investors may also increase their
holdings of UK equities, either directly or through unit trusts. And there
is the hope that takeover activity will increase with cash bids allowing
recipients to reinvest the proceeds in the market.
However, the current uncertainty on this side of the balance relates to
overseas investors. It is hard to forecast how much money is flowing into
the UK stock market from abroad, but the consensus is that since the general
election, flows have been significant. County NatWest, the securities house,
estimates foreign purchases of gilts alone total Pounds 4bn since the
election.
Large international securities houses have been advocating clients switching
their investments into the UK. The day after the election, for example,
Morgan Stanley advised its clients to increase the proportion of assets
invested in the UK by 5.5 percentage points to 14 per cent, moving from an
underweight to overweight stance as the UK accounts for 11 per cent of the
value of European equities.
Weighing down the other side of the balance, the biggest call on the market
will be gilt sales. The public sector borrowing requirement, which was
Pounds 13.9bn in 1991-92, is forecast to more than double in the current
year.
Following the election, the Bank of England moved fast to sell new gilts,
and there are a lot more to come. Last year net gilt sales were nearly
Pounds 11bn; this year they are expected to near Pounds 30bn.
The increase in gilt sales will more than offset a decline in money raised
in privatisations. Even these will not dwindle completely as there are many
calls due from earlier partly-paid privatisations such as the electricity
companies and the BT sale.
Rights issues took more than Pounds 10bn from the stock market last year but
may raise less this year as much work has already been done on restructuring
balance sheets. Companies have been attracted to the corporate bond market
too, as yields have fallen, although many of these securities are bought by
international investors.
New issue activity will jump however. Names such as MFI, GPA, 3i, The Daily
Telegraph group will be joining the stock market. There is also the unusual
sale of shares by Wellcome Trust in Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group,
which may involve a Pounds 4bn issue. But with overseas demand expected to
be high and the trust aiming to reinvest the proceeds in the stock market,
this could add cash to the UK market rather than take it away.
There is to some extent a self-correcting aspect to the mechanism. If there
are too many rights, the market will sag, so discouraging other companies
from making issues. A sudden fall in the market would put off flotations.
And as Mr Brown admits, the equity market did well last year, in spite of a
high level of rights issues. By contrast, it did badly in 1990 when there
was in theory much spare cash. Institutions allowed their cash holdings to
increase in 1990 and then ran them down again in 1991. However, this year
most stock market strategists expect a Pounds 10bn or Pounds 15bn shortfall
in available cash compared with the likely level of bond and equity issues,
if purchases by overseas investors are excluded.
At present it seems that foreign investors can more than plug the gap,
meaning that the equity market could go higher. But foreign investors can be
fickle and on their own they do not provide a sound basis for a bull market.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Resilient Argyll advances by 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continued resilience of food retailers to recession was yesterday
underlined by Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway, Lo-Cost and Presto
chains, as it posted a 25 per cent gain in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds
364.5m.
These followed similar substantial profits increases in recent weeks from
two other big food retailers, Tesco and J. Sainsbury.
However, the market was worried that cost increases were currently
outstripping same-store sales gains and Argyll's shares fell 10p to 357p.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said as a result of the low-inflation
environment in the 1990s, far more attention had to be paid to increasing
productivity. 'We will have to industrialise the way we run our stores,' he
said.
Efficiencies would come from better management of its supply chain. The
company is testing sales-based re-ordering systems. This year saw the
extension of sales scanning equipment to all Safeway stores.
In the year to March 28, Argyll's sales breached the Pounds 5bn mark for the
first time climbing 6 per cent to Pounds 5.04bn. Operating profits climbed
16 per cent to Pounds 331m as a result of the widening of operating margin
from 6.3 per cent to 7 per cent.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 442m as Argyll opened 17 Safeway stores. This
year 25 stores are due to open with spending projected to increase to Pounds
550m.
Interest income - including Pounds 2.5m in dividends from its shareholdings
in two mainland European retailers, Ahold and Casino - was Pounds 33.5m.
This was considerably higher than the previous year's Pounds 5.5m income
because of the cash inflow from last June's Pounds 387m rights issue.
The company received Pounds 78.3m in extraordinary income from the
settlement of its legal claim against Guinness over the Distillers bid. The
taxman took Pounds 19.8m of the Pounds 100m settlement while Pounds 1.9m
disappeared in legal costs.
Earnings per share grew 12 per cent to 24.2p. A final dividend of 6.55p will
lift the annual payout by 15 per cent to 9.75p.
This set of results marked the fifth year since Argyll acquired the Safeway
supermarket chain. Under its ownership, Safeway's sales have increased
threefold and profits sixfold.
'We are quite proud of what we have achieved,' said Mr David Webster, deputy
chairman.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Barclays pulls out of US retail banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK yesterday unveiled plans to sell off its 65-branch New York
retail banking operations in a move that will mark the UK bank's withdrawal
from the US retail banking business.
The buyer of the Barclays operations is the Bank of New York, the 17th
largest US bank with 223 retail branches in the New York area.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the New York bank is believed to
be paying between Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.10m) and Dollars 50m for the
Barclays branch network, which comes with Dollars 3.2bn of assets. The UK
bank's total North American assets are Dollars 22bn.
The 65 branches being acquired come with Dollars 2.9bn of deposits and
Dollars 2.1bn of loans. Barclays declined to say what portion of these loans
were classified as non-performing. The deal is expected to close by October.
The Barclays move comes 21 years after the British clearer first began
building up its US retail banking operations. It has been selling off a
series of US consumer finance businesses and retail branches since the 1989
sale to Wells Fargo of its 50-branch California operations.
Heavy bad debt provisions - stemming largely from problem property loans -
caused Barclays' US holdings to suffer a total loss of Pounds 217m in 1991,
compared with a Pounds 20m profit in 1990. Barclays' bad debt provisions in
the US last year more than doubled at Pounds 339m.
Mr John Kerslake, Barclays chief executive in the US, yesterday explained
that, in terms of the bank's strategy 'to concentrate on serving the
corporate and institutional markets', the New York retail branch banking
network 'does not fit into that strategy'.
Banking analysts stressed that Barclays, in common with other non-US banks
such as National Westminster Bank, had found it increasingly difficult to
manage a profitable branch business in the US. Barclays has been directing
its strategy away from retail and middle market clients.
For the Bank of New York, which has Dollars 40bn of assets and total
deposits of Dollars 29.2bn, the acquisition of the Barclays network is
considered a good fit. Both the Barclays and Bank of New York branches are
concentrated in suburban New York areas such as Westchester and Long Island.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Westpac announces record loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, Australian's biggest trading bank, has declared
the largest loss in the country's banking history following a massive
increase in property loan writedowns. The dividend has been cut and the
capital base strengthened through a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue.
It yesterday disclosed a ADollars 2.6bn (USDollars 1.96bn) turnround for the
half year to March, sending it to a pre-tax loss of ADollars 2.32bn against
a ADollars 313.4m profit last time. The bank's bottom-line loss was ADollars
1.67bn after a ADollars 713m tax credit and adjustment for minorities,
compared with a ADollars 218m profit previously.
The three-for-10 renounceable rights issue is at ADollars 3 a share. The
issue will not be underwritten, and the price compares with Westpac's close
of Dollars 3.89 in Sydney yesterday, down 5 cents.
Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, said the bank anticipated a 'sound'
profit in the current half and would pay a 12 cents a share interim
dividend, against 15 cents last time. This rate was expected to be
maintained for the full year.
He said the Reserve Bank supported the company's conservative approach and
had confirmed that, even after provisions, Westpac would satisfy official
capital adequacy requirements.
The Westpac loss follows bad and doubtful debt write-offs of ADollars
2.65bn, an increase from ADollars 579m last time. More than ADollars 2.1bn
of write-downs reflect revaluations of the ADollars 6.3bn property
portfolio.
Mr Conroy said average revaluations were 34 per cent below book value.
Westpac has also taken a much more pessimistic view of its 'problem' loans,
increasing provisioning from 28 to 47 per cent, raising their value from
ADollars 6.4bn to ADollars 8.2bn, or more than 10.6 per cent of the
company's total risk-adjusted assets.
Mr Conroy said shareholders would benefit in two ways. 'First, with the
values recognised as current market value, the bank can implement a strategy
of orderly disposal. But I stress the word orderly. There will be no fire
sales or dumping of property on the market.
'Second, as the size of our property problem reduces, the burden on future
profits from these non-performing assets will reduce.'

So much for the UK's post-election boom. Yesterday's retail sales figures
confirmed anecdotal and survey evidence suggesting consumers hardly rushed
to the shops following the Tory victory. Perhaps the odd bottle of champagne
boosted the food sector. Clothing and footwear were up, but a drop of 1.4
per cent in household goods sales was disappointing. Even though the effect
of Budget tax cuts and lower interest rates will be felt from this month,
there is not much sign of the consumer-led recovery which Mr Norman Lamont
now urgently needs to meet his modest forecast of 1 per cent growth this
year.

The net asset value of Britain's biggest property company may have fallen 17
per cent last year. But Mr Peter Hunt, LandSecs chairman, is in the
relatively happy position of having lost less of his shareholders' money
than most of his peers. The shares have outperformed the property sector by
15 per cent over the past 12 months, a deserved reward for his consistent
refusal to heed the siren calls of those urging a more aggressive stance.
The idea that they will now underperform should not go unchallenged, but, on
the basis of the gloomier net asset value forecasts for this year, the
shares are on a tight discount.

Yesterday's placing of Pounds 100m of irredeemable preference shares is the
clearest sign yet that CU is moving off the back foot. The company was
forced to become risk averse in the mid 1980s after disastrous losses in the
US, a policy which, as it happens, enabled it to avoid most of the mortgage
guarantee problems now haunting its competitors. Emboldened by a more
encouraging first quarter, CU is now in a position to take a more aggressive
stance on new premium growth.
Shareholders might not have been easily persuaded to put up the money
themselves, and would certainly have demanded a heavy price. But they are
still entitled to ask whether the chosen instrument best suits their
interests. The advantage is that the shares will count as capital for
solvency margin purposes - taking this ratio from 41 per cent at the end of
the first quarter to 44 per cent - while the gross rate of 11.55 per cent is
almost a half-point cheaper than that recently paid by Halifax building
society on a similar issue. The claim that ordinary shareholders' returns
are being attractively geared up will depend on whether the UK general
insurance cycle really is on the turn.
Certainly the tentative conclusion from the composite insurance results of
the last week or so is that better premium rates are at last sticking in
most classes of business. The recovery, though, looks set to be long and
slow and the risk for CU is in picking up dud accounts. Its UK general
insurance premiums increased by no less than 26 per cent in the first
quarter, against a 2 per cent fall at General Accident and a single-figure
increase at Royal.

It is difficult to escape the conclusion that something has suddenly gone
terribly wrong at Westpac, Australia's largest bank, after yesterday's
ADollars 2.65bn provision. Non-accrual loans rose 26 per cent in the past
six months; loans with interest more than 90 days overdue rose 63 per cent.
The bank has come unstuck on international loans to the Maxwell empire,
Olympia &amp; York and Macy's, but most of the problems are in domestic
property. After outside valuation of its property exposure, it has increased
its provision rate from 28 to 47 per cent.
Yet there is a chance that yesterday's announcement marks the beginning of
the end of Westpac's troubles. Having been slow to provide as the property
market fell, it has now leap-frogged some of its competition. Strictly
speaking, its ADollars 1.2bn rights issue is unnecessary. After the
provisions its capital ratios would still fall within the rules set by the
Bank for International Settlements. With the extra equity, the ratios will
be within the Australian norm.
It thus looks as though the bank is positioning itself for recovery.
Overheads have been cut by 1 per cent in the past year. The provisions rate
should fall from now on. It may even be possible to write back some of the
latest provisions. That would allow for more flexible management of the loan
portfolio. The proviso remains, though, that there should be no further
falls on the Australian property market. This risk will increase if other
banks follows Westpac's example and raise provisions to the point where they
can afford to sell property assets cheaply. Similar behaviour by banks in
the US has certainly slowed property market recovery there.

FT  21 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: A Safeway forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After yesterday's 25 per cent pre-tax profits increase from Argyll, it seems
safe to conclude that the effect of recession has been to accelerate
polarisation in the food retailing sector. Thanks in part to their
successful rights issues last year, Argyll, Tesco and Sainsbury are now able
effectively to bar rivals from developing competitive superstore chains.
Marks and Spencer is in a category of its own on the high street. The rest
have moved downmarket, where the returns are less attractive, or have simply
gone backwards.
As for the future, Argyll plans to open 25 Safeway superstores this year and
again in 1993. It has Pounds 170m of cash in hand, although the
preponderance of new stores in the more expensive south will push up its
store opening costs and pull down its still impressive 30 per cent return on
investment. Last year it grew faster than the competition. Its margins are
ahead of Tesco's and a mere point below those of Sainsbury. Management is
investing more time in non-Safeway operations, the Presto and Lo-Cost chains
where it believes there is significant room to seize more market share.
Granted, yesterday's figures were not quite as spectacular as Sainsbury's
last week - hence, perhaps, the market's reaction in marking down its shares
by 3 per cent. But there was no mistaking Argyll's confident tone. Given
their recent record, the shares deserve better than a multiple below the
market average.

FT  21 MAY 92 / New inquiry into police service promises big shake-up in
ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD changes to Britain's police service are likely to result from an
inquiry announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, yesterday.
The inquiry will examine many areas of police organisation including its
roles, responsibilities, career and rank structure, and pay. The service's
centralised pay structure could be replaced by one based more on individual
performance.
Mr Clarke is under pressure to contain levels of spending on the police,
which are high compared with other public services, and to improve
management and efficiency.
He announced the inquiry, which will report within a year, in a speech to
the Police Federation conference at Scarborough. 'I believe that I should
not simply charge into yet more change,' he said. Any decisions should be
taken on the basis of an open, well-informed and independent assessment.
The inquiry was well received by the conference and Mr Alan Eastwood,
federation chairman, said: 'We have nothing to fear and much to gain.'
After Mr Clarke had spoken, however, some delegates voiced reservations. 'I
believe this is a cost-cutting exercise,' said Sgt Mike Bennett, chairman of
the federation's Metropolitan Police branch.
Some police forces are already modernising their management structures, and
Mr Clarke said he intended to maintain the current 'direction and momentum
of change for the better'.
He made clear, however, that the inquiry would look specifically at rank
structure - which means it is likely to consider whether the service is
top-heavy with senior officers - as well as at pay.
'Is a blanket increase in pay to every rank and every officer, irrespective

FT  21 MAY 92 / Letter: Pointers to an economic upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M WHITWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Peter Marsh's article 'How To Figure Out The End of
Recession' (Management, May 18).
If one accepts the thesis that it is small business which generates
underlying growth in the economy and creates employment, then statistics on
new business start-ups and liquidations/insolvencies will provide a valuable
indicator. There are many sources of this information and I would like to
highlight one set of figures which may be of interest, new company
formations.
Limited companies are predominantly private rather than public and small
rather than large. New company formations may therefore provide a useful
indicator of start-up activity.
Year on year growth in new company formations was the norm until the year
ended March 1989. Over the most recent three years numbers have
progressively fallen and we are yet to see an upturn. When and if an upturn
occurs, maybe this will be an important indicator that the UK is moving out
of recession.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on the World Bank's World Development Report ('Development
and the environment', May 18) is generally perceptive and well taken. There
is however one jarring note. Speaking of environment problems you say:
'Fortunately, their solution does not require a global compact; it requires,
first more development ..' The implication is that 'more development' does
not require a global compact. I think on reflection you will agree this
would be thoroughly wrong.
Even if one accepts that 'more development' is to a large extent the
responsibility of the developing countries, the history of the past two
decades shows only too clearly that the lack of a global compact and of
effective global economic management has had a great deal to do with the
setbacks to development which many developing countries have experienced.
'More development' in an unfavourable international environment is a
near-impossible task. I very much doubt that the World Bank's report would
support this implication of your article.

<TEXT>
Sir, The recognition by the World Bank that the global environment debate
has largely ignored the most serious problems facing developing countries
('Environment debate 'ignores plight of poor'', May 18) should be given a
guarded welcome. Many individuals and organisations, including Save the
children, will support the 'priorities for action' listed in the World
Bank's World Development Report. These include stress on the need to address
the problems of lack of clean water and adequate sanitation. That the
welcome should be 'guarded' is because of fears about the priority which
will be given to that list of priorities.
Throughout the 1980s the World Bank played a dominant role in promoting
structural adjustment policies in many developing countries. Save the
Children and other organisations argued that the effects of such policies on
the most vulnerable in society, particularly children, should be considered
in advance. The World Bank and International Monetary fund were urged to
adopt policies which would seek to improve the productivity and income of
the poor and were told that services vital for the most vulnerable should be
reinforced.
Despite the welcome comments in the World Bank report, particularly on the
need for education for women, fears remain that the World Bank sees concern
for the poorest as something which can be tacked on to an otherwise
unchanged policy of economic adjustment.
Save the Children hopes that these fears are unfounded. International
institutions must recognise that human and environmental objectives, like
the needs of mothers and children, must be at the centre of an integrated,
longer-term development policy.

Sir, You say ('Privatisation plus for BR', May 19) that 'state-owned railway
tracks endure charges while users of state-owned roads go free'. With due
respect, that is nonsense.
There used to be a road fund into which all owners of vehicles paid an

<TEXT>
Sir, Martyn Thomas, in his letter (May 19) concerning maintenance of
national customs and border control for non-commercial aircraft flying
between European countries, was right in upbraiding the UK. But he should
also condemn the two EC commissioners, Martin Bangemann (industrial policy)
and Sir Leon Brittan (competition) for their inaction.
Both are aware that a person can today drive his car from the Netherlands to
Belgium or from Belgium to France without passport control, but if the same
person flies his aircraft from the self same countries to the other, customs
and border controls apply and are likely to apply in all EC countries in
1993.
My 750,000 members between them operate some 70,000 light aeroplanes,
microlight aircraft, gliders, balloons, helicopters, etc. These aerial
vehicles are used primarily for sport and recreation. Their pilots will,
just like business travellers in their light aircraft, become second class
European citizens left to face time and money wasting border controls at
designated customs airports, unless the EC commissioners take action.
The concept of the single European market will be meaningless unless
national customs and border controls for road, rail, sea and air within the
EC are abandoned.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Leading Article: RPI RIP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH pride themselves on scoring own goals; and nowhere is this more
true than in economic statistics. The Retail Prices Index has probably been
responsible for more own goals than most.
The particular fatuousness of the RPI lies in the fact that when the
government increases interest rates to combat inflation, the immediate
impact is to make inflation even worse. This arises because mortgage
interest rates feature in the RPI. There is an equally adverse effect when
interest rates are reduced. The net result is to produce violent swings
around the trend.
Governments would have to grin and bear it if the RPI represented some kind
of final truth. But to present the RPI as an accurate measure is simply
laughable. Most countries do not count mortgage interest payments. Instead,
house prices or rents enter one way or another. With the gradual revival of
the rented market in the UK, this method might be used for the British RPI.
It is therefore good, if belated, news that the chancellor is to refer the
treatment of owner occupiers' housing costs to the Retail Prices Index
Advisory Committee. But loud cheering is not the order of the day, for there
are fundamental fallacies behind the RPI and the Advisory Committee. The
first is that there is a single method of measuring the price level of goods
and services which is equally suitable for economic policy, uprating
benefits, updating taxes, indexing gilts and using in pay negotiations.
It is for instance often argued that the RPI has an inflationary bias
because prices would appear to rise by about 2 per cent a year simply as a
result of quality improvements in products included in the index. But if 2
per cent were docked off social security benefits for this reason, hardship
would soon result, as the majority of hidden quality improvements probably
take place in products such as hi-fi systems beyond the reach of
beneficiaries.
But the biggest anachronism of all is the Advisory Committee itself, which
is a survival of the 1960s and 1970s, and represents many vested interests
who are determined to get as much out of cost-of-living compensation as
possible. Better to leave the job to the Central Statistical Office, subject
to ministerial supervision and parliamentary scrutiny.
If anyone fears that the government would then tamper with the index for
political reasons, he or she need only glance at the immense powers of the
cabinet secretary to make sure that the rules of the game are obeyed. And if
anyone believes that the cabinet secretary's disapproval would remain
discreetly hidden, he has a lot to learn about how government works in the
world's oldest semi-democracy.

WHILE the British parliament yesterday debated the pros and cons of European
integration, the streets of London assumed a continental air. Baking sun,
waving flags and the sing-song accents of Spanish and Italian football fans
added to the cosmopolitan feel. The European cup final was in town.
But the British were only spectators, a fitting finale to the dismal
standard of football in this year's English football league. Last Sunday
against Brazil, England's national team was made to look leaden, prompting
from the manager an uncharacteristic footballing understatement, that his
squad 'lacks individual flair'.
Yet while Europe's politicians ponder and prevaricate, the people's sport is
pushing out to new borders. Yesterday the European Football Union (UEFA)
decided that clubs from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia can enter European
competitions; the republics of Slovenia, Croatia, Ukraine and Georgia are
knocking on the door.
European integration is the key to English football's salvation. The trend
towards big clubs and European competition is commercially unstoppable. That
the contract to televise English football has apparently been awarded to a
European-based satellite company is a sign of things to come.
Europe may not have a single currency by the end of the decade, but it
certainly should have a European soccer league. The top few English clubs
will then have to emulate the skills of continental Europeans, or get beaten
by them every week.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Europe's new muddle army: Plans for military co-operation
will have to disentangle overlapping forces and command structures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It did not look such a great idea. Putting together a Franco-German brigade
of 4,200 soldiers took three years' preparation. When it was inaugurated
near Stuttgart in 1990, senior French officers admitted it would take
somewhat longer before anyone would consider sending the brigade into
combat.
Two French regiments, two German battalions; one kind of beret but different
codes of discipline, pay structures, radio systems, ammunition. Headquarters
staff spoke French to each other one day, German the next, occasionally
resorting to English. Le Monde dubbed it the unite-gadget, the gimmick unit.
The French army seemed happy to keep it small.
Yet the apparently fanciful experiment has become the embryo of a grand
project. At their summit starting today in La Rochelle, President Francois
Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl are set to agree the blueprint for a
joint corps, starting at about 35,000 men, ready in three years and intended
as the nucleus of a future European army.
For now, it is the nucleus of a disorderly tangle involving Europeans and
Americans in intense diplomatic exchanges on the nature of European defence
initiatives and their impact on Nato. The arguments are not about the
principle of joint forces, but how they should be organised and who they
should take orders from. They are not yet about what these forces might
actually do in crises like Yugoslavia's.
Ideas for new military combinations have been taking shape for about two and
a half years. They arise from two distinct perspectives - Nato restructuring
and development of the European Community.
For Nato, multinational groupings were the best way it could keep a cohesive
military structure after losing the enemy that for 40 years provided its
reason for being. Almost all its members were cutting defences. Combined
formations could rationalise these forces and make the continued presence of
foreign troops in Germany more acceptable to the Germans. At the same time,
the US was contemplating progressively bigger reductions in its troop levels
in Europe - currently being halved to 150,000, with further withdrawals
widely expected. By common accord, Europe had to take more responsibility
for its own defence. Since relatively small forces were now required to be
ready at short notice, it was logical that these should essentially come
from the Europeans.
Other notions of joint European defence - maybe, one day - on a more
grandiose scale, were meanwhile appearing on the EC's horizon in the
build-up to last December's Maastricht summit, coinciding with Nato's
strategy review.
Convergence was always going to be difficult, however. The EC had always
left defence to Nato. There was a defence body straddling the two, the
Western European Union (WEU), consisting of nine members of both the EC and
the alliance, but it enjoyed no public profile, had been dormant for much of
its existence, and had no troops. Nato, always busy trying to patch over its
internal strains, was meanwhile searching for a new purpose, and Washington
was going to be edgy about any attempt to rock the boat.
And then, as always, there was the complicating factor of France. It is
where Nato used to have its headquarters, has five other Nato allies on its
borders, but for 25 years has had no part in the allied military hierarchy
or in its joint military planning. It is now the nation most eager to carry
the flag for Euro-defence.
Nato got in first. A year ago, Britain leapt at the suggestion by General
John Galvin, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Saceur), that it should head a
new rapid reaction corps of at least four divisions: 70,000 men. It would be
a Nato force, but could also provide units for a European reaction force;
commanders would just swap their Nato hat for a WEU hat. Under the WEU's
wing, the forces could be sent outside the Nato area - something on which
Nato has never reached a consensus.
France saw the plan as a crude bid to pre-empt its own efforts to create a
European defence structure that would be something more than a by-product of
Nato. The Germans participated in the plan, but thought they had been
stampeded by the British.
When France and Germany came out with their own plan for a joint corps in
October, the reaction from Washington and London was even sourer. Some other
European allies shared their concern that it could undermine the alliance,
in particular loosening the cement which since the 1950s had kept Germany at
the heart of Nato.
The UK, anxious not to alienate the US, contests the logic that Nato's role
should decline proportionately as Europe's defence role increases. Some
other EC partners are also cautious about the Franco-German plan, including
the Dutch and Portuguese. But, one senior British diplomat says, for most
European countries 'it is very difficult to tell the French to get lost'.
Behind the careful compromises worked out at Nato's Rome summit in November
('the development of a European security and defence role . . . the
enhancement of the role and responsibility of the European members') and the
tantalisingly hedged ambitions endorsed by EC leaders at Maastricht in
December ('the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in
time lead to common defence') lie two fundamentally different approaches.
For the French, it is prudent for Europe to make preparations independently
of the US. From a British viewpoint, that is the kind of attitude that will
make the US leave.
Nato has constantly reiterated the need for a continued 'North American
presence' in Europe. Canada, which up to now has shared this transatlantic
function with the US, dealt allies a nasty surprise in February by saying it
would pull its small remaining force out altogether. Keeping US forces, even
at much reduced levels, is seen as providing the crucial linkage to Nato's
ultimate defence guarantee, the US nuclear 'umbrella'. US involvement in
Nato also stands as a more general emblem of transatlantic co-operation. Gen
Galvin describes his post as 'America's seat at the table in Europe'.
Sensitivity to this US view has led Nato allies to shelve the idea of
appointing a European Saceur for the first time. Instead, Gen Galvin will
hand over next month to another US army officer, Gen John Shalikashvili. As
part of the military overhaul, the number of Nato commands is being been
reduced, but Americans hold on to the two top posts - the supreme commands
for Europe and the Atlantic - and to the southern Europe command in Naples.
The paradoxical result is that, while Nato is being redesigned to take on a
more European complexion, the US has a bigger share of the top military
jobs.
Britain opposes setting up any parallel European command structure -
confusing, it says, and a waste of money. The WEU is, however, to have a
contingency planning staff of 40.
The WEU is being brought into service because it is there. The body once had
an incipient military organisation but handed it over when Nato was formed.
It embodies a firmer commitment than Nato's for allies to come to each
other's aid. But its own military involvement has not gone beyond
co-ordinating some Gulf naval operations.
Britain wants it to be balanced halfway between Nato and the EC. But the
language of Maastricht ties it more closely to the Community, as 'an
integral part of the development of the European Union' and the executor of
EC decisions that have defence implications. The WEU is set to co-ordinate
closely with the Community, moving its secretariat from London to Brussels
and opening its membership to other EC states. European Nato allies outside
the Community may only join as associates.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, last week spelt out initial
proposals for forces that might be made available to the WEU. How big they
were would be up the WEU, but there would be no standing forces and the
organisation would draw on existing headquarters. He accepted that the
Franco-German corps could be well suited for the task but only as one of a
number of available units.
France is lobbying hard to persuade other WEU members to give the corps more
substance by joining. But there are few immediate candidates. Belgium is the
most likely - the reason for a lightning visit there by Mr Rifkind on
Tuesday - but appears still to be hesitating. Britain says clearly it will
not join, but would contribute other forces for the WEU. These could include
the existing UK-Netherlands amphibious force and the air-mobile division
which Britain, Germany, Holland and Belgium are jointly forming as part of
Nato's rapid reaction corps.
But Nato would have first call on the troops. Mr Rifkind allowed that the
WEU might be called on to act within Europe, but only when Nato chose not be
engaged. It was 'hard to conceive of significant combat operations in Europe
where Nato would not be involved'.
The Germans, alert to the worries of the US and other allies, have given
firm assurances that their own troops will remain assigned to Nato. The
French foresee arrangements under which the whole corps could be placed
under Saceur's wartime operational control. This is clearly distinct from
assigning French troops automatically to Nato. But the Germans say the corps
promises to associate France more closely with Nato's military partners, to
Nato's benefit.
The Bonn authorities meanwhile appear to see the corps as a possible way of
easing the constraints on German military involvement abroad, something that
the constitution is usually read as precluding.
Still unclear are the corps' relationship to the WEU - the US fears it may
create yet a third layer of military control - and its geographical scope.
'It seems odd,' admits Mr Willem van Eekelen, the WEU secretary-general, 'to
argue to the French and Germans to make these forces available for
everything except defence of their territory'.
WEU foreign and defence ministers are expected to approve outline plans for
putting troops at the organisation's disposal when they meet in Bonn on June
19. But it will all take time to clarify, and even then it will be an
agreement on means rather than ultimate aims.
Through the conceptual wrangling, the diplomatic niceties and the recondite
arguments can be glimpsed a familiar spectacle of the old European military
powers jockeying for influence.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major claimed yesterday, in opening the House of Commons debate on
the Treaty of Maastricht, that the treaty 'marks for the Community an
important and vital change of direction', in that it had 'for the first time
begun to reverse the centralising trend', and to move decision-making power
back towards the member states.
He was elegant enough not to dot the i, but this was in fact a neat and
telling response to the criticisms of his predecessor, who signed the Single
European Act in 1987. 'You allowed the centralising Euro-steamroller to
continue on its way,' he was saying to her in substance, 'whereas I have not
merely stopped in its tracks but obliged it to change direction'.
Thus he made much of the fact that the provisions of the treaty relating to
foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs do not figure in the
bill now before the House, because they are not modifications of the Treaty
of Rome, do not affect the law or institutions of the EC as such, and
therefore do not impinge directly on the law of the United Kingdom. Instead
they are separate 'pillars' of the European Union, in the form of
international agreements among the member states to co-operate in certain
specific matters. Disputes arising from them, Mr Major said, could if
necessary be brought before the International Court of Justice (which can
only arbitrate in disputes between states), but not before the European
Court (whose judgments, which may involve private firms or individuals, take
precedence over those of domestic courts).
Subsidiarity enshrined
Mr Major also stressed the treaty's enshrinement of the principle of
subsidiarity in EC law, in what he believes are legally binding terms -
although these terms are in fact much too abstract for anyone to predict
with confidence how the court will interpret them when they are put to the
test. His basic message was clear: the dragon of centralising federalism has
been slain, and the way is now clear for Britain, during its presidency in
the second half of this year, to take the lead in a chastened and more
pragmatic Community, which will at last give due priority to the interests
of a wider Europe, opening negotiations with the EFTA countries and
preparing the way for the admission of those further east.
Yet Mr Major's own speech contained some clues which show that things will
not in practice be that simple. He drew the House's attention to the fact
that there could be no increase in the EC's resources without British
agreement, and he served notice that he had 'no intention of agreeing' to
any reduction in the rebate on Britain's contribution.
Cohesion fund
The fact is that the Community's southern members regard an increase in
resources as a priority. Only this week a Spanish minister served notice
that Spain will block the process of admitting new members unless it gets
agreement on the early introduction of the 'cohesion fund' agreed at
Maastricht to help the poorer member states prepare for economic and
monetary union. This entails an increase in resources, as proposed by Mr
Jacques Delors in February.
The full Delors package may not go through, but any increase will sharpen
the determination of other member states who are net contributors, notably
Germany, to insist on a reduction, if not outright abolition, of Britain's
rebate. Argument on these homely questions, not to mention predictable
hand-wringing and recrimination over the corpse of Yugoslavia, will take the
edge off any grand British design to give the Community a new lead.
It is true that in many other member states the ratification process has
produced a lively debate, which outside Britain had been notable for its
absence in the period before Maastricht; and it is true that in the process
some of Britain's anxieties about the erosion of national sovereignty have
found an echo elsewhere in the EC. But the next stage of the institutional
argument will not, as Mr Major seems to think, be about the transfer of
powers to or from Brussels. It will be about the best method of taking
decisions on matters already admitted to be of common concern, in the
context of an expanding EC membership; and the more members there are, the
harder it will be to leave any important issue at the mercy of a veto by any
one of them.

There is in Britain, particularly among the more influential, a widespread,
albeit vague, feeling that it is highly dangerous to keep on proving that
people have been wrongly convicted and wrongly imprisoned; it undermines
faith in the police and the law. Even the eminent judge Lord Denning has
expressed such thoughts. But it will surely be a dark day if journalists
ever end their investigations, cease revealing such miscarriages of justice,
and stop serving as a last resort for the desperate. Rough Justice comes up
with yet another instance - Dave Smith and the Bordon Baseball Bat Murder -
where it seems that the wrong person may have been jailed (10.00 BBC1).
Radio has an interesting evening. At 7.05 Radio 3 starts the first broadcast
performance of John Buller's new opera BAKXAI, relayed live from the London
Coliseum. The Oath That Binds Us (7.20 Radio 4) tells of two doctors who
trained at Birmingham University in 1938 and met again after a life spent in
different countries. In Analysis (8.00 Radio 4) Peter Hennessy tries to work
out what a fourth successive Conservative administration may mean for the
way we are governed.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: Bach cantatas - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On so exquisite a summer's evening as Monday's it was all the odder to enter
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and submit oneself to a selection of Bach cantatas,
music that is manifestly intended for liturgical use. Yet there was nothing
gloomy and fusty about these period-style performances by the Orchestra and
Choir of the Age of Enlightenment, under Ivan Fischer. To the contrary,
everything was light and air and colour - colourful drama, indeed, to quote
the title of the six-concert series devised by Sir William Glock, of which
this was the first (the second was last night).
Each programme affords two or three of the vastly numerous (nearly 300) and
varied cantatas along with a selection from the motets, concerti and
orchestral suites (there are two other conductors involved, Rene Jacobs for
the second pair of concerts, Barthold Kuijken for the third). Monday's
programme attracted a virtually full house, as 'authentic' baroque
performance usually does these days, whatever the weather. The first of our
three cantatas, No. 110, 'Unser Mund sei voll Lachens', written for
Christmas Day 1725, was an apt and festive opening chorus, despatched with
bright irresistible crispness and panache.
Cantata No. 104, 'Du Hirte Israel, Hore' (1724) followed, bringing the
mellow oboes d'amore to the fore as well as tenor and bass vocal soloists.
The latter, Michael George, gave an affecting account of his lilting
pastoral aria, whose instrumental bass parts Fischer brought out with a
discreet complementary pungency. The double 12-part choir (with the merest
continuo accompaniment) produced a poised, compact but dramatically
expressive polyphony in the short motet, 'Komm, Jesu, Komm]' (BWV 229). The
fourth Brandenburg Concerto was done without conductor and with sprightly
soloists: recorder players Catherine Latham and Anthony Robson, violinist
Elizabeth Wallfisch (leader of the OAE), who executed the fast decorative
scales of the first movement in a fine spray of virtuosity.
After the interval we were treated to the plaintive sombre funerary colours
of the motet 'O Jesu Christ, Mein's Lebens Licht' (BWV 118) and the graphic
St. Michael's Day cantata No. 130, 'Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir' (1724).
The opening choral-instrumental movement was rendered with keen, brilliant
pointing of rhythm; tenor Christoph Pregardien's gigue-like duet with Lisa
Beznosiuk's flute was charming. Bach cantatas are wonderful things: full of
the bracing inventiveness of his Passions, without their longueurs, and
never two the same. My appetite is whetted for the rest of these splendidly
conceived concerts.

FT  21 MAY 92 / People: Oxford picks from its own
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clark Brundin, vice-chancellor of Warwick University, has been appointed to
head Oxford University's new school of management studies - which promises
to be a bright addition to management education in Britain when it admits
its first batch of MBA students in 1994. The post goes with the presidency
of Templeton College, the university's existing management institute where
the new school will be built.
After headhunting for more than a year, Oxford has, as ever, resorted to one
of its own. Brundin trained as an engineer in the United States, but most of
his academic life has been spent as a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. An
assiduous committee man, he ended up as chairman of the university's Board
of Faculties before decamping to Warwick in 1985. Until recently he was also
chairman of Anchor Housing, England's largest charitable provider of
sheltered accommodation for the elderly.
Brundin has a demanding job ahead. Templeton needs some Pounds 40m to get
its management school off the ground. As yet it has only Pounds 5m - a
sizeable chunk of it from Peter Moores, son of the pools supremo, after whom
the directorship of the school is named.
*****
David Kaye, a retired partner of Andersen Consulting, has been appointed
Dean of the City University Business School in London.
*****
Alan Brew has been promoted to be executive director of Landor Associates,
the international design consultants, and based at Landor's headquarters in
San Francisco.
A former Financial Times journalist, Brew joined Landor from the FT in 1985

Peter Farnell-Watson is to become managing director in the UK.

FT  21 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Russian ship's arrest was unjust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KHERSON
Queen's Bench Division (Admiralty Court): Mr Justice Sheen:
May 1 1992
A CARGO claim which is both an action in rem against the ship and an action
in personam against the shipowners, arises out of the same cause of action
and is between the same parties as proceedings in the same matter which have
already been started in personam by the cargo-owner in the courts of a
country which is party to the 1968 Brussels Convention. Therefore, under the
terms of the Convention, the UK court must decline jurisdiction in favour of
the foreign court and where that court would have refused to order the
arrest of the ship, security provided to obtain its release from arrest in
the UK must be returned.
Mr Justice Sheen so held when declining jurisdiction to hear a claim by the
owners of cargo carried on Kerch, and ordering the discharge of security
provided by the shipowners to obtain the release of her sister ship,
Kherson, from arrest.
HIS LORDSHIP said the cargo-owners claimed damages for breach of a contract
for the carriage of a cargo of oil on Kerch, from Rosario to Rotterdam, in
1990.
Kerch was owned by a Georgian state company.
On September 26 1991, the cargo-owners issued a writ in rem naming 16 ships
belonging to the shipowners. On January 23 1992, the writ was renewed for 12
months.
On March 27 1992, Kherson, a sister ship, was arrested at Felixstowe. The
shipowners applied for an order that the court decline jurisdiction and that
the ship be released.
During the hearing, the court was told that the shipowners had acknowledged
service of the writ. The action then became an action in rem and in
personam.
Kherson remained under arrest until April 3, when she was released on the
provision of security. The action then ceased to be an action in rem against
the ship. It now proceeded solely in personam.
On October 5 1990, the cargo-owners told the shipowners' Rotterdam agent
that if security was not provided they would arrest Kerch, which was then in
Rotterdam.
The Rotterdam agent informed the cargo-owners that there was a treaty
between the USSR and the Netherlands which prohibited arrest if the
shipowners chose domicil in the Netherlands.
The effect of the treaty appeared to be that if a party contemplated
commencing an action arising out of use of a ship, the other party might
'elect domicil' on the plaintiff's territory. When he had elected domicil an
action in personam could be brought against him that territory, but the ship
could not be arrested. The parties to the treaty would ensure compliance
with the judgment.
On October 5 1990, the shipowners chose domicil in Rotterdam. On October 9,
the cargo-owners's agents wrote accepting the choice of domicil and stating
that they refrained from arresting Kerch as security 'because according to
the bilateral agreement, the Soviet Union is to make sure . . . .a verdict
rendered by the Rotterdam District Court is to be carried out'.
The shipowners contended that that exchange of letters was evidence of an
agreement that the claim should be brought in the District Court of
Rotterdam.
They relied on article 17 of the Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement
of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968, which was given the force
of law in the UK by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982.
Article 17 provided that if parties domiciled in a contracting state had
agreed that the courts of a contracting state were to have jurisdiction,
'that court shall have exclusive jurisdiction'.
The letter of October 9 1990 was not an agreement that the Netherlands
courts were to have jurisdiction.
By accepting the shipowners' choice of domicil, the cargo-owners established
the right to commence legal proceedings in Rotterdam should they wish to do
so, and prevented the shipowners from withdrawing their choice of domicil.
That was not an agreement that the Netherlands court should have exclusive
jurisdiction. Article 17 did not apply.
As the cargo-owners had not had an opportunity to serve any of the ships
named on the writ before October 4 1991, they decided to commence an action
in Rotterdam. When they took that step they were aware they were not
entitled to arrest one of the ships in the Netherlands, because of the
treaty.
Article 21 of the 1968 Convention provided that where proceedings 'involving
the same cause of action and between the same parties' were brought in
different contracting states, 'any court other than the court first seised
shall . . . decline jurisdiction'.
The cargo-owners disputed that article 21 applied to an action in rem.
They submitted that a cause of action in rem was not the same character as a
cause of action in personam. Also, it was said, the action was not between
the same parties because it began as an action in rem and, after the
shipowners acknowledged service, it continued as an action in rem as well as
in personam.
The action was founded on and involved the same cause of action as the
Rotterdam proceedings (see The Deichland (1989) 3 WLR 478, 500). There were
differences in character between an action in rem and an action in personam,
but there were no differences between the essential elements of the cause of
action in the two types of proceedings.
As to whether two sets of proceedings were between the same parties, in The
Nordglint (1988) 1 QB 183,201, Mr Justice Hobhouse said an action in rem was
not an action between the same parties as an action in personam. He said 'it
will only become an action between the same parties when and if a shipowner,
liable in personam, chooses to appear in the action and defend it'.
The court agreed. As Lord Justice Lloyd said in El Tawwab (1991) 1 Lloyd's
Rep 205: 'The whole point of the action in rem is that it is an action
against the ship itself . . . and not a personal action against the owners.'
When a writ in rem had been served on the ship, if the owners did not
acknowledge service, the action proceeded solely against the ship. If the
shipowner acknowledged service, the action proceeded from that moment both
in rem and in personam. Judgment would be in rem and in personam.
The effect was that in so far as the judgment was in rem, it would be
satisfied out of the proceeds of sale of the ship. Insofar as it was in
personam, the plaintiff could not make double recovery, but could enforce it
by attaching the defendant's assets as he could with any other judgment
against a person.
The only differences between an action which was both in personam and in rem
(because the ship remained under arrest) and an action solely in personam,
lay in the remedies available to a successful plaintiff and the procedure to
obtain those remedies.
The Rotterdam action and the present action involved the same cause of
action. The two actions were between the same parties.
Accordingly, article 21 applied and the court must decline jurisdiction in
favour of the Rotterdam court.
Now that the ship had been released, the court's decision as to return of
the security must be the same as if she had remained under arrest.
In October 1990, the cargo-owners refrained from arresting Kerch because of
the treaty.
If the cargo-owners had commenced proceedings in Rotterdam in October 1990
and refrained from arresting Kerch because of the treaty, the UK court would
have regarded it as an abuse of its process if they had thereafter arrested
a sister ship within the jurisdiction in respect of the same claim.
The USSR had been dissolved, but Russia had assumed the treaty obligations.
The security provided by that treaty was regarded by the Netherlands as
adequate for its own national shipowners, and that was recognised by the
cargo-owners in October 1990.
In those circumstances it would have been unjust to keep Kherson under
arrest. The UK court would have ordered her release.
Accordingly, the cargo-owners were ordered to return the security.
For the cargo-owners: Timothy Saloman (Clyde &amp; Co).
For the shipowners: Charles Macdonald QC (Lawrence Graham).

FT  21 MAY 92 / People: Spending a bit of money on pubs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ross Cope, formerly with specialist mortgage provider First Mortgage
Securities, is the new treasurer of Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL), the pub
investment company set up last year by GrandMet and Foster's.
He is an expert in securitisation, or repackaging debt as saleable
securities, and is looking forward to bringing 'a novel financing technique
into the pub market'. At First Mortgage Securities he had been treasury
director, funding and securitising UK mortgages; hence Cope, 44, claims to
be one of a small clutch of people 'who have actually done it rather than
simply talk about it'.
But while the funding side may have been a success, the specialist mortgage
providers that sprang into life during the boom years of the 1980s, have
been particularly badly hit by repossessions, and are narrowly eyeing their
future commitment to the market.
As a technique suitable for thinly capitalised companies, securitisation
should work for IEL, which owns pubs and leases them out on 20-year
contracts. One of Cope's tasks will be to refinance the Pounds 1.32bn loan
taken out at IEL's inception.
An accountant who had a spell as treasurer of Girobank, he is a fan of
GrandMet's concept of managing pubs as properties in their own right. 'After
a month in the new job, I have worked out how you spot Inntrepreneur pubs.
They are the ones that look up-market, with a bit of money spent on them -
basically they don't look like pubs.'

DIXONS is famous for selling the latest electronic gizmos through its Dixons

proved lacklustre in recent years.
This week, however, the parent company has moved to reshuffle Supasnaps
senior management. Colin Glass, 35, managing director of Supasnaps, has been
elevated to the post of chairman and will also join the Dixons Stores Group
board as marketing director.
'I will be focusing on developing the Dixons and Currys brand propositions
and where they stand on the high street,' he says.
His position at Supasnaps is filled by Elizabeth Fagan, 34, previously
responsible for the company's buying and marketing functions. She joined
Supasnaps from Boots in 1990.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: NRA criticised over expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs HAVE strongly condemned the National Rivers Authority for weaknesses in
financial management that led to wasted expenditure of Pounds 1m and the
resignation of its first chief executive.
A report from the Public Accounts Committee published yesterday criticises
the Environment Department, Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the NRA, and his
board for failing to keep a sufficiently close eye on the water pollution
organisation's expenditure.
The primary reason for the criticism, which is extremely outspoken for a
parliamentary committee, was evidence that rules for spending large sums of
money had been ignored in fitting out the NRA's new head office in Bristol.
The project resulted in the wasting of about Pounds 1m out of a total cost
of Pounds 2.65m, and the resignation last June of Mr John Bowman, chief
executive, with a pay-off of Pounds 125,000. Two other senior executives
received written warnings for ignoring the financial procedures laid down
for the NRA.
In July, 1990, the NRA engaged Corporate Design Interiors (CDI) to advise on
relocating and to help choose contractors. It was also one of three firms
asked to tender for the Pounds 12,000 contract to design the layout of the
new offices.
The NRA then decided to combine the design contract with a much bigger one
for fitting out the building. Instead of asking several firms to tender, it
considered only two that had bid for the much smaller design job. The Pounds
2.65m contract went to CDC, a sister company of CDI, without Lord
Crickhowell, Mr Bowman or the NRA board being told.
An internal inquiry found that had the job been properly managed it would
have cost only Pounds 1.6m. It also said that the NRA's own board needed to
be more vigilant on spending.
The NRA said last night there had been 'serious shortcomings' in the
management of fitting out the Bristol head office, which resulted in poor
value for money.

FT  21 MAY 92 / BR not at fault over most train door deaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL was largely exonerated by the Health and Safety Executive
yesterday over the large number of deaths caused by passengers falling out
of the doors of moving trains.
At least 75 per cent of the deaths since 1984 were attributable to suicide
attempts, drunkenness or misbehaviour, the executive concluded.
Of the 25 per cent for which no explanation had been found, some may have
happened because door locks had jammed open or because doors had not been
properly closed, the executive said. It acknowledged that it had been unable
to link any of the deaths it investigated to either of those causes.
The investigation was launched last year because of public disquiet over the
165 train-door deaths between 1981 and 1990 - the largest single cause of
passenger fatalities over the period.
The executive concluded that a door lock properly engaged would never come
open during a journey in normal service. However, it established that in
certain circumstances, lock bolts could jam, and very slight pressure from
inside the train could cause the door to open.
A spot check of 140 doors had identified two in a dangerous condition, the
executive said. It criticised BR for not adopting maintenance procedures to
ensure the integrity of locks.
BR responded by saying that all slam-door InterCity trains would be fitted
with automatic locks over the next three years at a cost of Pounds 15m. It
said it had also improved maintenance procedures and was taking steps to
improve staff and passenger awareness of the importance of closing doors
properly.

FT  21 MAY 92 / Satellite TV market 'overestimated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIZE of the satellite television market in the UK has been significantly
overstated, according to a report.
GFK Home Audit, a market-research company, says 1.6m homes had satellite
television by the end of last year, compared to the 1.8m estimate by Barb,
which produces the official viewing figures, and a figure of 2.1m quoted by
Continental Research, a research company regularly quoted by the Financial
Times and British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake,
The GFK figure was based on interviews with 10,000 people last June and
updated with data from GFK Lek-Trak, which monitors more than 8,000
electrical retailers, including a sample of independents retailers.
'The GFK Home Audit provides the most accurate record yet of home satellite
ownership and suggests that there has been a substantial overstatement of
the market,' said Mr John Ramsbottom, managing director of GFK.
Mr Ramsbottom said his figures were supported by close comparison of film
channel viewing in his panel with figures produced by BSkyB.
Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental, which puts the present number of
homes with satellite dishes at 2.4m, yesterday stood by his figures, which
are based on interviews with more than 4,000 adults every month.
Continental said its end-of-year dish figure was 1.95m - the 2.1m figure
includes homes served by a communal dish. Mr Clemens said Lek-Trak data
consistently underestimated the number of satellite dishes in the UK.

BRAZILIANS, great lovers of soap operas, are glued to a real-life drama
involving the presidential family in a battle which could threaten
governmental stability.
The row erupted with the allegation by Mr Pedro Collor that his older
brother, President Fernando Collor, had been collaborating to help his
campaign treasurer and friend to accumulate wealth through fraudulent means.
Mr Pedro Collor says he has compiled a dossier on Mr Paulo Cesar Farias
(known as PC), elaborating alleged frauds which could incriminate the
president, and has put it on a video-tape now in a safe-deposit box in a New
York bank.
He accuses Mr Farias of having taken Dollars 15m from the Dollars 100m
Collor campaign chest for the 1989 presidential election, and of then using
his friendship with the president to cream off commissions for the award of
government contracts.
Mr Farias strongly denies the allegations, which a presidential aide claims
were provoked by the younger brother's envy of the elder. However, the row
caused the stock markets to fall 5 per cent on Monday, and forced Mrs Leda
Collor, the family matriarch, to intervene to prevent a threat to government
stability.
After intense family efforts to silence Pedro failed, Mrs Collor announced
on Tuesday night that she was sacking her youngest son Pedro from running
the family media empire in their home state of Alagoas, in the far
north-east, claiming that he was 'suffering a serious emotional crisis.'
Yesterday, Mr Pedro Collor was visiting a doctor for a certificate of
sanity. He insists he will not drop his campaign until 'PC is behind bars'.

A GROUP of influential Democratic members of the US Congress is seeking the
appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate possible wrongdoing by
the Bush administration in its support of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq,
before his August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The House of Representatives judiciary committee said yesterday it planned
to hold a hearing on whether to name an independent counsel.
This follows allegations by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking
committee, and others in Congress, that the administration is trying to
cover up its misuse of government loan guarantees that Iraq had obtained for
agricultural purchases, but then used to acquire military goods and
technology.
At the core of the matter is an alleged abuse of loan guarantees for
supposed agricultural exports to Iraq that were financed by the branch in
Atlanta of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
The BNL affair is beginning to attract widespread attention in the US media,
with the approach of the trial of Mr Christopher Drogoul, former BNL Atlanta
manager accused of making more than Dollars 4bn of improper loans to Iraq
from his branch. The trial, due to begin on June 2, was yesterday postponed
to June 22.
Documents obtained by the Financial Times show that a substantial part of
these loans helped Iraq's nuclear, chemical and missile projects.

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc is just as important as the D-Mark in the European Monetary
System, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said
yesterday, issuing a fresh challenge to the anchor role of the German
currency in the EMS, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The future single
European currency would be built around all its members and not just the
D-Mark, the central bank governor said.
Mr de Larosiere's remarks, on the eve of the Franco-German summit, underline
France's efforts to make the franc a strength to rival the D-Mark before the
projected single currency comes into effect by the end of this decade. 'The
franc is not in the D-Mark zone,' he said.
Nobody could deny that the D-Mark had been the anchor of the European
Monetary System for years, said Mr de Larosiere. But 'we are now coming to a
phase in our monetary relations where there is much more equality between
countries and where France's performance is rather better than its
partners,' he said.
France, Denmark and Luxembourg were the only countries currently able to
fulfil all the criteria for monetary union, he pointed out. 'So the notion
of this mono-currency anchored on to the D-Mark gives way to the real
necessity for a collective anchor and a common monetary policy,' he said.

Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, leader of the dominant Popular Front and the favourite
candidate to win presidential elections due on June 7, said 'Azerbaijan will
not be part of the current CIS, there is no doubt about that'.
Popular Front leaders refused to accede to a collective security pact signed
by six of the CIS members in Tashkent last week, seeing it as a threat to
the republic's security. They believe Russian influence helped reinstate the
former communist president, Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, for 24 hours last week before
he was forced to flee.
The conflict between Armenian and Azeri forces, which has spread from
Nagorno Karabakh in Azerbaijan to the northern tip of the Azeri autonomous
republic of Nakhichevan within Armenia, is causing growing concern to
neighbouring Turkey and Iran.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Show trial of Croats by Serb military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANZ KAFKA would have felt at home yesterday in the first floor courtroom
in Belgrade's main military courthouse. Seven pallid prisoners, all looking
bewildered and one obviously mentally disturbed, sat facing five military
judges, whose uniforms were decorated with from two to five stars.
Above them the eternal flame, the communist emblem of the defunct Yugoslav
federation, was still firmly fixed to the wood-panelled walls. A row of
seven clean-cut military policemen in camouflage uniforms separated the
defendants from the spectators and some scowling Belgrade journalists. The
main witness, who was present at the hearing, cursed and jeered at the
seven: 'Ustashe animals', using the Serbian epithet for Croats.
The men, Croat nationals, who are accused by the Yugoslav army of war crimes
and taking part in an 'armed uprising against Yugoslavia,' are the principal
players in what may herald the start of a series of show trials. The seven
are Croats from a village near Vukovar, the devastated city in eastern
Croatia. They are accused of crimes last autumn at the height of the army
siege of the town. The crimes range from murder to 'endangering the security
of the Socialist Federated Republic of Yugoslavia'.
The defendants, who face the death penalty, are being tried by a military
court although they are all civilians.
A guilty verdict looked predetermined as most of the defendants were not
allowed to choose their own defence lawyers. Instead they were awarded
'defence' counsels from the ranks of embittered Serb refugees from Croatia.
Mrs Nadezhda Danilovic, a defence lawyer from Belgrade, yesterday raised
objections to the military tribunal, saying that the court was not
authorised to try Croat, now foreign, citizens.
Defence lawyers fear that Serbia's state-controlled media will use this and
other trials to pump up hatred of Croats in order to channel popular
resentment at the collapsing economy.
The official media spew a steady stream of racist propaganda about
non-Serbs.
A western diplomat said: 'We are not questioning the right of Serbia to try
war criminals if it is based on real evidence. But there is also a legal and
moral responsibility to try criminals from their own side.'
Mrs Danilovic says the trial may mark the beginning of a wave of show
trials. She says the defendants are being tried for heinous war crimes,
although Yugoslavia was never officially at war with Croatia.
But if a wave of trials begins in Serbia, it is likely to be matched in
Croatia, where resentment of the perceived seizure of its territory by
Serbia, runs high. Serbs living in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, have
expressed fears that the government will use them as scapegoats.

ASTRA, the Swedish pharma-ceutical company, boosted pre-tax profits by 40
per cent to SKr1.063bn (Dollars 185.2m) in the first quarter of 1992 from
SKr757m in the corresponding period of 1991.
The company again forecast that profits for the full year would rise between
20 and 25 per cent to over SKr4bn.
Sales for the quarter climbed 35 per cent to SKr3.7bn from SKr2.7bn, while
profit per share rose by 45 per cent to SKr5.55 from Skr3.85.
Sales of Losec, the company's highly successful stomach ulcer drug and the
main competitor of Glaxo's Zantac, increased by 72 per cent in the first
quarter to SKr991m from SKr577m, with the biggest markets being in Germany,
France and Britain. Total sales of Losec (including those made through
licence-holders in the US, Italy and Spain) reached SKr1.550bn from SKr880m.
Astra's asthma agent Pulmicort enjoyed a 57 per cent sales increase in the
first quarter to SKr414m against SKr264.

FT  20 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo hit by broker revision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL exploration company Lasmo was the worst performing stock yesterday in
the FT-SE 100 Index and one of the weakest in the London market following a
sharp profits forecast downgrading by securities house SG Warburg.
Warburg argued that unless the company cuts its dividend, halves its
exploration budget and takes Pounds 5m off its overheads it will lose Pounds
30m this year. It said Lasmo needed to reduce its total dividend to a
nominal penny from 8.5p. Lasmo fell 18 to 199p with more than 8.8m shares
traded.
The revised forecast follows a similar exercise on Enterprise last week,
when Warburg lowered its underlying earnings prediction by Pounds 16m to
Pounds 78m, inclusive of Pounds 30m profits from asset disposals. County
NatWest followed yesterday with a forecast cut from Pounds 86m to Pounds 72m
for Enterprise, and estimated asset disposal profits at only Pounds 25m. It
also advised clients to reduce holdings. Enterprise slipped 5 to 421p.
Next optimism
A healthy trading statement from Next helped sentiment in a positive retail
sector anticipating improved official figures today. Next shares rose 4 1/2
to 88 1/2 p in volume of 6.8m.
Chairman Lord Wolfson said at the group's annual meeting that retail sales
in the first quarter were ahead by 10 per cent from last year's
corresponding period. Although some observers pointed out that Next's sales
last year were particularly flat, the rise followed similar noises from
Burton last week. The market also expects a moderate increase in retail
sales figures due today.
Burton gained 2 to 50p, Boots 3 to 467p and Kingfisher 2 to 563p. Dixons
advanced 6 to 271p and Amstrad rose 3 1/2 to 40 1/2 p, both partly on the
back of the BSkyB football deal.
Bank approves bid
Approval by the Bank of England for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's bid for
Midland Bank prompted renewed support for the UK clearer.
The statement triggered talk that Hongkong Bank would launch a dawn raid
today for Midland stock in order to take its stake above 15 per cent.
However, banking analysts said this was unlikely as Hongkong Bank is not
allowed to buy stock in the market at a price lower than the bid price.
Midland gained 4 to 397p.
The possibility that rival suitor Lloyds Bank - up 8 at 432p - may not get a
toehold caused analysts to cast around and look for another likely target
for Lloyds. They alighted on Royal Bank of Scotland, pinpointing the value
of its Direct Line Insurance subsidiary. Royal Bank climbed 7 to 205p.
Figures at the bottom end of expectations prompted profit-taking in BOC,
which dropped 15 to 703p.
The gases and healthcare group announced half-year profits of Pounds 162.7m,
up from a previous Pounds 144.7m but against analysts' forecasts of between
Pounds 163m and Pounds 166m. The company said signs of an upswing were
patchy and limited to a few segments of its global industrial gases markets.
Smith New Court lowered its full-year profits forecast by Pounds 5m to
Pounds 355m and was advising clients to switch into ICI which, it said,
offers good value up to 1400p. ICI eased 5 to 1361p.
Turnover in Hanson was boosted as a number of the conglomerate's directors
exercised share options. Lord Hanson reduced his holding to 6m shares after
selling 2.5m at 232 1/2 p. In the market, the shares eased 2 1/2 to 231 1/2
p with 10m traded. There were also 9.1m warrants traded.
Body Shop retreated 12 to 308p as rumours of a critical television programme
circulated.
Talk of the sale of Gardner Merchant, Forte's catering subsidary, refused to
die away ahead of today's results from rival caterer and potential purchaser
Compass Group.
The latest talk has the Pounds 500m subsidiary being broken up, with the UK
side going to management and Compass taking the European operations. Both
Forte and Compass shares were unchanged yesterday.
Slightly disappointing results from Allied-Lyons saw the shares marked down
8 to 652p. Worries over the Carlsberg deal and the brewery group's cash flow
 -with City anxiety over the possibility of a rights issue refusing to go
away - also persisted.
Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest moved to a buy position on Allied,
however, citing solid margins and good recovery prospects. 'The new
management team is on course to deliver superior earnings growth over the
next two years,' he said.
Nervousness ahead of today's results from Bass left the shares down 12 at
619p.
Selling in the US was said to have been behind a fall of 21 to 984p for
Wellcome.
Glaxo recovered 13 to 748p. Figures from Swedish competitor Astra,
particularly on Losec, the direct competitor to Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug
Zantac, were good but in line with forecasts.
British Airways raced up 15 to 302p in brisk trade of 18m shares, making it
the best performer in the FT-SE 100 Index. The company reported full-year
profits up 119 per cent at Pounds 285m, and a 20 per cent rise in the
dividend.
Analysts moved quickly to upgrade current year forecasts to around the
Pounds 409m mark. P &amp; O benefited from the positive mood surrounding BA and
gained 11 to 536p.
A gloomy annual meeting at Ocean Group sent the shares tumbling 27 to 311p.
British Steel eased 3 to 81p. There was talk in the market that the recent
price increases for steel are not holding and that the company is being
forced to sell to European customers at pre-April 1992 prices.
Williams Holdings added 6 at 360p, with suggestions in the market that the
share price was being massaged in preparation for a deal or acquisition.
A line of GEC stock that has been overhanging the market was said to have
held down the shares, which lost 2 1/2 to 230 1/2 p. However, 8m shares were
traded in big blocks at 230 1/2 p a share, suggesting that the overhang had
now been largely cleared.
Board changes at Southern Water were welcomed by the market, the stock
adding 12 at 411p in a positive water sector, where Panmure Gordon advised
investors to stay 'overweight'.
Building materials group BPB Industries gained 6 to 187p in heavy turnover
of 3.6m as BZW moved to a buy stance.

BID talk in Asda, in the traded options market, created substantial interest
in an otherwise dull day for derivative markets, writes Joel Kibazo.
Turnover in the London Traded Options Market reached 29,821 contracts, a big
improvement on Monday's 19,926, with the bulk of the day's business carried
out in stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was negligible at 4,922
lots.
Asda was the top traded stock option as takeover talk returned. There was a
total of 7,051 contracts traded, with the July 35 calls - in which 3,670
lots were dealt - the busiest series.
This was followed by British Airways, which reported good profits that led
to a clutch of profit upgrades. It traded 2,961 lots. Hanson, BT and Lasmo,
in which dividend cuts are forecast, were also busy.
In stock index futures, dealers talked of a dull session with June trading
in a narrow range for a large part of the day. June opened at 2,727, which
proved to be the high point of the day. Buying interest at the lower levels
was modest, with economic statistics and Wall Street having no effect on the
day's trading.
June finished at 2,717, down 12 from the previous session and around 9
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover
was a poor 4,649.

FT  20 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Hopes of another rate cut
lift Dow to record

Wall Street
US SHARES, after trading in a narrow range on either side of opening values
through most of the day, sprang to life yesterday afternoon and rose to a
record level as investors responded to growing expectations of a further cut
in interest rates in the wake of poor housing numbers, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 21.96 at 3,397.99, a shade above its
previous all-time high of 3,397.58 set on May 11, but turnover on the New
York SE was light, with 189.4m shares changing hands. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 climbed 3.56 to 416.37, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks gained 1.52 to 578.05.
The day opened with the news from the Commerce Department that housing
starts fell 17 per cent in April, more than three times the decline
forecast. The drop in housing activity would normally have depressed stocks,
but the fact that the data increased the likelihood of an easing of policy
by the Federal Reserve restricted the damage.
Market sentiment was also aided by a fresh decline in bond rates, which in
the case of the benchmark 30-year bond yield, fell to 7.75 per cent.
Upjohn rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 in turnover of almost 690,000
shares after the US Food and Drug Administration panel voted to allow the
company to continue marketing its controversial Halcion insomnia drug.
The ADRs of British Airways forged ahead Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 in
active trading after the company reported a 119 per cent jump in earnings
for the fiscal year ended March 31.
Dayton Hudson climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 62 1/4 on first-quarter net
income of 40 cents a share, against 39 cents a year ago and above the
consensus of analysts' forecasts.
Polaroid firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 26 after Mr Morton Langer, the
industry analyst at broking house Bear Stearns, initiated coverage of the
stock with a 'buy' rating.
On the Nasdaq market, Nova Pharmaceutical showed no change at Dollars 4 5/8
in active trading after the Baltimore-based biotechnology company said that
it had begun testing an anti-inflammation compound for the treatment of
septic shock and inflammatory bowel disease.
Mesa Airlines moved forward Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 25 1/4 on news that
Kemper Securities had upgraded the carrier's shares and raised earnings
estimates for the fiscal third quarter because of strong traffic gains and
bookings.
South Carolina Federal advanced Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 21 1/2 after
stating that it was engaged in preliminary merger discussions with an
undisclosed financial institution.
Canada
TORONTO ended slightly easier after moderate trading. The composite index
lost 6.1 at 3,385.3 as declining issues led rises by 295 to 268. Volume came
to 22.5m shares valued at CDollars 255.7m.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices were lower, but there were no significant
changes. Financial services and golds, the latter after early firmness, lost
ground.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on housing starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR sank to a new three-month low against the D-Mark on the foreign
exchanges yesterday on news of a bigger than expected monthly drop of 17 per
cent in US housing starts for April, writes James Blitz.
The US unit was trading at a low of DM1.5865 shortly after lunchtime in
European markets, as dealers feared that the sharpest monthly fall in
housing starts for eight years would force the Federal Reserve to ease
interest rates again.
When the rate cut failed to materialise at yesterday's Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meeting, the dollar regained some ground and closed in
London  1/2 pfennig down at DM1.5905. Dealers said the dollar had been
propped up by heavy bidding just below DM1.59 by two large German
institutions and life insurance companies in Tokyo. In New York it ended at
DM1.5903/10.
However, analysts believe the case for a cut is much stronger following the
housing figures, and could come today, when the FOMC meets again. Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London, said: 'The
balance of probabilities is for the Fed easing.' He does not believe that
the dollar weakness will last but thinks the currency could yet bottom out
at DM1.56.
The dollar also lost ground yesterday morning to the yen on news that
Japanese machine orders for March were up 14.6 per cent from the previous
month. The figure brought a strong reaction from the markets, coming one day
after news that the Japanese trade surplus in April was 13.4 per cent higher
than for the previous month. However, the Fed's decision not to cut rates
gave the US currency a temporary respite and it ended a little firmer at
Y129.10, and later closed in New York at Y129.12.
The D-Mark continued to perform strongly in the wake of Monday's news that a
large industrial strike had been avoided. Its best gain was against the
French franc as traders took profits following last week's bullish
performance by the French currency. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.3634, up
about  1/2 franc.
Sterling's recent rise against the D-Mark also seems to have petered out as
traders give up hope that the pound might cross its central rate against the
German currency. The pound closed  1/4 pfennig down at DM2.9250. One London
dealer suggested that the pound's decline against the D-Mark may have been
due to profit-taking in sterling/dollar trading, after the UK currency
reached a high point of Dollars 1.8425 in London yesterday.
The Swiss franc made new gains following Switzerland's decision to formally
apply for EC membership. The Swiss currency ended about  1/2 centime
stronger against the dollar at SFr1.4600.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates end firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES IN the sterling cash markets ended the day slightly firmer after the
Bank of England forecast a large shortage, which was not fully taken up
during the day.
In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds
1.15bn, much of which was caused by outstanding payments on the recent
Pounds 800m gilts issue. However, dealers were reluctant to sell paper to
meet the shortage, and a Pounds 200m shortfall remained at the end of
trading.
With a bank holiday due this weekend, market players will probably wait
until Friday to sell paper to the Bank, in the hope of pushing the overnight
rate as low as possible over the three-day weekend.
As a result, period rates finished slightly firmer. Three-month money, an
important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, ended the
day at 10 1/16 per cent, after closing at 10 per cent the previous night.
One-month money also closed a shade higher, at 9 31/32 per cent after a
previous 9 15/16 per cent.
Trading on the futures markets also reflected firmer rates. The June short
sterling contract ended at 89.97, three ticks off from a previous close of
90.00. The September contract ended down two ticks at 90.30. However,
volumes in both contracts were extremely low and amounted to little over
10,000 lots for the two contracts combined.
In its early operations in the cash markets, the Bank of England purchased
Pounds 21m of Band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 225m of bills for
resale to the market on June 8 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent.
The forecast was later revised to a shortage of Pounds 1.2bn before taking
account of the early operations.
The Bank later purchased Pounds 199m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent,
Pounds 40m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 39m of bills
for resale to the market on June 8 at 9 15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 346m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8
per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 80m.
In the German money markets, call money was steady but with an easier bias,
as relatively high liquidity levels at the banks took pressure off the
market.
Dealers quoted overnight money at 9.55-60 per cent, compared to Monday's
level of 9.55-65 per cent.

US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday after a large decline
in April housing starts fuelled hopes of an interest rate cut.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  21/32 at 102
3/4 , yielding 7.756 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  9/32
at 100 25/32 , yielding 4.930 per cent.
The market reacted instantly to news from the Commerce Department that
housing starts fell 17 per cent in April, a decline that was almost three
times analysts' forecasts.
The figures sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve's policy-making
Open Market Committee, which met yesterday, would react with a cut in
interest rates to stimulate the sluggish economic recovery. Although
monetary policy remained on hold, there were expectations that the Fed would
act soon. But some analysts cautioned the sharp drop in housing starts last
month was primarily due to an unfavourable comparison with unsustainably
high levels recorded earlier this year.
GERMAN government bonds fell slightly following substantial gains on Monday,
with trading nervous before the release of money supply data which could
determine the future direction of interest rates.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.21-29 for a
yield of 7.96 per cent, little changed from Monday's closing level but below
the high of the day.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures and options
exchange, closed at 87.48, down from an opening level of 87.56 and well
below the high of 87.63. Volume was sluggish at 30,000 contracts against
Monday's 80,000.
Money supply data for April could be released any time from today and is one
of the key economic indicators watched by the Bundesbank. The council of the
central bank holds a regular bi-weekly meeting tomorrow.
Yesterday, construction industry employers and unions agreed a 5.8 per cent
pay increase, plus improved conditions of service. The settlement follows a
similar deal between engineering employers and unions agreed on Monday.
UK government bond prices were stable to slightly weaker yesterday, but with
few investors or dealers taking positions before the retail sales data for
April expected today.
The benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed at 100 3/4 , close to the
opening level, for a yield of 8.9 per cent.
The June gilt futures contract on Liffe closed at 99.06, just down from the
opening level of 99.08 and below the day's high of 99.11. Volume was 15,000
contracts, well down from Monday.
The market was encouraged by figures which showed the public sector
borrowing requirement at Pounds 3.6bn in April, against market expectations
of closer to Pounds 4bn. This suggested that government finances are not
deteriorating as quickly as some analysts had predicted.
Official data also suggested that the UK economy is slowly starting to pull
out of recession. Manufacturing output rose by 0.1 per cent during March,
although the annual rate of growth remained negative, at minus 1.2 per cent.
However, retail sales figures due for release today could give a better
indication of the post-election performance of the economy.
JAPANESE government bond prices continued to trade with a firmer tone
overnight in Tokyo, supported by the buoyancy of share prices and the
strength of the yen on the foreign exchange markets.
The benchmark 10-year bond issue No 129 closed in Tokyo on a yield of 5.48
per cent, from 5.515 per cent on Monday.
The yen held on to Monday's gains on the foreign exchange markets, moving in
a tight range against the dollar between Y129.25 and Y128.25 in Asian
trading. By late afternoon in London, the Japanese currency stood at
Y129.00.
The Nikkei 225 stock market index closed up 311 points on the day at 18,754,
following a 368 point rise on Monday.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: GM to raise Dollars 2.14bn in
largest US stock offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS was last night in the process of raising Dollars 2.14bn gross
through the largest stock offering by a US company as its investment banking
underwriters priced the company's global issue at Dollars 39 a share and
increased the number of shares on sale by 10 per cent.
The selling price compared with GM's close on the New York Stock Exchange
last night of Dollars 39 1/4 , down Dollars  1/4 .
The size of the offer was increased from the 50m shares originally planned
to 55m because of investor interest, but this was short of the maximum 57.5m
General Motors said it might issue if there was sufficient demand. The
company's underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley, will now sell the issue on to
investors.
Some 40m of the shares will be offered in the US, 6m in the UK, 4.5m in Asia
and 4.5m in other international centres.
The gross spread on the issue - the difference between the selling price and
the price paid for the stock by the underwriter - is 97.5 cents. The selling
concession - the discount offered to selling groups  - is 63.5 cents and the
reallowance is 10 cents. Delivery of the shares is scheduled for May 28.
The price setting followed the completion on Monday of a roadshow in which
the automobile manufacturer sold itself to potential investors on three
continents.
The offering is a test of investor sentiment towards the company, which lost
Dollars 4.5bn last year but over the past few months has changed its top
management, announced plans for 21 plant closures and 70,000 job losses, and
begun overhauling is North American management structure.
The central question facing potential investors is whether these changes,
coupled with a slow recovery in the depressed US auto market, will be
sufficient to restore the company's earnings to respectable levels at a time
when it faces ever increasing competition from Japanese manufacturers and
American rivals Ford and Chrysler.
The offering is GM's first issue of common stock since 1955 and the largest
issue by a US company, excluding the Dollars 2.8bn rights offering to
existing shareholders made last year by Time Warner.
The next largest offering was a Dollars 1.46bn issue by Consolidated Rail in
1987.
The GM issue has been helped by the upward sweep of the US stock market
since the start of the year and the relative strength of 'cyclical'
companies, such as motor manufacturers, whose performance tends to track the
economic cycle.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Renault stages strong recovery
in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, yesterday reported a strong
first-quarter profits recovery. Pre-tax profits climbed from FFr298m
(Dollars 56.2m) in the first three months of 1991 to FFr2.36bn in the same
period of this year, on sales up by 19.3 per cent from FFr40.01bn to
FFr47.73bn.
The gain comes after accounting for Renault's FFr180m share of Volvo's
losses.
The group attributed the improvement to record car sales in the first
quarter. This was mostly due to the group's performance, though a limited
gain also came from the release of pent-up demand, which had built up during
last autumn's strike at Renault's main engine and gear box making plant.
The latest figures continue the sharp improvement in Renault's profits shown
over the whole of last year, and is a mark of the productivity gains
achieved under the chairmanship of Mr Raymond Levy. He is due to retire on
Friday, after nearly six years at the head of the group.
His successor, expected to be the managing director Mr Louis Schweitzer, is
likely to be named next week.
Renault sold FFr40.28bn worth of cars in the first quarter, 84.4 per cent of
total turnover, well up on the 80.9 per cent of total sales they represented
in the same period of 1991. Truck making accounted for FFr6.33bn, and the
remaining FFr1.1bn came from other industrial activities.

Target, Dayton's discount chain, performed best. Same-store sales rose by 6
per cent and total sales increased from Dollars 1.84bn to Dollars 2.15bn.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Chemical Banking predicts fall
in level of bad debt provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of Chemical Banking, the US banking group formed by the merger
of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank, yesterday predicted a
decline in the level of the bank's bad debt provisions and loan write-offs
during the second and third quarters of 1992.
Mr John McGillicuddy, speaking at the first shareholders meeting since the
merger took place late last year, said the Dollars 375m bad-debt provision
level recorded in the first three months of the year was high. He added that
he thought the level of non-performing assets would peak in the second or
third quarter of the year.
The total of non-performing assets at the bank was Dollars 6.2bn at the end
of March.
Turning to the treatment of loans to Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property
group that recently filed for protection from creditors in Canada and the
US, Mr McGillicuddy said the bank's lending to O&amp;Y Development Ltd was
placed on non-performing status in the first quarter of 1992.
Chemical Banking has a loan exposure of about Dollars 250m to the O&amp;Y group,
of which half is represented by lending to property projects, like the
Canary Wharf development in London.
Mr Walter Shipley, chief executive of Chemical, meanwhile told shareholders
the bank was confident it would meet or exceed its stated cost-cutting
targets, which begin with annual operating cost cuts of Dollars 225m by
year-end and as much as Dollars 750m a year by 1995.
Mr Shipley said the reduction in staff was also proceeding on schedule, with
2,800 jobs eliminated since the merger was announced last summer and the
greater part of the overall goal of 6,200 cuts to be achieved by year-end.
Chemical Bank is also continuing to strengthen its capital base, having
achieved a level of 6.6 per cent in its Tier 1 risk-based ratio at the end
of March.
The bank is planning to raise up to Dollars 250m by offering up to 10m
fixed-rate perpetual preferred shares at Dollars 25 each.
Duff &amp; Phelps, the credit rating service, yesterday said the improving
climate led it to upgrade the ratings on seven US banks including The Bank
of New York and Mellon Bank.
Four other banks - Chase Manhattan, First Interstate, Bank of Boston and
Shawmut - were placed on a 'favourable' rating watch with a view to an
eventual upgrade.
Mr Paul McCarthy, president of Duff &amp; Phelps, said that despite the period
of 'severe stress' banks had undergone over the past 18 months, there were
sufficiently improved prospects to warrant the upgrades. Among the other
banks whose ratings have been upgraded are Crestar Financial, First Bank
System, First Fidelity Bancorp, Signet Banking and Valley National.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: AMB wins AGF share ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AACHENER &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second largest insurance
company, has won an important courtroom victory over the status of the large
minority stake in the company held by Assurances Generales de France (AGF),
the state-owned French insurer.
The Regional Court of Aachen decided the Vorstand - or managing board - of
AMB was within its rights not to register the voting rights attached to 19
per cent of AMB out of the 25 per cent-plus owned by AGF. Under German
company law, the right to accord voting rights on special types of
registered shares belongs to the incumbent management.
The French company said it disagreed with the ruling, and would continue
attempts to have the shares registered. It maintains that its intentions
towards AMB are friendly.
The AMB Vorstand, however, believes AGF to be making a scarcely-veiled
attempt to win management control.
AGF argued before the court that AMB's tactics were frustrating its own
European development strategy, namely closer alliance with Fondiaria, the
leading Italian insurance group which now owns 20 per cent of AMB, and with
Royal Insurance of the UK.
According to Mr Piers von Simson, a director of SG Warburg, the London
investment bank advising the AMB Vorstand, the court's decision would put
pressure on AGF to enter further talks over co-operation. Earlier attempts
stalled over the question of registering the shares.

level
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Adidas, the German sports shoe company, fell sharply last
year, reflecting difficult conditions in the sportswear market - in
particular stiff competition from Reebok and Nike - as well as the costs of
continued restructuring.
The group is controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, who last month was appointed
Minister of Urban Affairs in the French government.
Group pre-tax profits dropped from DM90m (Dollars 56.6m) to DM44m last year.
Turnover was up just DM11m to DM3.53bn.
Plans to sell off brands such as Pony, Arena and Le Coq Sportif had 'neared
full completion' in 1991, Adidas said, and further consolidation measures
would be taken.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Allied-Lyons trading profit sees 9.6% rise
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, achieved a 9.6 per cent
increase in trading profits to Pounds 815m last year with strong
performances in all its operations. Taxable profits of Pounds 610m compared
with the previous year's Pounds 476m when Allied was hit by currency trading
losses of Pounds 147m.
The group reported yesterday that it had reached agreement with the Office
of Fair Trading over the leasing of 734 pubs to Brent Walker, the leisure
group. Arguments over the terms of the lease had threatened Allied's
compliance with government orders requiring it to free 2,380 pubs from tied
beer supplies.
Earnings per share during the 53 weeks to March 7 grew to 41p from 40.5p. A
final dividend of 13.35p makes a total of 20p for the year, 6.3 per cent up.
The wines and spirits division improved margins and raised trading profits
10.2 per cent to Pounds 410m. Ballantine's whisky shipments were 5 per cent
ahead with strong volume gains in Spain.
Food profits rose 11.4 per cent to Pounds 147m with the sector's
international spread cushioning it against tough trading conditions in the
UK. The Dunkin Donuts and Baskin-Robbins franchise systems opened a further
400 stores, and saw a 10 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 1.3bn.
Allied's brewing and pub retailing profits increased 7.9 per cent to Pounds
258m.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 79m for the reorganisation to meet the
government's beer orders partially offset Pounds 31m of profits from pub
property sales.

Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French building consortium, by the time it has
spent another Pounds 500m on the project. Eurotunnel is likely to have used
this money by late July or August.
Eurotunnel is in breach of its covenants and needs to persuade 65 per cent
of its bank lenders to waive the relevant covenant by May 29 if it is to
continue drawing on loan facilities. As a condition of granting the waiver -
which they expect to give - bankers have set the deadline for reaching
agreement with TML.
It is understood that Sir Alastair Morton, one of the company's joint
chairmen, has told bankers that it regards the deadline as 'wholly
unrealistic'. However, Eurotunnel yesterday refused to make any comment.
Eurotunnel has told the banks that there is little chance of being able to
assess the vast amount of financial information relevant to the dispute in
the time.
Eurotunnel is also concerned that any possible settlement with TML would
lead to a change in the basis of the construction contract.
This in turn would need the approval of 90 per cent of its 220 banks as
measured by the value of their loans - and Eurotunnel is fearful that it
would be impossible to get such a majority vote.
In other words, Eurotunnel fears that the banks are creating a potentially
disastrous financial crisis for the company. Some bankers share this view.
However, one of the leading lenders to the group insisted that the deadline
for the deal with TML was 'flexible'.
The dispute with TML is over responsibility for cost overruns. TML is
claiming about Pounds 1.5bn at 1985 prices for this lump sum contract which
was originally expected to cost Pounds 620m. Eurotunnel has offered to pay
Pounds 1bn, leaving a gap of about Pounds 500m.
The company has credit facilities of around Pounds 8bn, but the main lending
facility from commercial banks is for Pounds 6.8bn. Of this commercial line,
Eurotunnel has already drawn Pounds 4bn.

FT  20 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y tells Water Street investors they face big loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK yesterday told holders of securities in its 55 Water Street
property, the world's largest office building in New York, they faced huge
losses on their investment but could not rely on O&amp;Y to bail them out.
In a separate development, a UK government minister said no decision on
whether to move civil servants to O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf office development in
East London was likely to be taken before the deadline faced by banks on
whether to force Canary Wharf to file for insolvency protection.
At a two-hour meeting in New York, O&amp;Y told holders of USDollars 548m
(Pounds 309m) in two series of notes secured by the 53-storey, 3.6m sq ft
building in New York that the slump in the Manhattan property market meant
cash flow from the building would be insufficient to service the property's
debt from next year. It told them that by 1994, cash flow generated by the
building would have fallen to Dollars 5.2m, as tenants moved out, compared
with interest payments on the bonds of Dollars 35.9m.
The Water Street property is one of several buildings in the US which O&amp;Y
has financed through single-purpose companies with no recourse to the
parent. Bondholders were initially confident this structure would protect
them from O&amp;Y's financial problems. But, in a pattern likely to be repeated,
O&amp;Y warned Water Street bondholders yesterday they would have to rely on
their own resources to make improvements to the building which are necessary
to attract new tenants. A bond analyst at Jeffreys &amp; Company in New York
said the Water Street bondholders were 'shell-shocked' after yesterday's
meeting.
The price of the Water Street notes plunged 10 points to about Dollars 35
immediately afterwards.
O&amp;Y estimated improvements needed to attract new tenants could cost Dollars
100-Dollars 200m over the next five years.
Meanwhile a UK government minister said it would take 'several weeks' for a
decision to be made on moving 2,000 Department of the Environment civil
servants to Canary Wharf or a separate docklands property.
Bankers had been hoping for an earlier decision. They must decide by the end
of May whether Canary Wharf should be kept as a going concern, because that
is when it runs out of cash.
The DoE is looking at a number of docklands sites. The front-runners are
Canary Wharf, which has offered the space at Pounds 15 a square foot, and
Harbour Exchange, which is offering it at Pounds 13. The Department of
Transport is even further away from a decision on whether to move 1,000
civil servants to Canary Wharf.
In the US, O&amp;Y's request to the Water Street bondholders appears to signal
the start of a series of talks to allow O&amp;Y to continue operating its US
properties without court protection. O&amp;Y excluded its US operations from
last week's court order giving protection from its creditors in Canada.
The operating account for 55 Water Street and an Aetna Insurance surety bond
appear to be sufficient to meet Dollars 45m in interest payments due on June
30.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Drop in US housing starts may lead to interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST monthly drop in US housing starts for more than eight years
prompted renewed speculation yesterday that the Federal Reserve might soon
signal another cut in interest rates.
Housing starts fell by 17 per cent in April, a far bigger decline than most
analysts had expected.
The figures were released by the Commerce Department as governors and
regional presidents of the Federal Reserve, the central bank, met in
Washington to review monetary policy.
On Wall Street, the benchmark long bond closed more than half a point up on
the news, on hopes of an interest rate cut, and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed at a record 3,397.99, up 21.96.
The drop in starts affected all regions and categories of residential
property, including single-family homes, down 11 per cent.
Following other warning signals, including a decline in new house sales, the
drop seems to indicate a loss of momentum in residential housing, one of the
few sectors of the economy to rebound strongly from recession.
The consensus is that the economy is growing sluggishly, at an annual rate
of 2-3 per cent. However, the setback in housing is likely to fuel doubts
about the pace and sustainability of recovery. Car sales - another critical
barometer - remain subdued, while unemployment claims are still abnormally
high.
Wall Street analysts have been predicting an easing of monetary policy. If
the Fed acts, the likeliest move is a  1/4 -point cut in the federal funds
rate to 3.5 per cent, the floor set by the current level of the discount
rate at which the Fed lends to banks. This would trigger a 1/2 -point cut in
banks' prime lending rates to 6 per cent.
The Fed is under political pressure to ease monetary policy because monetary
growth is barely above the lower limit of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range.
However, it may decide that lower rates would only increase fears of higher
inflation.
Housing starts in April were running at an annual rate of 1.1m, the lowest
level since November but 14 per cent higher than last April.
Mr Maury Harris, chief economist at New York broker Paine Webber, said
starts were likely to rebound in coming months, reflecting a slight fall in
mortgage rates since April.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Italy must act to meet Emu goals, say EC ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN economic policy is in danger of sliding out of control, European
Community finance ministers said yesterday.
They called on Italy's caretaker government to take drastic and immediate
action 'to put the Italian budget back on the track' towards economic and
monetary union (Emu).
In a strongly worded communique, the ministers said there would be
'significant adverse repercussions throughout the Community' if Italy failed
to meet the economic convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty
by 1996.
They added: 'Strong measures cannot be further postponed, as the size of the
emerging slippage is such as to undermine the credibility of Italian
economic policy.'
Italy presented plans to improve its budget deficit and reduce inflation
last November, but EC ministers are worried that not enough has been done
since to meet stated targets. They estimate that a L30,000bn (Pounds 13.5bn)
package of spending cuts and reforms is needed if Italy is to meet its 1992
target of reducing the deficit to L127,800bn.
Mr Guido Carli, Italy's finance minister who lost his seat in the recent
election, said priority should be given to reforming healthcare and pensions
once a new government was formed.
Finance ministers also expressed their concern that German plans to meet the
Emu targets might be over-optimistic.
Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, said inflation - 4.7 per cent in
April - could come down to 3.75 per cent by the end of this year.
He added that the general government deficit would rise from 2.8 per cent of
gross domestic product last year to 3.1 per cent this year, before returning
to 2.6 per cent in 1993 - well inside the Emu target of 3 per cent by 1996.
But Mr Waigel's figures contradicted those approved by the ministers, which
indicated a deficit of 4.1 per cent in 1992, dropping to 3.3 per cent in
1993 and 1.9 per cent by 1995.
Mr Waigel tried to reassure fellow ministers that central government would
be able to hold in check spending by the Lander and municipal councils.
But Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, afterwards voiced
other ministers' scepticism about the German plans and effectiveness of
economic co-operation between Bonn and the Lander. His own country has
imposed much stricter budget deficit targets than Germany.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Battle to keep Bonn in new fighter project: Daimler-Benz
chief warns against pull-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ANDREW FISHER

   BONN, STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN defence and aero-space industries launched a furious last-ditch
defence yesterday to save their participation in the European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA), which is being developed with Britain, Italy and Spain.
Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest
industrial group and chief contractor for the EFA through its Deutsche
Aerospace subsidiary, warned that a decision to pull out would damage the
entire German economy.
'The issues concern technologies which were developed at great expense and
with great effort and have become key factors in an entire economy,' he
said.
The national federation for defence and aerospace industries sent an urgent
plea to the key decision-makers not to withdraw from the project, less than
two weeks before Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, is due to make
his final recommendation to the three parties in the government coalition.
The Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, the smallest partner in the ruling
coalition, has demanded top-level talks with Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor,
to head off the expected negative decision.
The party leadership has made it clear that the decision over EFA, which
will be built mainly in Bavaria, is a fundamental one for the coalition, and
must be agreed by all three parties.
Mr Reuter, in a barely disguised attack on Mr Ruhe and his colleague, Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, denounced 'short-sightedness,
aggravated by rose-coloured, populist spectacles'. Mr Mollemann is a public
opponent of the aircraft, and Mr Ruhe is widely reported to have made up his
mind to pull out.
If Germany quit the EFA project, and also cut its support for the two
European manned space projects, the Hermes space shuttle and Columbus space
platform, it would 'risk shaking the foundations of an entire industry . . .
because of relatively small gaps in the federal budget,' Mr Reuter said at a
press conference. The appeal to all the members of Germany's parliamentary
budget and defence committees, to Mr Ruhe and Mr Mollemann, was sent by Mr
Karl Dersch, president of the Federation of the German Aerospace and Defence
Industry (BDLI).
He said it was agreed in all the leading political parties that Germany
needed a new fighter to ensure its air security, and fulfil its political
contribution to Nato. It was not a question about whether to buy an
aircraft, but about which aircraft to buy.
He quoted a price for the aircraft including equipment, and value added tax,
of DM98m (Pounds 33m), based on a 'fly-away' price of DM68m. If all the tax
revenues due to the government from the manufacturing process in Germany
were deducted, he said, the real 'net' price to the state budget was only
DM29m. Every foreign competitor would be at least twice as expensive.
The BDLI has calculated that 20,000 jobs in Germany would be at stake if the
government pulls out of the EFA project. There would be a 'massive' threat
to the very survival of many medium-sized defence industry suppliers, Mr
Dersch said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER KNOWLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For once a regulatory body appears to have teeth, witness the reluctant
agreement by British Gas to provide a miserly price reduction just meeting
the minimum necessary to avoid legal action.
Would it be too much to ask that Oftel whips up sufficient enthusiasm and
courage to take on the mighty British Telecom and its cosy duopoly? After
all, the profits earned (sic) last year must qualify BT as one of the most
profitable companies in the world. Consider the population in the UK,
compared with the US, and then ask why BT makes more profit than AT&amp;T and
all the regional Baby Bells in total.
Should Oftel need help in the courage department please ask them to call.

What on earth is happening to Professor Sir Roland Smith? Ever since he lost
his job as chairman of British Aerospace last autumn, he has been shedding
his outside directorships. But he is now said to be contemplating stepping
down as chairman of his beloved Manchester United.
The Prof, who not so long ago sat on the boards of more public companies
than anyone, told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch yesterday that he is
'unlikely to remain chairman of Manchester United'. However, before he can
quit the United directors' bench he has to get the nod of approval from the
court of directors of the Bank of England on which he sits.
He says that it's the first time such a 'mundane point' has ever been
considered by the court. Perhaps it is. But Sir Roland would have gone up in
Observer's estimation considerably if he had announced that he was handing
in his notice at the Bank of England and devoting more time to United. He
would have to attend far fewer board meetings, Old Trafford is much closer
to his home, and its financial affairs would benefit from his continued
attention.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Observer: Frost frozen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever one thinks about the relative merits of British and US TV, when it
comes to serious current affairs programmes on Sunday morning, the US wins
hands down. Whether it's CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press, or
ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, most of the political issues of the
week generally get a good airing before Sunday lunchtime.
In Britain, the early Sunday morning current affairs field has been left
very much to David Frost, television interviewer of the rich and powerful.
However, his eight-year-old Frost on Sunday programme ends in December.
GMTV, which has won the breakfast TV franchise, doesn't think that his 1.4m
audience is big enough.
Instead, Liz Howell, the GMTV director of programmes who has pulled the plug
on Frost, says she wants 'a leisure show about the family'.
Frost is not the only casualty. Business news is going to be scaled back
drastically, and entertainer Jeremy Beadle will be running a quiz. As for
Frost, his best chance of staging a comeback lies with TV-am's planned bid
for the Channel 5 franchise. But that is unlikely to be on the air before
the end of 1994.

There is much in the newly-published Questions of Procedure for Ministers to

ladder.
The publication of the fact that permanent secretaries have authority to
ignore their junior ministers does little for the self-esteem of
Westminster's rising stars.
But the section that has caused real anguish in the Commons tea-room is the
instruction to ministers to restrict their foreign travel. It then adds
insult to serious injury by telling them if they must go abroad on official
business they should do so at weekends - and keep a fully-itemised account
of their expenses.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Observer: Perks for EC pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The removal of Germany's capital from Bonn to Berlin is causing awful
soul-searching in the political establishment, not to mention among the good
property owners along the banks of the Rhine. So it's nice to hear of some
people who stand to do rather well out of it - for doing nothing.
The European Commission, bless its boots, has decided that it must
recalculate the 'central co-efficient' according to which its employees in
Germany get their salaries calculated, and ex-Commission pensioners their
pensions. Instead of using Bonn's cost of living for the central figure, it
will now use Berlin.
Of course, Berlin is a rather more expensive place to live in than Bonn. If
Brussels is rated at 100, Berlin stands on 104, and Bonn on a modest 95. Any
suggestion that every EC official in Germany is suddenly going to get a fat
pay rise is roundly denied. Berlin, Bonn and the research centre in
Karlsruhe all have their own specific co-efficients, to which salaries in
each place are tailored accordingly. However, that leaves all the EC
pensioners in Germany, whose salaries are tied to the 'central'
co-efficient.
So for them, a nice little windfall of almost 10 per cent, assuming the
Council of Ministers approves the juggling.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on the policy of ageism suggests that the EC's policy is as
irrelevant and 'stupid' as the employment minister, Michael Forsyth,
implies.
The notion of 'jobs for life', which is suggested by the proposed Brussels
policy, has largely disappeared, but so has 'over the hill at 40'.
The minister was right to point out that the recession has resulted in
experienced and talented people in mid-career being made redundant, but
being in mid-career is not necessarily proving a stumbling block in finding
new jobs. A recent survey by my company found that less than 20 per cent of
client respondents aged between 40 and 55 quoted age as a barrier to new
appointments. Increasingly employers are recognising the benefits of
maturity. W G Methven,

<TEXT>
Sir, The Department of Employment's commitment to tackling age
discrimination as a priority of the UK presidency of the EC ('Over 35 is
over the hill for Brussels job-seekers', May 15) will deservedly highlight
this issue at European level.
UK members of the European parliament have for some time been pressing for
action to lift upper age limits on recruitment to EC institutions both via
the parliament's Intergroup on Ageing and through parliamentary questions.
The European Parliament has called several times for action to stop age
discrimination in the Community.
The European Court of Justice recently took a small step in the right
direction, by raising its upper age for recruitment to executive posts from
32 to 40. But the European Parliament, as well as the Commission, continues
to set upper limits of 33.
The UK government should, as a priority, persuade the EC institutions to
lift their upper age limits during 1992, and set an example to employers.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Leading Article: New realism in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has stepped back from the abyss. In a little over 24 hours following
Monday's wage settlement, the spectre of damaging strikes in the engineering
industry and renewed unrest in the public sector disappeared. The prospect
of a year or more of industrial stability and falling inflation in the
western Lander are good. But the threat of crisis has not been eradicated;
the struggle over how to spread the burden of unification has only been
prolonged.
The sudden outbreak of peace in the engineering industry demonstrates how
premature were the plethora of obituaries for Germany's consensus-seeking
decision-making. The extent of the compromise, and the speed with which the
building workers have fallen into line, demonstrates how much both unions
and employers wanted to avoid a confrontation.
Little wonder the west German political establishment has breathed a deep
sigh of relief. The wage agreements, while high by German standards, do not
spell danger for industrial competitiveness; and the fact that the unions
appear to have accepted the need for wage restraint should be enough to
remove the threat of higher interest rates.
Yet the canker remains. Prospects in the west may have improved, but the
plight of the eastern Lander continues to deteriorate. Output per head has
collapsed, capital investment is depressingly low, and the official
unemployment rate has risen to 15 per cent. Adding all the hidden unemployed
on various schemes increases the proportion of the potential workforce
without jobs to 40 per cent. What economic activity is occurring in the east
remains largely dependent on transfers from west German taxpayers. Net
transfers are expected to rise to 81 per cent of east German output this
year.
Wage conversion
The root of Germany's economic and social problems is the pace at which
wages in the east and west are converging. Parity in the engineering
industry is timetabled for 1996. But east German productivity is only a
third of west German levels. No wonder eastern industry is unprofitable and
the pace of industrial privatisation so slow.
These wage convergence deals should be rethought; but the ease with which
skilled workers can migrate mean that wages will still converge faster than
productivity. Unemployment in the east will stay high for some time. One way
or another the west German government will have to subside eastern living
standards.
Inefficient industries
Yet the government is currently impeding rather than speeding the
transformation. The most inefficient industries should be allowed to close;
but instead they receive the lion's share of subsidies from the Treuhand.
Rather than paying people to do nothing, government should instead subsidise
employment in the private sector. The subsidies should be temporary; but by
closing the gap between east German wages and productivity, they would
encourage the growth of private industry, rather than public idleness.
Yet whether the transfers subsidise employment or unemployment, the flow
will continue for years. The cost of these transfers was inevitably going to
place great strains on the social consensus in the west. But these strains
have been magnified by the unwillingness of the government to demand of the
west German people the necessary sacrifices.
The pain is not over. Despite last year's tax increases, public borrowing
continues to grow at an unsustainable pace. The government's commitment not
to increase taxes further already looks unrealistic. If it plans to stick to
its pledge to bring borrowing under control, then government will have to
cut spending. The candidates for cuts are numerous - subsidies in
agriculture coal and steel, and local government spending. Government at
federal and land level must specify where the axe will fall.
The bravery of Mr Kohl's embrace of unification in 1990 has been matched by
the poverty of his subsequent policy actions. But the events of the last few
months should have taught him and his colleagues the error of their ways. It
is time for Mr Kohl to come clean. If the coalition government fails to act
decisively, there will be more confrontation and, quite possibly, a new
government in 1994.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Half-open government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S moves to expose some of the workings of government to public
scrutiny are welcome if long overdue. The publication of the membership of
Cabinet committees will not change the world. And the 130-paragraph
Questions of Procedure for Ministers is unlikely to enter the best-seller
lists. But the workings of government will become marginally more
transparent, allowing voters greater insight into what goes on in their
name.
Defenders of the old order such as Lord Armstrong, the former Cabinet
Secretary, have warned that the removal of such restrictions means the end
of ministerial solidarity. If every backbencher knows that the Cabinet has
overturned the recommendation of a committee, the committee members will be
unable to maintain straight-faced the convention of collective
responsibility. It will be impossible to challenge foreign dictators or
vanquish insurgents at home, the doomsters say, if ministers cannot present
a convincing picture of unity.
Such scenarios are less than convincing. Ministers who fall out with
colleagues are already adept at using the lobby system to advance their
case. Cabinet splits emerged during the Falklands War and the miners' strike
without seriously impairing the government's efforts. Good government can
withstand public scrutiny - indeed is more likely to thrive under it.
The government is promising more openness to follow. Mr William Waldegrave,
the minister in charge of the reforms, has found more than 150 restrictions
on the disclosure of information which he hopes to tear up. Mr Major wants
to clear the attics of Whitehall of old documents withheld from the public
long after 30 years has expired.
Veil of secrecy
All of this is commendable. Two world wars shrouded British public life in a
veil of secrecy which is only now being gingerly cast off. It is often
easier to research recent British history in the US with its freedom of
information legislation or even in the voluminous records of the old Soviet
intelligence services which are now fully open to public examination.
The government rightly claims that it has done much to make more official
information available. Computerised data are now largely open on demand.
Patients can inspect their medical records. Much more information is
published about the performance of the public services.
But Britain remains a country of unnecessary secrecy. Much government
information about safety, for example, is unavailable to the public which
pays for its collection. If information about the safety of pesticides can
be published without breaking commercial confidence, why does not the same
apply to new medicines?
Public domain
Fire inspections carried out in London Underground stations are in the
public domain; those on British Rail are not. The Transport Department tests
new cars for pollution standards and safety - and refuses to make the
results available to consumers. Coroners' courts withhold documents on fatal
accidents from government-funded safety researchers.
Equally, the unfortunate imbroglio over the deaths of nine British
servicemen in the Gulf 'friendly fire' incident has been magnified by
official secrecy. The desire to sweep the incident under the carpet has
added to the burden of bereaved families, damaged the reputation of the UK
government and almost certainly made transatlantic relations worse.
The government claims that a Freedom of Information Act would not help
because it would deluge the citizen with information, much of it useless.
Far better, ministers say, to create a culture in which the government
machine releases willingly the information which the citizen needs. Such
paternalism is not good enough: it is for the citizen to make the decision
about what he or she wants to know. If there are reasons for withholding it
 -on national security, commercial confidentiality or other acceptable
grounds - the government must justify it case by case, subject to
independent appeal.
If Mr Major wants to go down in history as the instigator of open government
 -an honourable aim - he will in the end have to take on the vested
interests which resist a Freedom of Information Act.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Arts: Quirks of fate supplement the prize line-up - Cannes
Film Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At my prep school they used to show a feature film on the last night of
term. No matter what it was - Citizen Kane or Carry On Up The Khyber - the
same air of punch-drunk euphoria reigned. The assembled schoolboys knew that
their bags were packed and that there were 12 hours to freedom.
It was the same at the end of the 45th Cannes Film Festival. We had written
our final exam papers and attended every competition sitting; soon we would
hear about the prizes. Now all we had to do was to watch Tom Cruise in the
non-competitive closing movie Far And Away. This exuberant load of tosh, the
first film shot in 65-millimetre since Ryan's Daughter, has Cruise as a
young Irish peasant who streetfights his way from Connemara to Oklahoma, via
Boston, in the 1890s while falling in love with Nicole Kidman (aka Cruise's
offscreen girlfriend).
The Cannes audience loved the film. They cheered when Cruise first kisses
Kidman in front of a snow-patterned window with tinkly Christmas harp music
from John (ET) Williams. They cheered the climactic Oklahoma land race and
ensuing punch-up between hero and villain for Miss Kidman's hand. Most of
all they cheered the fact that Cannes had nothing left to throw at them. Now
more than ever was it rich to leave.
The final days brought some piquant addenda, but they were provided less by
Hollywood than by North America's shoestring divisions. The expected
mega-treats disappointed. David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a
catchpenny prequel to the TV series; Sidney Lumet's A Stranger Among Us is a
daft cop thriller with Melanie Griffith going undercover among New York's
Hasidic Jews, and Gary Sinise's Of Mice And Men is a Steinbeck adaptation
notable only for John Malkovich's touching Lenny.
I enjoyed far more two lesser-budget films drawn from their makers' own
lives. In the Directors Fortnight actor John Turturro presented his
writing-directing debut Mac. This low-budget tale of a self-made
Italian-American housebuilder (Turturro) and his battle for honest values in
a corrupt world is a touch loudhailed: like an Arthur Miller script directed
by Federico Fellini. But at best it is also powerfully funny, with Turturro
a marvel in the lead role based on his own father.
From Canada came Jean-Claude Lauzon's Leolo. The 12-year-old hero is the
film-maker himself, growing up in a ramshackle family flat in 1960s Montreal
where puberty, poverty and an army of potty relatives surge around him.
Especially eye-catching are Grandpa, who is dispatched to a mental asylum
during the brief intervals when Leolo is not trying to kill him, and
musclebound Big Brother who trains himself to look like A. Schwarzenegger
but still gets sand kicked in his face by any passer-by. Like Mac the film
is loud, episodic and all' Italiana. It is also witty, infectious and
winningly candid about sexual self-discovery.
The last days of Cannes are devoted in part to catching up with missed films
that colleagues tell you are masterpieces. This is never a gratifying
pastime. Either the colleague is right, in which case you are late with the
scoop. Or the colleague is wrong, in which case you want to brain him.
Braining has been a la mode at Cannes in 1992. Top of the films I could have
spent my life without seeing is Victor Erice's The Sun In The Quince Tree,
even though it shared the Prix du Jury and won the International Critics
Prize. This 2 1/2 -hour Spanish docudrama about a painter painting, yes, a
sunlit quince tree manages the remarkable feat of seeming both artless and
pretentious. In a grainy mixture of film and video, it drones on trying to
achieve its quasi-religious minimalism. But we never feel cinematically the
sensual magic of the artistic process, proclaimed in words by the real-life
painter Antonio Lopez. Nor do we know why there are so many extracurricular
shots of railway lines or TV sets glowing in night apartments or Mrs Lopez
pottering around the house.
So we come to the 45th Cannes Film Festival prizes. Jury president Gerard
Depardieu walked onto the stage, with that hunched-shouldered rolling gait
we know from a hundred French movies, like a bear searching for honey. And
soon we knew which honey-pot he was going for. The Palme d'Or winner was
Bille August's Best Intentions, praised on this page last week and cheered
again at Cannes last night. The majestic Ingmar Bergman-scripted period
epic, based on the lives of Ingmar's own parents, also won Best Actress for
Pernilla August, the director's wife, who played Bergman's mother.
If you can cope with that dynastic tangle, how about the evening's other
coincidences and convolutions? America's The Player, as well as winning Best
Director for Robert Altman, won Best Actor for Tim Robbins, seen here most
recently squiring his first film as director - the amiable political satire
Bob Roberts - through the festival. And John Turturro, last year's Cannes
Best Actor for Barton Fink, also brought his directing debut to Cannes, the
aforementioned Mac, and ran off with the prestigious Camera d'Or award for
Best First Feature.
One other Cannes quirk of fate. Bille August was the first non-American to
win the Palme d'Or for four years. The last non-American to win the prize
was - Bille August. That was for Pelle The Conqueror in 1988. What a tangled
web the film festival world weaves. This writer is now awarding himself a
personal Palme d'Or for getting through it all - the confusions,
coincidences and critical rigours - and is departing into well-fed anonymity
in central France.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Arts: Iphigenie en Tauride - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh National Opera have waited a long time - 45 years, to be precise  -
before tackling their first Gluck opera. Patience is bounteously rewarded:
on Monday his penultimate work surged out into the New Theatre, Cardiff,
with unstoppable force and speed: in clock-time the performance lasted just
over two hours, in psychological time it passed in a flash, and with a
searing immediacy that can have left few in the audience in doubt they were
encountering one of the essential masterpieces of music-drama.
No theatre, said Gluck, can be too small for it; but the New, medium in
size, 'close-up' in sound projection, seems just about perfect as an
Iphigenie en Tauride auditorium. This is an advantage of which the
conductor, Charles Mackerras, takes full account. He remains unbeatable as a
Gluckian who combines 'period' niceness of balance and modern communicative
passion.
Playing and singing (in French never less than acceptable) are of the
highest quality. Every note is rendered telling, reverberant with dramatic
intensity precisely directed. The bareness of the score is made - as it must
be - its supreme virtue: the silences speak as eloquently as the sounds, and
where a single detail or colour (such as the grimly buzzing string tremolo
in Thoas's aria) needs to set the tone, Mackerras works the effect with
masterly authority.
It is not spacious Gluck conducting. Edges are hard. Rhythms have a kick.
Marbled neo-Classical grandeur gives way to immediacy of impact. This chimes
with the style of the production by the admired young French team of Patrice
Caurier and Moshe Leiser (UK debut). Robes, drapes and columns are thrown
out; the set is a box whose mobile partitions have been decorated with faint
scratches and striations; the dress is harsh modern (grey skirts for the
priestesses, bare feet for all). A single prop (chair, knife) takes on deep
resonance as a poetic image. Bleakness is indeed beautiful.
The emphasis is on the trauma suffered by Agamemnon's survivors, the grip of
fear and seemingly eternal violence in which both Greeks and Scythians are
held. Since the physical action is so fiercely restrained, the smallest
physical gesture of consolatory warmth between Pylades and Orestes becomes
an emotional expression of overwhelming power.
In all these respects, and in its insistence on seeking out the meaning
under the marble, the production plainness manifests a genuinely Gluckian
dramatic intelligence; but after a while it begins to seem rather a one-note
sort of plainness. There is a lack of conversational variety, of detachment,
of 'architecture'. With the same look of vacant-eyed misery Iphigeneia sings
her four very differently expressive arias. Though in a programme interview
Mr Leiser marvels at the way 'every situation . . . relates to the suffering
that we can experience nowadays', he and his partner have not found a way of
'relating' the funeral rites that should close Act 2. The decision to cut
this sublime passage leaves a scar on the whole enterprise.
Luckily, strong advocacy for the production style comes from the excellent
cast. Diana Montague, an experienced Iphigeneia (in France and on record),
has never sung better on any British stage. Her soprano-ish mezzo carries a
rounded gentleness of timbre not usually associated with this most imposing
of dramatic-soprano roles. Perhaps the last degree of dramatic-soprano fire
is missed - but how musically she deals with the tessitura agonies of 'O
malheureuse Iphigenie]', how clear and fine her declamation]
This titular heroine is worth crossing the country to hear and see; and so
are those of the Orestes and Pylades, Simon Keenlyside and Peter Bronder. On
a keyed-up first night Mr Keenlyside's lean high baritone sounded hard
tested, but he, more than anyone else on stage, finds the expressive centre
in economy of gesture and movement - and nowhere more than in the
brilliantly staged account of Orestes's guilt-visions. Mr Bronder youthfully
vibrant tenor rings out with exciting freedom; Pylades's role in the drama
is made movingly fresh and artless.
The dark-toned bass-baritone of Peter Sidhom takes a gallant, health-risking
shot at Thoas's exhausting aria (but Mackerras should consider adopting the
Gluckian precedent of lowering it a tone). Among the smaller roles the Diana
of Alwyn Mellor, an Iphigeneia of the future, stands out. No less than its
recent, much-acclaimed Pelleas, this WNO Iphigenie en Tauride is a bold
stage venture vindicated by its music-making.
In repertory until May 28, then on tour until July 16

FT  20 MAY 92 / Jobs: Ex-cathedra injustice to the vast majority - Public
clocks, pillars of the establishment and the known facts about the
executive-pay question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY are most of Britain's famous public clocks, such as Big Ben, marked with
Roman numerals rather than Arabic figures?
While the question may seem abstruse, there is more than one way in which it
is timely. My reason for posing it is that it's the best answer I can give
to another question lately thrown at me by several callers in reference to
my comments on executive pay a fortnight ago.
What they demand to know, usually with a cackle, is why the Archbishop of
Canterbury doesn't read the Jobs column. But, just in case the connections
between the two questions aren't instantly apparent, I had better offer a
bit of explanation.
The drift of the comments a fortnight back was that most public debate in
Britain about executive pay is pointless. Whenever the topic is raised, the
discussion typically degrades into sweeping exchanges between folk
professing themselves opposed to greed on one side, and self-declared
proponents of enterprise on the other. Being not only a member of both camps
myself, but failing to see any necessary conflict between them, I dubbed
their bickering the 'dialogue of the deluded'. Whereupon the very next
Sunday the Archbishop of Canterbury ascended to the pulpit of Derby
Cathedral, and threw in his lot with the anti-greed party. Hence the
cackling callers' question about why he doesn't read the Jobs column.
The straight answer is that, not having managed to contact him, I don't
know. Most probably, he just feels no need to. But some additional light may
be thrown on the matter by the question about the famous timepieces.
For one suggested solution to it is that such clocks were erected to the
wishes, and so designed to the tastes of pillars of the country's
establishment, who had traditionally received a Classical education. While
that versed them in Roman numerals, the argument goes, it left them
un-familiar with Arabic figures and loth to heed the more complex data that
can be couched therein. They prefer to think on the broader, bolder scale
associated with the ancients.
How far that theory applies personally to the archbishop is another thing I
am unsure of. Nor, it must be admitted, was I present at his sermon.
Moreover, from the numerous press reports and commentaries I have pored
over, it is clear that he expressed admiration for industrialists and
'affirmed wealth creation'.
Even so, that did not deter him from also tainting them with avarice, and
using an unjustly broad brush to do it. For most reports are agreed that a
key passage of his homily ran:
'Within our own society, our collective commitment to industrial enterprise
will remain under-powered if the fruits of success appear to be concentrated
too heavily in the pockets of shareholders and senior executives. For
example, massive individual pay rises during a recession do not encourage
public support for wealth-creation.'
Although he did not say how many shareholders and senior executives he was
impugning, the implication is surely that they were appreciably large in
number and to be found throughout the wealth-generating sector.
That implication is at odds with such facts as are known, the latest of
which emerged well in time for the archbishop to scan ahead of preaching.
They come from the British Institute of Management's yearly pay survey, and
I cited them two weeks ago to show that, excepting the fat-cattery of City
banking, the number of Britain's managers enjoying high pay and 'massive'
rises is small and confined to the top ranks of the biggest outfits. Even
though the attempt proved vain, I'm having another go in the shape of the
underlying table.
The latest survey covered managerial staff (20,609 all told) in 340
companies. But my figures refer only to the 289 of them that also took part
in the previous year's study, so as to give a fairer idea of recent rises in
pay as well as present levels. The managers are divided into chief
executives, other board-members, five lower ranks of management, and senior
staff. Besides giving the findings across all the 289 companies, I have
broken them down into four categories by sales turnover.
As may be seen, the only group who received increases appreciably above the
8 per cent average for Britain's whole workforce are the chief executives of
outfits with sales of over Pounds 600m. And while the eminences in that
group did egregiously well - on average, they are now paid Pounds 3.74 for
every Pounds 1 going to the chiefs of companies with less than Pounds 25m
turnover - there were fewer than 20 of them.
In pointing that out, however, I do not expect it to count for much with
establishment pillars who, in line with the clock hypothesis, scarcely deign
to ponder such pettifogging details. Indeed, to judge by the FT's letters
column, they've already risen above the mere pay issue.
With the aid of an article by Professor Charles Handy which we published the
day after the archbishop had spoken, they have seized on another of his
preachings - to the effect that one of the things which ought not to be the
prime purpose of business is serving the interests of shareholders. Whether
that in fact should or should not be the case seems now to be the hot as
well as the broader, bolder topic.
All I can say on it is, whatever the ethical rights and wrongs of putting
shareholders first, British companies don't seem to do it in fixing top pay
levels. Witness a study of 51 of the biggest groups by Stefan Szymanski of
London Business School, in which he examined the links between directors'
pay, sales turnover, and value to stockholders in terms of earnings per
share over the decade from 1981 to last year.
The pay had gone up - on the whole, nearly five-fold - and in individual
companies had some link with sales turnover. But the relationship with
earnings per share was virtually zero.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Management: When a Prince means business - David Waller
tells the tale of a family fortune, management consultants and a punk
princess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helge Petersen, a former partner in the McKinsey consultancy group, received
an unusual phone call late in 1986.
Egon Zehnder, a prominent Swiss headhunter, rang with a unique proposition:
would he like to manage the business affairs of the princely house of Thurn
und Taxis, one of the oldest and wealthiest families in Europe?
Petersen took the job - but it did not turn out to be as idyllic as he first
imagined. He and colleagues he recruited left their jobs under a cloud in
1990 and subsequently became embroiled in litigation with their former
employer. It was only last month that this litigation was settled.
Petersen's appointment came about because the head of the family, the late
Prince Johannis von Thurn und Taxis, was concerned that the family
businesses were not earning enough to support his extravagant life-style.
The family's fortune - with assets of about Dollars 1.3bn excluding castles,
pictures, collections and jewellery - reflected the entrepreneurial talents
of Prince Johannis' distant forebears.
In 1490, they established a postal system for central Europe and ran it
successfully for a few centuries thereafter. During the 19th century, it was
privatised and the proceeds skilfully invested in industry and agriculture.
Unlike the fortunes of many noble German families, the T und T empire fared
well in the 20th century too. It survived two world wars, the Nazi Reich and
two periods of great inflation.
This was, however, due more to luck than the entrepreneurial skills of the
princes, who tended to be playboys rather than businessmen. Commercial
affairs were left in the hands of administrators recruited from the Bavarian
civil service.
Acutely conscious that his outgoings exceeded his income, Prince Johannis at
last decided it was time to bring professional management skills to bear on
an empire which well as agriculture, banking, brewing, industry and
international property. Hence Petersen was brought in and given leave to
recruit a team of managers.
For three glorious years, Petersen and his new recruits - principally
Eberhard Crain, a former colleague at McKinsey, and Rolf Levedag from the
Deutsche Bank - lived at the Thurn und Taxis seat of Schloss St Emmeram at
Regensburg in Bavaria, chief of the family's seven castles.
During the week, they had the fun of managing a large business from
congenial surroundings. At the weekends, they were invited to boar-hunts by
their employer, where they could rub shoulders with the likes of Donald
Trump, the former real-estate giant, Prince, the pop-star, Gunter Grass,
Germany's leading author, Franz-Joseph Strauss, Germany's former chancellor,
not to mention the Prince and his glamorous relatives.
Quite apart from the social attractions, the job was extremely stimulating.
'It was,' recollected Eberhard Crain earlier this year, long after the idyll
had come to an end, 'a position that everyone would dream of'.
Petersen agreed: 'It was intellectually very interesting. We had a
first-rate management group; to start off with we had an excellent
relationship with the Prince and we had a tremendous amount of
entrepreneurial freedom. You don't get all this in many jobs.'
The managers set up a corporate-style structure for the group. They
established a holding company, of which they were the directors and the
Prince was the sole shareholder.
Their first task was to assess the value of the Prince's assets: he had a
vague idea they were worth about Dollars 3bn and was disappointed to find
that they were less than half of that.
Then, with the help of Andersen Consulting, they installed a management
information system. They divided the businesses into five divisions:
agriculture, forestry, industry, brewing and financial services. These were
further subdivided into some 60 profit centres.
Agriculture and forestry - the bulk of the empire - produced a yield on
assets of 1 per cent or less per year. The managers' task was to work the
rest of the assets as hard as possible.
They embarked on ambitious plans to franchise the Thurn und Taxis name in
the financial services areas and:
bought property in north America and Germany;
rationalised the largest industrial company in the portfolio - Doduco, a
loss-making electronics concern;
sold off Dollars 145m of farm land.
The net result was that the empire turned back into the black, making
profits of Dollars 7.5m and Dollars 6.4m in 1988 and 1989 respectively.
The strategy was based on the assumption that the Prince, 59 years old when
he recruited Petersen in 1986, would live for at least another 10 years.
However he grew ill and fell increasingly under the influence of his wife,
Princess Gloria.
The 'punk princess' was well known in the German popular press for the
extravagance of her life-style and her imaginative haircuts. The Prince had
married her in 1980 when she was just 20. It was only in the late 1980s that
she started to develop an interest in the business rather than party-going.
Relations between the managers and the Prince grew frosty early in 1990
after an article appeared in a German magazine accusing Petersen and his
team of gross mismanagement and manoeuvring themselves to take control of
the fortune when the Prince died.
Formally, the Prince stood by his employees, but the old trust and
confidence was gone and the managers' freedom to act was henceforth strictly
circumscribed. By the middle of the year, Petersen and Crain had left of
their own accord and shortly afterwards Levedag was fired.
For the managers, the saga did not end with their departure from the
Schloss, nor even with the Prince's death in December 1990. The Princess
attacked them in numerous press articles, one of which in September last
year alleged that they had systematically manipulated the Prince's accounts
to pay themselves big bonuses.
Petersen and his former colleagues hit back, suing both Gloria and a number
of publications, claiming a systematic attempt to destroy their professional
reputations. The Princess counterattacked by filing criminal charges against
the managers.
Late last month, the Princess quietly backed down: a statement issued in
Frankfurt said that the House of Thurn und Taxis had dropped its allegations
against the former managers.
Both sides abandoned the lawsuits launched at each other; Levedag, who was
sacked outright, obtained compensation and all the managers successfully won
payment of unpaid bonuses due under their contracts.
This attempt to subject a large family fortune to professional management
discipline has not been good either for the fortune or the managers.
While Petersen landed on his feet, taking up a post last year as managing
director of the Wasserstein Perella investment bank in Germany, Crain has
only recently found a new job with a French investment group in Frankfurt.
Levedag is believed to be on the brink of taking up a new post.
Meanwhile a distinctly press-shy Princess Gloria presides over a family
fortune which is believed to be shrinking at much the same rate as it was
before the ill-fated experiment with professional management.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The UK's forestry policy has left the country with a subsidised crop of
mature trees whose value is often so low that they cost more to cut down
than to sell, according to a report* published recently by the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF).
It suggests that new ways of valuing trees could lead to future generations
being left with forests which they want and need, rather than serried ranks
of densely planted, environmentally unfriendly conifers.
WWF says that wildlife hates densely planted conifer forests, which allow
little light to the forest floor, leaving no ground cover, no animals or
insects, and consequently no birds. Conifers can also make the soil acidic
and leave it unsuitable for growing anything but the same type of tree.
The UK Forestry Commission has already started trying to put a value on the
benefits of forestry apart from the value of the timber. It points out that
it is far from easy to evaluate such things as landscape conservation,
carbon fixing and job creation in rural areas.
There are now signs, WWF believes, that economic analyses of forestry
projects are attempting to describe what it calls 'the wider social
returns,' such as environment costs and benefits. Policy changes include the
replacement of tax incentives with targeted grants, as well as new planning
procedures.
Andrew Christie Miller, chairman of Timber Growers United Kingdom, the trade
organisation for private woodland owners, thinks the WWF report brings
together all the aspects of work being done to try to provide economic
justification for subsidised forestry.
While there are plenty of grants available in the UK, the level of planting
in the UK has dropped to the lowest level since the Second World War.
In the private sector in late 1980s, 25,000 hectares per annum were being
planted, but this has now slipped below 10,000 hectares per annum.

At next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the world community has an
historic opportunity to move forward in a spirit of global partnership to
meet the challenges that will define our common future.
Sadly, the agreements to be signed at this historic meeting are hollow
shells of the original proposals, with little assurance that there will be
any real change in policy or practice, and meagre hope that the
environmental crises they are intended to confront will be slowed.
Regrettably, it was the intransigence of the US negotiators that weakened
the accords.
For example, the climate change convention was to unite the world in efforts
to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal cause of global
warming, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, principally because of
President Bush's opposition to these targets and timetables, the treaty to
be signed contains only vague language and no specific goals.
This means that world leaders gathering in Rio must, even now, begin looking
beyond the Earth Summit, to build a new global consensus that will create
stronger agreements and real progress. We need to create a mechanism to
ensure that the parties to the climate convention will meet regularly to
strengthen their commitments in the light of scientific developments. We
also need to support calls for increased energy efficiency and for increased
reliance on renewable energy sources.
We must establish a strong and effective mechanism to carry forward the
agreements reached at the Earth Summit. I have suggested establishing a
Stewardship Council to deal with matters relating to the global environment,
just as the Security Council now deals with matters of war and peace. Or we
could establish a tradition of annual environmental summit meetings.
Heads of nations must commit themselves to improving overseas development
practices to ensure that the projects are sustainable. One of the best ways
of doing this is to increase the transparency of lending practices so that
local communities and non-governmental groups have the opportunity to
comment on proposals.
Working voluntarily, we must use every treaty and alliance, every tactic and
strategy, every plan and course of action to halt the destruction of the
environment and to preserve and nurture our ecological system.
What is needed is a plan - call it a Global Marshall Plan for the
environment - that combines large-scale, long-term, carefully targeted
financial aid to developing nations.
Some strategic goals are obvious. For example, world population should be
stabilised, with policies designed to create the conditions necessary for
the so-called demographic transition - the historical change from a dynamic
equilibrium of high birth rates and death rates to a stable equilibrium of
low birth rates and death rates. This change has taken place in most of the
industrial nations and in few of the developing nations.
We also need to develop environmentally appropriate technologies -
especially in energy, transportation, agriculture, construction and
manufacturing.
We must rethink the economic 'rules of the road' by which we measure the
impact of our decisions on the environment. We need to establish a system of
economic accounting that assigns appropriate values to the ecological
consequences of routine choices made by individuals and companies, and
macroeconomic choices by nations.
Governments need a new generation of agreements that will embody the
regulatory frameworks, enforcement mechanisms, incentives, and mutual
obligations necessary to make the overall plan a success. These agreements
must be sensitive to the vast differences of capability and need between
developed and developing nations.
Finally, what is needed is an ecological perspective that does not treat the
Earth as something separate from human civilisation. Looking at the whole
means looking at ourselves.
If we do not see that we are a powerful natural force like the winds and
tides, we cannot see how we threaten to push the Earth out of balance.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Inside Whitehall: A society now not so secret - Yesterday
the government cut secrecy at the heart of Whitehall, revealing the
membership of cabinet committees whose very existence was previously not
even acknowledged. The cloak is being removed from how decisions are made
and who makes them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIGHT was was shed on some of the darker recesses of Whitehall secrecy
yesterday, but Mr John Major's latest exercise in open government had an air
of studied understatement about it. Sir Robin Butler, secretary to the
cabinet and head of the Civil Service, who lifted a corner of the veil of
secrecy surrounding Whitehall, is not a man who is given to grand gestures.
The exercise, launched by Mr William Waldegrave in his capacity as
chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, was designed to illuminate the
instinctively secretive Whitehall establishment that Sir Robin runs for his
political masters. It was a partial success. The publication of details of
the cabinet committees at the heart of government - and of the detailed
instructions to ministers on how to operate the machinery - provided a
valuable insight into the way Britain is run. Yet, as Sir Robin was obliged
to acknowledge, the picture remains far from complete. For those
unaccustomed to the intricacies of Whitehall decision-making, the first
message of the documents is that very little of the business of government
is conducted at full meetings of the cabinet.
The weekly sessions on Thursdays rarely last more than 90 minutes. With
occasional exceptions, ministers report on their activities or float ideas
rather than become entangled with the minutiae of policy-making. Most
decisions are instead taken by much smaller groups of ministers - sometimes
within the framework of the cabinet committee system published yesterday,
and just as often in still smaller ad hoc groupings. They provide the
infrastructure to support the all-important doctrine of collective
responsibility: the unbreakable rule that once a decision has been taken it
must be publicly supported by all ministers, whatever their private views.
It was the official committee structure that Mr Waldegrave and Sir Robin
unveiled - the 16 standing committees and 10 sub-committees that have
authority to take decisions on behalf of the cabinet.
The four most important - on home, foreign, domestic and legislative affairs
 -were officially acknowledged by Mrs Thatcher. While the existence of the
others has long been an open secret, technically their activities have
remained secret.
Their membership confirms what has long been known about the Whitehall power
structure: for example, that the chancellor or chief secretary, and
frequently both, have places reserved on virtually every committee in their
roles as guardians of the public purse. The prime minister heads nine of the
main groups.
Those interested in personal power plays will notice that Mr Michael
Heseltine is well represented in his capacity as president of the board of
trade. He has secured also Mr Major's agreement to an upgraded ministerial
committee dealing with industrial issues. The prime minister has curbed Mr
Heseltine's ambitions, though, by giving the group a neutral chairman in the
person of Lord Wakeham and by including Mr Norman Lamont as its next most
senior member.
Lord Wakeham, the lord privy seal, lives up to his reputation as chief
political fixer with the chairmanship of several committees on which
departmental rivalries run deep. Mr Waldegrave's principal role as minister
for the Citizen's Charter has won him a place on all the important domestic
committees.
So in theory, the interested observer should be able to trace the main
decisions of government through the cabinet machinery. That machinery in
turn should guarantee each member ample scope to ensure that his or her
voice is heard before important decisions are reached. Unfortunately the
reality is not quite as simple. Much of the most sensitive business of
government is done not in the cabinet committee system but by smaller ad hoc
groups with interests in particular policy issues.
Sometimes those are established alongside the standing committees, gaining
the title 'Misc' or 'Gen'. On other occasions, such groupings can exist
outside any formal structure, limiting the capacity of most members of the
cabinet to influence important decisions.
In her second and third terms, Mrs Margaret Thatcher came to rely almost
exclusively on 'Misc' committees and ad hoc gatherings to buttress her
authority.
Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, only once managed to secure a broad
ministerial discussion on the European monetary system. The issue eventually
tore Mrs Thatcher's government apart, but it never reached full cabinet.
Questions of procedure make clear that a senior minister's ability to force
full cabinet discussion of any particular issue is tightly circumscribed.
Except in the case of a battle with the Treasury over funding, such a
request must first win the support of the relevant committee chairman. Even
then, the prime minister can reject it.
Yesterday's documents make no reference to the role of Mr Richard Ryder, the
chief whip, who has ex-officio membership of all the main groups. Mr Ryder,
the prime minister's agent in much of the behind-the-scenes bargaining
between ministers, wields considerable but officially unacknowledged
influence across Whitehall. Mr Waldegrave insisted yesterday that Mr Major's
decision to publish the details signalled his determination to use the
formal committee system.
However, senior colleagues say he will find it difficult to avoid the
attractions of the ad hoc approach to settle the competing claims of
Whitehall departments. In such circumstances, the standing committee might
become little more than a mailing list for high-level documents. Sir Robin
acknowledged that open government extends only so far. The cabinet office
will periodically update the list of committees to include details of ad hoc
groups, but will not announce their establishment at the time. Without any
apparent hint of irony, Sir Robin said such announcements might be
'misleading'.
In fact, he is anxious to ensure that outsiders cannot delve too deeply into
the process of decision-making. More particularly, he wishes to discourage
the appearance in public of differences of opinion between ministers.
Mr Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's press secretary, made clear yesterday
that he would not help journalists to track decision-making through the
Whitehall machine by revealing when the committees meet. In terms of open
government, Mr Major has so far shone a torch rather than a searchlight into
Whitehall. But at least there is some light.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Inside Whitehall: Lobbyists welcome cabinet disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S cabinet committee disclosures were widely welcomed as a sign of
greater openness.
Knowing how and by whom collective decisions are made is already the common
currency of those who make their living lobbying government, or whose
business depends on it.
Big organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry and the
Institute of Directors - and large companies with sophisticated lobbying and
public-relations sections - thought the move would make little practical
difference because much of the information was already available to them.
Mr Nigel Clarke, a director of GJW, a political consultancy, said that the
publication itself was of limited value. 'Anyone involved in this area
already knows these things exist,' he said, 'and it does not require the
mind of Solomon to work out who's on them.
None the less, Dr Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of
Directors, said: 'I welcome more open government because it means better
government.'
Political lobbyists agreed in hoping the disclosures represented a greater
readiness by the government to consult interested organisations.
Mr Peter Luff, Tory MP for Worcester and a consultant with the lobbying
company Good Relations, expressed a view shared by industry in welcoming the
move as 'demystifying' relations with government.
He thought it would have a salutary effect on lobbying companies. He said
some sold information that encouraged clients to believe they obtained
through 'conspiratorial' means, rather than relying on selling good advice
about how to make a persuasive case to government.
The reforms are likely to help the small-business sector, where expertise is
not as great, and where specialist lobbyists are sometimes brought in to
provide information that will now be readily available.
Mr Stephen Alambritis of the National Federation of Self-Employed and Small
Businesses said the disclosures would be helpful in indicating which
ministers were interested in certain subjects.
In general, though, he did not think the current pattern of getting policies
across would change much - small businesses, for example, would still be
channelled through the Department of Trade and Industry and the relevant
minister.
Businesses and the lobbyists agreed that it was more important for them to
know how to lobby effectively at an early stage, before a subject appeared
on any cabinet committee's agenda. That was more important than discovering
the identities of members of cabinet committees.
Mr Clarke described much lobbying as going over policy details with
middle-ranking departmental civil servants - 'where the decision starts'.
Both categories also agreed, however, that while it would be helpful to know
when cabinet committee meetings were taking place, so relevant points could
be made, they could see why the government had decided against it. That was
because of the danger that ministers could be swamped with too many
approaches by the lobbyists.
They had clearly come close to sharing a Whitehall view of the world before
yesterday's disclosures.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley boost for Maxwell MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs CAMPAIGNING on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners have been encouraged by
the prospect of early publication of the report into the affair by the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB).
Mr Richard Page and Mr Frank Field, on behalf of the all-party group of MPs
supporting the pensioners, had a 'constructive and cordial' meeting
yesterday with Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary.
They believe that pressure from Westminster has caused the government to
take a more active approach to the affair.
The two MPs were pleased that Mr Lilley undertook 'willingly' to pass on to
the Bank of England the concern expressed that the banks were not making
enough effort to identify assets, and their view that the recent comments of
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, had been unhelpful.
Mr Page said afterwards that they had had the impression that the government
expected to receive the SIB report within the next two to three weeks. They
expect it to be published, enabling decisions to be taken before deadline at
the end of next month when the next tranche of trusts have said they would
be unable to pay pensions.
The MPs told Mr Lilley that the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (Imro), felt it had not been given proper authority because of
the difficulties of marrying trust law with the financial services regime.
The meeting coincided with a claim by the Maxwell pensioners' group that
6,000 Maxwell pensioners stand to lose three quarters of their monthly
payments by September unless the government acts.
Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said the
government had an obligation to help pensioners because of maladministration
by government departments in their oversight of Mr Robert Maxwell's
activities. By June, 5,000 Maxwell company pensioners will lose half their
monthly pension payments and 240 members of one Leeds-based scheme are now
getting no payments whatsoever.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, emerged unscathed in the Commons
yesterday from a preliminary skirmish with one of the prominent Tory
backbench opponents of the bill giving effect to the Maastricht treaty on
European Union.
Mr Christopher Gill (C Ludlow) - one of the two dozen or so Tory
backbenchers expected to refuse to support the bill's second reading in the
Commons tomorrow night - called for ratification of the treaty to be delayed
until outstanding differences on a number of key policy issues had been
resolved.
He said the prime minister would never be in a stronger bargaining position
to secure assurances on immigration, the retention of border controls and
limiting Britain's contribution to the European Community Budget.
Mr Gill argued that all those issues and the controversy over the EC's
working time directive should be settled before the treaty was ratified.
The prime minister replied that Mr Gill had raised a number of important -
and in many ways, 'tendentious' - issues relating to the existing provisions
of the Treaty of Rome - which established the EC - and not directly to the
Maastricht treaty.
He assured the House: 'In all these matters we will fight to preserve
British interests up to, during and after ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.'
Another leading opponent of the bill, Mr Nigel Spearing (Lab Newham South),
also sought to delay its passage by arguing that it should not be debated
until the government had provided MPs with a consolidated version of the
Treaty of Rome that reflected the changes resulting from the Maastricht
treaty.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said the bill was perfectly in order. It
was for the House to decide whether or not it should be passed.
THE US Defence Department stated yesterday it considered the case 'closed',
Jurek Martin writes from Washington.
Mr Pete Williams, the spokesman, said: 'For our part, the US government has
gone to extraordinary lengths to co-operate with the British investigation.'
He insisted that what happened was an accident, stemming from 'a difference
of interpretation' in communications between US pilots and British troops.
But two US Congressmen said yesterday they had directed the House armed
services investigations subcommittee to open a preliminary inquiry into the
deaths of the nine British soldiers.
'We are not sure how much we can do to resolve the discrepancies between the
American and British accounts of the events,' said Representative Nicholas
Mavroules, a Democrat from Massachusetts who chairs the subcommittee.
Mr Mavroules said that if there was a 'reasonable chance' of answering
questions about the incident, the subcommittee could conduct a full inquiry.

SENIOR civil servants throughout Whitehall had been informally reminded that
any prospective departmental moves should take account of the 'attractive
options' that might be on offer in Docklands, Downing Street said yesterday.
In line for a move to Docklands are the departments of the environment and
transport, whose Marsham Street offices in Westminster are due to be
demolished next year.
Ministers continue to emphasise that any move to Docklands would have to be
made on value for money grounds and not as a 'bail-out' for troubled Canary
Wharf developer Olympia &amp; York.

THE Liberal Democrats yesterday called on Mr John Major to apply 'all his

in Rio de Janeiro, Ralph Atkins writes.
The party also launched a cross-party appeal for a Commons debate
beforehand.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said preparatory negotiations for the summit
had gone in the wrong direction. He proposed stabilising carbon dioxide
emissions at 1990 levels by 1995, increasing resources for family planning
in developing countries and 'Red Cross' style immunity for those engaged in
environmental clean-up operations.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott wins Oscarin battle over
lunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF AN ability to raise the spirits of party activists is the chief goal for
Labour's leadership candidates, Mr John Prescott should abandon his campaign
to be deputy leader and run for the top job.
Yesterday, the Manufacturing Science and Finance union welcomed all four
leadership contenders to address its annual conference in Bournemouth and,
to the surprise of some, it was the shadow transport secretary who went home
with the Oscar.
Yet the day was also replete with ironies. This, after all, was the judgment
of the largely leftwing delegates of a union representing thousands of
Tory-voting white-collar workers, while the affluent south coast resort town
appeared wholly oblivious of the passionate debate on the future of
socialism taking part in its midst.
Each candidate played his or her part in character. Mrs Margaret Beckett
used her 15-minute address to play the gender card, making the case for a
fresh appeal to women voters. Mr Bryan Gould, an MSF member, sold himself as
the 'ideas candidate' but was in danger of losing his audience in a
sophisticated argument about devaluation, referring to the gold standard and
sterling M3.
Battling against the effects of lunch on the 300-odd delegates, Mr John
Smith's 18-page speech was respectfully if unspectacularly received. And
before Mr Prescott appeared, it was widely held that Mr Gould was the narrow
points victor.
However, that was not to reckon with the pugnacious MP for Hull. Squinting,
ad-libbing and at times tripping over his text, he none the less injected
the right note of indignant exasperation that prompted repeated bursts of
applause.
Mr Prescott's basic thesis remained unchanged. What the party needed, he
said, was someone to grab it by the scruff of the neck and shake up its
organisation.
With characteristic plain speaking, he went on to bash the Tories and the
press, with a sideswipe at the party leadership for good measure.
'There is much talk of the need for new radicalism and new vision in the
Labour party - not that I resist new ideas - but I'm firmly convinced that,
adequately presented, our historic values remain as true today as ever.'
Where the other candidates won barely 30 seconds of respectful sedentary
applause, Mr Prescott ended with a full minute of standing ovation.
It was a triumph of a kind. But as a long-time champion of electoral reform
reflected, in the Pavilion Theatre's upper circle: 'Under proportional
representation, he could be leader of that sort of party and bring a lot of
union influence to bear . . . in opposition.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM rules out protest in 'friendly
fire' deaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT signalled yesterday that it would take no action against the
US pilots involved in the deaths of nine UK soldiers killed by 'friendly
fire' in the Gulf war.
Mr John Major indicated to MPs that he did not believe the incident
justified a protest to Washington over its role in protecting of the pilots.
While lessons had to be learnt, he said, 'I hope we won't lose sight of the
fact that those were American pilots risking their lives alongside our
troops in a battle against a common enemy and to liberate Kuwait.'
Speaking after an Oxford inquest ruled on Monday that the nine were
'unlawfully killed', the prime minister faced pressure by Mr Neil Kinnock,
the Labour leader, to use his authority to ensure the victims' families had
the full truth. Mr Major replied: 'I'm not in a position to provide any more
information.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, later admitted that in the immediate
aftermath of the Gulf war, 'there was some confusion and uncertainty about
what exactly happened'. While the war had ended in February, the US Marine
Corps had not answered points raised in the Ministry of Defence inquiry
until July 10, he said.
However, Ministry of Defence officials said that all available information
was now in the hands of the victims' families.
Mr Rifkind said the UK was working closely with its allies to ensure that in
future, 'the risk of troops firing on their comrades is minimised'.
Meanwhile, Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, has asked
to see all the relevant documents held by the Oxford coroner and the MoD on
the incident.
The DPP's office said yesterday that Mrs Mills would consider the papers in
detail to see whether there was sufficient evidence to bring criminal
charges against the two US pilots allegedly responsible.
Her office repeated though, that there was no power to prosecute a foreign
national in England and Wales for any offence of murder or manslaughter
allegedly committed abroad.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Flat-rate pension rebates 'too costly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX REBATES to encourage young people to opt out of the state
earnings-related pensions scheme (Serps) should be reduced and larger
rebates offered to older people, according to the Institute for Fiscal
Studies.
The institute concludes in a study of financial arrangements for personal
pensions that the present system of flat-rate tax rebates costs the
government more in forgone revenue than it can ever save on social security
payments.
'There is no particular reason to favour younger workers over older,' the
institute concludes.
By the time an individual has reached the late 40s, it is no longer
advantageous to hold a personal pension and policyholders would be well
advised to opt back into Serps, says the institute. The age at which the
advantage disappears depends on whether the personal-pension holder is male
or female and on the assumptions of investment returns earned on
contributions.
The government has ruled out age-related rebates, arguing that they would
not provide enough incentives for young people to opt out of the system and
that they would be too confusing. Much of the life assurance industry, which
markets personal-pension plans, opposes any move to age-related rebates.
The government has said it will offer additional incentive payments only to
personal-pension holders over 30 from April next year. The rebate will still
be insufficient to discourage older people from rejoining the state scheme,
the study says.
Pension scheme sponsors need to increase contributions as members of schemes
grow older, the institute says. Thus lower contributions are needed for
younger members and higher ones for older members. The government's present
flat-rate rebates allow young people to buy a more generous personal pension
plan than they could achieve by remaining in Serps, but the contribution is
too small for older people to maintain personal pensions.
The institute also notes that transaction costs on personal pensions can
significantly reduce returns to policyholders. The institute concludes that
between a third and a fifth of contributions to a scheme can be eaten up in
charges.

FT  20 MAY 92 / 'The prime minister must be the final judge': Code of
conduct for members of the government Warning on conflicts between private
investments and public duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day issued the guidelines on conduct that are given to
each minister on taking office. On investments, the document urges ministers
to 'order their affairs so that no conflict arises or is thought to arise
between their private interests and their public duties'. Where there is
doubt about an interest, 'it will almost always be better to relinquish or
dispose of the interest, but in such cases the prime minister must be the
final judge'.
The document shows that Westminster and the City are miles apart in their
approach to handling the many potential conflicts of interest that arise
between private investments and public duties.
City institutions generally take a permissive attitude: directors and other
senior staff are allowed to own shares in companies they advise, for
instance. Yet any dealings have to be disclosed internally - and many houses
operate a policy of allowing staff to trade only with prior approval from a
central compliance officer.
Ministers are subjected to one general rule - that they avoid all conflicts
of interest. Investments that could give rise to conflicts, or perception of
conflicts, should be disposed of. Such guidance looks idealistic. 'It would
be nice if you could see all conflicts in advance,' says Mr Colin Condron,
compliance officer at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank.
He suggested that one route for ministers might be to ban investments in
equities, or restrict them to investment trusts. Alternatively, ministers
could be required to put their shares into 'blind' trusts, under which they
are not given any information about their investments - one of the
suggestions in the document for ministers who have a wide range of
investments.
Even that may not save ministers from embarrassment: 2 1/2 years ago, Mr
Cecil Parkinson, then transport secretary, was forced to issue a denial that
he had been involved in insider dealing after share trans-actions undertaken
by brokers WI Carr in the name of his nominee account.
The official guidelines to ministers say they should declare to colleagues
any private interest if they have to discuss public business in any way
affecting it. They should also 'remain entirely detached from consideration
of that business'.
There is no formal restriction - other than the normal rules on MPs'
interests, on former ministers taking up posts or other private-sector
interests - 'although they should naturally avoid any course which would
reflect adversely on their or the government's reputation for integrity or
the confidentiality of its proceedings'. On taking up office, the document
says, ministers should give up any other public appointment.
Directorships: Ministers must resign all directorships when they take up
office, the document says. The exceptions are directorships in private
companies established in connection with private family estates  - and
charitable organisations, unless there is a possible conflict of interest.
Partners in professional firms should cease any role in day-to-day
management of the firm's affairs, but need not dissolve their partnership or
allow their annual practising certificate to lapse. 'It is not possible to
lay down precise rules applicable to every case,' the document says.
'Ministers in doubt about their personal position should consult the prime
minister.'
Investments: Ministers cannot be expected to dispose of all investments. But
if a minister holds a controlling interest in any company, the
considerations are similar to those governing the holding of directorships.
The document points out that an investment in concerns closely associated
with a minister's department may create the danger of an actual or apparent
conflict of interest arising from exercise of powers or other influence in a
way that affects the value of the investment or from dealings where there
may be reasonable suspicion that the minister has special knowledge.
Ministers called upon to exercise any power or discretion or other influence
that could give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest should
delegate to another minister, and should take no part in the preparation or
reaching of any relevant decisions.
Ministers are bound by the provisions of the Companies Securities (Insider
Dealing) Act 1985 in relation to the use or transmission of unpublished
price-sensitive information obtained by virtue of their ministerial office.
Ministers are also urged to avoid speculative investments about which they
have, or may be thought to have, early or confidential information likely to
affect the price.
Ministers 'will wish to consider whether or not investments of their (minor)
children and their spouse should be treated similarly to their own'. The
document stresses that it is for ministers to judge what action they need to
take in respect of investments, but they should record any action in a
minute to the permanent secretary of the department.
Membership of Lloyd's: The prime minister, the chancellor of the exchequer,
the trade and industry secretary - and DTI and Treasury ministers
responsible for matters relating to Lloyd's - should not be underwriting
members of Lloyd's.
Any such minister who has been an underwriting member should not exercise
statutory powers affecting Lloyd's - or any syndicates, brokers or agents
with which he or she is connected - until all syndicate years for which he
or she was an underwriting member have been closed or until he or she has
reinsured all liabilities in such a way that he or she has no further
interest in their performance.
A law officer who is an underwriting member of Lloyd's, or who still has
open syndicate commitments in respect of past membership, should not tender
advice on the formulation, application or enforcement of legislation
relating to Lloyd's.
It is 'inappropriate' for other ministers who are members of Lloyd's to take
an active part in the management of the affairs of syndicates of which they
are members.
Ministers who are Lloyd's Names may be required to suspend underwriting
risks in any area in which their departments have responsibility.
Every minister is required on appointment to a first or subsequent
ministerial office to obtain the prime minister's permission before
continuing a connection with Lloyd's, however nominal. Any minister wishing
to establish any such connection during his term of appointment should
likewise obtain the prime minister's permission to do so. The secretary of
the cabinet is required to keep a list of ministers who are members of
Lloyd's.
Cabinet business: Cabinet and ministerial-committee business is defined as
consisting mainly of matters 'which significantly engage the collective
responsibility of the government because they raise major issues of policy
or because they are of critical importance to the public' and questions on
which there is an unresolved argument between departments.
Chairmen of ministerial committees are urged to limit references to the
cabinet. The only automatic right of appeal is if Treasury ministers are
unwilling to accept expenditure as a charge on the reserve. The document
says the internal process through which a decision has been made should not
be disclosed. Decisions reached by the cabinet or ministerial committees are
binding on all members of the government. Ministers and the law officers: It
will 'normally be appropriate to consult the law officers' in cases where:
The legal consequences of action by the government might have important
repercussions in the foreign, European Community or domestic field.
A departmental legal adviser is in doubt concerning the legality,
constitutional propriety or vires of proposed legislation or administrative
action.
There is a particular legal difficulty that may raise political aspects of
policy.
Two or more departments disagree on legal questions.
By convention, written opinions of the law officers, unlike other
ministerial papers, are generally made available to succeeding
administrations. Opinions of or advice from the law officers must not be
disclosed outside government without their authority.
Accountability: Each minister is responsible to parliament for the conduct
of his or her department.
Public appointments: In considering candidates for public appointments,
ministers should pay particular attention to securing, on merit, proper
representation of women and members of ethnic minorities on public bodies.
Acceptance of gifts and services: It is 'a well established and recognised
rule' that no minister should accept gifts or services from anyone that
would, or might appear to, place him or her under an obligation. The same
principle applies if gifts etc are offered to a member of their family.

Commanding presence: Lieutenant General Sir John Wilsey, commanding officer
of British forces in Northern Ireland, visited troops outside Coalisland,
County Tyrone, yesterday after soldiers and youths clashed on Sunday. He
refused to comment on demands by the Dublin government for the withdrawal of
the Parachute Regiment from the province.
The call by Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign affairs minister, followed
several days of unrest in the town, culminating in the confrontation on
Sunday when three civilians were shot.
Paratroopers were kept off the town's streets yesterday after protests over
the soldiers' behaviour. Lt Gen Wilsey spoke to troops outside the town as
metal detectors were used to find a machinegun stolen during the unrest.

FT  20 MAY 92 / RPI housing factor review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has ordered a review of the way housing costs are treated in
the retail prices index, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced
yesterday.
In a parliamentary written answer, he disclosed that the government was
referring the treatment of owner occupiers' housing costs to the retail
prices index advisory committee, the body that advises the chancellor on the
method of construction and compilation of the RPI, the UK's main index of
inflation.
The move follows widespread criticism inside and outside parliament of the
method of measuring the cost of housing, which is based on mortgage interest
payments.
A particular complaint has been the way the method makes the RPI rise in
response to higher interest rates when those are introduced to control
inflation.
That has knock-on consequences for wage negotiations and other costs.
The inclusion of mortgage interest payments in the RPI has also been
criticised because they involve a large element of investment and because
they can be seen as measuring the cost of credit, while no other type of
credit charge is included in the index.
Only Britain and the Republic of Ireland among European Community member
states include mortgage interest payments in their main inflation measures.
Six EC countries make no allowance for owner occupier costs.
The chancellor's advisory committee is already investigating how the council
tax, holiday spending and new cars should be treated in the RPI.

A LANDSCAPE painting by the Mexican artist Diego Rivera, 'Paisaje de
Toledo', giving a Cubist impression of the countryside around Toledo in
Spain, sold for Dollars 1.21m (Pounds 661,202) at Christie's in New York on
Monday night. It was bought by a Mexican dealer and reflects the strong
current demand for Mexican art.
The auction totalled Dollars 7.75m and was 24 per cent unsold. 'The
Temptation of St Anthony', a Surrealist work by Leonora Carrington, made
Dollars 440,000, an auction record for the artist.
Christie's sales of modern illustrated books and 20th-century decorative
arts in Geneva on Monday were less successful, with both nearly 50 per cent
unsold. The top price was the Pounds 37,218 paid for an autographed
manuscript by Jean Cocteau, Cherchez Apollon, illustrated with three
sketches.
Sotheby's also had difficulties, this time with tribal art in New York. The
most important lot, a rare Benin bronze head of a leopard, dating from the
17th century and estimated as worth as much as Dollars 500,000, was unsold.
There was little demand for medium-quality works, but an object from New
Guinea, a Middle Sepik River suspension hook, sold for Dollars 159,000, at
the top of its target. The auction brought in Dollars 1m, with 52 per cent
unsold.
Silver remains a healthy market and in Geneva an auction of European silver
totalled Pounds 2.5m and was more than 87 per cent sold. A French silver
gilt toilet service made by Francois-Daniel Imlin in Strasbourg in 1825 for
Stephanie, Grand Duchess of Baden, a protegee of Napoleon, sold for Pounds
228,461. A French silver soup tureen and cover, made by Jean-Baptiste de
Lens in Paris in 1736, far exceeded its forecast at Pounds 191,744.

THE public sector borrowing requirement for April was Pounds 3.6bn,
including privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.6bn. That is the biggest April
deficit since 1987.
The figure was slightly lower than expected but economists warned that
Britain was still heading for a record deficit in fiscal 1992-93. Most
expect the PSBR in the new financial year - which started last month - to
reach Pounds 30bn.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Working by ethnic groups surveyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELF-EMPLOYMENT is far higher among some ethnic minorities in Britain than
among white people, accounting for 22 per cent of the Pakistani and
Bangladeshi communities, according to the Department of Employment. The rate
for white people is 13 per cent.
However, ethnic minorities have an overall rate of self-employment of 16 per
cent, with the West Indian community down at only 7 per cent.
Self-employed members of ethnic minorities are more likely to create jobs
for others, with 40 per cent having employees, compared with 31 per cent of
whites.
The figures are from the department's Labour Market Quarterly Report,
published yesterday by the Sheffield-based Skills and Enterprise Network.
The report says a difference is also emerging in self- employment patterns
between men and women.
There were 3.1m self-employed people last year, compared with 1.9m in 1979 -
an increase of 65 per cent; but the number of self-employed women rose by
109 per cent, double the rate of increase for men.
The reports says that in the 10 years from 1981 the number of self-employed
women who employed others rose by 49 per cent, or 3 1/2 times the 14 per
cent rate achieved by men.
The idea that a large proportion of the self-employed are unskilled jobbing
builders or labourers is fading.
In 1981 nearly two fifths of those who were self-employed had no
qualifications, but that had fallen to just over a quarter by last year  -
and that was a proportion of a much bigger total.
However, the proportion with qualifications at degree level rose only
slightly, from 10.5 per cent to 11.3 per cent.
The report draws a distinction between self-employment and owner-management
of a limited company, where directors are classed by the Inland Revenue as
employees. It is therefore difficult to estimate how many small businesses
there are, although the number is put at 3m.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Acquisitions steady in first quarter but total value falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS in the UK remained steady in the first quarter of this year but
the value of transactions fell.
There were 124 transactions with an estimated total value of Pounds 2.2bn in
the first quarter of 1992, according to figures released yesterday by the
Central Statistical Office.
The total value of initial payments on acquisitions of UK industrial and
commercial companies was down Pounds 2.1bn on the last quarter of 1991, when
there were 130 transactions, and down Pounds 11.1bn from the 1989 peak.
Independent companies were involved in 72 of the sales, and subsidiaries in
52. There were no mergers.
Thirty transactions were valued at more than Pounds 10m and 49 at less than
Pounds 1m. The largest were the acquisition of Steetley by Redland, valued
at Pounds 624m, the sale of IEP (Automotive) to Inchcape Overseas for Pounds
363m, and Bowater's purchase of DRG for Pounds 201m.
Cash expenditure accounted for 58 per cent of the total, ordinary shares for
41 per cent, and fixed-interest securities for the remaining 1 per cent.
Cash has comprised more than half of expenditure in every quarter since the
stock market crash of October 1987. The figures omit cross-border
acquisitions.
Shareholders of quoted companies in the east Midlands have fared better over
the past year than the companies themselves, according to an analysis
published yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
The analysis covered the published results of 74 companies, and showed that
while, on average, pre-tax profits fell 5.1 per cent and earnings
attributable to shareholders fell 19 per cent, shareholders received a 17
per cent increase in dividends.
KPMG says 11,500 people have lost their jobs in the region in the past year.
Turnover of the companies in the survey totalled more than Pounds 19bn, and
was 2 per cent higher than in 1990-91.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Bank notes optimism over recovery: The Quarterly Bulletin
cautions that the revival is likely to be slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTIOUS optimism is back in fashion in Threadneedle Street.
The Bank of England in its latest quarterly bulletin says: 'The prospects
for recovery now appear better than for some time.' It warns, though, that
prospects are 'by no means uniform throughout the economy, and the pace of
recovery is likely to be slow, depending on the course of the world economy
and the impact of domestic and international financial fragility'.
Although the Bank believes output in Britain fell slightly in the first
quarter, it has taken heart from a recent recovery of business and consumer
confidence and the better mood of financial markets since the election.
Together with the May 5 cut in bank base rates to 10 per cent from 10.5 per
cent, 'these developments are encouraging and herald the prospect of an end
to recession,' it says. But the report also makes clear that much remains to
be done if the UK is to have as successful an economy as many of its rivals
abroad.
For that reason, the Bank lays great emphasis on Britain's fulfilling the
convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union
by 1996, when the European Community is due to discuss the possible move to
the third and final stage of Emu.
The Bank expects the present counter-inflationary stance will enable the UK
to meet the Maastricht terms on inflation and interest rates, but it has
doubts about the government's capacity to bring the ratio of the general
government deficit to the GDP from about 5 per cent at present to the
Maastricht level of below 3 per cent by the 1995-96 fiscal year.
The ratio of government debt to national income is likely to rise until
1995-96, which the Bank says would be the longest such rise for about 40
years. Achieving the 3 per cent ratio 'will require firm control of public
expenditure'. The government should therefore set 'a credible medium-term
target for public spending and borrowing'.
The Bank also urges greater efforts to lower inflation. It warns that direct
comparisons of consumer price trends between the UK and its EC partners can
be too flattering.
It says that there is 'no room for complacency' over earnings trends, even
though average earnings growth has moved more into convergence with that in
the UK's partners in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
'Continued downward pressure on costs will be essential', especially if
Britain is to make the most of export opportunities. Here, too, there is
some additional cause for worry. Strong exports helped to support output
through much of the recession, but weakness in overseas markets is 'now
contributing to the uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of
recovery' in Britain.
The pace of recovery will depend far more on progress in easing personal and
corporate debt burdens and developments in the property market.
The Bank notes that the fall in interest rates from 15 per cent in October
1990 'has not yet significantly strengthened confidence.' The personal
sector continued to increase its savings in the first quarter while its
gross income gearing ratio - the measure of households' gross interest
payments as a percentage of disposable income - was still high at 13 per
cent at the end of 1991 compared with its 1990 peak of 14 per cent.
The Bank suggests that falling house prices were one factor explaining the
public's muted response to lower interest rates. House repossessions were
another concern.
The commercial property market is also likely to remain depressed as
premises are completed and add to existing excess supply. The Bank notes
that office rents fell by more than a fifth up to the end of 1991, while one
estimate puts the drop in rental values for all properties in the City of
London at 38.9 per cent last year.
Corporate defaults have caused the banks greatly to increase their
provisions against bad debts. But the Bank says risk asset ratios remain
well above internationally agreed standards and there is no sign that bad
debts are causing banks to curb their lending.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Long-term jobless total rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people unemployed for more than one year rose by 94,000 in the
quarter to April to reach 841,000, the highest since October 1988. The
286,000 increase since April last year is the biggest yearly rise since
1982.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, regretted the increase but
pointed out that long-term unemployment was still only two thirds the level
it was five years ago. She also said that the number of very-long-term
unemployed, people unemployed for more than five years, was at the lowest
level since January 1985.
All regions suffered an increase in long-term unemployment with the largest
percentage increases in south Wales, the south-east - including London - and
East Anglia. Among those aged 18 to 24, the figure has risen 168,300, the
highest level since April 1988.
The Unemployment Unit, a lobby group, said the long-term unemployed were
becoming a larger proportion of the unemployed, rising from 25 per cent to
31 per cent in the past year.
The unit also pointed to the fact that the main Department of Employment
training schemes do not cater for the long-term unemployed. Employment
Training, for unemployed adults, concentrates on those unemployed for
between six months and one year.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour employment spokesman, said: 'We are storing up a
legacy of bitterness, discontent and frustration that is damaging to social
cohesion.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Output rise fuels hopes of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that the UK economy is on the verge of recovery was fuelled
yesterday by news that manufacturing output rose in the first quarter of the
year.
The increase of 0.3 per cent over the preceding quarter in the three months
to the end of March was the first three-monthly rise in output since the
recession began. It followed six successive quarterly declines.
The figures, from the Central Statistical Office, gave rise to optimism
among economists, but they said it was still too early to pronounce the
recession over.
In spite of the quarterly rise, and two successive monthly rises,
manufacturing output remained 2 per cent below levels of a year ago and 7.5
per cent below the high point recorded in the second quarter of 1990.
On a monthly basis, manufacturing output rose by 0.2 per cent in March after
a 1.1 per cent increase in February.
Overall industrial output - manufacturing plus energy - fell by 1 per cent
in the first three months of the year compared with the previous three-month
period.
That was mainly due to a big drop in energy output, which fell by 4.3 per
cent in the first quarter.
The Treasury said economic growth would become firmly established this year.
'Today's economic figures suggest the fall in manufacturing output may have
ended and growth will become firmly established during 1992,' it said.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said economic
prospects for the summer and autumn remained weak.
Four of the seven components in manufacturing showed an upturn in the first
quarter.
Output of the 'other manufacturing' sector, which covers paper, printing and
publishing, rose by 1.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter and
output of metals rose by 1.1 per cent. Production of food, drink and tobacco
rose by 1 per cent.
There was a small decline in engineering output, although on a monthly basis
output in the sector has risen for two successive months. Within
engineering, car production rose by 4 per cent compared with the previous
quarter.
Chemicals was the only sector to show a big improvement in output compared
with a year ago. Output grew by 5.3 per cent in the three months to the end
of March compared with the same period a year ago. The CSO said that was
almost entirely attributable to the strong performance of the
pharmaceuticals industry.
Output of the consumer goods industries rose 1.3 per cent in the first
quarter compared with the previous three months, with the highest rise in
the sector coming from cars.
Production of investment goods, considered a lagging indicator, fell by 1.5
per cent in the first quarter and intermediate goods by 2 per cent.
Economists agreed Friday's first-quarter gross domestic product would still
be negative in spite of yesterday's manufacturing output figures, because of
the fall in energy and water supply.

THE Folkestone-Boulogne cross-Channel ferry route, closed by Sealink Stena
Line at the end of last year, is to be reopened to freight traffic in mid
June by a new shipping company, Opale Ferries.
The company, formed by a group of mainly French investors led by the
Boulogne Chamber of Commerce, has chartered a Canadian freight ferry with
capacity for 50 lorries.
Opale believes there is enough demand among long-established users of
Boulogne to justify the service in spite of competition from the Channel
tunnel.
Passenger services were restored to the route last month through
Hoverspeed's SeaCat catamaran service.
North Sea Ferries has ordered two Pounds 31m freight ferries for its
Hull-Rotterdam route. Associated British Ports, which owns the port of Hull,
is to build an Pounds 11m roll-on roll-off terminal to serve them.

FT  20 MAY 92 / IT sector warns of skills shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK faces a shortage of information technology skills which might lead to
an exodus of computer software and service companies, according to leading
IT companies.
Mr Paul Aspin, southern region industrial business manager for International
Business Machines, said: 'Companies can now base themselves wherever in the
world the relevant IT skills are, and use international networks to transmit
data from there.'
Mr Aspin, who is also a board director of West London Training and
Enterprise Council, warned that unless the relevant skills were developed,
the IT industry would move to continental Europe and elsewhere.
Investment in IT training per person in the UK is half that in Japan,
according to Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive of ICL, the
computer group.
Lack of training by companies has meant that people who have the skills are
poached by companies at increasingly higher pay levels.
Dr Phil Blackburn, chief executive of the West London Tec, said: 'Short-term
recruitment ends up eating up funds that would be more effectively allocated
to long-term training.'
The Tec yesterday launched the IT Skills Forum, for which it has targeted
Pounds 1m to be spent on joint projects with members of the forum, such as
IBM, ICL and British Airways, to ensure that skills are developed.
As part of its programme, it is conducting a skills survey to track the
emerging skills needed by users.
The first phase of the survey has disclosed that 90 per cent of IT users
have no data processing or IT department responsible for transmitting
skills. The survey also reveals that most people who learn to use computers
do so by sitting next to someone with experience.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Jaguar reveals 2-stroke project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the UK luxury carmaker, has developed a prototype two-stroke engine
which might enter production in the next decade.
The surprise disclosure of the project represents a pioneering step among
European luxury carmakers. Several of the leading volume carmakers are
developing two-stroke engines for small cars.
Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, said yesterday that development of
the compact and lightweight V6 engine was the result of a 4 1/2 -year
research programme. Its engineers have worked with Orbital Engine of
Australia, the company that leads the development of two-stroke technology,
and with Queen's University, Belfast.
Mr Ron Lee, Jaguar manager of engine development, said the prototype
3.2-litre V6 was 40 per cent lighter than a comparable 12-cylinder engine
but could give the same output.
The company's present engine ranges comprise a 5.3-litre V12 and 4.0-litre
and 3.2-litre six-cylinder engines.
It is developing a V8 engine range, codenamed AJ26, which is planned for
launch in 1996. Jaguar is expected to decide this summer whether the new
engine will be made at one of its existing Midlands sites or at a Ford
engine plant.
Jaguar said that the next stage in the two-stroke engine project would be a
full-scale development programme in Australia with Orbital.
The company said it aimed to produce a 350 brake horsepower demonstrator
engine in the next two years. Jaguar's work has included the performance
testing of a three-cylinder development engine.
According to the company, two-stroke engines might offer significant
benefits to luxury carmakers because they would be substantially lighter and

FT  20 MAY 92 / EC urged to free energy market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URGENT action is required to quicken the pace of energy liberalisation
throughout Europe, Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday.
Mr Eggar said he would press for the quick introduction of a free energy
market when he meets European Community energy ministers in Brussels
tomorrow. He was speaking at a conference in London organised by the
Confederation of British Industry and the Confederation of Norwegian
Business and Industry.
His comments suggested that energy liberalisation might be a theme when the
UK takes over the EC presidency in July. The UK leads the way in
deregulation of electricity and gas industries, but may face strong
opposition in pushing for greater liberalisation from countries such as
France and the Netherlands.
Mr Eggar said industry and 350m consumers across Europe would have
'everything to gain' from cheaper gas and electricity, with only a handful
of vested interests likely to be losers. He suggested there was a 'striking
contradiction at the heart of Europe'.
'It is quite extraordinary that we have been spending so much time making
sure that goods can cross frontiers but we apparently find it impossible for
gas and electricity to flow across frontiers.'
He said significant disparities still existed between electricity and gas
prices in different European countries. He also warned that European
industry might find it impossible to compete with the rest of the world
unless energy prices fell, as they were in the liberalised markets of the US
and Japan.
Mr Eggar said arguments that electricity and gas were natural monopolies,
and that only monopolies had sufficient economic security to undertake large
investment programmes required by energy projects, had been proved wrong by
the liberalised UK electricity market, and the gas market in the US.
He also countered claims by opponents of energy liberalisation that it would
require a 'huge centralised regulatory bureaucracy'. Regulation could be
left to member countries operating within an agreed framework.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday maintained its opposition to legally binding European
Community rates of value added tax, delaying a decision on the issue until
next month at the earliest.
EC ministers were unable to agree on a series of directives enshrining last
June's political agreement on indirect tax and excise rates.
The UK sees no need for legislation that would set a minimum standard VAT
rate of 15 per cent, and has specific difficulties in agreeing directives on
harmonised alcohol and tobacco duties.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor - probably the only person who can sanction
a change in the British stance - left Brussels before yesterday's debate on
indirect tax.
Ministers also postponed a decision on the capital adequacy directive, which
would harmonise prudential standards for banks and investment firms. The
Portuguese presidency hopes for agreement at next month's meeting of
ministers.
The Advertising Association, which represents 26 leading advertising trade
bodies, today steps up its lobbying of the government, MPs and members of
the European parliament for further and wider deregulation within the EC.

FT  20 MAY 92 / BBC offers rise below inflation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BBC HAS angered unions by offering more than 25,000 staff an annual pay
rise below the current rate of inflation.
The corporation's offer for the year from the beginning of August is 3.7 per
cent, with a guarantee that nobody will receive a rise worth less than
Pounds 300. There is also a Pounds 75 increase in the London allowance,
bringing it to Pounds 2,190. The deal would cost Pounds 21.5m a year on the
BBC's pay bill of Pounds 590m.
The pay offer, which applies to members of the Bectu broadcasting union, the
NUJ journalists' union and the AEEU electricians' union, comes on the eve of
a BBC governors and top management conference to consider the corporation's
future role.
Bectu, which represents about 14,000 BBC staff, asked for 3 percentage
points more than inflation - at present 4.3 per cent - and a minimum salary
of Pounds 7,500. Mr Neil Fraser, head of BBC Radio Scotland, is leaving the
corporation after 24 years 'to pursue other programme interests', it was
announced yesterday.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Channel 5 bidding row returns to High Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL battle between Five TV and TV-am over their planned bids for the
Channel 5 franchise returns to the High Court today amid considerable
bitterness.
Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, believes the integrity of the breakfast
television company has been tarnished and is determined to pursue the issue
for as long as it takes to clear the company's name.
On May 5, Five TV issued a writ against TV-am, which is leading a consortium
called The Entertainment Channel, for alleged breach of contract. Five TV,
whose shareholders include Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto,
said TV-am had signed a confidentiality and exclusivity deal preventing it
from bidding for Channel 5 with anyone else.
Five TV was horrified when TV-am signed an agreement to bid for the
franchise in a consortium including Time Warner, the international media
company, and Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group. It meant that a rival
was in possession of most of Five TV's confidential plans.
Mr Gyngell emphasised that Mr Stratis Zographos, his finance director, had
signed what he took to be a normal confidentiality agreement and had not
noticed a line blocking any investment in a rival Channel 5 bidder.
Mr Gyngell has denounced the clause as a 'restraint on trade', although on
May 8 in the High Court TV-am gave an undertaking that it would give Five TV
notice before it concluded any agreement to bid for Channel 5.
The legal action is delaying any serious attempts at bringing together the
rivals to form a single consortium, which would almost certainly be in a
position to bid the minimum Pounds 1,000 a year for the franchise.
In the Five TV camp are Thames Television, Sony Entertainment, the parent of
Columbia and Tristar Pictures, and CanWest, an international broadcaster.
Several leading shareholders in the two consortia believe the start-up costs
are so high that Channel 5 will be viable only if any bid is uncontested.
Apart from the legal action, there is a gulf between the programme plans of
the two groups, with Five TV placing greater emphasis on local news and The
Entertainment Channel thinking more in terms of a single national channel.
As soon as the two sides leave the High Court, the talking may start in
earnest before the deadline of July 5.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Names take fresh action on deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S Names yesterday launched two new attempts to prevent the authorities
at the insurance market from drawing down on their deposits to meet losses.
In the High Court Mr Justice Potts gave leave to six Names - individuals
whose assets back underwriting at the mar ket - connected with the Gooda
Walker Action Group, which represents more than 2,100 Names, to seek a
judicial review of Lloyd's.
In yesterday's hearing Mr Alan Newman QC, for the Names, argued that Lloyd's
had 'failed properly to have regard to the interests of members' when making
the cash calls and drawdown procedures.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker group, said: 'We look
forward to exposing the parlous state of Lloyd's regulation to the cold
light of judicial scrutiny for the first time in its history.'
Solicitors Bentleys Stokes and Lawless are advising the group. Judicial
reviews are actions against public or semi-public bodies which are alleged
to have failed to observe their - often statutory - duties. In a separate
action, Withers, solicitors acting on behalf of the Distressed Names Spiral
Action Group, issued 10 writs against the Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Rose
Thomson Young and Devonshire agencies yesterday.
The writs are regarded as test cases and allege negligence by the agents.
They also claim that the spiral reinsurance transactions - deals in which
Lloyd's syndi cates and London companies reinsure each other's high-level
exposure to catastrophe risks - were entered into 'without the authority of
the Names involved'.
Withers said yesterday that it had been advised by counsel that Names have a
'very strong if not overwhelming prima facie case for negligence in respect
of the underwriting business of the Rose Thomson Young agency'.
Both actions aim to obtain injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down
on the deposits that all Names must lodge when they join Lloyd's to meet
insurance losses.
Last month more than 800 Names, represented by solicitors Michael Freeman,
failed to obtain injunctions.

FT  20 MAY 92 / US banks face probe into racial lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERAL banking regulators are investigating the lending records of 266 US
banks suspected of having discriminated against customers from minority
groups.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulates a
number of federally chartered banks, said yesterday the banks had been asked
to reply to Washington by the end of the week.
'We have been investigating for several months and a number of banks have
received letters saying we are looking into racial disparities in lending,'
an OCC official said.
The OCC said the mortgage lending records were being scrutinised after
officials found a disproportionate rejection rate by some banks of mortgage
applications from minority groups such as black and Hispanic Americans.
The practice is known colloquially as 'redlining,' a term based on the
notion of bankers drawing a red line on a map around neighbourhoods they do
not wish to lend to.
Other federal bank regulators also examining the issue include the Federal
Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
If the OCC decides that a bank is guilty of discrimination it may employ a
series of sanctions, ranging from administrative or civil penalties to
limiting the institution's ability to expand its operations or open new
branches.
The Bank of Boston, one of the leading banks operating in the depressed New
England economy, has claimed it will make Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of new
business loans over the next five years in an effort to stimulate the
region's economy.
Banking analysts are sceptical, however, that the bank can fulfil such a
forecast. The bank described the claim as a projection of loan demand,
rather than an actual commitment to make the loans.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S government has threatened to hold a plebiscite later this year
to force Congress to reform the constitution and allow President Carlos
Menem to run for re-election in 1995.
The constitution forbids presidents from holding consecutive terms.
However, the opposition Radical party is opposed to Mr Menem's re-election
when his present six-year term ends. The conservative UCD party, the
government's ostensible ally, is split over the issue.
Senator Eduardo Menem, the president's brother and head of the Senate, said:
'Since it appears that some political forces are against the reform, I think
it would be correct to consult the people directly.' A plebiscite would not
have force of law, but the government is confident of wining a 70 per cent
majority, which would intimidate Congress into supporting reform.
Constitutional amendment has become Argentina's leading political issue. Mr
Eduardo Bauza, secretary general of the presidency, warned that 'undoubtedly
we are heading towards a plebiscite' unless the opposition co-operates by
approving reform. A two-thirds majority of Congress is needed to convoke a
constituent assembly.
Mr Menem's fixation with re-election as he approaches the middle of his term
is creating political uncertainty. Analysts warn that a constituent assembly
could introduce social clauses that hinder economic reform.
The president has said constitutional reform will not deflect his commitment
to free-market policies. But his claims that he is not directly involved in
a reform campaign are not widely believed.
Re-election has obsessed Argentina's civilian presidents. The only leader to
win re-election was Juan Peron in 1952, but the amendment was scrapped after
the army toppled him in 1955.
Mr Raul Alfonsn, Mr Menem's predecessor, also tried to change the
constitution but the Peronists blocked his efforts.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Sales of Halcion given go-ahead by FDA panel: Sleeping pill
seen as safe when used as prescribed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HALCION, the controversial sleeping pill made by Upjohn, has been found by
an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be safe
and effective when used as prescribed for short-term treatment of insomnia.
The panel recommended that the world's best-selling sleeping pill remain on
the market in the US, in spite of studies showing that it produces higher
rates of anxiety and memory impairment in some patients than similar drugs.
The panel recommended clearer labelling of the drug's possible side-effects.
The FDA is not obliged to follow the panel's recommendations but is expected
to abide by them and allow Halcion to remain on the market.
Upjohn believes a final decision could be made within two to six weeks.
The panel said data did not confirm more alarming side-effects. It was fears
that Halcion induced a substantially higher number of these, particularly
depression and memory loss, that led to the drug being banned in a number of
countries, including the UK, Norway, Finland, Bermuda and Argentina.
Restrictions have been imposed on dosing levels in France and Spain. A
German Health Ministry panel has not yet reported.
In the UK, a final decision on the ban is expected by the start of next
week, according to Upjohn.
Although the UK accounted for only a small part of Halcion's sales, the
ensuing publicity hurt the drug's sales around the world. These declined by
39 per cent during the first quarter of this year.
Last year Halcion accounted for Dollars 237m (Pounds 133.8m) of Upjohn's
Dollars 3.4bn sales. Shares in the US company firmed Dollars 7/8 to Dollars
35 3/8 at the close on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The stock was
trading at about Dollars 47 3/4 before Halcion sales were suspended in the
UK last September.
At the FDA panel meeting, the company said it would conduct a study of
10,000 patients in a further attempt to allay fears about the drug's safety.
The panel had recommended additional studies to determine the safest and
most effective dosage.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Mulroney to pursue tough line on trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Prime Minister Brian Mulroney visits the White House today in a
climate marred by bitter trade disputes and concern that the US is drifting
deeper into isolationism.
It is just seven years since President Ronald Reagan and Mr Mulroney sang
'Irish Eyes are Smiling' together and swore their mutual allegiance to the
free market. But clearly the world no longer seems 'so bright and gay'. Mr
Reagan has left centre stage and - if the polls are correct - Mr Mulroney
and President George Bush soon could be joining him in political retirement.
Mr Mulroney seems to find Mr Bush no less genial personally than his
predecessor, but the political realities dictate a tougher line on trade
from Ottawa.
However, the atmosphere will be lightened by a US Commerce Department
decision last week to cut its proposed countervailing duty on Canadian
softwood lumber from 14.8 per cent to 6.51 per cent.
Mr Derek Burney, Canadian ambassador to the US, said the move would 'help
lower the temperature,' but insisted the ruling was 'a tortured attempt to
manipulate the facts in order to substantiate a pre-ordained result'. The
case will head the list of trade grievances, along with skirmishes over
duties on Canadian-made Hondas, beer and magnesium.
The Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks is on the agenda.
Mr Mulroney would request 'the same kind of flexibility' on agriculture
trade talks that the US was demonstrating toward the European Community, Mr
Burney said.
There are two new problems to discuss. The White House last week requested a
dispute settlement panel under the Free Trade Agreement to investigate
Canada's wheat pricing methods. Mr Mulroney may now request a panel to
examine US agriculture export subsidies.
The Canadian prime minister is also expected to emphasise the necessity of
US leadership on aid to the former Soviet Union, in advance of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Canada and the US in June.
Canadian officials stress that Ottawa has contributed more than Dollars 2bn
in aid to the region - about 40 per cent of the US contribution - when the
US economy is 10 times larger.
Talks will also focus on the looming Group of Seven summit in Bonn, the
North America Free Trade Agreement, and the Earth Summit to be held in Rio
de Janeiro.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Privatisation pioneer goes one further: Mexico is handing
over the provision of basic public services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISIT Mexico's recently re-opened National Auditorium and a change in the
way the government conducts business becomes clear. Once a loss-making white
elephant with cheap subsidised tickets, the auditorium now charges up to
Dollars 100 (Pounds 56) a seat, and makes a handsome profit.
Once an employer of 1,200 federal workers, it now has just one. All other
work, from security to securing stars - including recently Placido Domingo,
Paul Simon and next year's Miss Universe - is contracted to the private
sector.
The Mexican government, well-known for the privatisations of state-owned
industries, has taken the concept a step further by handing over the
provision and financing of basic public services to the private sector.
Telephones, motorways, water treatment, electricity generation, railways and
ports are being financed in part or fully by private capital to an extent
not seen even in most developed countries. Subsidies are being scrapped.
The stimulus to the privatisation of public goods comes from the appalling
state of Mexico's infrastructure, cited by most businessmen as the most
critical constraint on economic growth, and the enormous pressures on the
government budget.
A recent report from the business organisation Canacintra concluded with
what most Mexicans did not need telling: the motorway network was
insufficient, with some sections too narrow and badly put together; trains
were slow and in bad condition; ports were unreliable; the telephone service
was inadequate; the postal service was slow and inefficient . . . and so on.
The government's first target was the telephone system, privatised in
December 1990. Telmex, as the telephone monopoly is known, has to invest
under government regulation about Dollars 14bn in five years and increase
lines in service by 12 per cent a year. Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance
minister, likes to say that the government privatised investment in Telmex
which would not have been forthcoming had the company remained in public
hands.
The government handed over at about the same time the construction of all
four-lane toll roads to the private sector, ahead of the US, which allowed
private partnership for the first time last December. The Mexican government
has already authorised concessions for 3,521km of motorway for investments
of Dollars 5bn, of which 1,149km are in operation. Another 2,372km of
concessions are forthcoming.
The government usually finances about 10 to 15 per cent of a motorway
project, banks or capital markets another 50 per cent, and private investors
or construction companies the rest. Brokerages and banks recently have been
issuing bonds in Mexico guaranteed by future toll payments. The government
promises to extend concessions to private investors in a motorway if
projected revenue targets are not met, substantially reducing the risk of
the bonds.
Soon these bonds will be offered internationally. The first to be submitted
probably will be backed by tolls on motorways that already have been built,
in an attempt to test the market. However, foreigners at a recent conference
on Mexico's motorway programme appeared cautious and wary about
exchange-rate risk and the possibility that future governments might renege
on commitments made by the free-marketeers now in control.
Other risks have become apparent. Toll prices, because of the high cost of
capital, are so high that demand in some cases has not met expectations,
causing losses for creditors. Construction costs have been higher than
projected in the Mexico City-Acapulco motorway, to the discomfort of the
lead bank, Banco Serfin.
Other government departments have followed the example of the Ministry of
Communications and Transport. Mexico's Commission of Federal Electricity
(CFE) has signed projects worth Dollars 2.5bn with consortia including
France's Alsthom, Spain's Mecanica and Mexico's Bufete International to
build and then lease back generators. The CFE will assign another Dollars
2.2bn-worth of plants to private contractors, including a consortium lead by
General Electric and Bechtel, according to a report by El Financiero
International.
These projects may prove big business for Mexico's brokerages who are
working on projects to attract private capital aside from that provided by
foreign construction companies. Mr Javier Magana of Probursa is working on a
plan to emit electricity bonds internationally and guaranteed by CFE's
promise of payments for the use of a generator.
Probursa is also proposing a similar scheme for water treatment plants,
where capital is raised through water bonds that are guaranteed by a stream
of payments which local government agrees to make for use of the plants. A
series of French and British water companies have trooped through the
offices of the National Water Commission in the hope of obtaining a slice of
a billion-dollar business.
Such projects, while hardly new in the US, 'would a year and a half ago been
considered absurd', says Mr Magana. They are feasible because interest rates
have fallen to below 15 per cent and confidence in the peso is strong, while
the consensus in and out of Mexico is that infrastructure spending will boom
over the next decade.
However, foreigners may still hesitate to invest in a country where price
controls on basic necessities such as electricity and water have been a way
of life for more than half a century. The other constraint is Mexico's
constitution, which still reserves ownership and distribution of many public
services to the state. While the government has found ways round the law,
greater legal clarity would help.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN American exporters of bananas to the EC could face curbs under the
European Commission's latest plans to protect its traditional, mostly
Caribbean suppliers, David Gardner reports from Brussels.
Last month, Brussels imposed quotas on so-called 'dollar zone' banana
exporters, plus a 20 per cent tariff, ahead of next year's single market.
Central America, Colombia and Ecuador provided three-fifths of the EC's 3.4m
tonnes consumed in 1990.
The assumption was that this would now be consolidated, with an extra 3 per
cent-a-year 'dollar' quota to accommodate rising consumption. EC suppliers
from outlying areas such as France's Martinique and Spain's Canary Islands,
and from Caribbean and African producers linked to the EC by the Lome
Convention, would have their higher-cost produce protected.
Brussels' latest view on the quotas (in a document to be sent to interested
parties) is more restrictive than expected. 'From a Latin American point of
view, it's fairly much a disaster,' one observer said. Under scenarios
listed, 'dollar zone' producers would have only 1.4m tonnes (two-thirds of
what they supply now) guaranteed. An extra 900,000 tonnes would be licensed
out to 'dollar zone' and traditional suppliers, as would 3 per cent annual
increments thereafter. A decision is not expected before July.

FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Japan may face dumping duties on vans in
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department yesterday ruled that Japanese carmakers have sold
minivans in US markets at less than fair value. In a ruling which clears the
way for punitive duties on Japanese minivan imports, the Commerce Department
said Mazda sold minivans below fair value by 12.70 per cent. Preliminary
estimates had put the dumping level at 7.19 per cent.
Toyota was found to have underpriced its minivans by 6.75 per cent; the
preliminary dumping estimate was 0.95 per cent. All other vehicles were
found to have been underpriced by 9.88 per cent, up from 4.23 per cent in
the preliminary investigation. The department makes the estimates on the
basis of a fair market value formula.
The complaint now moves to the US International Trade Commission, which is
expected to rule by the last week in June on whether the alleged dumping has
hurt US industry. An ITC spokesman said a finding of injury was by no means
'a foregone conclusion'. Before dumping duties can be imposed, the US
carmakers must prove they have been hurt as a result of the 'dumped'
minivans rather than the recession or American preferences for Japanese
vehicles. Injury has been found more often than not in dumping complaints.
The big three US car companies - GM, Ford and Chrysler - asked for the
dumping investigation a year ago. They said Japanese minivan exports to the
US had soared to Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 670m) in 1990. They asked for dumping
duties of almost 30 per cent.
After the Commerce Department issued its preliminary findings, Japanese
carmakers raised prices and the US carmakers' share of the minivan market
increased, analysts said. Mazda and Toyota are the big sellers in the US
minivan market. Mitsubishi's sales volume is considered minimal, and Nissan
discontinued minivan sales in the US.
