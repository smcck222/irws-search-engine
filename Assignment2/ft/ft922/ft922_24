FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking leaves Paris
lower at the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-taking was evident in Paris yesterday, as other senior bourses
generally held steady, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was initially lifted by a firm franc and bond market but profit-taking
and a flat opening on Wall Street sent shares lower by the close. The CAC-40
index dropped 10.46 to 2,053.17 in moderate turnover of FFr3.2bn.
A FFr6.10 drop to FFr390 in Elf, which held its annual meeting yesterday,
weighed on the market. The chairman said first quarter operating profit fell
about 25 per cent from the year-ago period.
Unspectacular first quarter turnover figures sent Alcatel lower for the
second day, closing down FFr13 at FFr648, and also wiped FFr18 off Saint
Gobain to FFr595.
Euro Disney stabilised after Tuesday's drop, and analysts said the stock
looked oversold. It rose as high as FFr129.30 before closing 70 centimes
better at FFr126. Pechiney International eased another FFr5.30 to FFr201.70
following Tuesday's private placement of new shares.
FRANKFURT was mixed in quiet trade as metalworkers mooted further talks with
employers; after hours, a resumption of talks was scheduled for Hesse today.
The DAX index closed 1.74 lower at 1,749.42 after a similarly token 0.16
rise to 706.98 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume eased from DM6.2bn to DM6bn.
An unsubstantiated rumour that Deutsche Bank had recommended steel stocks
left Hoesch and Klockner-Werke DM3 and DM1.50 higher, at DM246 and DM118
respectively, but Preussag fell DM6.90 to DM406.
Kaufhof, the retailer, gained DM7 to DM498 on a higher dividend and a 30 per
cent jump in net profits.
MILAN was supported by short-covering ahead of the close of the account
tomorrow. Dealers said that call options on Fiat and Montedison were taken
up but that those on insurance stocks had been abandoned. The Comit index
edged up 0.73 to 482.33 in turnover estimated at L80bn-L100bn after L86.6bn
on Tuesday.
Dealers were sidelined ahead of the Fiat results due tomorrow, which could
either help the market to recover or condemn it to a further decline. A 30
per cent cut in the dividend has been discounted by the market, but a
dividend paid partly in cash and partly in shares in one of the group's
subsidiaries or a capital increase, both rumoured yesterday, would be taken
badly.
Olivetti rose L77 to L2,949 on turnround hopes after its heavy loss and
restructuring charges last year.
ZURICH took SBC at its word. The bank said on Tuesday that Moody's
downgrading of its triple-A rating was not material. Its shares recovered
SFr6 to SFr287 as the SMI index closed 2.7 higher at 1,953.5.
AMSTERDAM was disappointed by Aegon's flat earnings per share for 1991 and
its shares fell Fl 1.10 to Fl 124.80. The CBS Tendency index was unchanged
at 130.2.
CSM, the food and biochemicals group, advanced 90 cents to Fl 96.60 on
unsurprising first-half figures. Hunter Douglas lost Fl 1.50 or 2 per cent
to Fl 75.30 after reporting a small rise in first quarter sales after
Tuesday's close, while Royal Dutch, which reports first quarter figures
today, eased Fl 1.10 to Fl 150.20.
MADRID's general index closed up 2.91 at 260.82 with strong buying noted
late in the session prior to the expiry of futures and options contracts
today. Endesa put on Pta105 to Pta3,675 after reporting better-than-expected
first quarter earnings while Tabacalera weakened Pta90 to Pta6,700.
STOCKHOLM rebounded from an early drop on demand for Volvo and Ericsson. The
Affarsvarlden general index added 1.4 to 1,007.8 in turnover of SKr689m
after SKr576m.
Ericsson B free's added SKr6 to SKr141 following Tuesday's late news of a
big Japanese order. Volvo B free's recovered SKr4 to SKr448 after Tuesday's
drop.
COPENHAGEN was lifted by a 38 per cent jump in Novo Nordisk's first quarter
net, the KFX index closing 0.38 higher at 96.39 as Novo rose DKr13 to
DKr547. Hafnia fell DKr24 to DKr200 in thin, speculative trading. HELSINKI
dropped on profit-taking, the Hex index felling 12.2 to 852.3.
BRUSSELS eased with the Bel-20 index closing down 3.12 at 1,221.74 in thin
turnover of BFr669m. Electrabel, which announced investment plans of BFr40bn
in 1993, lost BFr55 or 1 per cent to BFr4,890. VIENNA's ATX index shed 1.81
to 966.75. Among active issues Austrian Airlines lost Sch30 to Sch2,280
after announcing a 12 per cent decline in first quarter earnings.

FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei resumes upward
path on firm yen and bonds
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average resumed its upward trend, after Tuesday's brief
interruption, as a sharp rise in the yen and a rally in the bond market
prompted bargain hunting by domestic investors, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 260.04 up at 18,768.57. Initially, arbitrage
unwinding depressed the index to the day's low of 18,425.83, but the firm
bond market later encouraged bargain hunting and index-related buying which
pushed the Nikkei to the day's high of 18,803.79.
Volume was down slightly to 380m shares from 392m. Mr Brian Tobin at SG
Warburg Securities said most investors were 'cautiously optimistic' and
activity was supported by small-lot domestic interest. Mr Tobin added that
foreign investors remained on the buying side, picking up cheap blue chip
issues.
Advances outnumbered declines by 570 to 423, with 141 issues remaining
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 12.41 to
1,398.22, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.36 to 1,117.13.
The yen gained strength on a testimony by Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury
undersecretary, in which he expressed concern about the Japanese currency's
weakness against the dollar. The yen rose Y2.30 against the dollar to close
at Y130.30.
Currency movements sparked active buying in interest rate-sensitive issues.
Power utilities and shipbuilding shares firmed, with Tokyo Electric Power
adding Y110 at Y2,890 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gaining Y5 to Y600.
However, exporters lost ground. Hitachi fell Y11 to Y839 and Matsushita
Electric Industrial retreated Y10 to Y1,390. Auto makers were also weak,
with Toyota Motor down Y10 to Y1,480 and Honda Motor declining Y30 to
Y1,530.
Rumours that the development of an anti-Aids drug would be announced later
this week lifted bio-technology issues. Okamoto Industries advanced Y130 to
Y1,550 and Morinaga Milk appreciated Y17 to Y856.
Oil refiners rose on the recovery in crude oil products on overseas
commodity markets. Nippon Oil gained Y26 to Y726 and Showa Shell Sekiyu Y100
to Y1,380.
Sanrio, the novelty maker, climbed Y80 to Y1,620. The company, which made
extensive stock investments in the late 1980s, announced an upward revision
of unrealised losses on its investment portfolio to Y21bn for the fiscal
year ended this March.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 60.49 higher at 21,346.90 in volume of 27.2m
shares. Traders with a short-term horizon sought pharmaceutical issues. Ono
Pharmaceutical advanced Y180 to Y3,150.
Roundup
DOMESTIC politics and foreign buying gave most markets in the region a lift
yesterday, but political jitters had the reverse effect in Thailand.
HONG KONG accredited US buying and reform prospects in mainland China for
its third consecutive record high. The Hang Seng index closed 52.02 stronger
at 5,757.95 for a gain of 7.2 per cent so far this month. Turnover expanded
from HKDollars 3.65bn to HKDollars 3.99bn.
Blue chips dominated the active list. HSBC turnover exceeded HKDollars 300m
as it moved up 50 cents to HKDollars 45, boosted by the recent visit to Hong
Kong by Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, HSBC's takeover
target.
MANILA took heart from early election indications that senior presidential
hopes Ms Miriam Defensor-Santiago and former defence secretary Mr Fidel
Ramos were ahead in the polls.
Closed on Monday and Tuesday for the elections, the exchange saw the
composite index rise 93.02, or 7.5 per cent, to 1,328.04, almost in touch
with its all-time high of 1,396 registered late in 1989.
BANGKOK continued Tuesday's decline, reflecting further uncertainty over
whether the government would accept a proposed constitutional amendment
which would allow only an elected member of parliament to be prime minister.
The SET index fell 23.36, or 3.01 per cent, to 731.27 in turnover of
Bt3.43bn. Bangkok Bank lost Bt16 to Bt676 and Bangkok Land Bt8 to Bt145.
SEOUL's high-capitalisation stocks retreated from their day's highs, but
this still left the composite index 5.89 higher at 592.29 in turnover up
from Won241bn to Won325bn.
TAIWAN reported buying of small speculative-oriented shares as the weighted
index rose 36.08 to 4,325.32 in TDollars 16.7bn turnover (TDollars 13.3bn).
AUSTRALIA was lifted by industrials, and particularly media stocks after the
recovery at News Corp. The All Ordinaries index put on 5.9, or 0.4 per cent,
to 1,682.7, its highest for six months.
News Corp moved ahead 68 cents to ADollars 22.40. John Fairfax gained 8
cents to ADollars 1.52 in high volume of 17.5m shares after last week's
listing at an issue price of ADollars 1.20.
NEW ZEALAND rose to a four-month high, helped by foreign buying centred on
the forestry sector. The NZSE-40 index added 14.19 at 1,509.15.
BOMBAY recovered after Tuesday's steep fall. The BSE index moved forward
344.76, or 11 per cent, to 3,431.13.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuela invests Dollars 3.8bn
in oil refineries
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S national oil company, PDVSA, is investing more than USDollars
3.8bn to upgrade its two largest oil refineries. The investments are among
the largest in the world oil refining industry.
The company has placed a high priority on the investments and they are not
likely to be affected by budget cuts - anticipated this year because of
lower-than-expected world oil prices.
Upgradings are planned for the Cardon refinery, operated by PDVSA subsidiary
Maraven, and at the Amuay refinery, operated by Lagoven, another PDVSA
division.
The investments are intended to enhance product quality to meet future
environmental standards (especially those of the Clean Air Act in the US).
They are also designed to increase processing of heavy crude oils and to
raise profitability.
The two refineries, connected by a system of pipelines last year, have
combined crude oil processing capacity of 935,000 barrels per day. Viewed as
a single complex, that makes Amuay and Cardon the largest complex in the
world.
Cardon, with 300,000 b/d of processing capacity, is receiving investments of
Dollars 3bn. Outlays for a delayed coker, catalytic platformer,
isomerisation unit, and other projects will radically alter the refinery's
product slate. The facility now produces about 70 per cent distillates and
30 per cent high sulphur fuel oil. By 1994, the refinery is expected to
produce 90-95 per cent distillates and only 5-10 per cent fuel oil.
Investments at Amuay, which has a capacity of 635,000 b/d, will total
Dollars 818m. They cover a delayed coking facility and other units to raise
the quality of refined products and reduce emissions.
Both refineries are building plants to produce MTBE and TAME, oxygenates
used to replace lead in car petrol. International companies, including Fluor
Daniels and Foster Wheeler, are involved in the projects.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reformed CAP will be a tight
fit - David Blackwell on problems looming for medium-scale farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of top quality 500-acre family farms in the UK looks bleak,
however diluted the proposed EC Common Agricultural Policy reforms become.
Two separate recent studies have reached similar conclusions after analysing
the effect of the reforms proposed by Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC Farm
Commissioner. Central to his plan is a 35 per cent reduction in cereals
prices to bring them nearer to world levels. Farmers would get compensation
for the cut only if they set aside 15 per cent of their land.
Only recently a 500-acre farm would provide a comfortable living - certainly
enough to send a couple of sons to public school, according to Mr Malcolm
McAllister, managing director of Booker Farming, which farms and advises on
45,000 acres in England.
The comfortable living has already disappeared, and the additional
imposition of the proposed reforms would be 'devastating' to a 500-acre
unit. Its net income, estimated at Pounds 20,000 now, would fall to just
Pounds 3,500 before the 'nominal set-aside compensation', Booker predicts.
Grant Thornton, the farming accountancy firm, is predicting a fall in the
income of a well-run 500-acre farm from Pounds 65.70 an acre to Pounds 55 an
acre before rent and finance costs.
Given the tightening restrictions in income, it is not surprising that more
than 9,000 UK farms have gone out of production in the past five years, as a
National Westminster Bank study showed earlier this year. The bank predicted
a continuing concentration in the industry as the largest farms expanded and
the smallest shrank.
Ironically, Mr MacSharry sees his reform plans as supportive of family
farming in Europe. 'In this country he will definitely not be supporting the
concept of the family farm,' says Mr McAllister.
Mr Gary Markham of Grant Thornton points out that even in the UK the
MacSharry plans will benefit the average, as opposed to the high performance
500-acre farm, which would show a profit of Pounds 25 an acre compared with
the Pounds 21.40 being realised at the moment. However, for most farmers
this is still not sufficient to fund interest on borrowings and/or rent,
which can be more than Pounds 50 an acre.
Mr Markham believes that the MacSharry reforms will be of maximum benefit
'on low performance farms of under 300 acres, but most of these will still
trade at a loss, and will probably disappear'.
For the bigger farmers the options are limited - they can try to increase
output still further, they can reduce fixed costs, or they can adjust their
business to make full use of crops such as potatoes and sugar-beet which are
not affected by the MacSharry plans.
'Progressive units must plan for the changes now,' Mr Markham says. 'It
could make the difference between staying in farming or not, depending on
the level of rent or finance.'
Booker Farming has worked out that the MacSharry plans would cut the net
profit on one of its 1,200-acre farms from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 19,500.
But Mr McAllister believes the damage can be limited through further
expansion, such as taking a typical 500-acre farm under contract.
Under such a scheme, according to Booker, the owner of the 500-acre farm
would end the year with an income of Pounds 27,000 while the net income for
the 1,200-acre farm will be Pounds 70,500. The 500-acre farmer's income will
come from a fixed sum of Pounds 50 an acre, including the 75 acres of
set-aside which Booker would manage, coupled with a share of the profits.
Mr McAllister, whose company achieved a return last year of 24 per cent on
capital employed, believes such an arrangement would create a single viable
business through economy of scale in place of two unviable businesses. The
contracted-out farmer would live on his farm and enjoy it, but cease to farm
directly.
Booker would spend more money on training, hoping to reduce costs on fuel,
sprays and fertilisers still further. Last year, Mr McAllister claims a 15
per cent saving on fuel after making sure that every tractor driver could
check fuel injectors and filters.
Contracting-out might seem a drastic way out, but Mr Markham agrees that
increasing the size of a well-run farm appears to be almost the only option
to reduce fixed costs by any substantial amount.
Meanwhile, Mr Markham points out, it is the uncertainty surrounding the
reforms that is hurting the farming business most. 'Let's get on with it and
fix the goal posts in place,' he said.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar strikes hit Guyana and
Barbados

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUGAR industries of Guyana and Barbados have been crippled by strikes as
millers and unions argue over higher wages.
Guyana's 20,000 sugar workers have left the country's eight mills idle to
support their union's demand for wage increases of 100 per cent. The Guyana
Sugar Corporation, the country's sole producer, says it cannot pay that
much.
The strike comes amid indications of a recovery in output by the Guyanese
industry. Production so far this year of about 90,000 tonnes is slightly
more than double the output in the corresponding period of last year.
The union representing sugar workers in Barbados said the strike in that
island followed the refusal of the milling company, Barbados Sugar Industry,
to pay workers a bonus agreed earlier. The company claims the formula for
the bonus has not been agreed with the union. The sugar harvest was delayed
by an eight-week strike, and the industry, which is forecasting output of
55,000 tonnes, has had to import to meet home demand.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin producers' association set
to end export quotas by 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSOCIATION of Tin Producing Countries is likely to end tin export curbs
by 1994 because low prices are already forcing members to produce below
their quotas, according to a senior association official, Reuter reports
from Kuala Lumpur.
'Based on the current stock depletion rate, we may continue the export
quotas for another one-and-a-half years,' said Mr Redzwan Sumun, the
producer group's executive secretary.
The association's members - Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Nigeria, Thailand and Zaire - account for about 60 per cent of world
production and they have operated a system of annual export quotas since
March 1987.
Prolonged low prices, caused by a large stock overhang and depressed demand,
have caused mine closures and production cuts.
To help reduce the overhang, the association's current agreement limits
members' exports to a total of 87,091 tonnes in 1992, down from 95,849 in
1991. Members produced less than their quotas in 1991 and analysts say the
trend could continue if prices remain low.
Some analysts estimate the ATPC members' 1992 production at 85,000 tonnes.
The Malaysian tin price surged yesterday to an eight-month closing high of
MDollars 15.05 (Dollars 5.92) a kilogram, reflecting rising consumer
interest, after recently dropping almost to a low of MDollars 13.99 a
kilogram.
Non-ATPC members Brazil and China, the world's top two producers, have
voluntarily limited exports in recent years.
Mr Redzwan put world tin stocks at slightly below 40,000 tonnes at the end
of April, marginally lower than a year ago but well above the ATPC's
market-equilibrium target of 20,000 tonnes, or six weeks' of world
consumption.
A Brazilian high court has delayed an expected ruling on a dispute over
mining rights at Brazil's biggest tin mine, Bom Futuro, after a judge asked
for more time to study the case, the Gazeta Mercantil reported.
The Gazeta said two Supreme Court justices had voted to give the rights to
the Ebesa consortium when a third justice called for a delay to review the
process.
Ebesa, a group of seven companies led by Paranapanema, the world's largest
private-sector tin ore producer, was granted the right in November to mine
the open-cast site in the Amazon state of Rondonia.
In December, wildcat miners won a court injunction against the Ebesa
consortium while appealing to win the right to work Bom Futuro.
State of Rondonia officials have said that despite the injunction about
1,500 wildcat miners continue to work the site. In March, police and
government officials confiscated 48 tonnes of tin produced by the wildcat
miners.
The Gazeta did not report whether a new date had been set for the ruling.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices in Australian terms are holding firm, with better styles tending
firmer and crossbreds particularly in good demand. However, weakness in the
US dollar is inevitably reflected in Australian exchange rates, and from
time to time recently Australian economic problems have tended to underline
this factor. Overseas buyers consequently find wool a little cheaper to buy.
The strength in sterling has led to more definite price reductions in the
UK. Business is at present quiet but activity in early processing remains
very good and signs of recovery from recession are cautiously indicated
elsewhere.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Appeal for greater openness in
gold market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST chairman of the London Bullion Market Association made a final
appeal for greater transparency in the gold market as he stepped down from
his position yesterday after four years, Reuter reports.
Mr Robert Guy, a director of NM Rothschild, the bullion house, said the long
bear run in gold had discouraged investors from using the market, but added
that if they returned as the market picked up, they would demand more
information.
'If you want to attract investors into the market you shouldn't ask them to
invest blind,' Mr Guy said.
The LBMA chairman said historic but regular reports on London's gold market
turnover would also assist the bullion houses themselves.
'It is internally important for the companies involved in the market to have
a benchmark to compare their activities with each other,' he said.
Pointing out that both the gilts and foreign exchange markets appeared to
benefit by producing turnover figures, he suggested the gold market should
gradually do the same. 'I think the majority of market makers would be happy
to see turnover figures, but the LBMA believes in consensus,' he said.
The question of value added tax on gold, said Mr Guy, would continue to be
an important issue. He said the outcome of current talks in Brussels on the
harmonisation of VAT rates within the EC would be of vital importance to the
London and continental gold markets.
'As far as London is concerned the worse we could do is maintain the current
situation. There are sound reasons for removing VAT from gold, but political
reality means this will be very hard to achieve.'
Under current regulations members of the LBMA who trade between themselves
do not pay VAT on their transactions. 'It would be helpful if investors
could buy gold free of VAT provided they did not take delivery,' said the
outgoing chairman.
He saw no move towards the market adopting a central clearing house system
but said there was an interest in reducing the cost of providing a clearing
service in London.
'There is no standard cost charged by the London market to the international
world. . . and the provision of that cheap or free service obviously
attracts a lot of business,' he said.

MOST BASE metals prices fluctuated in narrow trading ranges at the London
Metal Exchange during the afternoon with traders watching the latest round
of German metal workers pay talks. The COPPER market was the most nervous -
Germany is one of the world's biggest importers of that metal - and the cash
position closed Pounds 8.50 down on the day at Pounds 1,218 a tonne,
extending the fall on the week to Pounds 22.25 a tonne. The TIN market's
recent strength was maintained, although the three months delivery position
again failed to break resistance at Dollars 6,100 a tonne. The closing price
was Dollars 6,090.50 a tonne, up Dollars 15.50 on the day. Traders suggested
a technical correction back to about Dollars 6,000 a tonne might be needed
before a renewed challenge of the upside resistance could succeed. COCOA and
COFFEE prices were holding on to slim gains at the close but traders were
not expecting substantial rallies to develop. 'The real test will be when we
start to see further origin-selling but for now, we're just happy to end the
day in the plus column,' one cocoa trader said.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japan faces civil action over
Hirohito coin seizure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MURKY mystery involving 11m gold coins worth Y1.1 trillion (million
million) issued to celebrate the late Emperor Hirohito's 60th year on
Japan's Chrysanthemum throne is about to enter a new phase.
On his arrival in Tokyo yesterday Mr Paul Davies, a UK coin dealer, said he
would start a civil court action next week against the Japanese government
and the Tokyo metropolitan government to seek the return of 3,200 Hirohito
coins, valued at more than Pounds 600,000. They were seized 26 months ago by
the Tokyo police at Narita airport. He also seeks compensation.
The police claimed that the confiscated coins were fakes and that they had
uncovered Japan's largest known counterfeiting case. They alleged the coins
were part of a consignment of 107,000, then worth USDollars 70m, suspected
of being counterfeits and imported to Japan from the Middle East through
European intermediaries.
Mr Davies, a 40-year-old barrister who set up a coin dealing business in
Ilkley, West Yorkshire, 19 years ago, has always protested that his coins
are genuine.
He said yesterday that his main motive in taking his case to the Japanese
court was to insist that the relevant government authorities prove, beyond
all doubt, that the coins are fakes. 'If they are unable or unwilling to
substantiate their claims, I should be fully compensated for my losses,' he
said, 'and my tarnished reputation should be unconditionally restored.'
Mr Davies said another aspect of the court proceedings would be to highlight
the contradictory behaviour of Japan's Ministry of Finance, the Tokyo
Customs Office, the Bank of Japan and the Osaka Mint prior to the seizure of
his company's coins.
He suggested: 'Their behaviour, both collectively and independently, clearly
established that the coins are unquestionably genuine.'
The affair began in 1985 when Japan gave the gold market a tremendous boost
by importing 300 tonnes of gold, then worth Dollars 3bn, to prepare for the
issue of the Hirohito coins the following year.
The scheme was controversial from the outset because the gold was imported
via New York in an effort to make the balance of trade with the US look less
favourable to Japan.
It also involved big profits for Japan's finance ministry. The coins were
priced at Y100,000 each, twice the value of the 30 grams of gold they
contained. Consequently, the ministry made a profit of up to Y600bn, worth
Dollars 3.5bn at the time.
However, as the coins were legal tender and the Bank of Japan was obliged to
buy them back at Y100,000 each, there were obvious risks that forgers might
try to cash in on the premium between the gold content and the legal-tender
price. In January 1990 the Tokyo police said that this had indeed happened
and claimed forgers had been at work since 1988.
The Tokyo police and the Finance Ministry continue to deflect questions
about the affair by saying investigations are continuing. But Mr Davies
claimed yesterday the police effectively abandoned their investigations in
the summer of 1990.
He said: 'I have been held as a financial hostage by the Japanese
bureaucracy for over two years and made to pay the penalty for a crime that
does not exist. The financial pressure caused by the prolonged confiscation
of my coins is greatly restricting my business.
'The Tokyo police and the finance ministry are not above the law. They must
be accountable for their actions and cannot be allowed to hide behind a veil
of secrecy.'
His Japanese attorney, Mr Takeshi Sakuragi, will formally lodge the legal
documents at the Tokyo District Court next Tuesday.

<TEXT>
HAVING reached record levels last year, Norway's troubled bank sector cut
its losses by almost half in the first quarter of 1992, AP-DJ reports from
Stockholm.
According to a survey by the Norwegian banking association, Norway's
commercial banks made a combined net loss of NKr889m in the three months,
down from a NKr1.67bn loss in the same quarter a year earlier.
The improvement stemmed from cost-cutting at the operating level as well as
reduced provisions to cover losses on loans and write-downs. Improved
interest net income also helped.
Operating costs were reduced to NKr2.63bn in the quarter from NKr2.87bn a
year earlier, while loan losses by commercial banks shrank to NKr2.07bn from
NKr2.54bn.
While the loan loss figures represented a 19 per cent reduction, loan losses
remained the main obstacle to profitability in the Norwegian bank sector,
analysts said.
They also warned against placing too much emphasis on first-quarter results.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Du Pont's Dollars 300m issue eases
shortage of high-rated deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market saw a handful of mainly dollar-denominated
deals yesterday, with Du Pont and City of Stockholm launching two
medium-sized issues.
Du Pont, the US chemicals group, is issuing a Dollars 300m, seven-year bond
with a coupon of 7 1/2 per cent which is due to break syndicate today.
Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager, expects fairly strong demand for
the paper given the shortage of dollar-denominated issues from triple-A
rated borrowers recently.
Triple-A names have been unable to raise funds at sub-Libor costs recently,
forcing investors who want to pick up a decent yield to focus more on
well-known, but lower-rated issuers instead.
The Du Pont issue was priced to yield 34 basis points over the seven-year US
treasury bonds, which was considered a fairly tight pricing by some market
participants.
City of Stockholm launched a Dollars 325m floating rate note with a coupon
of  1/16 below three-month Libor.
IBM International Finance, the large computer company's financing arm which
is used to support sales, is launching an Ecu 150m two-year bond with a
coupon of 9.25 per cent.
Paribas, the lead manager, reported demand for short-dated Ecu paper and
said that the issue is aimed at retail and small institutional investors.
The deal is the first bond issue from IBM since the company had its credit
rating downgraded from Aaa to Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service, so the
market was keen to see whether this had any effect on IBM's cost of funds.
IBM is keen to maintain the same cost of funding and Paribas claimed
yesterday that the company was borrowing on broadly similar terms to those
commanded in the recent past, helped by better-than-expected first-quarter
profits. IBM still has a triple-A rating from S&amp;P.
In the D-Mark sector of the market, Corfin, the Czech leasing company,
announced a DM25m private placement - the first private Czech company to
issue a foreign currency bond. The bonds carry a coupon of 11 1/2 per cent
and were priced at Libor plus 260 basis points and the issue is guaranteed
by Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, the Czech foreign trade bank.
Daiwa Europe, the lead manager, said most of the bonds have been placed
mainly with German investors although some bonds were sold to the Japanese.
Corfin, which leases cars, trains and small aircraft, is borrowing in the
international markets for the first time but it is expected to return from
time to time since it needs to fund its car purchases in D-Mark.
Sumitomo Corporation, the Japanese group, launched a Y50bn five-year bond
with a coupon of three-month Libor in the first three months, turning to 6
per cent thereafter. Daiwa Europe, lead manager, said most of the deal was
placed with Japanese investors.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: SEB's long-term debt rating
downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG-TERM debt rating of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest
commercial bank, was reduced yesterday by Moody's Investors Service to Aa-3
from Aa-2 in a further blow to its prestige.
The New York rating agency said the bank 'will experience ongoing asset
quality stress, particularly in its domestic loan portfolio'. SEB's earnings
growth would be limited, it added.
However, the rating agency noted that SEB is currently exhibiting strong
capital ratios. It said that the bank's ratings for short-term deposit
obligations and commercial paper was not under review and remained at
Prime-1, although the rating on SEB's long-term deposit obligations has also
been reduced to Aa-3.
Moody's action is a further sign of the continuing troubles at SEB which
recorded a 30 per cent drop in operating profit last year following
SKr4.76bn (Dollars 813.7m) of credit loss provisions and a SKr500m loss on
the disposal of a 28.2 per cent share option in Skandia, the insurance group
it failed to take over.
The credit re-rating will add further pressures on SEB as it awaits
impatiently the arrival of its third chief executive in three years - Mr
Bjorn Svedberg, the former chief executive of Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications group. He takes over from Mr Bo Ramfors in September
Last week's move by the Swedish state to nationalise the whole of
Nordbanken, the country's loss-making second largest commercial bank, in a
rescue operation has added to the pressures on SEB and the rest of the
private sector.
Mr Curt Olsson, SEB chairman, complained that while he accepted the Swedish
government had no real alternative but to take over Nordbanken, in doing so
it distorted competition in the banking system.
Moody's also downgraded the long-term debt and deposit obligation ratings of
Swedbank, the central bank for Sweden's savings banks, from Aa-2 to AI.

MOODY'S Investors Service in New York has put Bell Canada's long-term debt

The regulatory decision is expected in Ottawa in mid-June although it could
possibly be delayed until the autumn.
Bell Canada, part of the BCE group, is the country's biggest
telecommunications company and has an effective monopoly on the domestic

Bell Canada has CDollars 5bn in long-term debt outstanding, including first
mortgage bonds and unsecured debentures. The issues are rated double A-1 and
double A-2, or the highest possible level for a corporation.

AEGON, the Netherlands' second-largest insurer, said yesterday that it
posted a 12.3 per cent rise in operating profit in the first quarter of
1992, although growth in net profit was held to just 1.5 per cent because of
reduced gains on the sale of shares and property investments.
Net profit was slightly higher at Fl 193m (Dollars 104m) compared with Fl
190.2m a year earlier. Operating profit, however, saw more marked growth to
Fl 187.7m from Fl 167.1m.
This reflected a 8.75 per cent rise in operating earnings in its core
life-insurance business, as well as strong improvements in non-life
insurance and miscellaneous activities. Operating profit from health and
accident insurance eased to Fl 11m from Fl 12m.
Total turnover rose by 13.2 per cent to Fl 4.43bn. The company said turnover
and earnings in the US were considerably higher, but it gave no details.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: French table plan to boost share
buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday tabled hotly awaited plans to encourage
private individuals to buy more shares, so as to channel more of the
nation's savings to its undercapitalised companies.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, presented the scheme, christened plan
d'epargne personnel en actions (Pep) at yesterday's cabinet meeting.
Parliament will be asked for approval in the autumn so that investors can
start placing cash in the current tax year.
The scheme would allow individuals to put FFr600,000, or couples to invest
FFr1.2m, in shares for a minimum of six years or a maximum of eight, and to
receive dividends and capital gains tax free. Shares in both quoted and
unquoted French companies are permitted, as are unit trusts, known as Sicavs
in France, so long as they are invested in equities. Shares in Peps can be
sold within the time limit so long as the proceeds are immediately
reinvested.
The idea was launched by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, while he
was finance minister, as a way to reinforce French companies' equity bases,
which a series of surveys have shown to be weak by their main competitors'
standards.
Peps are also designed to entice savers to invest in partial privatisations,
which Mr Michel Charasse, the budget minister, has estimated will raise
around FFr10bn for the government this year. Estimates of total demand for
the new Peps vary from FFr20bn to FFr40bn per year.
The scheme follows a similar model to the plan d'epargne populaire, which
was introduced two years ago and offers tax breaks for investments in bonds.
It has raised FFr240bn to date.
However, the equities Pep is likely to disappoint stock market
professionals, who had been urging more generous tax benefits. Critics also
point out that it does nothing to solve the wider problem of the very small
number of company pension funds in France.

<TEXT>
ZURICH INSURANCE said both its life and non-life businesses contributed to
an 11.7 per cent rise in net income in 1991 to SFr431.8m (Dollars 284.00m).
The group is raising its dividends and launching a one-for-eight rights
issue to raise SFr310m. The voting and bearer shares and participation
certificates will then be split, so as to double the number of shares and
PCs issued.
Gross premiums rose 13.2 per cent to SFr19.2bn last year, with acquisitions
contributing about a third of the growth and the weakening of the Swiss
franc another third. Investment income rose 15.5 per cent to SFr3.7bn with
total investments amounting to SFr59bn at the end of the year compared with
SFr50bn.
Consolidated capital and surplus rose 15 per cent to SFr6.9bn before
appropriation of the 1991 profit.
The directors propose dividends on the old equity base of registered and
bearer shares of SFr70, compared with SFr66, and on the participation
certificates SFr35 compared with SFr33.
The rights will cost around SFr1,100 for each SFr100 par value registered
and bearer share, and SFr550 for each SFr50 participation certificate.
Most of the proceeds of the issue will be applied to doubling the par value
of the shares and PCs. They will then be split two-for-one.
Zurich has also decided to remove its ban on registering foreign owners of
its registered shares, but has established in its place a 3 per cent limit
on any individual holding of the registered shares.
Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive, said the transactions were aimed at
improving liquidity of the group's equity and providing shareholders an
additional tax efficient return on their investment.
The funds were being raised now because stock market conditions were
favourable. They would be used to finance current business.

FONDIARIA, the holding company of one of Italy's biggest insurance groups,

Consolidated group profit figures will not be available until next month.
But Fondiaria's group premiums rose 13 per cent to L5,021bn last year,

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Investors puzzle over German
borrowing - Public sector funding could place a strain on the bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S public sector finances are again stirring the interest of
investors and analysts anxious to know how much the government will borrow
from the bond market this year.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said last week that federal
government borrowing is likely to fall to DM40bn in 1993 from DM45bn
(Dollars 27.2bn) this year, largely because tax revenues have been higher
than anticipated. He has also proposed an austerity programme aimed at
reducing government borrowing.
Borrowing by 'off balance sheet' government agencies set up to promote the
economic reform of eastern Germany - such as the Treuhand and European
Recovery Programme (ERP) - stays high.
Analysts' estimates of the total German public sector deficit this year,
including all government-backed funds and agencies, range from DM190bn to
DM210bn, up from around DM170bn in 1991.
How much will be financed in the bond market remains an open question. For
example, the Treuhand, set up to manage state-owned east German industry
ahead of privatisation, has so far funded only in short-term markets. But it
may start long-term bond issuance in the second half of this year, competing
directly for funds with the federal government.
Equally, the ERP, set up to help with economic development in eastern
Germany, is borrowing for the first time this year, aiming to raise DM25bn.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers, noted that
bonds account for 56 per cent of all outstanding German public sector debt,
broadly defined. Using this rule of thumb, the market could be asked to
absorb DM110bn new bunds, Unity bonds and quasi-government debt instruments
this year.
Others are less pessimistic. Mr Stefan Schneider, analyst at Nomura Research
Institute, estimated total public sector bond market borrowing of around
DM80bn.
But to this must be added refinancing of outstanding debt, running at DM90bn
according to government figures.
Hence total bond issuance is likely to reach at least DM160bn, possibly as
high as DM240bn, once borrowing by the post office and the state-owned rail
system is included.
Whatever the eventual out-come, borrowing on this scale could place a strain
on the bond market. There are already signs of resistance, especially when
market conditions are weak.
Last week, for example, the ERP launched a debut DM5bn 10-year bond issue,
but only around half the paper could be sold into a weak market.
Analysts are split over whether government borrowing will depress bund
prices for the rest of the year.
Among the more optimistic forecasts, Mr Schneider predicted 10-year bund
yields of around 7.5 per cent by the summer, from close to 8 per cent
yesterday, as the government's deficit reduction package and better
inflation figures improve sentiment.
The impact of large-scale public sector borrowing will probably depend on
the broader economic outlook for inflation and interest rates.
'In a bull market supply can be totally benign - in fact it can help to
improve liquidity,' commented Mr Klaus Baader, bund market analysts at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
Over the medium term, most observers now agree that Germany's total public
sector debt outstanding will balloon from DM1,170bn in 1991 to around
DM2,000bn by 1995.
This will push the debt up to at least 55 per cent of GNP, and possibly as
high as 70 per cent, depending on assumptions about growth.
Even at the lower end of expectations, this is only a whisker away from the
60 per cent limit set in the Maastricht treaty for countries which can
proceed to the next stage of European monetary union.

BRASCAN, a key management holding company controlled by the Bronfman family
of Toronto, forecasts that stronger commodity markets would bring some
recovery in earnings this year.
However, the company, which owns 49 per cent of Noranda, Canada's biggest
resource group, earned CDollars 7.3m (USDollars 6.13m), or 24 cents a share,
in the first quarter, down 37 per cent from a year earlier. In all of 1991,
it lost CDollars 18m, or 60 cents, against profit of CDollars 80m, or 40
cents a share.
Mr Jack Cockwell, president, told Brascan's annual meeting that better metal
and lumber prices would favour Noranda later this year. However, recovery in
other sectors may be slow, he warned. The company is to retain its dividend
of CDollars 1.04 a common share.
Mr Cockwell told the meeting the company would not bid for Union Gas, one of
Ontario's two gas distributors.

PERU has moved forward to August the sale of Aeroperu, the state airline,
according to Admiral Dante Matellini, the carrier's president.
The government has accelerated its privatisation programme and placed a
Dollars 50m price tag on the airline. Several large international carriers -
including Iberia, Continental and Singapore Airlines - have expressed
interest.
Two firm bids have been submitted, one of them involving the company's
pilots and possibly an outside airline. The other is from a consortium of
Taca (Transportes Aereos de CentroAmerica) and a Peruvian transport group
headed by entrepreneur Mr Rodriguez Banda.
The consortium is offering around Dollars 25m cash plus further investment
of between Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m in a new fleet. Under this
proposal, the government would probably retain a percentage of the shares
temporarily, and sell them later on the local stock exchange.
Aeroperu was independently valued at Dollars 54m six months ago; its routes
account for around half that. Its eight aircraft, only five of which are
operational, are worth some Dollars 15m. Other assets include a site at
Lima's Jorge Chavez airport and administrative buildings.
The company is presently running up an operating loss of Dollars 1.5m a
month, mainly due to overstaffing. It plans to cut its workforce of 1,800 by
around half. The government has come up with Dollars 6m to cover redundancy
payments for 800.

TRANS World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has
renegotiated a deal with American Airlines, the much larger Dallas-based
carrier. It involves the sale of TWA's landing slots and gates at Chicago's
O'Hare airport.
The deal was originally part of a larger asset sale package agreed between
the two airlines in late 1990. The Chicago slots and gates were to be sold
by TWA for Dollars 70m, and the airline said it would shift operations to
Midway Airport, Chicago's second airport.
Under the new arrangements, the sale price for the 40 landing slots and
three gates comprises a Dollars 500m zero-coupon note payable in monthly
instalments over 20 years. TWA is still talking of moving to Midway.
However, under the new deal, it also retains the right to use one of the
gates. Neither American nor TWA had any immediate explanation for the
changed structure of the deal.
TWA, whose operating losses in the first quarter of this year were almost
Dollars 100m, has faced opposition to previous asset sales transactions in
the bankruptcy court - notably from the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the federal agency which has argued that sale proceeds should
be used first to repair TWA's pension plan deficit.
The new agreement is subject to various closing conditions.

MGM-Pathe Communications has made a non-binding proposal to distribute Orion
Pictures' unreleased motion pictures and its library products, AP-DJ reports
from California.
MGM said it would make an advance under a distribution agreement and provide
a line of credit for print and advertising expenses.
It said its proposal contained an option for it to purchase the film assets
of Orion.
Terms of the MGM proposal were not disclosed.
Although Orion, which last December filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors, has 10 films ready for release, it has lacked the
funds to do it.
An agreement with Orion would give MGM-Pathe films to send through its
existing distribution pipeline. MGM-Pathe needs more films to release
because its prolonged legal and financial problems have halted production.
MGM said that the proposal, if accepted, would effectively benefit MGM's
distribution infrastructure and make the most of the value of the Orion
library and also the unreleased motion pictures.
MGM-Pathe is principally owned by Credit Lyonnais following the bank's
recent foreclosure on MGM's stock.

BERLITZ, the US language instruction company, has turned in first-quarter
net income of Dollars 4.4m, or 23 cents a share, against Dollars 5.9m, or 15
cents, a year earlier.
Operating income in the quarter fell to Dollars 4.4m from Dollars 7m, while
sales rose to Dollars 68.3m from Dollars 64.8m. The company attributed the
decline to economic slowdown in Japan and Europe and continued expenses
related to the expansion of its translation business.
Macmillan, the US publishing subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC) owned 56 per cent of Berlitz shares. The ownership of the stake is the
subject of litigation.
Berlitz's interest income from affiliates fell Dollars 3.9m to Dollars 1.7m,
reflecting payment defaults of the notes from MCC and some MCC affiliates in
the 1991 fourth quarter. MCC has filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code.
Berlitz reiterated that preferred stock dividends have been suspended and
are not expected to be paid in the foreseeable future. In the 1991 first
quarter, the preferred stock dividend reduced net income available to common
shareholders by Dollars 3.1m.

DAIWA Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, is considering a plan to shore up
the finances of Yanmar Diesel group, led by the leading Japanese diesel
engine maker. The group faces big losses on its securities investments
because of the sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market.
Yanmar said it had unrealised losses of Y50bn (Dollars 376m) at its two
finance subsidiaries. The group has asked Daiwa and other leading commercial
banks such as Sanwa Bank, Sumitomo Bank and Fuji Bank, for cheap loans. Bank
loans to Yanmar's two affiliates total over Y110bn.
The move comes at a time when many Japanese companies, which rushed to
invest in the bull market of the late 1980s, are experiencing problems. An
increasing number of companies are expected to turn to banks for support.
A spate of company rescues is expected to erode bank profit margins.
Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo expects city banks' profits to suffer in the next
three to four years because of problem loans of up to Y25,000bn. Kleinwort
reckons 30 to 50 per cent of such loans may be unrecoverable.

TOYODA Automatic Loom Works, a leading Japanese machinery-maker and the
original company of the Toyota Motor group, yesterday reported its first
fall in annual pre-tax profits in five years.
The figure fell 20.3 per cent in the year to March, to Y24.1bn (Dollars
181.20m), as margins were squeezed by rising costs. Sales growth, meanwhile,
was hit by the slowdown in industrial investment. Sales were flat at
Y583.4bn.
Sales fell 10.6 per cent in textile machinery; 12 per cent in forklift
trucks; and 17.4 per cent in parts for car air-conditioners. Car-related
business, including assembly work carried out under contract for Toyota,
increased 9.8 per cent.
The company said it saved Y4bn through rationalisation, but suffered a Y2bn
foreign exchange loss, a Y4bn increase in labour costs, and a Y3.4bn rise in
other costs. It also saw a Y1.6bn drop in non-operating profit.
Toyoda Machine Works, a leading machine tool maker and also a Toyota group
company, reported a 75.3 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits, to Y2.6bn, on a
sales decline of 2.4 per cent to Y174.6bn.

approval to sell two thirds of its business, including assets of CDollars
7bn (USDollars 5.80bn) and 97 bank branches.
National Bank of Canada plans to buy 48 Central Guaranty branches in Quebec

acquire 49 branches in Ontario and western Canada.
Each would pick up CDollars 3.5bn assets and matching liabilities.
The company is confident of winning regulatory approval from the federal
government.
Proceeds of the sale will go to shore up Central Guaranty's capital base.
The remaining third of the business, in southern Ontario, includes 61
branches and CDollars 5bn assets.
If the federal government refuses to approve the deal, the whole of Central
Guaranty would be back in play.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from the beer division of South African Breweries (SAB)
helped the consumer goods group overcome severe recession and record
improved earnings in the year to the end of March.
Mr Meyer Kahn, executive chairman, described economic conditions in South
Africa during the year as the worst in 50 years. He said he was 'relieved'
at the group's performance, given the current environment.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to R17.7bn (Dollars 6.2bn). Operating profit rose
5 per cent to R1.82bn, while attributable profit was up 10 per cent at R779m
 -significantly higher than analysts' predictions of flat earnings growth.
The share of attributable profits from the beer division rose to 60 per
cent, or R465m, a 16 per cent increase over 1991. Profit from other
interests rose by 2 per cent to R314m.
Although there was negligible volume growth in the beer division - for the
first time since the 1983-1985 period - Mr Kahn said it was a 'formidable
performance,' given the decline in consumer spending.
He attributed the continued growth to efforts to keep beer prices
competitive against other consumer goods. He said price increases in recent
years have been held to 80 per cent of the inflation rate.
Mr Kahn said the beer division's performance reflected relative resistance
of beverage sales during an economic downturn compared with durables such as
furniture and textiles, in which the group has large interests.
He said private consumption expenditures in South Africa had declined 5 per
cent during the year, reflecting the 'parlous financial condition' of most
consumers, while the 'turbulent' socio-political environment had also
undermined fragile consumer confidence.
Mr Kahn said the level of real economic activity had declined in all the
group's main retail areas. Earnings dropped 37 per cent at supermarket chain
OK Bazaars; by 35 per cent at retailer Amrel; and by 35 per cent at
furniture company Afcol.
Edgars, the fashion, footwear and apparel group, lifted earnings by 5 per
cent.
Mr Kahn said beverage exports had almost doubled in the past two years. He
said SAB would continue to focus on exports, but he anticipated an average 5
per cent annual sales growth in the domestic market. Earnings from foreign
operations were about 10 per cent of the total.
Looking ahead, Mr Kahn said that although he believed the recession had hit
bottom, he saw little meaningful economic improvement before the first
quarter of 1993. He predicted an earnings increase for 1992-1993 similar to
that of the current year.
Earnings per share increased by 10 per cent to 290 cents, with the dividend
up by a similar margin to 130 cents. A scrip alternative was offered.

<TEXT>
SEGA Enterprises, the Japanese video game maker, has agreed to pay Dollars
43m to settle a patent dispute with a US inventor. The agreement is the
second large US patent payout by a Japanese technology company in recent
weeks.
Sega, through its subsidiary, Sega of America, was to fight a Dollars 33m
Californian court award last month to the inventor, Mr Jan Coyle. However
the company decided that the potential financial and public relations costs
of an appeal outweighed the likely benefits of the action.
The dispute is over colour image-display technology used in video games, on
which two other makers, Nintendo of Japan and Atari of the US, have already
reached settlements with Mr Coyle.
Sega and Sega of America will share the two-part payment, Dollars 23m of
which will be delivered next Monday, with the remainder due by August 17,
when the patent on the technology expires.
Until the court ruling, Sega had celebrated dramatic growth in sales, which
doubled in the year to the end of March to an estimated Y213bn (Dollars
1.60bn).
The company is forecasting a pre-tax profit of Y33.4bn, also double the
amount of fiscal 1990.
Mr Hayao Nakayama, president and the architect of the Sega's rise to
international prominence, had condemned the US jury system for allowing
'amateurs' to decide on complex technical issues.
'We have concerns about the jury's level of understanding. This is a rather
simple case and it is clear that we should be okay. We had certainly taken
professional advice, and our professional told us we would win,' Mr Nakayama
said last month.
The company's decision to settle follows a similar agreement by Minolta, the
Japanese camera-maker, which agreed to pay Dollars 127.5m to Honeywell, the
US technology company, after a court ruled it had infringed patents for
autofocus technology.

MOLSON, the diversified Canadian group, has returned to the black in the
year to the end of March, buoyed by solid performances in its brewing and
special chemicals businesses.
The group reported a profit of CDollars 126.2m (USDollars 106.00), or
CDollars 2.25 a share, for the year, against a loss of CDollars 39m, or 72
cents, after special charges a year earlier. Earnings for the 1991-1992 year
were in line with analysts' forecasts.
The 1990-1991 charges covered full provision for Molson's equity investment
in Australian-based International Brewing Holdings, equal to CDollars 2.93 a
share. Excluding the provision, the group realised a profit of CDollars
118.5m, or CDollars 2.21 a share.
Revenues in the current year were CDollars 2.9bn against CDollars 2.5bn.
Brewing and special chemicals provided the thrust in fiscal 1991-1992. The
brewery business's operating profit rose 7 per cent to CDollars 172.8m,
reflecting the effects of the rationalisation programme. The improvement
came even though overall industry sales declined in Canada.
Molson now has almost 52 per cent of the domestic market. US sales rose 2.1
per cent and accounted for 19 per cent of the US imported beer market.
Divarsey, the speciality chemicals concern, saw operating profit jump 62 per
cent to CDollars 75.5m on sales of CDollars 1.2bn. The upturn reflected the
integration of DuBois Chemicals, acquired last April, and an improved market
share in the US.
Although sales at the building materials retailing subsidiary improved,
operating profit dipped 28 per cent to CDollars 21m. The outlook is better
for the current year.

APPLE Computer's Dollars 5.5bn copyright infringement suit against Microsoft
and Hewlett-Packard, the US computer companies, took an unexpected turn this
week when a federal judge in San Francisco agreed to reconsider his decision
to dismiss most of Apple's arguments in the closely watched case.
Apple filed suit in 1988, charging that Microsoft's Windows program and HP's
NewWave software violated copyrights on the screen displays of Apple's
Macintosh personal computers.
Last month Judge Vaughn Walker rejected Apple's contention that the overall
'look and feel' of the computer displays should be compared in order to
determine whether its copyrights have been infringed.
Instead, the judge compared elements of the displays and ruled that most
were not original to Apple or were covered by a prior licensing agreement
between Apple and Microsoft.
However, the judge has now reluctantly agreed to Apple's request that he
review his decision. He said that he was 'inclined to reject the motion for
reconsideration out of hand'. Nonetheless, recognising the importance of the
case to the entire computer industry, he granted Apple's request.
However lawyers for Microsoft and HP said that they were not concerned by
the judge's decision. 'This is just a stay of execution,' said one of HP's
attorneys.

The Banesto bid follows hard on the heels of two others: Ciments Francais,

of Cementos Rezola, in the Basque country, which it does not control and
Portland Navarra is bidding for 10 per cent of the Cantabrian producer,
Cementos Alfa, in order to control it.
With its Pta10,000 a share bid for the rest of Sanson offering a premium of

the bid seems certain to succeed, analysts said.

TRACTEBEL, Belgium's electricity company, has breached the barriers
preventing foreign entry into Spain's utility sector by paying Pta18bn
(Dollars 178m) for 3 per cent of Iberdrola, the blue chip privately-owned
group that controls some 30 per cent of domestic generating capacity.
The acquisition forms part of a global industrial co-operation agreement
between the two companies and was engineered by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV),
the Spanish retail bank. BBV has strengthened its position as Iberdrola's
chief shareholder by raising its holding by 2.5 per cent to 10 per cent.
The Spanish bank's role in the deal, and its increased investment in
Iberdrola, appear to have allayed the fears of the industry ministry which
at the end of last year blocked a share swap agreement between Tractebel and
the domestic utility that would have given each a 5 per cent stake in the
other's business.
Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, had conditioned that agreement
to the creation of a strong domestic shareholder block in Iberdrola for the
latter's equity is widely spread while Tractebel is 40 per cent owned by
Societe Generale de Belgique.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Europe's computer champion on
the ropes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that in the creation of Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems (SNI)
Germany - and Europe - might have a computer champion able to hold its own
with the cream of the US and Japanese manufacturers have taken a battering
over the past 18 months.
Formed in late 1990 through the merger of Siemens' computer division with
Nixdorf Computer, the fallen star of German information technology, the new
company had expected to return an operating profit by the end of 1991.
Earlier this year, however, Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, the company's chief
executive, warned that SNI will still be in the red at the end of its
current financial year, which ends in September, despite healthy
improvements in sales. Its ability to cut its losses, moreover, will remain
hostage to improvements in the general economic situation, he said.
However, many people believe that SNI can still form the nucleus of a
Europe-owned computer industry, and Siemens is committed to the company,
arguing that data processing is a core technology in electronics. Mr Wiedig,
underlines the position: 'We want to return to the black as soon as
possible, but if in two or three years we have not done that, we will not
sell the business.'
Siemens acquired Nixdorf two years ago to save the ailing minicomputer
manufacturer from financial collapse. Failing to anticipate the sudden
overall downturn in computer sales, Nixdorf's revenues slipped quickly out
of line with expenses. In the year prior to the takeover, losses amounted to
just over DM1bn.
Siemens, on the other hand, is the powerhouse of European electronics, a
company even the mighty International Business Machines feels comfortable
with as a partner in semiconductor research; its computer group, focusing on
the needs of large companies, made a profit of DM700m (Dollars 432m) in
1990.
Furthermore, Siemens has deep pockets and, contrary to rumours that the
marriage was a shotgun affair, was eager to take advantage of Nixdorf's
international marketing network and its contacts with smaller companies. The
new company, with 50,000 employees and revenues in excess of DM12bn, is the
world's eighth largest. Its product line includes mainframe computers,
mid-range systems, personal computers and workstations and it spends some 14
per cent of revenues on research and development. It has excellent
opportunities to open up new markets in the east of Germany and in eastern
Europe.
So why have expectations of an early return to profitability been so
comprehensively dashed? Mr Wiedig points to three factors working against
the immediate success of the new company.
First, although it was not immediately apparent at the time, SNI was born at
the beginning of the worst year in modern computing history, when aggregate
results for the world's 10 top companies showed both reduced revenues and
losses. 'It is important to carry out mergers when economic conditions are
positive,' Mr Wiedig says, arguing that sales growth creates an aura of
success which helps to weld the company together.
Second, there was a significant cultural difference between the two
partners. Siemens had specialised in building data processing systems for
large customers while Nixdorf's expertise lay in developing solutions to the
computing problems of small and medium customers.
This gap was not helped by feelings of resentment on the Siemens side that
the performance of the new company was prejudiced by Nixdorf's continuing
losses, or bewilderment from former Nixdorf employees who found it difficult
to come to terms with their reduced status in the German computing
hierarchy.
Third, the business procedures and computing systems used by the two
companies were very different, leading, in the first months at any rate, to
lost and delayed orders.
'It took time to bring our internal data processing together,' Mr Wiedig
says. 'Data processing systems make a company more productive, but in the
two companies there were 200 different systems. Now we have created a lot of
data processing bridges.' It may be a further three years before complete
compatibility is established.
'Every procedure had to be newly created by combining elements from the two
partners. It was difficult and with the industry in a poor state, people
became disillusioned. They started enthusiastically, but then reality struck
home.'
'That phase is now over. There is still some merging of mental attitudes,
but for most employees, that should be complete by the end of the year.'
The measures SNI is taking to restore profitability differ little from those
of its leading competitors. They include the reduction of 4,000 jobs, or 8
per cent of the workforce, between June 1991 and September this year,
together with a reduction in manufacturing capacity, rationalisation in
production and cost cutting. The aim is to save some DM600m annually, while
halving the DM781m loss recorded in 1991.
In the first quarter of the current year, sales rose 26 per cent to DM3.8bn
while orders rose 14 per cent to DM3.7bn. The results are encouraging for
those who believe that Europe should maintain a strong manufacturing
presence in the computer industry, among them Mr Wiedig who argues that if
Europe is to remain competitive, it has to retain key skills including
semiconductor technology and data processing.
'At present we are simply inviting Japan to take the lead in all the key
technologies but if we change our attitude they will change theirs.
'We do have to find new rules for the game; Europe has resources, demand and
skills, but it lacks co-ordination.' Mr Wiedig is less exact about where the
initiative should come from but agrees it could be from Brussels, from the
computer industry or from a single company. An example of the kind of
co-ordination he seeks is, perhaps, the plan by SNI, Olivetti of Italy and
Groupe Bull of France to develop Community-wide computer networks to tackle
cross-border issues.
'Europe cannot afford to lose the third industrial revolution,' Mr Wiedig
avers. 'In agriculture, it takes half a day to turn a camping meadow into a
potato field; but in information technology the position, once lost, will
not be repairable within 10 years.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Guarded optimism at Yorklyde
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorklyde, the Huddersfield-based woollen and worsted cloth manufacturer,
reported profits of Pounds 1.52m pre-tax for the 12 months to January 31.
The outcome - down from Pounds 1.82m last time - came on turnover ahead 14
per cent to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 9.92m). Mr Charles Brook, chairman, said
the 'satisfactory' result reflected a period of severe recession.
There was guarded optimism of an upturn in trading conditions, although this
was likely to be gradual, he said.
Earnings per share dipped from 25.2p to 21.2p. The final dividend is held at
5.7p for a maintained total of 9.7p.

Firstland Group, formerly Firstland Oil &amp; Gas, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 743,000 for the 1991 year.
The figure included an exceptional provision of Pounds 301,000 against a
disposal of shares in Explaura, the limestone extraction group. Losses for
the previous year amounted to Pounds 3.39m including exceptionals of Pounds
2.8m.
Turnover totalled Pounds 393,000 (Pounds 563,000) and losses per share
emerged at 3.34p (15.42p).
The group, quoted on the USM, recently announced a refinancing package and
appointed a new management team. It intends to diversify away from its oil
and gas interests and is currently looking at the areas of packaging,
distribution and specialist engineering.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Investment Trust, which has total assets of Pounds 590m, saw its net
asset value rise to 821p per share over the 12 months to March 31.
That represented a 3.1 per cent increase over the 796p at March 31 1991, and
compared with falls of 1.8 per cent in the FT-A All-Share Index and 2.5 per
cent in the MSCI World Index, said Sir Colin Barker, chairman.
The trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, has 65 per cent (67 per cent)
of its portfolio in the UK, 13 per cent (12 per cent) in Europe, and an
unchanged 9 per cent in the US.
Net revenue attributable to ordinary holders came to Pounds 13.4m (Pounds
16.4m) after tax, minorities and a Pounds 1.37m exceptional charge on
revaluation of property.
Earnings per share were 21.5p (26.3p) and the dividend for the year is held
at 22.5p with an unchanged final of 13p.
A subdivision of shares - from 25p to 5p - is proposed to improve
marketability.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Greenalls improves 7% to Pounds 26m -
Expanding pub chain outperforms local rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALLS Group, the Lancashire-based pubs and hotels operator, achieved a 7
per cent increase, to Pounds 25.8m, in pre-tax profits for the half year to
March 27.
Mr Andrew Thomas, managing director, said the business climate 'continues to
be difficult. We have not seen any sign of a real upturn in consumer
spending.'
Trading profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 23.9m on the back of a 5.6
per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 238.2m.
Fully diluted earnings rose from 11.7p to 12.5p and the interim dividend is
increased to 4.84p - a 10 per cent rise on last time's 4.4p.
In spite of the recession, the group's 1,368 pubs raised operating profits
by 7.6 per cent to Pounds 20.7m, outperforming the industry in its trading
area.
Drinks sales were 3.5 per cent higher though volumes were down overall by
nearly 6 per cent.
Food sales grew some 24 per cent, partly reflecting an increase in the
number of managed food houses.
Nearly Pounds 9m was spent on pub refurbishment, and the 40 pubs acquired
from Allied-Lyons for Pounds 10.2m at the end of March were expected to
boost the estate's second half performance.
Operating profits from the 104 catering inns and restaurants were 42 per
cent higher at Pounds 3.1m. Another 13 establishments were being developed
as part of the division's expansion programme.
Profits from Cellar 5, the off-licence chain, advanced from Pounds 1.45m to
Pounds 1.81m. The operation has yet to feel the full benefits of the 187
Blayney shops bought from Vaux.
The drinks and services division, encompassing amusement machines and drinks
distribution and wholesaling, raised profits by 8.6 per cent to Pounds
3.42m.
Trading conditions continued difficult for De Vere hotels in the UK.
Operating profits declined 11 per cent to Pounds 6.08m as occupancy rates
fell from 57 per cent to 53 per cent.
Advance bookings for the autumn have been improving, however, and the
operation is expected to benefit in the second half from a new hotel at
Swindon, and the recently-opened golf hotel in Cheshire.
Losses in the US hotels operation were cut from Pounds 959,000 to Pounds
677,000.
Profits from the disposal of properties fell from Pounds 2.89m to Pounds
1.96m, reflecting the group's decision to curtail sales until the market
improves.
Net debt stands at Pounds 213m, representing 26.6 per cent of shareholders'
funds.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: TransTec seeks Pounds 24m to expand and
cancel debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSFER Technology Group, formerly Central &amp; Sheerwood and headed by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell before reorganisation and the decision to concentrate
on specialised engineering, yesterday announced three acquisitions and a
Pounds 23.9m rights issue.
As well as funding the purchases, the cash call will eliminate group debt
currently between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m.
BEW (Auto Products), Earby Light Engineers and Raycon Corporation - the
companies being acquired - would 'contribute significantly to TransTec's
planned growth as an important supplier to the automotive and aerospace
industries', said Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman.
They will cost TransTec a combined Pounds 7.65m, plus dividends of Pounds
1.8m paid on completion to the vendors of BEW and Earby. TransTec is also
assuming borrowings of Pounds 9m, resulting in a total bill of about Pounds
18.5m.
Up to 6.23m shares will be allotted on a 1-for-2 basis at 400p each, a
discount to last night's 485p close, up 2p on the day. Joint underwriters
are Charterhouse Bank, the group's advisers, and Credit Lyonnais Laing,
broker to the issue.
Consideration for BEW, which is a high volume machinist of aluminium and
iron castings, is Pounds 4.63m, with Pounds 4.58m in cash and the balance as
an unsecured loan note; it is a customer of AL Dunn and competitor to
Coventry Apex, the two companies in TransTec's automotive division.
Mr Neil Logue, TransTec finance director, said the annual turnovers of BEW
and Apex were about Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m respectively. When brought
together, he was looking for a combined figure of about Pounds 80m. Although
the BEW name would be retained, he said, the company's management would not.
This contrasts with Earby, which is keeping its management. The company,
which will cost Pounds 2.18m cash, makes high precision components for the
aerospace industry and Rolls-Royce in particular. It has no US sales. Mr
Logue said the vertical integration of Amchem, TransTec's aerospace
subsidiary which has links with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the
US, into Earby would enable the division to manufacture complete engine
blades.
Raycon is a US-based manufacturer of electro-discharge and laser machining
systems for both the automotive and aerospace industries. The consideration
is Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 840,000) cash.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Barlo launches conditional IPounds 22m
offer for IRG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BARLO GROUP, the Irish-based radiator manufacturer, yesterday announced an
IPounds 21.7m (Pounds 19.7m) bid for IRG, a plastic packaging business with
manufacturing plants in the Irish Republic, the UK and Belgium.
At current prices, the share-exchange terms of 55 Barlo shares for every 20
IRG ordinary value the latter at 143p, a premium of 6 per cent on the last
dealt price and of 50 per cent on the price at April 9, the day prior to
Barlo acquiring 14.89 per cent of IRG.
About 35.8m Barlo shares would be issued, representing 32 per cent of the
enlarged capital.
Barlo said its offer was conditional on irrevocable commitments being made
on a further 15 per cent of IRG shares by 5pm today, which would bring its
stake to 29.9 per cent.
The bid is also conditional on the IRG accounts for 1991 showing pre-tax
profits 'not less than IPounds 1.8m and total borrowings not exceeding
IPounds 15m'.
IRG has yet to announce those results, but local analysts expect profits of
IPounds 2.2m and earnings per share of 12.5p.
Barlo proposes to raise Pounds 10m through a placing on the offer being
declared unconditional in all respects; an open offer will made to
shareholders. This is expected to reduce the estimated IPounds 15m debt of
IRG.
Earlier this month Barlo reported a return to profits for the year to March
31 1992, following two years of losses, and despite a continuing recession
in the UK construction industry.
This has been largely attributed to the rationalisation carried out by the
new management team put together under Mr Tony Mullins, managing director
since September 1990.
It is this expertise which Barlo hopes to apply to its target should the bid
be successful.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Avon Rubber motors ahead 15% to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER PRICES and a shift in the sourcing policies of vehicle manufacturers
is benefiting Avon Rubber, the components and tyre manufacturer which
yesterday revealed a 15 per cent increase in interim profits from Pounds
3.58m to Pounds 4.1m.
Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said manufacturers were focusing on
longer-term relationships with fewer suppliers. This, and other factors, had
helped Avon increase profitability in every division except industrial
polymers, which suffered a sharp drop in sales following the end of
hostilities in the Middle East.
However, the pre-tax line was also buoyed by a fall in interest charges from
Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 1.91m. Turnover rose by less than 1 per cent to
Pounds 115m (Pounds 114m) for the six months to March 28. The dividend is
maintained at 5p, payable from earnings 31 per cent higher at 11.1p (8.5p).
Mr Mitchard said the second half was likely to show further improvement. The
benefits of last year's Pounds 5.8m charge for reorganisation were coming
through and sales were also showing signs of life in the UK and France.
Meanwhile, a decline in defence-related sales hit profits at the industrial
polymers division. The operating return plunged 52 per cent to Pounds 2.6m
on sales 19 per cent lower at Pounds 44.7m. The tyre business - which
focuses on high performance products for the racing industry - more than
doubled profits to Pounds 1.8m, helped by higher prices.
COMMENT
Few had expected that Avon could improve on the windfalls from last year's
hostilities in the Middle East. The trick was in bringing debt and interest
payments down, offsetting higher depreciation charges. The future looks
encouraging for Avon, which is spending more than ever - some Pounds 15.5m -
on capital expenditure. Also, rationalisation measures promise significant
benefits until 1994. All that aside, yesterday's sharp rise in the share
price appears to have taken the flavour out of the stock for the moment. The
shares closed 24p up at 459p, and look up with events on profit forecasts of
Pounds 8.5m for 1992. The prospective p/e of 16 times appears expensive in
the short term, but the shares are still a long way from the peak of 859p
achieved in 1987.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lower new vehicle sales cut Frank Gates to
Pounds 1.32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANK G GATES, the east London-based Ford dealer, yesterday announced a 45
per cent drop in 1991 pre-tax profit, from Pounds 2.39m to Pounds 1.32m, and
a dividend cut.
The share price shed 8p to close at 71p.
Turnover fell from Pounds 70m to Pounds 56.3m. The company said about half
of this was caused by the fall in new vehicle sales, with the rest split
between used cars and the effect of selling most of the contract hire
business in 1990.
Car sales had suffered mainly from the shrinking of the new car market, with
a little extra disadvantage from Ford's declining share.
Trading profit fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.34m, mainly because of the
slump in new cars. Profits from used cars and parts and servicing were
similar to 1990.
As the group had rid itself of Pounds 6m borrowings linked to contract hire,
interest costs plummeted from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 163,000. This meant
that the profit figure was about Pounds 140,000 up before exceptional gains.
In 1990 these amounted to Pounds 1.37m because of the disposal.
By the year-end, net debt had grown to Pounds 3.5m, about 15 per cent
gearing, following investment in a large site at Bishop's Stortford,
Hertfordshire.
The group only pays a final dividend and this was cut by 18 per cent to
2.25p, in line with the fall in after-tax profit. The Gates family, other
directors and connections own about 56 per cent of the equity.
On a lower tax rate, earnings per share were 4.87p (6.51p).

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Diploma holds steady at Pounds 6.2m despite
sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIPLOMA, the electronics, building components and special steels group,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits marginally lower at Pounds 6.2m, despite
a drop from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds 61.9m in turnover.
Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said that although it had 'been a long,
hard recession exacerbated by many false dawns', he believed that conditions
in the period under review were 'worse and more difficult to manage' than in
the corresponding six months.
On the building components side, IG Lintels achieved a 'marginal
improvement' and Mr Thomas said that IG had increased its market share from
25 to 35 per cent in the past 2 1/2 years.
Profits at Robert Lee, the distributor of plumbing fittings and 'as near to
the high street as we get', were down by one third in the 'worst conditions
in 20 years'.
Witham's, in the steels division, was 'substantially down' though still in
the black. It was hit by recession in France, where it has 25 per cent of
its turnover, and by low spending in the oil sector.
Mr Thomas said that in electronics 30 per cent of orders were now 'design
won'. Macro had a good first half with sales up 10 per cent and a 25 per
cent increase to the bottom line.
Because of Diploma's good cash flow, Mr Thomas said he wanted to re-balance
the interim and final dividends: so the interim is lifted to 2.75p (2.25p),
payable from earnings of 7.3p (7.5p) per share.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.7m. Of this, Pounds 1.1m
related to the loss on the disposal of the ECS stake and an equivalent
amount is debited from shareholders' funds. The remaining Pounds 2.6m -
goodwill which was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition  - is
now written back.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BICC rights to raise Pounds 154m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the cables and construction group, yesterday launched the first large
rights issue since the general election triggered a sharp rise in the stock
market.
The FT-SE 100 index has gone up by nearly 12 per cent since April 9. BICC
shares had gained 10 per cent before yesterday's announcement of the Pounds
154m issue at 285p a share.
The news was not unexpected and BICC's share price advanced 9p to close at
356p.
It was helped by the group's statement that it intended to hold the dividend
at 19.25p.
Equity analysts have been expecting a wave of rights issues since the market
started to rise, although there is some doubt as to whether the total for
this year will match last year's record Pounds 9.26bn.
BICC's issue, on a 1-for-5 basis, takes this year's running total over the
Pounds 1bn mark.
Mr Robin Biggam, chairman, said the money would be used partly to expand the
cables businesses in continental Europe and North America and partly to
reduce debt.
Negotiations were fairly advanced on one US purchase. The fragmented North
American industry, badly affected by recession and price pressures last
year, was ripe for regrouping and companies could now be bought relatively
cheaply.
On the Continent, BICC had already announced the acquisition of KWO in what
used to be East Germany and was considering other purchases.
Mr Biggam estimated that about half the rights issue proceeds would be used
for acquisitions this year.
The immediate effect will be to strengthen the balance sheet. December's net
debt of Pounds 35m has had Pounds 90m added to it by the inclusion of Grupo
Espanol General Cable, in which BICC now has a majority stake.
There remains nearly Pounds 100m of off-balance sheet debt, mainly
associated with a joint property venture at Spitalfields on the edge of the
City.
BICC also has Pounds 177m of convertible capital bonds which it counted as
equity, rather than debt, in arriving at year-end shareholders' funds of
Pounds 685m.
Last year the group, which also owns the Balfour Beatty construction
company, suffered a 56 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Pounds 81m after
Pounds 42m of property write-downs and provisions for losses on the Channel
tunnel contract.
The exceptional charges knocked nearly 15p off earnings per share, which at
10.7p fell well short of covering the dividend.
The rights issue will add more than Pounds 10m to the dividend bill of
Pounds 54m, largely paid out of reserves last year, and will aggravate the
problem of unrelieved ACT.
On current trading, BICC said there had been no first-quarter improvement in
its main markets. However, operating cashflow was up on last year. Some
signs of recovery had been detected in the US and the outlook in the UK had
become more encouraging, although little impact was expected before next
year.

<TEXT>
The chairman of Wescol, the loss-making structural engineer which came to
the USM three years ago, is to resign as part of a top-level management
shake-up aimed at strengthening the company's board.
Mr John Hicks said yesterday that he wanted to devote more time to other
interests. Mr Barry Anysz, a non-executive director, will become acting
chairman until a permanent replacement is announced sometime in the next few
weeks.
Wescol, which fell into difficulties following the collapse of Rush &amp;
Tompkins and two other big debtors, also announced the appointment of two
former Tarmac employees - Mr Alan Riddle and Mr David Sutton - as chief
executive and business development director respectively.
Mr Riddle said the appointments were not a rescue of the heavily-indebted
group. 'We are not company doctors,' he said. 'We see this as a very
positive move, adding our skills to those of the existing board.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Heavy UK losses peg Allied Irish Banks'
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY LOSSES in the commercial mortgage lending business in the UK
restricted pre-tax profits growth at Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's leading
financial services group, in the year ended March 31 1992.
Profits came to IPounds 185.8m (Pounds 168.5m). That represented an increase
of 4 per cent on the previous IPounds 178.8m, after allowing for a 2 per
cent rise in bad debts provision to IPounds 178.3m (IPounds 174m).
In Ireland and US the divisions both performed well showing strong profits
growth - the former was up 9 per cent while the US was 1 1/2 times greater.
The UK division, however, increased its losses from IPounds 4.9m to IPounds
47m which, according to Mr Gerald Scanlan, group chief executive, 'was due
to a very high bad debt charge resulting from a recession which has been the
deepest and most prolonged since the war'.
He said 30 per cent of the IPounds 750m UK loan portfolio to the small
business sector was presently non-performing; that was a 65 per cent
increase on the previous year. The bank specialises in giving commercial
property loans to restaurants, pubs and hotels.
'We expect the situation in Britain to remain difficult through the coming
year,' said Mr Scanlan.
The bank currently had 200 specialist financial staff working with its
customers facing difficulties in the UK 'to keep them up and running. Our
experience has been that it is very difficult to sell a business once the
door is shut'. The non-performing loans were being handled by the specialist
workout unit, while the profitable business had been placed with its 35
branches in the UK which 'continued to show a profit last year'.
Mr Scanlan said there had been an overhaul of operations in the UK, with
lay-offs of 300 out of the 1,400 staff 'from all levels from the chief
executive down' and which he said would result in the division moving to a
'more focused operation'. He anticipated pre-tax profits of IPounds 35m from
the UK division 'within two years'.
Group total assets increased by 2.2 per cent to IPounds 18.2bn (IPounds
17.9bn), and it's Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio, as defined by the Bank of
International Settlements, hads remained at 6.6 per cent - that, Mr Scanlan
pointed out, was currently better than most of the UK clearing banks.
Earnings per share were 16.1p (15.2p), and the dividend is lifted to 8.25p
(7.75p) through a final of 4.65p.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mountleigh defers pref dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTLEIGH, the property and retail company, yesterday underlined its
parlous financial state by deferring the Pounds 4.3m dividend on its Pounds
83m of convertible preference shares.
With debts of more than Pounds 500m the company is trying to reach an
agreement with its banks and bond holders over a financial restructuring.
Matters are likely to come to a head before May 27, when it is due to redeem
Pounds 40m of Swiss bonds. A further Pounds 35m of bonds are due to be
redeemed in June.
Its ability to meet those obligations have been damaged by failure to clinch
the sale of its Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands to
Hammerson, the UK property company, and the O'Connor Group, a US pension
fund adviser. The deal, which would have brought in Pounds 125m, fell
through at the end of last month.
That failure was partly due to the likelihood that the shopping centre was
built on contaminated land. The risks of investing in blighted areas have
become more prominent because the government is considering bringing in a
register of contaminated land.
Mountleigh's negotiations with its creditors are headed by a banker, Mr
Steven Gerard, who became chief executive early last month. Mr Gerard, a
former senior executive at Citbank, one of Mountleigh's largest lenders,
said he aimed to implement a 'strategically focused operating and financial
plan which will be satisfactory to all creditors'.
The announcement that the preference dividends would be deferred was
expected by the City and Mountleigh's shares closed at 6 3/4 p, up 1/2p.

Guinness has established a subsidiary in South Africa to expand its
distribution in the continent's biggest beer market.
From later this year Guinness stout will be brewed and distributed under
licence by South African Breweries.
For almost two years, limited distribution in South Africa has been handled
through Namibia Breweries, which brews and distributes the product in a
number of African markets.
Mr Alfons Walser, managing director of the new subsidiary, said yesterday:
'We believe the timing is right for us now to become directly involved in
the marketing of the Guinness brand in South Africa.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: New chief takes relaxed hold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN Schofield, the newly-appointed chief executive at MTM, looked
surprisingly relaxed yesterday afternoon after unveiling the chemical
group's dire and long-awaited results.
One reason for his relaxed state is the knowledge that he can start with a
clean sheet and with no responsibility for the present predicament.
That is no bad thing. MTM's stock market problems began in March with a
profits warning only days before it was due to announce its results. The
auditors, Binder Hamlyn, had problems with the application of some of the
accounting standards.
Analysts and the City were reassured, however, that there would be no impact
on trading. Five days later , MTM was forced to make a second profits
warning, this time suggesting that pre-tax profits would be 'significantly'
lower than the City's expectation of Pounds 23m.
What lay behind the fall appears to have been an inability of Mr Richard
Lines, the founder chairman, to accept that the company he had successfully
built had a trading problem and would not meet what he had promised
shareholders at last year's rights issue.
He had promised profits of Pounds 23m on turnover of Pounds 125m - a result
that would have confirmed the wisdom of launching a Pounds 49m rights issue
for the Pounds 62.5m acquisition of Hardwicke in the US.
The shortfall in profits and turnover was a shock to managers, says Mr
Schofield. Management information systems fell apart after August. After
that date, the line managers never saw the management accounts. They and
non-executive directors were not in a position to question the trading
position.
'It's difficult when there is a strong, persuasive CEO who is seen to be
successful,' explained Mr Schofield yesterday. 'How do you sign off from
success?'
Mr Schofield is also relaxed because he believes that he has sold to the
banks the bones of his strategy to save the company. When he has fleshed his
ideas out, he expects the banks to extend the credit lines until next
January. He insists that the business is essentially sound and there are no
rotten apples in the barrel. The main priority will be to reduce
indebtedness, from about Pounds 106m at present to some Pounds 50m.
Some businesses will be sold, admits Mr Schofield. However, he insists that
the company is not bleeding money and there is no need for fire-sales.
The company is anxious to obtain good prices for disposals, which cannot be
achieved quickly. It was on the speed and scale of disposals that he
disagreed with the Postern, the corporate management specialists called in
to form a strategy for the group. He says they wanted to sell the group's
crown jewels.
Mr Schofield's plan also consists of focusing MTM on three core areas -
research, fine chemicals and speciality chemicals. Mr Schofield expects the
research side of the business to be a stand-alone operation by the end of
the year and cash-neutral for the next 18 months. He also plans to build up
larger inventories, so the business can be more responsive to customer
needs.
The fine chemicals business, particularly in the US, is also sound, says Mr
Schofield. Although some of the businesses were running at only 50 per cent
capacity earlier this year, he is confident that they will reach 85 per cent
soon.
The speciality chemicals business are highly cash-generative, he says. They
require little capital investment, but expertise from qualified staff. He
maintains that there has been no outflow of staff since the onset of the
group's difficulties. However, he believes there had been a severe lowering
of morale, which he expects to deal with by visiting the sites.
'Over 10 working days I've been with the company, I've been dealing almost
exclusively with the outside world. I now need to visit some plants.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BP share registration unit moved in Pounds
25m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM is transferring responsibility for its share register to
Computer Management Group, the information technology consultants, in a deal
worth Pounds 25m over the next five years.
The contract is the first to be signed since BP announced last month that it
was cutting its corporate staff by 700 as part of a plan to save Pounds 415m
a year. The package involved 250 redundancies, but BP said it hoped that 400
other employees would find jobs in companies to whom work was contracted
out.
All 62 staff in the share registration unit will transfer to CMG, although
remaining in BP's Harlow office.
BP said the move ensured that costs could be cut while maintaining standards
of service. Its share register is one of the largest and most diverse in the
UK, with 550,000 shareholders, quarterly dividends, and 12 employee share
schemes worldwide.
CMG has provided a supporting service to BP for more than 25 years. It
handles share registration for other companies, including Legal &amp; General
and British Airways.
Mr Ron White, UK chairman of CMG said the advent of Taurus, the automated
share dealing system being introduced next year in London would increase the
need for companies to have efficient and cost-effective share registration
services.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: SFO becomes involved as MTM reveals Pounds
20.6m pre-tax deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office has become involved in the investigation into MTM,
the specialist chemicals company where the share price collapsed in March
leading to the resignation of Mr Richard Lines, founder chairman, and the
finance director.
A report by Binder Hamlyn, MTM's auditors, is to be forwarded to the SFO,
probably by next week.
Mr Ken Schofield, chief executive, who took over from Mr Lines 10 days ago,
said the SFO's position is that it wanted to look at the report following a
Stock Exchange insider trading investigation into the company.
The Binder Hamlyn report reveals transactions that were 'incorrectly
recorded' last year and in 1990 which boosted sales and possibly profits.
During 1991, Mr Lines sold 3.3m shares at over 200p, a price that analysts
believe would not have prevailed had the revised figures reported yesterday
been available at the time.
Yesterday's long-awaited 1991 results were worse than expected.
On an unaudited basis, pre-tax and pre-exceptional profits for 1991 were
Pounds 5.14m, down from Pounds 9.75m the previous year. This 1990 figure was
itself revised down from Pounds 13.5m to take account of the questionable
transactions.
Mr Schofield said these transactions involved MTM selling chemicals to a
bank at the year-end and recording them as sales. He would not say how much
similar transactions affected sales and profits last year but said there
were 'a whole raft of items.'
In addition, MTM has taken a Pounds 25.7m exceptional item. This included a
Pounds 17.5m provision to revalue assets to true market value.
As a result, pre-tax losses were Pounds 20.6m, down from an adjusted Pounds
7.9m on sales of Pounds 104m.
The company also incurred an interest charge of Pounds 7.39m on debt that
ended the year at Pounds 85m but which has subsequently grown to Pounds
109m. Debt rose partly to reverse Pounds 7.1m of sales which were taken last
year and should have fallen in 1992.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Crown Communications' French network for
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROWN Communications, the loss-making commercial radio group which owns LBC,
is believed to be trying to sell or find partners for its stake in RFM, the
French Radio Network.
Crown officially owns 40 per cent of the RFM network which has 89 radio
stations throughout France, but has effective managerial control.
Mr Christopher Chataway, Crown chairman, acknowledges in the annual report
for the year to September 1991, published yesterday, that audience figures
have yet to reflect the development of RFM.
The group incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 7.52m for the year.
Mr Chataway also warns that the group will report another significant loss
in the first half of the current year although the trading outlook continues
to improve.
Crown's auditors, Price Waterhouse, say they believe there are adequate
financial resources available for the foreseeable future.
They auditors note that the Crown directors have recently extended their
bank facilities ' but in the medium-term expect to effect asset sales and/or
other measures to reduce the group's borrowings.'
The French stake is Crown's main remaining non--core business.
Price Waterhouse has also qualified how some aspects of the RFM investment
is stated in the accounts.
During the year Crown increased its intangible fixed assets from Pounds
1.59m to Pounds 12.75m.
The auditors added: 'In addition, we are unable to determine whether the
investment in RFM amounting to Pounds 16.04m is fairly stated.

FT  14 MAY 92 / The awesome power of a Triple-A: Richard Waters on the
impact of the credit rating agencies on the financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Church Street in Manhattan, in a building sandwiched between City Hall
and the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, a small group of people met
recently to decide on a matter of vital importance to a bank on the other
side of the Atlantic. The question: should Swiss Bank Corporation, one of
the three mighty and secretive Swiss banks, remain one of the world's tiny
band of top-rated financial institutions?
The meeting took place at the offices of Moody's Investors Service, which,
alongside Standard &amp; Poor's, is one of only two credit rating agencies with
worldwide recognition.
Among those present were Mr Ken Pinkes, responsible for the 42 analysts in
Moody's financial institutions group, and Mr Don Noe, head of the agency's
international side. With them was Mr Tom McGuire, head of all Moody's
corporate ratings.
Together, they represent one of the most powerful groups in the
international financial markets. Their judgments on the standing of banks
and other entities around the world determine how much it costs companies
and governments to borrow money.
In the event, the meeting decided to back the judgment of its young analyst,
Mr John Kriz, a banking specialist who has been with Moody's for seven
years. His view: that SBC should lose its cherished triple-A rating. The men
on Church Street had reached a similar decision weeks before about Credit
Suisse. That leaves only two European banks - Deutsche Bank and Union Bank
of Switzerland - with an undisputed triple-A seal of approval.
The Moody's decision, announced on Tuesday, comes in the week that rival S&amp;P
decided to confirm its triple-A rating of all three big Swiss banks. The
differences in the two agencies' views are stark. According to Moody's,
there has been a 'recent material deterioration' in SBC's loan book. S&amp;P
thought otherwise. 'Loan and asset quality are sound,' it said.
This difference of view is important because both have had access to
information hidden from investors. In the case of the Swiss banks, this
includes details of their hidden reserves.
As a result, the financial markets follow their judgments almost slavishly.
Lower-rated borrowers pay higher interest rates in the debt markets. As the
chart shows, this is particularly true during recessions, when concern about
credit quality becomes most acute. When the agencies disagree, the markets
feel uncertain. Investors and other financial institutions are left to guess
at what has happened. 'I just wonder if Moody's has discovered some
undisclosed problem in their (SBC's) loan book,' said the head of credit at
one large bank in London.
A less sinister explanation is the heavy subjective element that enters all
ratings decisions. Both Moody's and S&amp;P have well-established methods for
assessing a company's financial health, and S&amp;P even publishes guidelines of
how financial ratios affect a company's rating.
S&amp;P is widely regarded as being more scientific in its approach to ratings,
relying heavily on the results of intensive number-crunching, while Moody's
is said to take a broader view of a company and its environment. In
practice, though, both rely ultimately on the judgments of their analysts.
Not everyone is happy about their power. Bond market professionals complain
that agencies react too late to factors which affect a company's credit
standing. Naturally enough, companies which receive poor ratings complain
bitterly, often adding that, being based in the US, the two global agencies
simply don't understand non-US businesses.
Concern about their power has percolated into the US political arena.
Congressman John Dingell, chairman of the powerful House energy and commerce
committee, is pressing for regulatory oversight of their activities. The
agencies, along with four other smaller companies, enjoy the privilege of
recognition from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, giving their
ratings powerful standing. Yet the SEC does not vet the agencies at all.
Similar concerns could migrate to Europe. French and UK regulators already
officially recognise several rating agencies.
The EC is about to do the same: its proposed directive on the capital
backing needed by securities companies, to be agreed by the end of next
month, explicitly recognises the ratings of bonds and other debt market
securities.
The EC's recognition of rating agencies is likely to give another push to
attempts to develop European-based companies with the power to rival the
global giants of the business. IBCA, a London-based agency and one of the
six recognised in the US, has established a strong reputation around the
world.
Bertelsmann, the German media group, is now considering taking a majority
stake in a new venture being planned by a powerful group of German banks and
companies. 'It could fit in with our range of activities and make sense for
us,' the company said yesterday. If it decides to act, Bertelsmann will
enter a field dominated by publishing groups - McGraw Hill, which owns S&amp;P,
and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, owner of Moody's. Only companies which are distant
from the financial institutions, such as media groups, are generally
considered to have the independence to run a rating agency. It could be that
only Bertelsmann has the muscle to challenge US control of the business.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Sainsbury profits rise 21% to Pounds 628m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. SAINSBURY, the supermarket group, has overtaken Marks and Spencer as the
most profitable UK retailer, announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 628m for
the year to March 14, a rise of 21.2 per cent. The group's shares rose 20p
to 459p on the news.
Lord Sainsbury, chairman and chief executive who confirmed that he would
retire in November on his 65th birthday, said that when he became chairman
in 1969, M and S made profits nine times those of Sainsbury. In 1969
Sainsbury's annual profits were Pounds 4.3m - or Pounds 33m at 1992 prices -
and the group had 244 shops, of which only a third were self-service
supermarkets.
Lord Sainsbury, who will become the group's president, said that over the
past 20 years the compound growth rate of profits was 23 per cent a year.
He said the 1991-92 figures represented a 'very good year's performance' and
although he felt the economy was improving, 'I do not see any concrete signs
of recovery'.
The group's share of the retail market for food, drink, toiletries,
confectionery, tobacco and newspapers had risen from 10 per cent to 10.4 per
cent, a greater increase than that achieved by Tesco or Safeway, while Asda
and Gateway, the other leading supermarket groups, had lost market share.
Lord Sainsbury also said that the opening of a third of the shops on Sunday
had increased the group's trade. Mr David Sainsbury, Lord Sainsbury's
cousin, who is to take over as chairman and chief executive, said Sunday
trading had been marginally profitable.
Group sales for the year were 12.2 per cent higher at Pounds 9.2bn, and
operating profits rose 14.1 per cent to Pounds 667.7m.
Following the Pounds 489m rights issue last June there was interest
receivable of Pounds 12.7m (against Pounds 35.6m payable last time), with
the rights money accounting for Pounds 33m of the improvement.
The group is setting aside Pounds 49.4m for profit sharing among 74,000 of
the staff. Before property items costing Pounds 4.2m, pre-tax profits were
25 per cent higher at Pounds 632.2m. Fully diluted earnings per share,
before the property items, rose 17 per cent to 25.43p and a final dividend
of 6.35p gives a total of 8.75p, an increase of 20.4 per cent.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Ratners to take extra Pounds 53m charge: John Thornhill on
restructuring costs at troubled jewellery chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS GROUP, the troubled jewellery chain, is finalising plans for a
sweeping restructuring of its operations and announced yesterday it would
take an extra Pounds 53m exceptional charge this year to cover the
anticipated costs, bringing the total to Pounds 98m.
The company was forced to make the announcement after disclosing its plans
to bankers while renegotiating its credit lines.
Ratners stressed the company's financial position was not in jeopardy and
strongly denied the review might lead to the departure of Mr Gerald Ratner,
its controversial chief executive.
Ratners' announcement was made 4 minutes after the close of the London
market. Earlier, the company's shares closed  1/2 p higher at 19 1/2 p
giving it a market value of Pounds 55.9m. In January, after a disastrous
Christmas trading period, Ratners announced it would take an exceptional
charge of Pounds 45m to cover rationalisation costs. This latest increase in
provisions suggests it will cut more deeply than envisaged.
The company intends to close its Colindale warehouse and concentrate UK
distribution at one site in Birmingham. About 250 jobs will be phased out
over the next year although some may be reabsorbed in Birmingham.
Further exceptional costs are expected to relate to stock write-downs both
in its jewellery chains such as Ratners, H. Samuel, and Ernest Jones, and
its Salisburys bags shops.
Analysts speculated that up to 200 of Ratners' 2,000 outlets might also be
earmarked for closure. Although the tarnished Ratners chain may be heavily
rationalised it is understood that it is unlikely to be phased out.
Additional costs are also likely to be incurred in rationalising Ratners' US
businesses.
Further details of the restructuring will be released when Ratners reports
its financial results for the year to February 1 in a few weeks although a
date has not been set.
Analysts suggested there was now added reason to strengthen the balance
sheet although no fund-raising exercises were likely to precede the annual
results.
'This is only likely to increase the likelihood of some kind of capital
restructuring at the expense of ordinary shareholders,' said Mr Quintin
Price, analyst at stockbrokers James Capel.
Ratners is not denying reports that it is in talks to dispose of its Watches
of Switzerland chain although any anticipated losses on its disposal are
likely to have been considered as an extraordinary charge.

</HEADLINE>

   BELGRADE, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations peacekeeping headquarters for Croatia, which is based in
Sarajevo in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina, has been urged to withdraw
because of the fighting in the Bosnian capital.
The call yesterday from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary-general, coincided with a lull in the fighting in Sarajevo as Serb
irregulars from the surrounding hills, who have besieged the city, declared
a five-day ceasefire. Shops and cafes reopened and people emerged from their
cellars.
In a report to the UN Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'I am
convinced by the operational and security arguments in favour of the
temporary relocation of the bulk of the force's HQ staff from Sarajevo'. His
report also questioned the future of UN peace plan for Croatia.
He added that he would instruct General Satish Nambiar, commander of UN
forces in the former Yugoslav republics, to relocate temporarily 'pending
the restoration of calm in the city'.
Mr Ghali also ruled out the possibility of expanding peacekeeping operations
to Bosnia, where Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, have seized
control of half the territory.
But in a further apparent setback for UN operations in the region, the
report cast doubt on the future of the UN peacekeeping plan for Croatia.
The plan calls for the withdrawal of the Serb-led federal army, and the
demilitarisation of three UN Protected Areas after the deployment of 14,000
peacekeepers, which had been scheduled for later this month.
UN officials say local Serb leaders in Croatia have refused to demobilise
reservists if the UNPAs are not extended to include other regions populated
by Serbs in Croatia.
Mr Boutros Ghali warned that renewed hostilities in Croatia could not be
ruled out and said that, if this happened, the deployment of the UN forces
would have to be reconsidered.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Tour operators expect tough year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S tour operators reeling under the recession over the past 12
months, face an even worse year ahead as an expected post-election boom in
package holidays failed to materialise.
A number of tour operators have cut the price of May and June holidays by as
much as 60 per cent, in an effort to fill empty seats - in some cases up to
quarter of their capacity.
With Thomson, the largest operator, last-minute bargain seekers can pick up
a fly-drive holiday to Florida at Pounds 199 which would normally cost over
Pounds 400.
Analysts also point to a new trend for holidaymakers to wait longer before
making bookings, depriving tour operators of the benefit of early deposits.
The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday published figures showing that tour
operators had over-capacity of 1.6m holidays in the year to 30 September
1991 and a turnover of Pounds 440m less than the tour industry predicted.
The 40 largest operators had obtained CAA licences for 11.9m passengers, but
actually carried only 10.3m. This year, tour operators have told the CAA
they expect to carry 13.5m passengers, an increase of more than 30 per cent
on last year's actual figures.
CAA licences for this year project turnover of Pounds 4.44bn, a substantial
increase on both the forecast for 1990-91 (Pounds 3.65bn) and the actual
turnover achieved (Pounds 3.21bn).
But Thomas Cook, the travel agent, said yesterday that 'those in the
industry who expected a post-election expansion of package holiday demand
have been disappointed. The market is not as buoyant as some predicted'.
Holidays for May and June have 'not been selling as well as would have been
liked' but Thomas Cook said the case would be different in the latter half
of June through to September. Summer bookings - where discounting has not
yet been necessary - are already 'full to the brim'.
Mr Dermot Blastland, managing director of Owners Abroad's tour operations,
said that although there had been no immediate post-election boom, the
market had been 'getting stronger every day since the election'.
Thomas Cook believes that the projections by some operators of a 20-40 per
cent increase in demand this year is over-optimistic. 'Those which are
looking for a 7 per cent to 10 per cent increase are being more realistic',
it said.
Airtours has increased capacity by up to 30 per cent, but is looking for
increased market share to fill that.
Other operators played down the problem of over-capacity, and said Thomson
was in difficulties because it had seriously overestimated early summer
demand, and could not trim capacity.
Mr Harry Coe, group finance director of Airtours, the third largest
operator, said the level of discounting was not unusual. 'Every year there
is excess capacity in May and June, and every year there is price cutting in
the late bookings market in order to move it,' he said.
Mr Paul Slattery, leisure analyst with Kleinwort Benson, said it was
'extremely difficult to predict how the market will react this year'.
The move away from early to last-minute bookings meant that tour operators
now have much less deposit cash earning interest over several months than in
the early 1980s. This in turn meant that pinpointing the likely demand for
tour packages was increasingly difficult, particularly as consumers demand
higher quality at relatively cheap prices.
Mr Slattery added that increased over-capacity may well hit the market even
more this year, with the return to the sector of senior figures from the
former International Leisure Group, which when it ceased trading last year,
enabled a number of smaller operators to pick up trade.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: Traps that inhibit growth of grant-maintained
schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW TURNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are to be congratulated on avoiding many of the elephant-traps into
which some of your colleagues have fallen when considering the impact of
grant-maintained schools (Leading article: 'A strategy for UK education',
May 6). But one or two have caught you.
The Department of Education and Science has rejected nearly half the
applications by schools threatened with closure, so GM status has not
totally inhibited closure - except perhaps where local education authorities
have failed to bring proposals forward.
The DES has provided a 'decentralised administration to manage' GM schools -
in each of the schools themselves - and if the DES's 'mechanism of control'
is weak it is intentionally so. First, schools cannot make strides if they
do not take risks (and those risks may on occasion be ill-judged); second,
most schools flourish when politicians leave them alone, not when (however
good their intentions) they have the capacity for infinite intervention.
(And anyway, the education offered by Stratford School has emphatically not
been thrown into turmoil).
As for funding, although the DES may in due course need to establish an
agency - like the Benefits Agency - to fund the growing GM sector, regional
bodies 'representing the community' are not justified. An effective market
offers choice not only to a local majority of consumers, but also, and more
effectively than 'representative' structures, to minorities.
Finally, a stable institutional framework is exactly what is not required
for education to flourish. Institutions must be capable of adapting to the
demands of parents, pupils and the wider community, and mechanisms and
policies should be tailored to help them to adapt. Unencumbered,
grant-maintained schools are both vital and flexible.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Lifting the lid on a Pandora's box: Major's commitment to
more open government will be shown in reforms that are piecemeal but
profound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the prime minister recently announced the identity of the head of MI6,
Britain's secret intelligence service, the very existence of which had never
been publicly acknowledged, he caused a considerable and deliberate stir.
This was no casual indiscretion. Mr Major linked the outing of MI6's chief
with a pledge to sweep away the 'cobwebs of secrecy which needlessly veiled
too much government business'.
This week, Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for the civil
service, announced a far-reaching review of the UK's secrecy laws.
Legislation to lift unnecessary restrictions on the release of government
information is expected next year.
These steps are only the first in a programme of measures to open the whole
Whitehall machine to greater scrutiny, as promised in the Conservative party
election manifesto. However, greater openness is only part of a programme of
constitutional reform which the prime minister is considering, including
changes in the position of Scotland and perhaps even a Bill of Rights.
Initially, it will be open government where greatest progress is made. First
to go will be some of the secrecy which surrounds ministerial
decision-making. The responsibilities and membership of cabinet committees
which do most of the cabinet's work will be published for the first time,
within the next few days. And Questions of Procedure for Ministers, the
guidebook which sets out ministers' responsibilities, will be published.
Mr Major remains opposed to any formal legislation on freedom of
information. His view is that it only makes things more secret: civil
servants and politicians will not commit to writing information which would
be embarrassing were it to come out. And he believes that the quality of
policy-making will deteriorate if advisers cannot explore all options freely
because their advice is to be in the public domain.
But the prime minister is keen to relax the procedures under which many
government papers remain secret well beyond the traditional 30-year rule. He
would like a blanket release of historic documents, including many still
classified from the Second World War, with only those for which release
could be proved damaging held back. Following opposition from the cabinet
office over the resources this screening would involve, the likelihood is
that more archive material will be made available on request, subject to
veto case by case by the department concerned.
The Conservatives can already claim some success at opening Whitehall to
public gaze. For example, the more powerful select committees set up after
the 1979 general election can question ministers and civil servants in
public and call for the production of documents and other evidence.
The creation of more than 70 executive agencies to deliver government
services has led to the publication of information previously shrouded in
secrecy on targets, quality of service and financial performance. And the
Citizen's Charter, the prime minister's campaign to improve the public
services, is forcing schools, health authorities and local councils to
publish details of their performance.
Increasing the openness of government is a move to expose deficiencies in
the constitutional system, according to Mr Graham Mather. Mr Mather is
president of the European Policy Forum, a free-market think-tank on
constitutional reform which has attracted Mr Major's support.
'It will make the workings of the system clearer and allow informed debate
on its shortcomings,' Mr Mather says. 'Mr Major is more interested in
constitutional change than Mrs Thatcher, and is prepared to consider deft
changes to political mechanisms which could produce better results.'
Mr Major has already signalled an interest in changing parliamentary
procedures and hours. And he has made encouraging noises about Scotland,
where despite a modest increase in votes at the election, the legitimacy of
Conservative rule is undermined by the party's third position in Scottish
politics.
While there is no doubting the prime minister's commitment to preserving the
Union, he has gone out of his way to promise some change to 'make government
more responsive to the needs of Scotland'. This may be no more than the
formation of a select committee for Scotland, or the restoration of the
Scottish Grand Committee - all MPs with Scottish seats - sitting perhaps in
Edinburgh from time to time. But the prime minister has made it clear that
he is prepared to look for new solutions to constitutional problems.
Other issues he is likely to address include the constitutional role of
local government. After a decade of strife between Whitehall and town halls
and the growth of contracting out and opting out, local authorities are
changing into purchasers of local services rather than providers. Many
Conservatives believe that a review is overdue, and that the work of Sir
John Banham's Local Government Commission offers an opportunity for a new
settlement between central and local government.
Mr Mather sees the 1990s as a decade of even more radical constitutional
reform - including the introduction of a Bill of Rights which would entrench
such constitutional changes.
'We have been moving into a more rights-based structure for the public
services,' he says. 'It would be appropriate to mark such changes with a
written document.'
This commitment to a some sort of written guarantee of rights is echoed by
Mr Ferdinand Mount, the former Downing Street adviser whose recent book The
British Constitution Now sets out a Conservative agenda for reform. He
proposes a constitutional entrenchment law, complete with supreme court to
rule on it - and asserts that such a move would be entirely within the
Conservative tradition.
Mr Major has certainly given no hint of a move towards a Bill of Rights in
his thinking. But both Mr Mather and Mr Mount are influential in Downing
Street and among Conservative opinion-formers.
The prime minister is clearly delighted to have seized the initiative on
open government - he teased Conservatives at the Carlton Club's eve of
Queen's Speech reception with allusions to the 'surprise' he planned for the
next day. As an astute politician, he undoubtedly realises that moving to
the ground of constitutional reform denies it to his opponents.
However, he is also aware of the need to carry his party on any reforms.
Conservatives are easily alarmed by threats to the established order - as
Lord St John of Fawsley put it, the party needs to be reassured that the
slate is not about to be wiped clean and a fresh start made.
So constitutional changes are likely to be piecemeal. But their eventual
impact could be profound, as with other aspects of the 'incremental
Conservatism' which has become the hallmark of Majorism. They will certainly
amount to more than a tilt in the direction of open government.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: Mind-set in European agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G ROTHWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir,I have just read David Richardson on the Po valley ('Farmer's
viewpoint', May 12), and while having some sympathy with him on the
inability of the Italians to stick to the rules, I cannot help thinking how
his article typifies the mind-set that exists in European agriculture.
His analysis of the comparative merits of two strains of dairy cows focuses
completely on a gross output model whereas those of us who would operate in
an undistorted and unsubsidised world would necessarily focus on a gross
margin model. He did at one stage mention the pursuit of profit but it is
one thing to pursue it, and another to achieve it.
Is it any wonder that in almost all commodities produced in Europe the price
needed by farmers is around twice that needed by the world's economically
efficient producers.
The promised review of the Common Agricultural Policy will produce changes
far more profound than most people in Europe necessarily understand as
pricing pressure puts pressure on gross output thinking.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: The price to be paid for learning a language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID J BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In reviewing the book, Languages in International Business (Management:
'Talking turkey on foreign language lessons', May 13), Christopher Price
omits to mention one of the fundamental questions that confronts employees
who learn languages for business.
Whatever the employer's intentions, there is a definable cost in money terms
to the employee.
If an employer pays even part of the cost of language lessons then the
employee will be taxed on that amount as a perk in the same way as he or she
is taxed on the benefit of a company car.
Even worse is the fact that someone paying top rate 40 per cent tax will be
charged at 47 per cent of the cost of the lessons because even the tax on
lessons is taxed.
This matter was raised not only with the Inland Revenue but also at high
level in the last Treasury team. The government's answer was that if such
perks are not taxed then the government would have to give the same benefit
to the ladies of the night in Bayswater.
I admit to being surprised that the Inland Revenue cannot tell the
difference between a large international bank in the City and a sole trader
who does not import or export.
By contrast, my subordinates in Frankfurt do receive very considerable
personal fiscal benefits in respect of any training; this must surely be
seen as a hidden subsidy to assist German foreign trade and therefore
contrary to stated General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade policy.
Is there any good reason why an employee should pay for a benefit to be
enjoyed by his or her employer?

FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: UK needs high value added activities to stimulate
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK E BLEACKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While the pledge by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, to 'help British industry to win' is commendable (May 6) I wonder
what exactly he means by 'British industry'.
Would he include:
multinational companies, such as ICI, that are headquartered in the UK yet
have significant sales and share ownership outside the country;
foreign-owned companies, like Nissan, that are sizeable employers in the UK;
UK-owned companies, such as Amstrad, which sub-contract significant
manufacturing and assembly operations to foreign countries.
Any dialogue that seeks to stimulate economic growth by 'picking winners' -
the main focus of industrial policy in France - fails to address the key
issue. A more urgent priority is the development of those skills and
capabilities necessary to attract high value added activities into the UK,
no matter what the companies' national origin.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Russia rolls the dice of reform: Martin Wolf traces the
difficult process of making the rouble stable and convertible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing could more clearly reveal the revolutionary changes now under way in
Russia than the attempt to make the rouble internationally convertible. If
the attempt succeeds, Russia and, shortly thereafter, other participants in
the rouble area, will have been dragged into the global market economy. More
important still, the global market economy will have been dragged into
Russia.
The rouble symbolises almost everything that was wrong with the Soviet
economy. That it was inconvertible into foreign exchange was the least of
its problems. Cash could not be freely exchanged into goods, assets or even
bank accounts. When Mr Valentin Pavlov decided in January 1991 to take
Rbs100 and Rbs50 bank notes out of circulation, he was merely demonstrating
the contempt in which Soviet ministers held both the money they issued and
the people who have to use it.
The use of the printing press as the main instrument of public finance in a
year when the all-Union budget deficit rose to 19 per cent of gross domestic
product destroyed what remained of the rouble's utility. One result was
restrictions on inter-republican trade, in order to keep scarce commodities
from flooding out. This accelerated the move towards barter trade, itself an
important reason for the 17 per cent decline in the real GDP of the former
Soviet Union last year.
The price liberalisation announced by the Russian government at the end of
December 1991 and reluctantly followed by the other republics was the first
stage on the road to convertibility. Paradoxically, the reduction in the
notional purchasing power of the rouble by three and a half times (on the
official price index) made that despised piece of paper worth possessing, by
eliminating shortages.
Convertibility into domestic consumer goods is the least one might expect of
a currency. But, with the introduction of a foreign exchange auction -
albeit a limited one, with no more than Dollars 15-Dollars 20m offered at a
time - along with a sharp depreciation of the currency, the rouble could
also be turned into foreign exchange.
It is on the latter that the government now wishes to build. Convertibility
of the rouble into foreign exchange at a unified and fixed exchange rate
offers the following advantages:
together with the proposed elimination of almost all import and export
quotas (apart from those on oil and gas) and the introduction of export
taxes and import tariffs, the latter mostly at around 5-10 per cent, a
convertible exchange rate would help to move Russian relative prices towards
world levels;
a convertible exchange rate would increase competition in the domestic
economy;
an internationally convertible rouble would encourage the return of flight
capital, stimulate foreign direct investment, eliminate the need to
introduce market-protecting export controls among the former Soviet
republics, reduce the incentive to introduce new republican currencies
helter skelter and create the basis for a common market throughout the
Commonwealth of Independent States; finally,
a fixed exchange rate for the rouble would provide a monetary anchor to the
reforms.
By July 1, the exchange rate of the rouble is to be unified and made
convertible for Russian residents on current account. Initially it will
float. Some time afterwards (a date and the autumn now being discussed by
the Russian authorities) the rouble is to be fixed. A rate of Rbs80 to the
dollar has been tentatively proposed, with a margin of 7 1/2 per cent on
either side.
The reform would create a single exchange rate. Penal rates, such as the one
obliging exporters to sell 40 per cent of their earnings to the state at a
sharply reduced rate (something they generally fail to do), would be
abolished. Furthermore, there would not be a special rate for capital
transactions, though convertibility on capital account would be restricted
until the rouble finds a more 'realistic' level.
Far more important than setting dates is establishing the necessary
conditions. Exchange facilities have to be created throughout Russia. More
important, a unified, convertible and fixed exchange rate is possible only
with strict monetary control. But to gain such control, the Russian
government needs to achieve a harmonious working relationship with its own
central bank and curb the three main sources of rouble diarrhoea: the
budget, the enterprises and the republics.
The Russian government inherited a budget in extreme disorder. Ostensibly,
it reduced that deficit to about 1 1/2 per cent of GDP in the first quarter
of 1992. But this was on an expenditure, not a commitment basis. On the
latter basis, the deficit was about 5 per cent of GDP. In the government's
memorandum to the International Monetary Fund on its economic policies of
February 1992, it promised a budget deficit for April to December 1992 of
1.4 per cent of GDP. This forecast has since risen to 5 per cent and
presupposes that defence spending can be kept to around 4 1/2 per cent of
GDP. Further monetary emission to finance the deficit seems inevitable.
February's draft budget forecasts domestic taxation of oil and gas at 4.7
per cent of GDP between April and December and export taxation (including on
oil and gas) at 9.1 per cent of GDP. But Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime
minister in charge of economic reform, insists that a large net increase in
revenue must not be expected. A rise in the price of oil from an initial
level of Rbs350 a tonne to over Rbs12,000 by the end of next year is likely.
Such large increases in energy prices will require offsetting subsidies to
users, at least for a transitional period.
State enterprises have responded to reform by trying to maintain employment
and output, while putting up prices and not paying their debts. In response,
a worried government has already agreed to expand central bank credit to the
commercial banks by Rbs200bn, which implies a rise in total credit of almost
50 per cent. The difficulties of enterprises can only increase after the
planned energy price increases.
Energy pricing plays no less important a role in the most difficult area of
all: inter-republican relations. At present, the rouble is a currency with
15 central banks and no monetary discipline. Why should any government or
central bank behave prudently when the central bank next door can flood its
country with roubles? The planned move to stabilise the rouble would be
swiftly undermined if errant republics were not first brought to heel.
The question is whether Russia possesses the right mixture of determination
and generosity. Without the former, there will be monetary chaos; without
the latter, there will be collapsing trade. But convertibility plus energy
price liberalisation does provide Russia with the needed carrots and sticks.
As an internationally convertible currency, the rouble would be more
valuable than any of the new currencies that are likely to be introduced by
other republics, at least in the near future.
Sustaining trade among the countries of the former Soviet Union is
essential. Such trade cannot be sustained (or rather restored) on the basis
of settlement in hard currency, because of the shortage of foreign exchange.
But the simplest payments union would be the maintenance of the rouble area.
Russia would run it. In return for control, Russia would also have to
provide the transitional credits that most of the other republics will need
as soon as energy prices are raised to world levels.
Even for those republics that resent Russian control and intend to establish
their own currencies a period of economic restructuring within the rouble
area is a sensible first step. Mr Matiukhin, the chairman of the Central
Bank of Russia, states that much progress has been made, with agreement on
obligatory reserve ratios, discount rates and the distribution of cash.
Correspondent accounts between central banks have also been established.
Agreeing limits on mutual credit is now the most important outstanding item.
Rouble stabilisation demands assistance from abroad as well. The Dollars
24bn proposed by the Group of Seven industrial countries for this year
includes humanitarian assistance and debt relief. But the latter merely
recognises the reality that repayments are not being made.
The core of the Dollars 24bn would be a Dollars 4bn stand-by agreement with
the IMF, which that organisation suggests may be completed in July, plus
Russia's share of the Dollars 2.5bn promised by the World Bank in loans for
essential imports. The Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund from the General
Arrangements to Borrow of the Group of Ten, which comprises the G7 countries
plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, would be available
only when the rouble is fixed.
If the rouble is to be fixed, however, two questions arise: at what rate?
And for how long?
With Russian gross national product smaller at current exchange rate than
Belgium's, the rouble is undervalued. It has been appreciating rapidly in
real terms, however, as prices soar and a further real appreciation seems
inevitable. If some of that could come via nominal appreciation rather than
inflation, that would be heplful. But it will take some time for a sensible
exchange rate to emerge in a market that will be distinguished by Russians'
determination not to exchange hard currency for roubles.
Moreover, with large energy price increases in the offing, inflation will
continue at a rapid rate. The government itself talks of 15-20 per cent a
month (400-700 per cent a year). Such inflation is inconsistent with
exchange rate stability. Moreover, a trade deficit of Dollars 2.8bn in the
first quarter alone shows that what is on offer is not, in fact, that much.
It would be senseless even to try to stabilise the rouble before the
exchange rate had stabilised and positive real interest rates had been
established (along with the effective bankruptcy provisions needed to make
such interest rates bite). A central bank discount rate of 50 per cent,
however astronomical it may seem to Russians, will provide no dyke against
the monetary tide with inflation running at 15 per cent a month.
No single act could do more to signal the beginning of serious economic
transformation, not merely of Russia but of the former Soviet Union, than
rouble convertibility and stabilisation. It is worth the gamble. But the
gamble must be taken carefully: unification and convertibility first; fixing
the exchange rate second; monetary control, first and last.

DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER; THE BUSINESS OF BASEBALL
By Paul M Sommers, editor
Brookings Institution
It has long been necessary to be a lawyer and accountant fully to understand
sport in America. To these qualifications must now be added an advanced
degree in economics.
The thought is prompted by two apparently disparate events. The first
occurred on April Fool's Day when 500-odd toothless Canadians, supplemented
by Russians, Czechs, Slovaks, Swedes, and even the odd American, closed down
the National Hockey League for the first time in its 75-year history.
The second is the publication of a truly formidable, but completely
engrossing, tome by the Brookings Institution called, deliciously, Diamonds
Are Forever, and sub-titled The Business of Baseball.
Ice hockey is a sport in some trouble. Wayne Gretzky may be the greatest
thing ever to put on skates, including both Torvill and Dean. But its nasty,
brutish image, allied to the eternal problems of following a fast-moving
puck, means it has no national US television contract.
Its players do not seem to understand this. What they have grasped, however,
and what the Brookings book demonstrates in econometric spades, is that the
best way to earn more money is not nakedly to ask for it but to go on strike
in order to change the terms of employment.
This is essentially what the off-field history of baseball over the last
generation has been all about ever since, in 1969, an outfielder called Curt
Flood challenged in the courts the sport's reserve clause and refused to be
transferred from St Louis to Philadelphia. '
Curt Flood lost his case when the Supreme Court ruled that baseball was
exempt from the national anti-trust laws. But others followed his lead and
after a couple of strikes and endless negotiation the reserve clause was
confined to the dustbin for all but the youngest and was replaced by the
concepts of free agency, individual contracts and binding independent
arbitration of salary disputes.
The impact on the players' pockets has been dramatic. A recent survey in USA
Today newspaper reported that 20 years ago the average annual salary was
Dollars 34,000; in 1982 it had risen to just over Dollars 200,000: this year
it should exceed a cool Dollars 1m. Yet this has not been ruinous to the
sport's viability because baseball revenues have soared with its booming
popularity.
Where the Brookings book's 10 essays, replete with economic models,
extrapolations and charts, is indispensable is in the extent to which it
dissects the processes of the changes in the sport's structure, never better
than when it addresses the fundamental problem of the link between pay and
performance.
The starting point is Babe Ruth's famous comment in 1930 when he was asked
how he could justify earning more than Herbert Hoover, who happened to be
president. 'I had a better year than he did,' the Bambino replied.
The Brookings prose is a little more involved, as perhaps it needs to be.
Thus Andrew Zimbalist writes: 'A profit-maximising employer will hire
workers up to the point where the marginal factor cost (MFC) is equal to the
gross marginal revenue product (MRP). The marginal factor cost, in turn,
will equal the salary paid to the factor (the player) plus any necessary
marginal auxiliary costs that accompany the factor.'
Space here precludes going into formulaic ingredients in detail. But there
is one killing table, covering the seasons from 1986-89, and seeking to
determine, using the MRP yardstick, whether players are exploited or
overpaid.
It shows that, if anything, players still do not earn enough, though in 1989
a near perfect balance was achieved. But it also proves that the younger the
player the greater the degree of exploitation.
Apprentices were paid between one-fourth and one-sixth of their net MRP;
journeyman performers, with arbitration and free agency rights, earned 50-64
per cent of their MRP; the stars were paid 23-39 per cent above their MRP.
In another age it would be called child labour.
But a parallel chapter, by Rodney Fort, raises another problem. Player union
power in the last 20 years has actually produced greater inequality in pay,
contrary to its presumed intent and certainly all its rhetoric. This in turn
has probably led to a less equal distribution of talent and therefore a less
competitive sport.
The fans themselves, the most vocally disgusted over soaring salaries,
actually contribute to them by demanding to see what they consider the best;
and the best players, especially pitchers, do fill ballparks and owner's
pockets.
Yet baseball delights in defying the economic statistician. Last year's
World series, between Minnesota and Atlanta, was not only contested between
two teams who had finished last in their leagues in 1990. They also had
lower than average payrolls, because most of their best players were young.
A seasonal aberration, perhaps; after all, as Arthur Burns, the Fed's late
chairman, once said, seasonally adjusted the Great Lakes never freeze over,
and nor, of course, will baseball. Ice hockey should be so lucky.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Opening up the post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE citizens of Europe's prospective single market, communicating with
one another is a business that is changing with breathtaking speed. But amid
the seismic upheavals in telecommunications markets and technologies, one
sector has thus far remained relatively impervious to change: the post. Now,
at last, a dose of market discipline seems to be coming to the mail too,
with the publication yesterday of the European Commission's green paper on
postal services.
The paper, which proposes the opening of a range of mail services currently
carried out exclusively by national postal monopolies to a modicum of
competition, has been a long time in arriving, and is still worryingly short
on detail. Stiff opposition among the postal administrations and some EC
governments to earlier drafts helped to delay it, and to blunt some of the
Commission's ideas.
But its delivery is no less welcome for that. In the process of consultation
that now begins, it will be up to users of postal services to make sure that
the Commission hears their case for enhanced competition and improved
efficiency at least as clearly as it will hear the postal monopolies'
objections.
How this debate unfolds should be of interest to business everywhere in the
Community. Companies need efficient postal services at affordable costs as
much as ordinary citizens do. The fact that the quality of such services
varies significantly between EC member states is a distortion to the
European market and a serious handicap for businesses and consumers in those
countries with poor postal administrations. Critically, companies and
individuals also depend on the existence of a universal service - one that
ensures next-day delivery to a remote farmstead in Brittany as readily as to
the Rue de la Bourse.
Balancing requirements
Yesterday's green paper - the result, among other things, of a tussle
between Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi's communications directorate and the
Commission's competition czars under Sir Leon Brittan - is an attempt to
strike a balance between these various requirements. Sensibly, the
Commission has shied away from complete liberalisation of the postal market,
which almost everybody agrees would lead to the loss of a universal service,
at least of one at affordable prices. Equally wisely, it has shunned the
opposite course: complete harmonisation of services, which would essentially
entail the establishment of a single, monster postal administration for the
entire Community.
Extended competition
The proposal is, rather, that existing national postal administrations
should retain their monopoly over domestic letter services up to a certain
(as yet undetermined) price and weight level, and that competition -
currently allowed, for example, in parcel services - be extended to other
areas, such as express, direct mail and cross-border services. Any
restrictions on competition, it argues, should be aimed solely at preserving
universal services.
The benefits of such a gradualist approach can already be seen in Britain,
where the Post Office has taken advantage of modest increases in competition
to improve its services and management practices. This is one British
experience worth investigation by other EC countries.
As always, the devil will lie in the detail of the Community's eventual
regulations, and in their implementation. And in this respect the green
paper does give some cause for concern. Compared with earlier drafts, for
example, the Commission has watered down its commitment to opening up
cross-border services and direct mail. It has also introduced a clause which
would allow governments worried about eroding their universal mail services
to apply more restrictive measures - a sizeable potential loophole.
Hence the importance of regulation. To prevent cheating by the postal
monopolies, any eventual EC postal directive must contain provisions for a
tight, and transparent, regulatory regime. And any exemptions to competition
should be as tightly drawn as possible. Only under these conditions will
Europe's state owned postal services achieve higher efficiency, while
allowing private sector competitors to develop the new services a healthy
economy needs.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Leading Article: The EC and Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S decision by the United Nations to withdraw from Sarajevo, the
capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, casts an ominous new shadow over the war in
what used to be Yugoslavia. Not only is it a disappointment for the UN and
for the European Community, which has also withdrawn its monitors from the
republic, it signals, for the moment, a victory for Serbia and the
Serbian-dominated Yugoslav army in their quest to create a greater Serbia.
That army, which still controls a third of Croatia, is now attempting to
block the deployment of UN peace-keeping troops in Croatia. If it succeeds,
it is reasonable to conclude that the Croatian army, which has also been
fighting in Bosnia, will launch an offensive to regain control over its
borders.
When the EC started trying to mediate between the warring factions last
July, it was entering terra incognita. This was the Community's first
attempt to mediate in a war, and the first test of European security after
the Cold War. The affair has demonstrated how the collapse of communism has
created a security vacuum in Europe, as well as exposing the Community's own
vulnerability and divisions on foreign policy and security issues.
For several months, the EC, under the umbrella of its peace conference
chaired by Lord Carrington, adopted a two-pronged strategy: while attempting
to negotiate the break-up of the Yugoslav federation, it held out the
prospect of recognition for Croatia until it could broker a lasting
ceasefire in that republic. But under pressure from Germany, the Community
recognised Croatia last January. The decision did nothing to stop the war
from spreading to other parts of Yugoslavia. Serbia and the federal army
consolidated their positions in Croatia, and then attacked
Bosnia-Hercegovina. More than 1m people have been displaced, and thousands
killed, in the struggle.
Precipitate action
Throughout the 11 months of fighting, the EC has been accused of indecision
and weakness vis-a-vis the aggressors, principally the Yugoslav army. The
Community also stands accused of acting precipitately in its recognition of
Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, on the grounds that this provoked the army,
and Serbia, into grabbing more land, and undermined the efforts of the EC
peace conference. There is some justice in these charges: the EC has itself
been divided on how to proceed and most member governments now admit that
premature recognition was a mistake.
Futile debate
Nevertheless, this debate is futile; there has never been the political will
within Croatia or Serbia to stop the fighting. Ceasefire agreements by both
sides were repeatedly broken and the grab for land by both republics took
precedence over EC and UN peace efforts. The EC must now ask what else it
can do - to stop the killing, and prevent a heavily-armed Serbia from
becoming the new strong man of the Balkans.
In practical terms, the EC must immediately enforce the arms embargo imposed
on all the former republics of Yugoslavia by the UN Security Council. This
will not be easy. But at least the Community should spell out to Austria,
Russia, Slovenia and the countries of eastern Europe that it will take a dim
view of support, sales, or transfers of weapons to any parts of the Balkans.
For its part, the US, which has remained on the sidelines, must signal to
Russia (if it has not already done so) that its conciliatory attitude
towards Serbia, is not consistent with improving relations between Moscow
and Washington.
The EC must also keep up the pressure on Serbia. Recalling its ambassadors
from Belgrade earlier this week was a necessary, if belated gesture. It
should now make clear to Serbs that President Slobodan Milosevic's regime
will find no place in Europe unless it gives up its territorial ambitions;
that it will do everything in its power to ensure that a greater Serbia can
not be economically sustained. Eventually, Serbia will need good relations
with the EC.
In the meantime, despite yesterday's developments, the EC and the UN have
said they will persevere with their peace efforts. Stopping now is precisely
what the Yugoslav army and Mr Milosevic want the outside world to do. They
should not be appeased.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Arts: I puritani - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bellini's last opera comes back to the Royal Opera House after an absence of
28 years. The return promotes good cheer on many levels. On a simple one,
there was on Tuesday the unfamiliar pleasure of hearing a Covent Garden
audience brim over with noisy enthusiasm long after the first-act curtain
had fallen and the house-lights had risen.
More significantly, there was the immense reward of hearing and seeing a
marvellous opera worthily done. This is a temperate appraisal; and indeed,
there are flaws to regret in the performance - small flusters in the stage
presentation, clumsy chorus drill (compensated for by choral singing more
vigorous than the recent house norm), one big disappointment in the
cast-list.
On the whole, though, the experience surges to grand, house-filling life in
a way that restores our vision of I puritani as one of the peaks of Romantic
opera. Restoration of the sort is no simple matter. This is an opera written
for a quartet of great singers, not just a prima donna; a tissue of
exquisite vocal melodies not neatly parcelled in discrete solos but made
part of expansively developing structural patterns; and a Romantic
music-drama, often derided for its soft-headed way with English history and
its lapses of simple logic, that is nevertheless capable of carrying an
extraordinarily powerful emotional charge.
It needs passion, technical finesse, commitment, clearheadedness. It doesn't
often come off. It did on Tuesday. June Anderson, Giuseppe Sabbatini and
Andrei Serban, producer of the 1982 Welsh National Opera Puritani staging
here adopted by Covent Garden, are the chief architects of that achievement.
The force of the general argument against borrowed productions - that they
tend to lose artistic life-blood away from their original circumstances of
generation - is softened (though not essentially counteracted) by the
occasional successful borrowing of this kind.
It looks handsome on the Royal Opera stage: a marriage of clean lines and
vivid images, Civil War verismo and heightened Romantic psychodrama. It
unfolds with urgency graded to match the atmospheric intensities of the
score. Serban himself has not been around to supervise the transfer, but in
his place Jonathan Eaton skilfully recreates the complexities of motivation
in which the original show abounded. The scene with the wedding veil into
which the polonaise is studded is played with chamber-ensemble closeness of
focus; around the abandoned Cinderella coach (a splendid poetic image) that
forms the centrepiece of Act 3, a deeply moving drama of healing and
reconciliation is built up.
The production inspires Miss Anderson: that much is plain from the
spontaneity and unforced glow of her characterisation, easily the freshest
and most appealing she has given in London. Elvira is a role she has sung in
many theatres: that much is also plain from the sheer expertise with which
she 'plays' the vocal line, making the most not just of its bravura but of
its simplest expressive effects, tossing in decorative details and high
notes with a lightness that adds its own airy eloquence to the drama. The
amplitude of her soprano tells wonderfully in ensembles; in the opera's long
middle act one begins to note its lack of colour variety and warmth - but
also the deftness with which she varies lyrical sentences and paragraphs.
Sabbatini is an Italian tenor with style. The voice is not large, not
startling in natural beauty of timbre; but it possesses virile Italianate
vocal 'juice', and is used with a care for honeyed elegance of
phrase-shading and emotionally affecting utterance that caresses Arturo's
music, highlights its most ardent expressive facets. His treatment of the
extravagant high notes put in for Rubini - not the celebrated famous F sharp
but all the Cs, C sharps and Ds - shows admirable taste; he never yells,
never blares, always maintains the musical shape. With his glittering eyes,
sharply Roman profile and alert bearing he makes the species of Bellini
tenor hero seem one of opera's most elevated.
The remaining members of the Puritani quartet are less remarkable. Robert
Lloyd's bass counsellor is sung and acted with gentleness, authority and
distinction, in tones too monochrome to do full justice to the Chopin-esque
elegy of 'Cinta di fiori'. I fear the much-hyped Dmitry Hvorostovsky has
been ill-advised to tackle so demanding a bel canto baritone role as
Riccardo at this point in his vocal development. He looks handsome, and
prowls the stage with generalised Byronic fervour; he is good at suave
cantabile lying in mid-range. What he lacks, worryingly, is a secure,
resonant top; for the ringing martial close to Act 2 the big guns are
audibly missing.
Daniele Gatti, a livewire Italian conductor, seems determined to explode
singlehandedly all past criticisms of Bellini's orchestration. He gets
bright, forward orchestral playing with a firm rhythmic profile  - keen
strings, particularly. On Tuesday his interventionist beat tended to drive
the singers hard, nipping at their vocal heels, inhibiting the full flow of
their phrase-shapes. Enthusiasm of the sort is a fault on the right side: Mr
Gatti plainly loves the opera, and urges the audience to share his passion.

Last week Michael Parkinson looked forward with keen anticipation to the
start of a new series of Rab C. Nesbitt and was surprised when I did not
share his enthusiasm. Had I never been stuck in a lift with a drunk Glasgow
football supporter, he asked. Yes, I said, I had, and while that was merely
unpleasant, this series was unpleasant and also packed with incomprehensible
dialogue. Somehow the attractions of drunkenness combined with stupidity and
aggression seem to have passed me by. But since Mr Parkinson is far from
alone (the yobbish Scot is now regarded as such a draw that the cover of the
current Radio Times is devoted to him) I will have another look (9.00 BBC2)
and try to plumb the hidden depths.
Earlier on the same channel viewers in the south-east get a regional
programme, First Sight (7.30) about British quarantine regulations being
relaxed under EC law and the prospect of '70 rabies free years' coming to an
end. The way some of the British talk you would think that people in
continental Europe were dying like flies from rabies. Actually the chances
of dying in an air crash are much higher.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Arts: Turnage's 'Leaving'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the younger generation of British composers none has found himself a
more privileged position than Mark-Anthony Turnage. As Radcliffe Composer in
Association to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra he has not only a
fine orchestra and concert hall at his disposal, but also the possibility to
try out his new works while they are still at the drawing-board stage.
The latest score to come off the drawing-board is Leaving, which had its
first performance at Symphony Hall in Birmingham on Saturday. As it happens,
this is not an orchestral work at all, but a choral piece, sombre and
dignified, a mature and fully polished undertaking in every way. The young
gun who ambushed audiences unprepared for the ferocity of his opera Greek
has here given way to the serious and unhurried thinker.
His theme is the brevity of man's life, explored through the words of five
poets from John Donne to Sylvia Plath. As in the best of such pieces there
is a variety of styles and attitudes: a haunting lullaby to a poem by WH
Auden, conjuring its nocturnal spell over an irregular rocking rhythm, is
followed by a crisp and sardonic Stevie Smith setting. The skill on
Turnage's part is to give the whole a convincing unity of mood.
The score is also well organised, with that special gift so important in a
young composer of hitting upon a recognisable musical idea and using it to
its full value. In Stevie Smith's 'Drowning' a swirling motif holds the
movement together, working its way up through the instruments, starting on
piano, trumpets and xylophone, until it creates turbulent waters that
overwhelm the music, leaving only the distant cry of the drowning man.
Those growling low sonorities and occasional outbursts from unfettered
saxophones are fingerprints of the Turnage we know already. He throws
adventurous sounds the way of the instruments in his small orchestra, more
than he does to the choir, and it is unlikely that the relatively
straightforward choral parts in Leaving posed many problems to the CBSO
Chorus under Simon Halsey. The two solo voices were Helen Walker and Andrew
King, soprano and tenor.
The new work's depth of feeling, a public warmth of spirit reminiscent of
Tippett, lingered through the interval. Then, in the second half, the CBSO
and Sian Edwards dispelled it all too quickly with Tchaikovsky's Sixth
Symphony, not very well played, as the orchestra was coming on cold. The
performance only took off where speed beckoned and then it became fast and
furious with almost careless abandon.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Arts: The Rules of the Game - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pirandello's The Rules of the Game is such an elusive play that you must
catch it wherever and whenever you can, including the new production at the
Almeida.
The rules are pretty flexible, Basically they come down to observation and
survival. Leone Gala, the husband who has generously moved out of his own
house in order to allow his wife to spend more time with her lover,
explains: 'If I gave in to any of my feelings, I wouldn't be around to see
how the game develops.'
On the other hand, Leone does have feelings which are not too deeply
submerged. He admits to being hurt by his wife casting eyes elsewhere, and
when he applies the rules of the game, he does so quite ruthlessly. He
allows himself to be drawn into a duel, for which he has no direct
responsibility, then arranges for the lover rather than himself to be
killed.
There are several ways of playing The Rules. It can be a social comedy with
a touch of Wilde and Coward, but also a psychological drama about a neurotic
wife whose selfish husband fails even to try to understand her. Pirandello's
skill lies in repeatedly moving the goal posts, for this is a continental
game where there are no level playing fields. There is some Wilde, some
Ibsen. Only Pirandello can put the whole lot together.
Jonathan Kent's direction of this new, but not significantly different,
version of the play by David Hare, adds an English gloss by setting the
first act in Pinterland. Instead of a small town in Italy, the initial
action takes place in what looks like a smart flat in Islington: tall white
walls, drinks in the background and not much else in the way of furniture -
in other words, what is becoming a familiar Almeida set.
There is an unnecessary degree of intensity in the opening exchanges. Silia,
the wife, shouts at her lover, Guido, when softer distress signals would be
more appropriate. Guido, who is meant to be elegantly dressed, pads about
barefoot, shirtsleeves rolled up, braces and no tie. There are quite a lot
of pauses. One fears the worst.
Pirandello, however, cannot be put down like that. From the entry of Richard
Griffiths as the husband, the action perks up. He is a very thoughtful
fellow, very fat, enjoys eating his own cooking and prides himself on his
intellect. He scores points off the lover and still casts a spell over his
wife. In the bachelor flat to which he has removed himself there are a
couple of splendid characters: Filippo, his servant, and Dr Spiga, his
flat-mate.
One of the best scenes in this production comes when Leone and Filippon
continue to beat eggs in full chef's dress while talking about philosophy
and entertaining the lover. The play is full of symbolism, of which
egg-beating is only a part. It requires a light touch which the the Almeida
performance does not always have. Nicola Pagett remains too rigidly intense
as the wife. David Yelland as the lover is not the languid afternoon man
that he ought to be. But there is compensation in the master-servant
relationship between the egg-beaters. John Normington is a superb Filippo.
The production could be improved overnight by speeding it up and going for a
souffle, not a dumpling.
Almeida Theatre until June 27. (071) 359 4404.

MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN (PG) MGMs West End
SCORCHERS (18) Odeon Haymarket
It would be hard to believe the events depicted in Europa, Europa if it were
not for the fact that they are based on a true story. Polish director
Agnieszka Holland's powerful film tells the tale of Solomon Perel, a German
Jewish boy who survives the Holocaust by passing himself off as a Hitler
Youth. Perel (played with near perfect credibility by Marco Hofschneider) is
13 when his family is forced to flee from Berlin to Poland after his sister
is beaten to death by Nazis.
When war breaks out, he flees further east, winding up in a Russian
orphanage, where he gets a crash course in saving his skin by allowing
himself to be indoctrinated by the Bolsheviks. After Hitler attacks the
Soviet Union, Perel is once again forced to switch allegiances upon being
captured by an SS unit.
By virtue of quick thinking and sheer luck he becomes a celebrated German
soldier, earning himself a place at the elite school for Hitler Youth.
There, he must somehow hide his identity from his classmates, even going so
far as to try to uncircumcise his penis in a crude and nearly fatal
auto-operation. It is only with the defeat of the Nazis and a miraculous
reunion with his last surviving family member that he can reveal his true
self.
Holland steers us through this difficult story with a surprisingly deft
touch, balancing its true horror with darkly humorous sequences, such as the
moment when Perel is credited with capturing a Russian squad after trying to
surrender to them. There is something ironically apt about the fact that it
is his penis that constantly threatens to give him a way, as if the Jewish
manliness his forefathers bequeathed him is the one thing he cannot betray.
In the end, it is what saves him from going over altogether to the enemy,
represented most potently by the pretty young madchen who offers herself to
him in order that they can make a little Aryan bundle for Adolph.
The film is by no means flawless - the sequences in which Perel dreams of a
dancing Stalin and a secretly Jewish Hitler seem flat and contrived. In the
end, however, Holland has fashioned a subtle and provocative film, made even
more impressive by the director's refusal to moralise on Perel's story.
Though free will plays just as big a part in the boy's survival as fate, one
is never asked to see him as either a hero or a traitor. Hofschneider's
remarkable performance exorcises all traces of calculation and cunning from
the young hero. He is a pawn of history who somehow manages to avoid
capture. Perel gains nothing from his deception except his life, and, by
doing so, manages to score a victory, however dubious, over those who would
have taken it from him.
The Dark Wind is Hollywood's first attempt to bring to the screen one of
Tony Hillerman's superb detective novels, noted not just for their skill and
integrity but also for their unique setting - the Indian Country of
America's Southwest. Hillerman's sleuth is Officer Jim Chee of the Navajo
Tribal Police (played here by Lou Diamond Phillips), a detective who
balances his interest in police work with a desire to master the 'old ways'
of his people's culture and religion. Here, Chee finds himself assigned to a
seemingly routine stakeout, only to be drawn into a complex tale of murder,
witchcraft and drug smuggling. To make matters worse, he soon becomes a
suspect in the case, pursued by malevolent Federal agents as well as the
real killer.
Despite the promising and timely material, however, the film gets entangled
in the undergrowth of its own complexity. This is not to say that there are
not good things at work here, most notably Phillips's performance, which
manages to show how the qualities that make Chee a good Navajo - patience,
acuity, respect - also make him an effective cop, a man who is able to feel
the dark wind of crime that blows among his people. And the film makers
deserve full marks for their unsentimental presentation of the traditions of
the Navajo people.
The problem is the direction of Errol Morris, a celebrated documentary maker
whose most famous film, The Thin Blue Line, was a painstaking examination of
a real life crime for which the wrong man had been imprisoned.
Unfortunately, Morris's characteristic deliberation and exhaustive thirst
for facts bog down this fictional detective story. All too often, he misses
the desert for the cactuses, providing slogging exposition at just the
moments he should be jolting the viewer along. It is a style that is too
detailed to make for gripping drama. The result is a movie as bloodless as a
corpse left too long in the sun.
Memoirs of an Invisible Man is another film that suffers from a lack of
flesh and blood. In it, a strangely subdued Chevy Chase plays a callow
stockbroker who manages to get himself zapped by an experimental ray that
makes him invisible. Far from providing the voyeuristic satisfaction such a
condition might seem to promise, this transfiguration brings him nothing but
trouble, primarily in the form of a wicked CIA agent (Sam Neill) who wants
to recruit Chase for his obvious espionage advantages.
Director John Carpenter seems to have given up on the sci-fi and thriller
aspects of the film altogether, straining credibility from start to finish
with a series of illogical leaps. Instead, he focuses on special effects and
sightless gags, resulting in a few nice touches, such as the transparent
Chase chewing gum or inhaling cigarette smoke. But the overall feeling the
film leaves you with is one of missed opportunities - when Chase finally
beds the woman of his dreams (Daryl Hannah), we are given no sense of the
pros and cons of invisibility in the sack. The whole thing ends up being a
rather perfunctory rehashing of Carpenter's far superior Starman. Indeed,
the film's most convincing display of invisibility comes from Hannah
herself, who proves yet again that her acting ability cannot be detected by
the human eye.
A little bit of on-screen invisibility would have come in handy during
Scorchers. Set on a summer's night in backwoods Louisiana, the movie
intertwines two separate stories of innocence and lust, one involving a
young bride who hides under the bed from her earnest young husband, the
second depicting another youthful wife as she goes gunning for her man and
the prostitute he has been frequenting. For good measure, there is also a
nearly incomprehensible sub-plot about two feuding old codgers who end up
dancing to Mahler around a jukebox (don't ask).
Writer/director David Beaird seems to be operating under the fallacious
assumption that if he throws in equal measures of crudity and sentimentality
then he will come up with something that is neither. The result is an
abrasive, gooey film that manages to make you wonder what Beaird expects the
audience to feel. Veteran cast members Faye Dunaway (as the good-hearted
whore), James Earl Jones (splenetic bartender) and Denholm Elliott (town
drunk) seemed to have realised that something was amiss here, each turning
in performances so loaded with self-parody that you can forgive them their
presence in so misguided a production.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Bays, 50, has been appointed chairman of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society, which has assets of Pounds 14.8bn and is one of Britain's
fastest growing financial institutions.
Bays, a chartered accountant, is a director of Sharpe &amp; Fisher, a small
Cheltenham firm of builders' merchants, and has sat on the C&amp;G board since
1975. He has been vice-chairman of the society since last year and takes
over from Stephen Price, 67, chairman for the past five years. Price, a
retired practising chartered accountant, has been a director of C&amp;G for over
30 years and will remain on the board.
C&amp;G has been growing faster than many of its rivals and through a series of
acquisitions has become a significant force in the industry. Its undoubted
success owes much to the drive of its chief executive, Andrew Longhurst, who
is thought to be the highest paid executive in the industry. However, in
common with some other fast growing societies, there has been concern that
its board of non-executive directors is not strong enough to control a
powerful chief executive.
Typically, building society boards have been composed of local worthies,
rather than well-known businessmen. C&amp;G has taken steps to strengthen its
board in the past year with the appointment of Timothy Brookes, the
42-year-old chief executive of In Shops, and Douglas Strachan, 58, a former
chief executive of Allied Breweries. Yesterday, it reappointed Alastair Ross
Goobey, 46, James Capel's chief investment strategist, who left the board
last year when he was made a special adviser to Norman Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer.
Chris Tennant has become a partner of PHILDREW VENTURES.
*****
Alasdair McKerrell, Malcolm Moir and Todhunter Bensen have become partners
of Cazenove.
*****
Glen Grant, Andrew Pisker, Carolyn Moses, Gary Weinstein, Katherine Klein
and Greg Fitzgerald have all been appointed managing directors at LEHMAN
BROTHERS INTERNATIONAL.
*****
Brian Colls, director of technical services, is appointed director of
financial services division at EXTEL.
*****
Richard Cooper is appointed to the board of TULLETT &amp; TOKYO FOREX (LONDON).
*****
Roy Dinsdale is appointed head of OTC equity derivatives marketing and sales
at DAIWA EUROPE; he moves from Nippon Credit International.
Jeff Harris (left), the new chief executive of UNICHEM following Peter
Dodd's retirement at 55 this week, forecasts the new style at the top as
'plus ca change'. An accountant by training, he joined UniChem in 1985 and
was made finance director the following year. He points out that, having
'been at Peter's side' as the pharmaceutical wholesaler evolved into a major
public company 'it would be pretty irrational to want to wreak havoc when
the business is running extremely well'.
As Unichem looks to expand further into Europe, Harris, 44, admits that
'being a different generation' means that he does have ambitions to draw
more people into the company's decision-making process. 'There are a lot of
very able people below board level who should be involved,' he says.
The succession was made clear last autumn when Harris was promoted to deputy
chief executive. Scuba-diving enthusiast Dodd, who is off to spend the first
four months of his retirement submerged in the Caribbean, drew attention
before he left to the undesirability of chief executives boasting good golf
handicaps. Harris, needless to say, does not play golf.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Adas, the government's Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, has
appointed as chairman Charles Bystram, a director of Stakis. The 62-year-old
Bystram brings substantial food industry experience to Adas; he was chairman
of Geest and before that a director of United Biscuits. He will help guide
the transition of the former government department into a commercial
business - Adas became an independent executive agency last month.
Chief executive Julia Walsh says: 'It's vital that primary producers,
processors and retailers co-operate much more closely if the industry is to
survive against competition from tram, Adas is nailing its colours to the
mast and showing the whole industry that we mean business.'
Adas was launched as an agency with a brief of providing strategic, business
and technical consultancy to all involved in land-based industries - food
producers, processors and retailers, farmers and growers, government
ministries, planners, land-owners and leisure enterprises. Adas has 1,700
consultants and the biggest specialist R&amp;D base in the country.
The chairmanship is one of three key posts which are to be filled from
outside. Christopher Herring is to become finance director after six years
of consultancy with Touche Ross, including work with other government
agencies. The appointment of a marketing director has yet to be announced.

FT  14 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: New York rejects UK judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACHCHAN v INDIA ABROAD PUBLICATIONS INC
New York Supreme Court: Judge Shirley Fingerhood:
April 13 1992
A UK libel judgment obtained by a private person against a media defendant
in respect of a news report of public concern, is unenforceable in New York
in that, having been obtained under English law which imposes the burden of
proving truth and justification on the defendant, it fails to satisfy US
standards for protection of free speech and the press under which the
plaintiff must prove falsity and fault.
Judge Shirley Fingerhood so held when giving judgment for the defendant,
India Abroad Publications Inc, on a motion by the plaintiff, Mr Ajitabh
Bachchan, to enforce a libel judgment obtained by him against India Abroad
in the UK.
HER HONOUR said that judgment was granted in the UK High Court against the
New York operator of a news service.
The story held to be defamatory was written in London, and wired to the news
service in India. It was reported in two Indian newspapers, copies of which
were distributed in the UK. It was also reported in an issue of India Abroad
in New York, and an edition was printed and distributed in the UK by a
subsidiary.
The story stated that a Swedish daily newspaper, Dagens Nyheter (DN), had
reported that Swiss authorities had frozen an account belonging to Mr
Bachchan to which money was transferred from a coded account into which
commissions paid by Bofors were deposited.
Bofors was a Swedish arms company which, some time before, had been charged
with paying kickbacks to obtain a large munitions contract with the Indian
government.
Mr Bachchan brought an action against DN in London at the same time as it
sued India Abroad. DN settled and issued an apology. The jury assessed
Pounds 40,000 damages against India Abroad and its reporter.
As authorised by section 5303 of New York's Civil Practice Law and Rules
(CPLR), Mr Bachchan sought to enforce that judgment by motion for summary
judgment in lieu of complaint.
Entry of judgment was opposed on the ground that it was imposed without the
safeguards for freedom of speech and the press required by the First
Amendment to the US Constitution and article 1 section 8 of the Constitution
of New York State.
India Abroad asked the court to reject the judgment as repugnant to public
policy, which was a ground for non-recognition of foreign judgments under
CPLR 5304(b)(4).
If the public policy to which the foreign judgment was repugnant was
embodied in the First Amendment or the free speech guaranty of the New York
Constitution, refusal to recognise the judgment was 'constitutionally
mandatory'.
Under English law any published statement which adversely affected a
person's reputation was prima facie defamatory. A plaintiff's only burden
was to establish that the words complained of referred to him, were
published by the defendant, and bore a defamatory meaning. Statements of
fact were presumed to be false and the defendant must plead justification.
English law did not distinguish between private persons and public figures
or those involved in matters of public concern. None were required to prove
falsity of the libel or fault on the part of the defendant.
No plaintiff was required to prove that a media defendant intentionally or
negligently disregarded proper journalistic standards in order to prevail.
The defendant had the burden of proving not only truth but also of
establishing entitlement to qualified privilege for newspaper publications
and broadcasters where the matter published was 'of public concern' and
publication was 'for the public benefit' (section 7, Defamation Act 1952).
India Abroad argued that English defamation law failed to meet US
constitutional standards because Mr Bachchan, a friend of the late Rajiv
Gandhi, and the brother and manager of a movie star and former member of
parliament, was a public figure.
In New York Times v Sullivan 376 US 254, 279-280 (1961), the US Supreme
Court ruled that to recover damages for defamation a public official must
prove 'actual malice'. That burden of proof was placed on public figures who
sued media defendants in Curtis Publishing v Butts 388 US 130 (1967).
It was unnecessary and inappropriate to decide whether Mr Bachchan, an
Indian national residing in England or Switzerland, was a public figure.
In Gertz v Robert Welch 418 US 323,347 (1974), the court held that a private
figure could not recover damages for defamation without showing that a media
defendant was at fault.
In Philadelphia Newspapers v Hepps 475 US 767,775,777, Justice O'Connor
stated that when the speech at issue was of public concern but the plaintiff
was a private figure the Constitution supplanted Common Law standards, 'but
the constitutional requirements are . . . less forbidding than when the
plaintiff is a public figure'.
Finding the plaintiff to be a private figure and the newspaper article to be
of public concern, the court held that 'the Common Law's rule on falsity -
that the defendant must bear the burden of proving truth must . . . fall
here to a constitutional requirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of
showing falsity, as well as fault'.
India Abroad's publication related to a matter of public concern. The
affidavits and documents revealed that the wire service report was related
to an international scandal which touched leading participants in Indian
politics and was reported in India, Sweden, the US, the UK and elsewhere.
Placing the burden of proving truth on media defendants who published speech
of public concern had been held unconstitutional because fear of liability
might deter such speech.
In Hepps, it was said that 'because such a 'chilling' effect would be
antithetical to the First Amendment's protection of true speech on matters
of public concern' a private figure plaintiff must show the speech was false
before recovering against a media defendant.
The 'chilling' effect was no different where liability resulted from
enforcement of a foreign judgment obtained where the burden of proving truth
was upon media defendants.
Accordingly, Mr Bachchan's failure to prove falsity in the UK made his
judgment unenforceable in the US.
There was another reason why enforcement would violate the First Amendment.
In the UK, a plaintiff was not required and did not meet the 'less
forbidding' constitutional requirement that a private figure must show that
a media defendant was at fault.
New York's standard for liability in actions brought by private persons
against the press was set forth in Chapadeau v Utice Observer-Dispatch 38
NY2d 196, 197 (1975).
Where the content of the article was arguably of legitimate public concern
reasonably related to matters warranting public exposition, the party
defamed might recover. However he must establish 'that the publisher acted
in a grossly irresponsible manner'.
UK courts did not require a plaintiff to prove that a press defendant was at
fault. Mr Bachchan certainly did not establish that India Abroad was
'grossly irresponsible'.
The UK and the US shared many Common Law principles. Yet a big difference
between the two jurisdictions lay in the UK's lack of an equivalent to the
First Amendment.
The protection of free speech and the press embodied in that amendment would
be seriously jeopardised by entry of foreign libel judgments granted
pursuant to standards deemed appropriate in the UK but considered
antithetical to the protection afforded to the press by the US Constitution.
The motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint was denied.
For Mr Bachchan: Stephan Skoufalos (Chalos &amp; Brown, New York; Sarosh R
Zaiwalla, London).
For India Abroad: Laura R Handman (Lankenau Kovner &amp; Bickford, New York).

At 63, Peter Morley, the new chairman of the National Council of Industry
Training Organisations admits to having been a workaholic for more than 40
years.
NCITO is the umbrella body which represents the views of more than 100
Industry Training Organisations to government and other agencies.
ITOs are the independent voluntary bodies which are responsible for
promoting good training within most industrial sectors. Morley says he aims
to build on the work of his predecessors and to raise the profile of NCITO.
Since his retirement towards the end of last year after 27 years with Tesco,
where he was group personnel director, he has been occupied six days a week.
As well as being a magistrate and sitting on industrial tribunals, he is
chairman of the National Retail Training Council and the British Association
of Commercial and Industrial Education in addition to enjoying a variety of
hobbies.
His business baptism gave him a taste for overwork. At 22 he suddenly found
himself, through death in the family, in charge of two furniture shops. It
was not a job for which two years of national service had prepared him.
However, he ran the business successfully for 11 years and then sold it to
Tesco.
He regrets not going on to higher education and becoming his own boss before
he had worked for anyone else. He says it is not a career path he would
recommend.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Technology: Shared vision of IT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conventional wisdom about the respective roles of the chief executive and
the information technology director in the successful exploitation of
computing in business is challenged in a new study from the Oxford Institute
of Information Management.
The study was undertaken to examine the factors which could help to create a
good relationship between the chief executive and the IT director. It is now
generally accepted that a successful relationship is a key factor in the
effective exploitation of IT. Yet the study found that:
A background in marketing or general management is more likely to lead a
chief executive to an effective 'vision' of the value of IT than hands-on
experience. This contradicts the view that top managers would only come to
appreciate IT if they had practical experience.
IT directors with a background in data processing are more likely to form a
successful relationship with their CEOs than business line managers placed
in top IT management jobs. This might seem obvious; but there is a
well-known 'culture gap' between computing specialists and line managers.
It is not necessary for the IT director to report directly to the CEO as
long as he or she is part of the top management team.
The study, carried out by David Feeny and colleagues at Templeton College,
was carried out under the Impact Programme, now sponsored by KPMG Management
Consultants.
The study suggests that a successful relationship between CEO and IT
director derives from a common vision of computing as a way of conferring
competitiveness on an organisation rather than merely automation and
efficiency.
The relationship can be improved if the CEO sets aside time to explain his
attitude to the IT director, if the IT director is a member of the company's
'cabinet' and if the two executives spend time away from the office
discussing business goals.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Grass is greener in
the high street - John Thornhill says retailers are coming back into town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoppers love those massive out-of-town superstores because they can get
everything they want in one go. Retailers love them because they are cheaper
to run.
The arguments seemed so powerful that for many years, the big food retailers
left small, high street shops in droves for vast sites on the ring road. The
number of grocery shops has fallen in the last three decades from more than
100,000 to 40,000 and the current recession has continued to throw up
casualties.
But it now seems that edge-of-town sites do not satisfy all shoppers -
especially those without cars and the elderly. Retailers are realising that
there is money to be made from efficient town centre chains. There are signs
that the high street is coming back to life.
Some retailers, of course, have never deserted it and have defended their
positions by offering premium products and service. Marks and Spencer runs a
highly profitable chain of neighbourhood stores while John Lewis Partnership
is still expanding its 99-store chain of Waitrose supermarkets.
The Kwik Save discount chain and the Iceland frozen foods business have also
mainly stuck to traditional shopping centres. Even the bigger chains, such
as Tesco and Safeway, are now returning to high streets with the benefit of
their sophisticated distribution systems. Tesco is redeveloping the old Moss
Bros site in Covent Garden in central London to launch what it describes as
a 'Metro' store.
But one of the most ambitious attempts to create a completely new high
street chain has been the launch of Somerfield, run by Gateway Foodmarkets,
bought by the privately-owned Isosceles group three years ago.
Twenty-five Somerfield stores have already opened with a wide range of
own-label goods. The number of stores will rise to 50 by next April giving
the chain total square footage of about 1m sq ft. More will rapidly follow
if the chain establishes itself. The man behind the idea is Bob Willett,
Gateway's chief executive, who claims that Somerfield is one of the most
heavily researched food chains ever launched, aimed at one layer of a
segmenting food market.
The stores, which consist of 11 conversions from weary Gateway stores and 14
new sites, range from 12,000 sq ft to 26,000 sq ft. They offer fresh
produce, expansive delicatessens and bakeries. They are well-designed with
high-quality lighting and even boast barrel-ceilinged wine aisles complete
with echo.
Willett wants the chain to offer a premium service. Staff are attentive and
dress smartly either in boaters and traditional aprons or black blazers and
striped trousers or skirts. The check-out staff pack the goods after
scanning them at specially-designed tills.
The stores have an up-market, leisurely feel but Willett claims that prices
are consistent with other Gateway stores. He prefers to refer to them as
'up-value'.
Willett says that converted Somerfield stores are performing well and have
seen sales increases of more than 20 per cent. The average basket size of
Pounds 16.30 was well ahead of the Pounds 8.80 achieved at Gateway.
'Somerfield is focused on building the shopping basket by offering range and
service,' he says.
The birth of the new chain has been a brave move in a recession and has had
its problems. Gateway, which runs 635 Gateway stores and 18 Food Giant
discount superstores, recently reorganised its management structure around
the three retail concepts, causing some friction.
'It has been painful as people have lost turf' Willett says.
While admiring the idea, industry analysts harbour doubts about Somerfield's
heavy costs and question whether the indebted Isosceles can give the chain
the backing it needs. Willett also accepts that it will take time before
customers appreciate the Somerfield name and suggests the chain would double
its turnover if it had the magical words Marks and Spencer emblazoned over
its shop-front.
'The problem is that Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer have been around for
more than 100 years. We are as yet unknown,' he says.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Marketing and Advertising: Jingles go only part of the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertising has lost its way and needs to be reborn as a system of product
information for consumers.
Bill Ziff, chairman of Ziff Communications Company which specialises in
magazine publishing, believes that the current decline in advertising has
not just been caused by the recession.
'What's occurring today is caused by one basic trend: a loss of confidence
in advertising's power to persuade the consumer.' This, Ziff told the recent
Periodical Publishers' Association conference in London, had affected all
media.
Consumers were increasingly turned off by 'the search for the perfect
jingle, the slogan so devoid of content that it could be about anything, the
model with the happiest smile, the celebrity with the highest approval
rating, the universal image to manipulate the presupposed mass-mind.'
The transition to the more substantial advertising required by
factually-driven purchasing decisions was already under way, Ziff predicted.
It would tend to favour print and magazines over the electronic media.
The loss of confidence was caused by advertising's outmoded appeal to
anachronistic notions of a mass market.
This was in stark contrast to the reality of the marketplace - the
increasing sophistication of contemporary consumers and the fragmentation of
once monolithic brand names into a host of customised lines and styles.
As ever greater variety pours out of the world's manufacturers, Ziff argued,
'the advertising we carry continues to cling to the magic talisman of brand
names in the outmoded belief that image can still override specific features
and real price and value in the minds of knowledgeable consumers'.
Advertising had lost its power over the consumer because of its banality.
The rebirth of advertising as an indispensable information system, Ziff
added, would make product quality a viable investment strategy 'by guiding
highly-targeted buyer groups to the specific products that had the right
pricing and features for them'.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs rebuffed over Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners yesterday criticised the
rejection by a junior minister of their suggestion that the government
should seek ways of keeping pension funds open until investigations into the
state of the Maxwell funds were complete.
Mr Richard Page, Tory MP for Hertfordshire South-West, and Mr Frank Field,
Labour chairman of the social security committee in the last parliament, are
to meet Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, on Tuesday to press the
case for a 'lifebelt' for the pension funds.
The talks follow a cross-party meeting on Tuesday, attended by more than 60
MPs, which called on the government for an immediate statement of its
position, and asked the government to consider how the funds might be kept
open as 'a humanitarian as well as a practical gesture'.
But Miss Ann Widdecombe, a junior social security minister, said it would be
premature for the government to commit itself to any form of action, and
questioned the usefulness of any move to 'drip-feed' the funds.
Mr Page expressed regret that she had taken this line, especially before the
MPs' meeting with Mr Lilley. 'I don't think it's wise for ministers to close
off avenues of discussion before they have heard all the arguments,' he
said.
The MPs believe that keeping the pension funds alive is critically important
in increasing the prospects that the assets can be tracked down and
retrieved by the trustees.
The prime minister has told pensioners of Maxwell-owned companies that
compensation for stolen funds could be paid if there had been
'maladministration, either by the Department of Trade and Industry or Imro'.
In a letter to a member of the AGB pension fund, Sir Robert McCrindle,
replying for Mr Major, said that if a complaint was made to the
parliamentary ombudsman and an investigation proved maladministration had
occurred, 'we may be in a similar situtation to that which prevailed in the
case of the Barlow Clowes investors.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Gould advance broad
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR must reject the notion that minor policy changes will prove adequate
to win the next election and instead develop a platform with a breadth of
appeal that embraces the interests and aspirations of middle-class voters.
That is the view held by both contenders for the party leadership in
articles published in the New Statesman and Society today.
Shadow chancellor Mr John Smith, the odds-on favourite, and Mr Bryan Gould,
his challenger, definitively reject the so-called 'one last heave' notion,
which argues that the party should simply repackage its current policies and
improve on its communications with the electorate.
But their approaches as to how to broaden the party's appeal varies subtly
with Mr Gould delivering a new, thinly-veiled attack on his rival for his
handling of economic policy at the election.
Mr Smith argues that Labour should play heavily on the argument of
enlightened self-interest, a broad concept of freedom and economic logic.
The shadow chancellor suggests that the 'comfortable and contented' are
anxious about inner-city degeneration, unemployment and the decline in the
quality of life.
'Poverty and injustice . . . are not only moral issues but also questions
about the cohesion and security of the whole community,' he argues.
Relatively affluent people share with the less well-off an interest in
improved investment in skills and innovation, opportunities for women and
high standards of health and education provision.
He points out that poverty and unemployment are not just bad for individuals
but 'undermine the capacity for wealth creation in a modern economy. 'This
is our economic argument: a path to personal enrichment for the fruits of
economic progress more widely shared,' he writes.
Mr Gould begins by criticising Labour's election campaign for failing to
offer motives to middle-class voters to support the party.
'In the event, all we had to say to them was that we intended to tax them
more severely - if not immediately, then at some not long delyed point in
the future,' he writes.
In a passage that will infuriate Mr Smith's supporters, he says the party
endorsed Tory macroeconomic policies by accepting a simple goal of monetary
stability, offering no route to full employment or recovery. He also asks
why constructive proposals such as contributors' control over pensions
funds, share ownership schemes and better employee rights were not proposed.
In future, electors should not be treated as socio-economic groups but as
individuals given the power that leaves them 'properly equipped to operate
in a market place that would otherwise treat them unfairly'.
'Labour's concern should, in other words, be with the initial distribution
of wealth rather than with a post hoc redistribution that offends the
intended beneficiaries almost as much as it alienates the forced
contributors,' he concludes.

LABOUR MPs will be ordered to abstain in next week's vote on legislation to
ratify the controversial Maastricht agreement on European Community treaty
changes, the shadow cabinet agreed unanimously last night.
Their decision, in effect, brings to an end an impassioned debate in the
Parliamentary Labour party that yesterday showed itself divided on the
correct tactics to adopt in the light of a widely-anticipated Conservative
backbench rebellion.
At a heavily attended weekly meeting of the PLP, about eight MPs argued
vigorously that the party had several grounds on which it could justifiably
vote against the government. But Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign
secretary, warned forcefully that to oppose the legislation would be
inconsistent with Labour's stance at the general election.
He was backed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the leader, who wound up the hour-long
debate by reminding MPs that an opposing vote could be used against the
party at the next election.
Mr Stan Orme, the PLP chairman, said that no MP present believed Labour
could defeat the government as it was recognised the Tory rebellion would be
limited and that the Liberal Democrats would almost certainly vote with the
Conservatives.
Liberal Democrat MPs agreed last night to support the Maastricht legislation
on its second reading.
But they will attempt to force debates during its passage on Economic and
Monetary Union, the European parliament and the social chapter.
The leadership's decision means Labour will table an amendment criticising
the government's European stance, but will abstain on the main motion. Some
Labour rebels can, however, be expected to defy the whips and vote against.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Trafford Park jobs expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 9,500 jobs have been created in Trafford Park, Greater Manchester,
in the past five years according to a census of the companies there by the
park's development corporation.
Trafford Park, Europe's first industrial estate, now houses 1,188 companies,
an increase of 460 since 1987. The companies employ 34,492 people - 34 per
cent up on the 24,950 of five years ago. The corporation was set up by the
government in 1987 to reverse the area's decline.
The development corporation has so far invested nearly Pounds 88m of public
funds. This works out at about Pounds 9,200 for each extra job, but the
private sector has contributed more than six times as much.
Some of the jobs have resulted from businesses relocating to north-west
England, but 47 per cent of the new companies are either new businesses or
branches of companies based elsewhere.
There was a 98 per cent response to the survey, so the figures are the most
accurate yet to show the effect of a development corporation on the area it
is trying to regenerate. Engineering was the biggest sector, with 48 per
cent of manufacturing employees.
Only 18 per cent of the companies are exporters, but 84 per cent trade
directly with others in Trafford Park, suggesting a developing
infrastructure of component suppliers.
Most companies are relatively small, with 56 per cent employing fewer than
10 people each and 80 per cent having turnover of less than Pounds 10m.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Legal aid checks criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRIMINAL legal aid is being granted without proper checks on applicants'
eligibility, according to a report by the Commons public accounts committee.
The matter was investigated after the qualification by Sir John Bourn, then
comptroller and auditor-general, of the 1990-91 appropriation account of the
Lord Chancellor's Department. Sir John cited 'uncertainty as to the
propriety and regularity' of spending on criminal legal aid.
Magistrates' courts - which account for more than half of the Pounds 333m
spent yearly on criminal legal aid - attracted particular criticism. Sir
John pointed to problems with insufficient information on the grounds for
applications and lack of evidence about checks on income.
Applicants for legal aid are required to provide 13 weekly pay slips as
proof of income. The MPs found that pay slips were often not provided, and
sometimes not even requested.
'It is unsatisfactory that court staff should knowingly fail to ensure that
legal requirements are complied with,' the MPs said.
Expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid. HMSO, Pounds 9.75.

<TEXT>
WORK started yesterday on a Pounds 16.6m project to create an opera house in
Edinburgh. It is expected to be ready in time for the 1994 Edinburgh
International Festival.
The project involves the conversion of the large Empire Theatre, last used
as a bingo hall.
Mr George Younger, chairman of the Empire Theatre Trust - which is leading
the project - said sufficient finance from the public and private sectors
was in place. Bovis has been awarded a Pounds 12m contract as managing
contractor.
Mr Younger, who is also chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, said the opera
house would cost about Pounds 20m, including the Pounds 3.5m which Edinburgh
District Council had paid for the Empire Theatre.
The public sector is contributing Pounds 15.6m through councils, Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise, the Scottish Tourist Board, Historic Scotland and the
Scottish Arts Council.
About Pounds 2.4m towards a Pounds 4m target has so far been raised from the
private sector, with contributions coming from banks and United Distillers.

GERMANY'S Thyssen Haniel Logistic (THL) yesterday announced the first steps
in a Europe-wide shipping and transport alliance.
It is to link with Denmark's DFDS group and Austria's Schier, Otten. Further
partners for THL Europa Alliance are being sought in Greece, France and
Italy.
Under the alliance, DFDS, which operates Scandinavian Seaways shipping
services in the North Sea and overland haulage, will take over THL's
overland transport businesses in the UK, Netherlands and Belgium. THL, part
of the Thyssen group, will take over DFDS operations in Spain and Hamburg.
The alliance will operate in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Scandinavia, the
UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Portugal.
Mr Ole Frie, manager of the DFDS transport division, said the alliance was
an alternative to the acquisition policy pursued by other major European
haulage groups over the past few years. He said the alliance would yield the
advantages of acquisition without the costs and the problems associated with
integrating companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton are moving steadily towards
a confrontation in November, in the US presidential election, each having
won two more primaries on Tuesday.
But a new opinion poll showed that, in California, the largest state, they
would both be beaten by Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman mounting an
independent challenge for the presidency.
Some analysts suggest that the disgruntled people most likely to tell a
pollster that they would vote for Mr Perot are also the least likely to
vote. But his supporters have surprised many with their ability to collect
enough signatures to put his name on the ballot in states from Texas to
Maine.
Mr Bush was assured of the Republican party's presidential nomination before
he took more than 80 per cent of the vote in Nebraska and West Virginia this
week.
In the Democratic primaries, Mr Clinton won Nebraska with 48 per cent and
West Virginia with 74 per cent. In the latter, he kept his challenger,
former Governor Jerry Brown of California, below 15 per cent, thereby taking
all 31 of the state's delegates to the Democratic convention which will
anoint the party's presidential candidate in July.
Many political pundits have called the Arkansas governor's results
disappointing, but he has scored as well as Mr Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic nominee in 1988, at this stage of the campaign.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Brazil plans radical tax devolution to states and cities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government will outline radical proposals this week to halve
the number of federal taxes and shift responsibilities for many public
services from the federal government towards states and municipalities,
report Stephen Fidler and Christina Lamb in Braslia.
The reforms, aimed to enable the government to balance its books
consistently, are seen as crucial for the success of Brazil's economic
stabilisation programme.
Mr Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho, co-ordinator of the Fiscal Reform Commission,
said in an interview that the proposals will be presented across the country
to mass public meetings throughout next month.
The final version will go to Congress only after municipal elections in
October. This means the government will have to continue to rely on tight
monetary policy as its main weapon against inflation for at least the next
six months.
According to Mr Oswaldo, the main thrust of the reform will be to devolve
greater responsibilities to the states and municipalities, transferring
services such as health and education from the federal government. It would
reduce the number of major taxes to eight from 15.
Under the proposals, the federal government would raise taxes in two ways -
via excise duties on items such as fuel, cars, tobacco, drink, electricity
and telephones; and through income tax.
It would also broaden the base and lower the rates of the current income
tax, reducing heavy payroll taxes on companies, a focus of legal
controversy.
For the states, the main source of revenue would be value-added tax and, for
municipalities, a property tax applied to rural and urban areas.
Under the 1988 Constitution, about half of tax revenues is transferred to
the states and muncipalities, but without clear definition of their
responsibilities. 'We cannot reduce the transfer of funds but we can pass to
them the jobs they could perform better', said Mr Oswaldo. 'At present, one
cruzeiro leaving Braslia for schoolbooks has to go through so much
bureaucracy that it is worth only a few cents by the time it reaches its
destination.'
He stressed that the planned decentralisation would 'improve efficiency and
bring the citizen closer to the provider of services'. He believed it would
be politically popular because mayors and governors could win electoral
support for building and running good schools and hospitals.

FT  14 MAY 92 / French ports in a storm over reform of dock labour scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH dockers are to step up their seven-month campaign of strikes against
plans, presented to parliament yesterday, to scrap their 45-year-old
protected status.
The reform of the dock labour scheme is a long-delayed attempt to restore
the competitiveness of French ports against cheaper and more efficient
competitors in Belgium and the Netherlands.
The reform would transform dockers into normal salaried workers and give
freight handling companies the right to decide how many employees they need.
The number of jobs in the docks and their distribution between ports would
no longer be decided centrally, except for temporary workers. Dockers out of
work would receive ordinary unemployment benefits, rather than be paid
through a central organisation.
France is one of the last European countries to attempt to modernise labour
practices in its ports and accordingly has lost billions of francs of port
traffic to Antwerp and Rotterdam, easily reached by rail, motorway or canal.
The problem has been worrying the government for years, but has been too
sensitive to tackle until now because the docks are one of the last
strongholds of the well organised and aggressive communist-led trade union,
the CGT. The 1947 ports labour law gives the CGT a near-monopoly on jobs in
the docks and the system of a central ports labour office has made it hard
to dismiss surplus workers.
However, political sympathy for the CGT has declined along with support for
the communist party. There is a growing consensus between the main parties,
and especially among industrial companies, that France can no longer afford
the old restrictive practices.
Over the past decade, the share of French exports to pass through its sea
ports has fallen from 75 per cent to 59 per cent, while their share of
imports has fallen from 35 per cent to 33 per cent. Over the seven years to
1990, the share of French sea-born exports to go through foreign ports has
nearly doubled from 15 per cent to 29 per cent.
This has cost France heavily. The government estimates that FFr210bn (Pounds
21.2bn) of French exports and imports went through non-French ports last
year, while the dockers' strikes cost freight handlers around FFr1bn in lost
charges.
It is surprising the damage has not been greater, given that that French
ports are so overmanned that dockside handling charges - by far shippers'
biggest single port cost - are between 30 per cent and 50 per cent above the
European norm.
The reform is now being pushed hard by the maritime affairs minister, Mr
Charles Josselin, who aims to get them passed by parliament next month.
The CGT reckons about half the 8,300 dockers will lose their jobs if Mr
Josselin gets his reforms. It is unimpressed by government offers of early
retirement and redundancy payments, plus retraining.
In response, the union has called 31 short strikes since October, the most
recent a week-long stoppage, starting last Monday, timed for the
parliamentary debate. Yesterday, the CGT also held demonstrations in Paris
and the main ports.
Freight handling companies warn that more French shippers will be tempted to
cheaper and more reliable ports in Belgium and Holland for good if the
strikes get much worse. But neither the government nor the CGT are in a mood
to give in.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Sharp increase likely in US bank insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BANKERS are bracing themselves for a sharp increase, next January 1, in
the premiums they must pay to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The FDIC, the government agency that guarantees depositors if their bank
fails, had its reserves wiped out by a wave of bank failures in the 1980s.
It has proposed a new premium formula that would make weakly capitalised
banks pay substantially higher rates than those with solid capital bases.
Even the strongest banks, however, would have to pay higher premiums than
they do now.
But bankers complain that the stiffer premiums will force more weak banks
out of business and compel even the stronger banks to be more conservative
in their lending - just as the US government is urging them to ease a
possible 'credit crunch' by lending more, especially in risky inner-city
areas.
'This is mandating a conservative mentality for the rest of this decade,'
said Mr Kenneth Guenther, executive vice-president of the Independent
Bankers' Association of America.
The proposed changes to the FDIC premium structure are available for public
comment, but opponents of the increase do not expect to be able to influence
more than details of the new premiums.
The FDIC proposal would increase the level of premiums from 23 cents per
Dollars 100 of deposits to an average of 28 cents, and could levy an
additional Dollars 1.5bn a year of premiums. Well-capitalised banks would
pay 25 cents; the weakest a 31 cents premium.
Advocates of the premium increase believe it is needed to replenish the Bank
Insurance Fund (BIF), which the FDIC manages. The administration reckons the
fund will have a deficit of Dollars 2bn this year, climbing to a peak of
Dollars 39bn in 1996.
However, others argue that these projections greatly exaggerate the BIF's
likely deficit. Also, higher premiums could slow economic growth and so have
a negative impact on the fund.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Italian utility in Pounds 4.5bn gas import deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENEL, Italy's state-owned electricity generating utility, has signed one of
the world's biggest long-term energy supply contracts with Nigeria in a
liquefied natural gas deal worth around L10,000bn (Pounds 4.5bn) over 20
years.
The transaction, starting in 1997, marks a further diversification of
supplies for the energy-dependent Italians. It is the first direct liquefied
natural gas deal between a big European electricity utility and an energy
producing country.
ENEL will buy 3.7bn cubic metres of gas a year from a new plant being built
by Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas, a Nigerian government-owned company in
which Shell, Agip and Elf are also shareholders. Smaller quantities of gas
will also be supplied to utilities in Spain, France and the US.
The price ENEL will pay will be indexed to that of crude and refined oil, as
well as coal, but the value of the contract is expected to amount to L500bn
a year.
Once the liquefied gas arrives in Italy, it will be processed at a new
facility at Montalto di Castro in the central Lazio region. The plant will
supply a 3,300 MW power station to be built nearby.
ENEL currently uses 6-7bn cu m of natural gas a year, but expects
consumption to rise to 20-25bn cu m by the year 2000 after a number of deals
are completed.
Around 6bn cu m of Algerian gas will be supplied via an undersea pipeline
being built by the Italian state-owned SNAM group, while a further 1.5bn cu
m will be imported in liquid form. Meanwhile, talks are under way with
Norway to supply 3-4bn cu m, while further supplies may come from Qatar. The
new contracts should help to overcome the uncertainty surrounding plans to
import 4bn cu m of gas from Russia.
Italy uses around 50bn cu m of natural gas to generate electricity and for
domestic purposes, 60 per cent of which comes from Algeria and Russia.
Future consumption is expected to rise to 80bn cu m, three-quarters of it
imported.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US ECONOMIC reports yesterday provided further evidence of a slow recovery
from recession.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.9 per cent in cash terms
last month, and by 4.4 per cent in the year to April.
This was a stronger performance than expected, but figures for March were
revised down substantially to show a fall of 1 per cent rather than 0.4 per
cent. After seasonal adjustment, the April increase left sales slightly
lower than in February.
Consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.2 per cent in the year
to April, indicating that resumed economic growth is not yet putting upward
pressure on inflation. Figures for producer prices released this week were
also subdued.
Following the report on Friday of a bigger-than-expected rise in payroll
employment last month, the sales figures appear to confirm a gradual
improvement in the economy. Some analysts, however, remain worried that
growth of personal incomes will be too weak to support continued sales
growth at the April pace.
The jump in sales was seen a reducing, but not eliminating, the chance of
another small cut in interest rates. The Federal Reserve remains concerned
by very sluggish growth of the money supply.
The retail improvement was led by car sales, which rose 2.9 per cent last
month and by more than 10 per cent relative to April last year. Excluding
cars, retail sales rose 0.4 per cent in April. Sales of building materials
and clothing were also strong last month.
Excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile, 'core' consumer prices
rose 0.3 per cent last month, the lowest increase since January. Annualised
core inflation is running at just under 4 per cent.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKMENISTAN has reached a transport, banking and trade agreement with its
neighbour, Iran.
The deal, agreed during a visit by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani to the former Soviet republic, considerably expands Iran's
economic influence in the region. It follows the failure last weekend of a
joint central Asian, Turkish, Pakistani and Iranian summit to agree on
economic co-operation, and is a setback to Turkish efforts to curb Iran's
economic role in the region.
Under the agreement, a joint banking and customs system will be established
between Turkmenistan and Iran.
Road and rail links will be completed. According to Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh,
Iranian finance minister, the Dollars 500m (Pounds 282m) cost of the railway
will be primarily born by Iran. This is in addition to Dollars 50m of
Iranian credits to Turkmenistan announced last week.
'What we are offering them is the chance to export goods via the Persian
Gulf,' said Mr Nurbakhsh, who envisaged that raw materials, including Uzbek
cotton and silk, Kazakh oil and Turkmen natural gas could soon be exported
through this route.
A second project to build a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Iran had also
been agreed, Mr Nurbakhsh said. A deal for the purchase of 19bn cubic metres
of Turkmen gas by Iran has been signed, with plans to expand this once the
pipeline had been completed. According to Mr Nurbakhsh, some of this gas
would be used in Iran, and some exported to the west, and Turkey.
Discussions were continuing about a controversial oil pipeline between
Turkmenistan and the Gulf.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Moreira sees debt deal soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Marclio Marques Moreira, Brazilian economy minister, expects to conclude
an agreement in principle, during the next six weeks, on the restructuring
of Brazil's commercial bank debt.
He also said for the first time that Brazil would be willing to contribute
part of its foreign reserves to support the agreement with banks. This
should ease the path to an accord over the Dollars 42bn (Pounds 23.7bn) in
medium- and long-term debt.
A sharp rise in Brazilian reserves over the past six months has helped allay
fears that there would be insufficient resources to back the debt agreement.
Finance is necessary to pay for collateral to guarantee concessional bonds
to be issued under the agreement.
Mr Moreira insisted in an interview that the guarantees would still have to
be phased in over time, as the volatility of reserves did not permit an
immediate earmarking of the funds.
He said the growth in reserves was now beginning to flatten out, although
they had risen significantly since the last published figure of Dollars 11bn
at the end of February. Inflows of capital had subsided since the government
restricted, late last month, the ability of Brazilian entities to borrow
abroad.
The Brazilian economy, in a three-year recession, was bottoming out, he
believed. This was suggested by several factors, including a 2 per cent
increase in energy consumption over the first quarter of last year in Sao
Paulo, responsible for 40 per cent of Brazil's gross domestic product.
He denied that he was under pressure to relax the government's tight fiscal
discipline by releasing more money to the states and to the armed forces.
There has been growing discontent over the low level of pay in the military,
particularly in comparison to that of the executive and legislature. A
fighter pilot earns the same as a lift operator in Congress, Mr Moreira
admitted, and said that such anomalies would have to be corrected over time.
He said his priorities for the coming year included a reduction of
inflation, to 2 or 3 per cent a month from about 20 per cent now, and
overseeing a sustainable return to growth.
The minister wanted to complete the agreement with banks and to secure
legislation, among other things, for port deregulation, an end to some state
monopolies, and fiscal reform.
Last week, the government confirmed it had not met its first-quarter targets
under a stand-by programme with the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Pedro Parente, Brazil's planning secretary, indicated the extent to which
government spending had been compressed during the first quarter, in a vain
attempt to meet the target for the operating deficit (current revenues less
current expenditures and debt interest).
He said the government had foreseen expenditures of five trillion cruzeiros
(Dollars 2bn at the present rate) in the first quarter of the year, but had
spent only three trillion - a cut of 60 per cent in real terms compared to
the first quarter a year earlier.
However, there was an operating deficit of Cr10.8 trillion, the target
having been Cr5.6 trillion. This was because interest payments on internal
debt were Cr2.8 trillion above target - interest rates were higher than
expected - while government revenues were Cr4.4 trillion less than expected
because of legislated delays in the collection of some important corporate
taxes.
The government hopes the delayed tax payments will begin to flow this month,
interest rates having already fallen from first-quarter levels. Mr Parente
said he was thus still convinced the government could meet half-year
targets.

The local currency has been under strong upward pressure largely as a result

The European Commission yesterday finalised a Ecu500m (Pounds 350m) aid
programme to help poorer areas of the Community restructure their textile
industries, and so indirectly to reduce protectionism against imports,
writes David Buchan in Brussels.
The chief beneficiary of the aid, to be spread over 1993-97, will be
Portugal, where textiles account for one third of manufactured exports.
Lisbon had been promised the aid in return for not obstructing an opening up
of the EC market to textiles from central Europe and possible moves towards
free trade with north Africa.

EL SALVADOR, Guatemala and Honduras have agreed to create a free trade zone
across their three countries and to accelerate central American integration,
Reuter reports from Ocotepeque, Honduras.
The accord will allow unrestricted movement of almost all goods and capital
across the three countries and establish uniform customs duties on imports.
Annual trade between El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras currently runs at
some Dollars 600m. The free trade zone creates a market of some 20m people,
in which total imports are estimated at Dollars 4.5bn.

A GATT disputes panel has ruled against the US after a complaint by the
European Community over Washington's 'Buy American' policy.
The panel said the proposal to buy a sonar mapping system broke rules on
government procurement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
that
the US should open bidding for the system to overseas suppliers.
However, the US, which disputes the panel's interpretation of Gatt rules,
yesterday opposed adoption of the report by the world trade body's
government procurement committee. Reports have to be adopted by consensus
under Gatt procedures. The report will come back to the committee at its
meeting in June.
The dispute relates to the purchase of a Dollars 2.4m sonar mapping system -
an underwater radar system, which uses ultrasound to detect objects. The
purchase was part of a 1989 contract for Antarctic research support services
between the National Science Foundation, a US government agency, and
Antarctic Support Associates, a private company. The US Congress imposed a
'buy American' requirement. The administration argued the purchase was not
covered by the Gatt code, which does not apply to service contracts.
The panel ruled that the purchase constituted government procurement even
though it would be done through a private company, because the US government
was putting up the money and would own the sonar mapping system.
Tension between the EC and the US has mounted since February, when Mrs Carla
Hills, US trade representative, set a January 1 deadline for the imposition
of sanctions unless the EC altered its public procurement legislation.
On Tuesday, the EC urged the US to end discrimination against non-US
companies tendering for public contracts and to call off threatened
sanctions.

<TEXT>
WESTERN aid donors yesterday told Malawi that it will get more development
money from them only if it improves its human rights record.
The troubled southern African state came away from a World Bank-sponsored
meeting with nothing towards the Dollars 74m (Pounds 42m) of development
assistance it needs this year and next.
They were ready to meet again within six months if Malawi could show
'substantive progress' in basic freedoms and human rights, said the donors'
communique.
Donors pledged Dollars 170m of food aid for victims of the drought which has
hit Malawi and its neighbours.
This was Dollars 100m less than needed, but officials stressed the shortfall
on humanitarian, as opposed to development, aid had nothing to do with human
rights and that drought assistance would be handed out as required through a
plan for the whole region.
Malawi has worried donors because of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda's
continued intolerance of any opposition, and the recent outbreak of
industrial unrest and looting in which 38 people were reported killed.
Unrest has spread this week to tea plantations.
Tea is Malawi's largest export after tobacco.
Mr Louis Chimango, Malawi's finance minister, said in Paris the government
would allow the Red Cross to inspect prisons, and give a court trial to Mr
Chakufwa Chihana, a trade unionist arrested last month after calling for
multi-party elections. Beyond that, Mr Chimango refused to give further
details of how Malawi planned to satisfy donors and said he had no idea how
to fund the aid shortfall.
Three international labour leaders were allowed to visit Mr Chihana
yesterday.

ISRAEL yesterday reacted sharply to a statement by the US that Washington
supported a 1948 UN resolution recognising the right of Palestinian refugees
to return to their original homes, a proposition that all mainstream Israeli
parties reject as a threat to the existence of the Jewish state.
stressed at a news briefing:
Ms Margaret Tutwiler, state department spokeswoman, following a call by
Jerusalem to clarify her statement, said yesterday that the issues raised in
the resolution 'can only be resolved through a process of direct
negotiations among the parties themselves.'
The exchange came as talks were due to get under way in Ottawa yesterday on
the plight of Palestinian refugees convened as part of the multilateral
phase of the Middle East peace process.
Israel refused to attend the talks because representatives of the
Palestinian exiles were invited as well as residents of the occupied
territories. They declared their intention of having the issue of their
right to return put on the agenda.
Washington advised the Palestinians not to raise the issue but was clearly
irritated by the Israeli stance. Ms Tutwiler said late on Tuesday that the
US continued to support Resolution 194, which recognises the right to return
home, or to compensation for losses, for Palestinians who fled or were
forced from their homes in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed
establishment of the state of Israel.
Ms Tutwiler said Washington did not want to 'interpret' the resolution -
apparently signalling that the US did not envisage in practice a flow of
refugees back to parts of what is now Israel. Refugees from the 1948 and
subsequent wars number about 2.5m. But her statement deepened a rift between
the Bush administration and the Israeli government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIAN opposition groups have demanded an investigation into the
business interests of President Suharto's children as the first week of a
general election campaign nears its close.
Mr Soerjadi, chairman of the Indonesian Democratic party, one of two
opposition parties, has condemned a monopoly in trading in cloves granted
last year to BPPC, a private company headed by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, Mr
Suharto's youngest son.
Cloves are the key ingredient in Indonesia's fragrant kretek cigarettes. The
monopoly had a projected turnover of about Rp1,000bn (Pounds 275m) last year
but Mr Putra has said BPPC was unable to service Rp759bn in soft loans from
Bank Indonesia, the central bank.
Mr Soerjadi also criticised a monopoly in orange trade in the Kalimantan
region, granted to a subsidiary of a group headed by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo,
Mr Suharto's second son.
The presidential family was also attacked earlier in the week by Mr Deliar
Noor, a member of the Forum for the Purification of Democracy, a leading
dissident group which includes retired generals and religious leaders.
Mr Noor accused Mr Suharto of 'nepotism' and described the business
interests of his children as 'an abuse of power'.
The governing Golkar party, however, is likely to retain power in the June 9
election with a large majority, bolstered by its 20-year record of economic
growth averaging more than over 6 per cent a year.
But the sensitive issue of his children's businesses may embarrass the
71-year-old president before he faces an election next March when he is
expected to stand for a sixth term of office. His election has never been
contested as all the parties have nominated him as their candidate.

MR Edgardo Espiritu, president and vice-chairman of the state-controlled
Philippine National Bank (PNB), the country's largest commercial bank,
yesterday resigned after a pre-election row over encashment of government
cheques issued to local government officials around the country.
The resignation was immediately accepted by President Corazon Aquino who was
expected to announce the appointment of Mr Federico Pascual, the present PNB
vice-president, as officer-in-charge until early next month.
Mr Espiritu was caught in the political flak last week when he told PNB
branch managers not to encash cheques totalling some 980m pesos (Pounds 21m)
that the government had given to 42,000 officials.
The timing of the cheques' release was widely interpreted as a move to
influence last Monday's general election, although the government had argued
that these were regular allotments from tax collections.
Mr Espiritu is a known supporter of Mr Ramon Mitra, presidential candidate
of the the Democratic Filipino Struggle party while Mrs Aquino backs Mr
Fidel Ramos, the former defence secretary.

PAPUA New Guinea (PNG) said yesterday its troops had landed in the south of
the secessionist island of Bougainville for the first time since the
national army and police withdrew in 1990.
Mr Rabbie Namaliu, prime minister, said 15 soldiers landed at the village of
Siwai on Saturday and set up a base in the area. Mr Namalie said a further
60 troops have been stationed on a nearby island.
Mr Namaliu said the troops were despatched in response to requests from
local chiefs and village leaders. He said the leaders feared for their
safety following executions carried out earlier this year by the
secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army.
Mr Namaliu said the landing was designed to help restore services to the
south of Bougainville, which has suffered lack of food and medical supplies
since PNG imposed a blockade on the island two years ago. However, he said
the PNG government is committed to seeking a peaceful solution to the
crisis.

MR Rashid Solh, a 66-year-old Sunni Moslem parliamentary deputy and former
prime minister, became Lebanon's new premier yesterday, a week after his
predecessor resigned in the wake of nationwide anti-government riots.
The Lebanese pound rose to LPounds 1,425 to the dollar on the strength of
the news, compared with a record low of LPounds 2,100 last week.
The formation of a proposed 24-member cabinet is still being negotiated by
representataives of Lebanon's religious communities. The 1989 Taif peace
accords said that political office should progressively be dissociated from
religious affiliation, but the quarrel over cabinet seats shows how deeply
rooted the sectarian system is.
Maronite Phalangists who have split between the Lebanese Forces militia led
by Dr Samir Geagea and the Phalangist party led by Mr George Saadeh are
demanding more positions in the next government to enable them to block
decisions by majority pro-Syrian ministers. The defence, interior and
foreign affairs portfolios are likely to stay unchanged with former militia
leaders again in government.
Mr Solh is the fourth member of a prominent Beirut Sunni family to become
prime minister. He has been a deputy since 1964 and served as prime minister
for seven months from 1974, but his government fell when a brawl broke out
in parliament at the beginning of the civil war in April 1975. His main task
will be to oversee parliamentary elections scheduled for this summer.

<TEXT>
INDIA yesterday alleged that commercial considerations were behind a US
decision to ban exports to the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and
'to thwart India from growing into an important economic entity in the
international space market.'
The allegation was made by Prof UR Rao, Isro chairman. He claimed the US was
aware of India's low launch costs, saying: 'We are going to be an important
economic entity in the multi-billion dollar space market. Therefore, reasons
for the two-year ban on exports to India are totally commercial.'
Prof Rao said the US sanctions would delay Isro's projects and would force
it to exceed its budget.
India's satellite development programme could be crippled by the ban.
Although India has made limited progress in rocket technology - the purchase
of which from Russia attracted US sanctions against India and Russia - its
satelite programme is progressing well and it has many potential buyers. But
satellite development depends heavily on US supplies of components now
banned. Electronic components required for satellites form a big share of
imports from the US.
It is not clear, however, whether joint ventures between Indian and US
companies involved in supply of such components are covered by the ban.
Prof Rao said Isro chose Russian technology when bids by General Dynamics of
the US and France's Arianespace were four times the Dollars 250m (Pounds
139m) quoted by Russia's Glavkosmos, also covered by the US ban. Prof Rao
said General Dynamics told India its cryogenic engines, which Isro is buying
from Russia, did not come under Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)
regulations.

Nigerian students, angered by chronic fuel shortages, smashed cars during a

from Lagos.
There were no immediate reports of clashes with riot police, who took up
positions near Lagos University and in other areas late on Tuesday after
student leaders called for two days of protests against the fuel shortage in
the oil-producing country and to air other grievances.
Other witnesses said police turned back scores of vehicles from Oshodi. Some
drivers, who made it through the area, had green leaves on their cars to
show solidarity with the students.
The military government earlier ordered the deployment of troops to help end
fuel shortages in Nigeria caused mainly by cross-border smuggling and
hoarding.
Defence Headquarters, quoted by state radio, ordered special border patrols
to stop smuggling, escorts for tankers and the immediate closure of all
petrol stations within 25km (16 miles) of Nigeria's land frontiers.

THE RUSSIAN government yesterday more than doubled teachers' and doctors'
pay after they had threatened to strike for a 10-fold increase.
The two groups are among the poorest in Russia, earning about Rbs700 a month
(the minimum wage has just been increased to Rbs900 to help people survive
price liberalisation and rapid inflation).
The government also announced plans to levy import taxes of 5-10 per cent to
reduce the import bill. They will come into effect in August, and follow a
13 per cent increase in first quarter imports, compared with a year ago.
That pushed the balance of payments deficit for the period to Dollars 2bn.
Mr Andrei Vavilov, first deputy finance minister, said separately that the
government aimed to unify import tariffs so that their average level did not
exceed 15 per cent.
Import taxes were suspended in January until June in order to encourage
imports so there would be goods on the shelves when the government freed
most consumer prices at the start of the year. Mr Pyotr Aven, foreign
economic relations minister, told Interfax news agency the government was
also considering an extra 28 per cent VAT on imports.
Meanwhile, a law setting a framework for regulating currency operations was
submitted to parliament yesterday. Rather than spelling out what would and
what would not be allowed, it listed areas for which the central bank would
have to provide more detailed regulations, such as conditions for exporting
capital.

<TEXT>
THE SOCIAL chapter of the European Community's Maastricht treaty is badly
flawed, according to Unice, the European industrial and employers'
confederation. Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, the organisation's secretary general,
told an FT conference on the impact of EC law and policy that allowing
Britain to opt out of the social chapter had set a precedent which could
lead to abandonment of the 'one Community' principle .
However, what concerns Unice more is the extension of qualified majority
voting to issues involving working conditions, and information and
consultation processes. Six member states acting together would be enough to
push a measure through, given the weighted voting system.
'You will have six states determining social policy for 18 countries of
Europe - a long way from the requirement for greater democracy,' said Mr
Tyszkiewicz.
The problem was made worse because some EC governments were unable to stand
firm, even against their better judgment, in the social field. Unice cited
the working time directive, which it said many governments had described as
expensive and hindering flexible use of working time.
The organisation expressed its pleasure with some aspects of the new social
chapter, such as the statutory obligation for the Commission to consult the
social partners (employers and unions) on social policy measures, but Mr
Tyszkiewicz warned the Commission against attempting to legislate where it
was not satisfied with an agreement negotiated by the social partners.
'We cannot do the job with the Commission breathing down our necks. That
must be made plain,' he said. Dr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director general
for competition at the Commission, told the conference that 'a reinforced
competition policy' was needed to underpin the creation of the internal
market, but there would be greater emphasis on curbing state aid and on
deregulation.
In the telecommunications field, a review of the voice monopoly would be
undertaken this year. 'The Commission cannot ignore the fact that
(telephone) calls between member states are two to three times more
expensive than the equivalent distance calls inside member states. This
constitutes a surcharge on trade and a block to the internal market
process,' he said.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union comfortably
passed its first hurdle yesterday, with a large government majority in the
national assembly in favour of the corresponding revision of the country's
constitution.
The legislation must now go through the Senate, before a final vote in a
joint session of parliament. Only then will France be able to ratify the
treaty, either in a simple parliamentary law or by referendum.
The national assembly debate dragged on all night as deputies ploughed
through 80 amendments. The final vote in mid-morning yesterday was 398-77,
with 99 abstentions. This was a significantly bigger majority than might
have been predicted, given the vociferous opposition from a minority of
right-wing Gaullists and other nationalists.
Last week, Mr Philippe Seguin, a nationalist Gaullist, mustered the support
of 101 deputies, including 58 Gaullists, in a move to reject the treaty in
its entirety. In yesterday's vote, many Gaullists changed their minds, and
only 31 voted against the constitutional revision.
The government may have owed its enlarged majority to its acceptance of four
opposition amendments. The most significant will give parliament a greater
involvement in debating Community legislation; other amendments are purely
symbolic, like the one declaring French to be the language of the republic.
The government also assuaged some Gaullist fears by declaring that France's
right to impose a veto in defence of vital national interests, by virtue of
the so-called Luxembourg compromise, was just as great as ever. In reality,
this right of veto is purely imaginary.
However, it ignored Gaullist protests against the Maastricht provision
giving the vote in local elections to people from other EC countries.
Yesterday's result will restore the government's confidence that it will
secure a majority in the Senate and the minimum three-fifths majority in the
joint session, which which be held in Versailles.
The debate provided a further bonus for the government in its vivid
demonstration of the acute divisions between the conservative opposition
parties over the EC. There is a deep gulf between the Gaullists who are
allergic to anything which smacks of federalism and the centre-right UDF and
centrist UDC groups, which are firmly committed to the principle of European
integration.
Gaullists are further split between those who are reticent about the
Community and those who are downright hostile, with only a small minority in
favour.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday pulled back from recommending the
immediate liberalisation of cross-border and direct mail services.
Its long-awaited green paper on the single market in postal services
suggests gradual liberalisation, a significant softening of tone compared
with earlier drafts which recommended their removal from post office
monopolies. Some national postal authorities have lobbied hard to preserve
their monopoly rights over mail services.
While the paper recommends more liberalisation, it reiterates the right of
each member state to apply for a 'more restrictive solution' under the EC
treaty, in the interests of preserving a universal mail service for all
consumers.
Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, launching the discussion
document with Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the commissioner responsible for
the sector, said he would not rule out the use of special Commission powers
to break open national monopolies without approval of member states.
Sir Leon has forced the pace of change by recommending the liberalisation of
express services and publications, and trying to restrict the scope of
reserved areas - such as domestic private and business correspondence - in
which national monopolies would be allowed to maintain control.
He stressed yesterday that the Commission would move quickly to turn its
discussion document into legislation. However, it will come under continued
pressure from national postal adminstrations not to challenge public
monopolies.
Mr Pat Lupo, chairman and chief executive of the international express
service DHL, said yesterday: 'It is disappointing to see the Commission
yielding to pressure to amend its original proposals concerning cross-border
services.'
Mr Jim Campbell, counsel for the International Express Carriers Conference
and European Express Organisation representing many private operators, said
the paper still contained 'unwarranted traditional assumptions', although he
praised its general move towards liberalisation.
The British Post Office welcomed the EC's gradual move towards
liberalisation.
The Commission has called for the establishment of a set of reserved areas
in which national administrations would be able to keep their monopoly. Such
a commitment would preserve standards and ensure a universal postal service,
the Commission believes. Reserved services should include domestic personal
and business correspondence, the Commission says. 'A (standard) service
would be available everywhere in the Community, ..irrespective of the
accessibility of certain regions,' said Mr Pandolfi.
The paper also recommends the creation of an independent regulator to
achieve 'the best balance between public and private operators'.
Composite insurers (which combine life and non-life operations) will be
allowed to establish branches in any EC member state under legislation
expected to be agreed by ministers today. The third life assurance directive
will override clauses in a 1979 directive, which restricted composite
insurers' rights to create new branches in countries outside their
traditional homes of Italy, Belgium and the UK.
Ministers are also set to discuss the vexed issue of frontier controls on
goods, including checks on animals. Britain and Ireland want to maintain
such checks, to help prevent the spread of rabies.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Carbon tax faces Europe with steep cost rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S decision by the EC Commission to back a carbon tax could lead to
big rises in the price of fuels most commonly used by Europe's industry. But
it addresses what is widely seen as the most pressing environmental issue of
the day: the growth in 'greenhouse gases' which threaten to change the
world's climate through global warming.
EC figures show that a Dollars 10 tax per barrel-of-oil-equivalent by 2000
would have the biggest impact on industry and power station operators. They
would have to pay 58 per cent more for hard coal, 45 per cent more for heavy
fuel oil and 34 per cent more for natural gas.
The prices of petrol and diesel fuel would have to rise by 6 per cent and 11
per cent respectively. For households, the impact of the tax would be
equivalent to a 16 per cent increase in light fuel oil prices, while natural
gas prices would rise by 14 per cent.
Although scientists disagree on the scale of the threat, many bodies,
including the EC Commission, have adopted a 'no regrets' policy of curbing
carbon emissions because of the other benefits it brings, such as energy
conservation. The EC has also set itself the target of reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
However a big attack on global carbon emissions will need the co-operation
of the US which, as the chart shows, is the worst offender among the large
industrial nations. The Bush administration has refused to set specific
targets and deadlines, arguing that it is more important to draw up
appropriate measures and follow them through. It also has doubts that the EC
can meet the targets it has set itself.
Last week, the US forced a compromise on a proposed treaty on global warming
which is to be signed at next month's Earth Summit in Rio. This will not
contain the binding commitments which were originally proposed. Instead, the
developed countries will be required to draw up plans to curb emissions.
Yesterday's resolution by the Commission also requires Japan to back the tax
before it can be adopted. However Japan's record on emissions is among the
best of the industrial countries, and so far, Tokyo has shown little
enthusiasm for adding a tax to the already long list of regulatory measures
it has taken to clean its air.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Preacher Pat hopes to work a miracle at UPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOURNALISTS did not know whether to laugh, cry, or welcome the apparent
rescue of a venerable institution.
'It's unfair, he'll get his scoops from God,' they said; or: 'We can't
compete with a hotline to Heaven.'
The news, from a bankruptcy auction in Rutland, Vermont, late on Tuesday,
was that a television evangelist had made a cash bid for United Press
International.
The Rev Marion G. Robertson is universally known on earth - and perhaps
upstairs - as Pat. He put in the only complete bid for UPI, the 85-year-old
news agency that has been on its last legs for more than a decade.
UPI prided itself on being first with the news of President Kennedy's
assassination and won nine hallowed Pulitzer prizes for its news coverage.
Pat Robertson is undoubtedly the best known televangelist not now in jail
for fraud or otherwise under a cloud for sexual misdemeanours. More than
that, he ran for the Republican presidential nomination four years ago on an
extremely conservative platform and spent more than Dollars 20m to carry
five states in the primaries.
Yesterday, he first said he had no intention of turning UPI into a religious
wire service or otherwise to change its traditional editorial content. Then
he appeared on his 700 Club flagship programme and pronounced that buying
UPI might be 'a little opportunity' for God to touch the media 'with his
truth and love'.
Mr Robertson used to claim he communicated directly with the Almighty fairly
frequently. This assertion may disturb UPI's biggest remaining client, the
definitely non-Christian Kyodo news agency of Japan. It has said it would
tear up its annually renewable contract if what it got took on a
proselytising tone.
Until Tuesday night, Mr Robertson had not entered the public's political
consciousness much since 1988.
But he has not exactly been idle in the past four years, as his contingent
all-cash Dollars 6m bid for UPI demonstrates. The condition is that he has
30 days to look at UPI's books, after which he may lower or withdraw his
offer.
Mr Robertson's vehicle for the offer is US Media, formed a year ago as the
for-profit offshoot of his tax-exempt Christian Broadcasting Network.
He runs a sophisticated corporate network. Another arm is International
Family Entertainments, which runs the cable Family Channel and went public
last month. The offering valued the stock held by Mr Robertson and his son
at dollars 90m, constituting a positively unholy return on an initial
investment of dollars 183,000.
UPI has gone in the other direction and is a shadow of its former self. In
the 1980s, it went through several hands and twice filed for bankruptcy.
Even divine intervention, however, may not be enough to keep UPI afloat for
much longer.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (18): When profit comes before
policy - UK utilities face energy efficiency dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW years ago, Walt Patterson and his wife halved their electricity bill
by replacing all their lights with low energy lamps. 'It was a pretty
sizeable investment - about Pounds 10-Pounds 12 per light. But after two to
three years we have already recovered that,' he says.
Few householders are as enlightened as Mr Patterson, an energy specialist
who was one of the first to preach the environmental gospel. But if only
more of us would replace our lamps, the savings in national energy
consumption would be 'spectacular', says Mr Patterson.
'If people caught on how much they could save, just for lighting, the
regional electricity companies would be very worried. Their sales would drop
like a stone.'
There, he says, is the rub. The regional electricity companies which supply
domestic customers are not promoting energy efficiency products because
their profits depend primarily on selling more electricity, not helping
customers to save it.
Brenda Boardman, at Oxford University's Environmental Change Unit, agrees.
'At the moment, the regulation governing the regional electricity companies
is structured around them being utilities, and being on a growth curve by
selling more units,' she says.
'I want them to become energy service companies, selling warmth and lighting
rather than units of electricity,' she says. This would mean the companies
would consider insulating homes and installing low energy lighting as
alternatives to supplying more power.
There is, she says, enormous scope for saving. 'Say your fridge uses 100
units of energy. The average new fridge will use 90, a saving of around 10
per cent. If you are well informed, and buy the best fridge on the UK market
you will be down to 43. And if you buy the best fridge anywhere on the world
market, you will be down to 19 - a saving of 80 per cent.'
The super-efficient fridge, moreover, will not necessarily be more
expensive. There is no correlation between the capital cost of a fridge, and
its efficiency.
What Ms Boardman, Mr Patterson and many others advocate is 'least cost
planning,' also called 'demand side management'. Briefly, this means meeting
the country's energy needs by energy conservation measures whenever that is
cheaper than building new power stations.
At the moment, there is very little demand side management in Britain. The
legislation brought in when the electricity industry was privatised two
years ago, has no provision for demand side management, except that the
regional electricity companies must promote energy efficiency.
'That means leaflets, which is a minor point,' says Ms Boardman. 'Most just
give general advice like 'insulation is good,' whereas what's often needed
is household specific advice and money.'
And, she points out, the government has been unclear about its objectives,
failing to distinguish clearly whether it wants to reduce demand, promote
energy efficiency, (getting more from each unit of energy), or simply cut
the carbon dioxide emissions which result from burning fossil fuels and
cause global warming by any possible means.
Privatisation, she suggests, may have made demand side planning a less easy
option, because when the government controlled the industry it could decide
whether to opt for supplying more power, or managing demand.
'Before, the government could, for instance, have considered giving Pounds
1bn to the Department of the Environment to spend on insulation, rather than
building new power stations. Now, industry has to be able to compare those
options.'
One of the strongest arguments why demand side management will not work in
the UK electricity industry now is that it is not 'vertically integrated'.
Privatisation split the electricity generators - who build most power
stations and are the primary suppliers of power - from the regional
electricity companies - who sell it to meet customers' demand.
This means there is no longer one integrated company which can compare a
'supply side' option, like building a new power station, with a 'demand
side' option, like insulating more homes.
Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, made this point in a brief
examination of least cost planning in an energy efficiency review produced
last year.
This argues that what the regional electricity companies do will not affect
the generators' decision to build or not to build new plant, and that the
regional companies would have to recoup the cost of investing in
demand-management programmes by putting up their prices.
'The question in the UK is, what is the incentive for regional electricity
companies to promote energy savings?' says Mr Tony Boreman, at Offer. At the
moment, there are two main reasons why the companies actually have a
disincentive to promote energy saving.
First, if they invest in installing low energy lights in domestic homes, for
example, they cannot pass the cost on to customers. By contrast, they can
charge customers for the cost of buying more power.
Second, the companies have a relatively stable cost base, which means that
more unit sales mean more profits. This means that even if they could
recover the costs of putting the lighting in, they would lose out because
the new lights would consume fewer units of electricity.
This has not completely deterred regional companies from investing in energy
efficiency - competition from gas has encouraged them to use energy
efficiency as a marketing tool, especially when it comes to selling industry
electrical solutions to problems.
'It is in the interest of the industry to keep customers away from gas,'
says Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth. 'But in
the small business and domestic market there is no incentive to save energy.
It is not happening in existing homes.' What is needed, he says, is real
incentives, and penalties for companies that do not encourage demand
management.
Mr Tim Wolfe, at the Association for the Conservation of Energy (ACE),
believes a system could be introduced in the UK. 'There has been lots of
opposition from the Conservative party in the UK, saying it is not
appropriate because our industry is not vertically integrated. I don't
believe that matters.'
Others agree. Firstly, the regional companies do have some avoidable
supply-side costs - such as spending on sub-stations or upgrading their
local networks - which they can offset against managing demand. Second,
points out Mr Wolfe, they can be given an incentive to invest in demand
management.
So far, Offer has suggested the possibility of introducing an 'E factor,' as
the gas industry did last year. This 'E factor' would be added to the
regulatory formulas that govern how much the regional electricity companies
can increase electricity prices to customers. It would allow the cost of
approved energy saving programmes to be reflected in the electricity price.
But this, Mr Wolfe believes, is not enough. 'Say a programme costs Pounds
5m, and saves the company Pounds 7m in the cost of buying more power - they
have already made Pounds 2m. But they might have lost Pounds 2.5m in
revenues from the power they would have sold. We believe they should be
allowed to recover that Pounds 2.5m. Not the Pounds 5m the programme cost -
just the Pounds 2.5m.'
An E factor which allows the companies to recoup the costs of energy saving
programmes would encourage them to spend on programmes, but not save energy,
he says. But an E factor which allowed them to recoup lost revenues would
encourage them to spend less on the programme, and save units. 'This is a
fundamental issue, and one I don't believe Offer will meet head on.'
Brenda Boardman agrees. 'At the moment there is a double disincentive - no
pass through of costs, and no profit except by selling more units.'
'There should also be a greater emphasis on planning,' suggests Mr Wolfe.
'Offer could require the regional companies to put forward energy plans
every two years, or could set the companies targets.'
Most important, say all advocates of least cost planning, is to change the
regulation governing the regional electricity companies, so that their
profits are not directly linked to higher sales.
'If their costs were unit-sensitive, but not their profits, then instead of
advertising at you to buy things, they would be discouraging you, because it
would cost them more,' says one commentator.
Offer has asked for comments on its energy efficiency document before June,
and may then move to implement some form of E factor. It is unlikely,
however, that it will be enough to get the regional companies installing low
energy lights and fridges.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (17): All eyes on Kuala Lumpur -
Malaysia spearheads sell-offs in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY the end of this month the first stage in the privatisation of Malaysia's
state electricity board will be completed when 23 per cent of the company's
shares begin trading on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.
The minority flotation of the state-owned utility, Tenaga Nasional Berhad
(TNB), is the biggest yet in Asia's developing countries, where most of the
region's utilities are under state control.
Malaysia's experiment in privatisation is being closely watched in view of
widespread moves in the region to make the power sector operate more
commercially. The TNB flotation involves the allocation of 625m of its 3bn
shares to the private sector, with most of the shares going to domestic
institutions, the public at large and to employees and a further 60m
allocated to international investors.
Baring Brothers, the UK merchant bank, lead managed the international
offering. The offering was heavily oversubscribed and 'grey market'
indications are that official share trading will see TNB shares hitting the
market well above their offer price of MDollars 4.50 per share.
The TNB flotation dates from the late 1980s when the Malaysian government
began soliciting advice on how to privatise the utility, then known as the
National Electricity Board (NEB). At that time, Mr Samy Vellu, the energy
minister, hoped to float a majority of the shares, leaving the government as
a minority shareholder, but retaining overall sovereignty for the utility
through control of a so-called 'golden share'.
That plan was abandoned given the complexity of trying to ensure a fair
distribution of the shares among Malaysian institutions and the ethnic
Malay, as opposed to the Chinese, public. It has been a cornerstone of
Malaysian domestic policy since 1969 to broaden the Malay share of national
corporate wealth to match the more commercially successful ethnic Chinese
population.
Malays comprise 58 per cent of the population of 18m, the Chinese and
Indians comprising 33 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. Critics of the
privatisation scheme argued that the TNB was almost too good to put on the
marketplace.
Malaysia is technically self-sufficient in energy with large gas and oil
reserves and abundant hydroelectric potential. It now delivers piped gas to
Singapore and is at the crossroads of a partially completed trans-ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Nations) gas pipeline grid, extending from
Thailand to Indonesia.
With an installed capacity of 5,000 MW, Malaysia is not burdened by the
population demands of Indonesia (180m, 9,000 MW) and its 1:3.5 ratio of
kilowatts per head of population far exceeds the Asian average of 1:10 (the
European average is roughly 1.5:1).
The government has argued that injections of private capital were needed to
improve the TNB's efficiency and meet the demands of new industry. It has
set an ambitious target of adding a further 3,000 MW of new capacity to
reach 7,834 MW by 1995, largely through the addition of hydroelectric and
combined cycle power stations to the national grid.
Mr Vellu recently declared that Malaysia wanted 'to become Asia's
powerhouse'. The TNB's restructuring required it to be removed from
governmental control. This necessitated its corporatisation, which took
place in September 1990. After that, it was up to national and foreign
bankers to put together an action plan that could be sold to the public.
As well as an impressive boost in generating capacity, the TNB is predicting
a sharp increase in profits. Last year, its turnover was MDollars 3.7bn,
with after-tax profits of MDollars 501m. It foresees an after-tax profit
rise to MDollars 820m this year and MDollars 969m in 1993.
With electricity tariffs forecast to remain stable, this could mean a
sell-off of some of the utility's assets, particularly thermal power
stations which would be run by private operators. It is already in talks
with Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong to build a MDollars 4.6bn (Dollars
1.7bn) thermal power station on a build-operate-transfer basis. Hopewell
would run the station for a specified number of years, recouping its
installation costs from the sale of electricity into the TNB grid.
To the alarm of some, TNB's long-range programme includes a closer
examination of nuclear. When the flotation was first mooted, Mr. Vellu,
commenting on the problems facing Britain's electricity privatisation, said:
'Thank goodness, we do not have nuclear.' Analysts suggest that this
position really has not changed and that nuclear was put into the current
flotation prospectus as a demonstration of the utility's technological
prowess, rather than as an indicator of true, long-term intent.
With the minority flotation just being completed, there are no immediate
plans to float any more shares, though the TNB - with the government holding
a golden share - may decide to do so later in the decade. The possibility
that shareholders might have to fund a showpiece (and probably unnecessary)
nuclear power station might provide a big disincentive to a further
devolution of the utility.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (15): Flickers of anxiety -
Chris Cragg takes the pulse of Japan's nuclear industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS CRAGG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, nuclear power in Japan has a rosy future. With 42 units
in operation, with a gross capacity of 33,404MW, the industry had an average
capacity factor of 73.4 per cent in February.
By most standards, this capacity factor - a measure of output against the
theoretical maximum availability - is excellent. Japanese reactors work
well.
Equally, apart from the comparatively minor Mihama incident in February
1991, a primary coolant tube rupture in the steam generator, Japanese
nuclear energy has been remarkably free of accidents and Japan relatively
free of the knee-jerk antagonism to nuclear electricity that is familiar in
Britain, Germany and the US.
Yet within the electricity industry as a whole, there is a creeping
nervousness about the promise of nuclear.
On the surface all appears normal. Last month, the centrifuges of Japan's
Nuclear Fuel Industries' (JNFl) uranium enrichment plant at Rokkashomura
started to roll out the planned 150,000 separative work units (SWUs) a year
of enriched uranium. The eventual target will be 1,500,000 SWUs a year.
Rokkashomura, after some initial local nervousness, will eventually become
Japan's version of Sellafield, reprocessing spent fuel into re-usable
uranium and plutonium ready for the fast breeder reactors Japan plans to
build.
Nowhere else in the world is there quite the faith that the nuclear fuel
cycle will be closed.
The mid-term MITI plan for the nation's electricity foresees 72,500MW of
capacity by 2010. Yet it is this apparent vote of confidence that is making
Japan's power utilities nervous.
It represents an expansion in capacity which would considerably more than
double the units now in operation.
What bothers the industry is where these new units are going to go and just
how long it will take to persuade the inhabitants of any new sites to accept
them.
Furthermore, demanding that the nuclear construction industry should build
two 1,000MW reactors per year for the next 20 years is a challenge only the
Japanese would take seriously.
Japan does indeed have 10 reactors under construction, amounting to a
combined total of 10,488MW, with the last on line in October 1996.
Permission for two further plant, amounting to 2,181MW has also been given.
The problem is that planning authorisation for some of these plant dates
back as far as 1982. As a recent MlTl survey disclosed, the lead time for
building a nuclear plant, including finding a site as well as construction
time is now over 25 years. This lead time has been increasing steadily, from
just over eight years in the 1970s to just over 17 years in the 1980s.
The nub of the problem is space. In contrast to German or US methods, the
Japanese power corporations have, like the French, adopted a policy of
financial persuasion in relation to the inhabitants of a potential nuclear
site. Yet localities have become increasingly sophisticated and demanding in
return.
While the power companies complain that the inhabitants fail to realise the
real economic benefits to the neighbourhood in terms of local industry and
jobs, the locality-minded Japanese often object to the export of the power
from the area to supply the cities.
In Japan, where land is extremely expensive close to the largest power
demand, this makes for huge difficulties.
Consequently, the current draft nuclear budget for fiscal 1992 from MlTl has
increased last year's allocation for power plant siting promotion by 10.6
per cent to Y43,000m (Dollars 341m) with a further Y16,205m going on special
subsidies to those around future sites. At this rate, the state will be
spending over Dollars 1bn every two years on nuclear plant siting.
The total MlTl draft budget for the Nuclear Power Resources Siting Account,
including safety and grants to develop local industrial complexes, now
amounts to over Y80bn a year.
Even with this and offers of up to 50 per cent discounts for local
consumers, it is still easier to build a plant on an established site, but
there are limits even to this.
Tokyo Electric Power, for example, has hopes of a planned 1,356MW reactor at
Kashiwazaki Kariwa on the north coast of Honshu Island. Yet if this goes
ahead, it will be the seventh unit on the site, giving it an enormous
8,212MW of capacity. The twin sites of Fukushima host 9,096MW of capacity,
although not in such a small area.
By contrast Tohoku Electric Power's proposed plan to build a reactor on a
new site at Maki, again on the north coast of Honshu, has had an authorised
plan since 1981 but commercial operation is not expected before 2000.
With these kind of problems, even those within the Japanese nuclear industry
are beginning to wonder if the MlTl targets for 2010 are not too high. Yet
Japanese power consumption, in comparison with both Europe and the US,
continues to grow more rapidly than expectations. The problem is that peak
demand is growing more rapidly than the average demand in most parts of the
country.
Tokyo Electric, for example, had a peak demand of 27.3GW in 1980, compared
with 44.7GW in 1990, while base-load grew by a much smaller percentage.
Seasonal demand in Tokyo used to be only 29 per cent above base load in
1980. It is now expected to be 38 per cent above it in 1999.
Such increases in peak demand - apparently much increased by a craze for
personal cleanliness amongst Japanese youth and hence greater use of hot
water - do not sit easily with the rising capital and site-finding costs of
nuclear capacity.
Nuclear remains primarily a base-load provider, when run at its most
efficient. Consequently many now believe that the real need in the Japanese
network is for more gas-fired stations that can follow the load curve.
As a result, some of the largest corporations in Japan met last December to
discuss the idea of a Japanese trunkline gas grid, using Russian Sakhalin
and Yakutsk gas. Significantly, among them were Tokyo Electric Power and
Kansai Electric Power, the two largest power utilities.
Whether such a pipeline will come to fruition remains impossible to say.
Nonetheless, there are plenty of trends to indicate greater use of gas-fired
generation in Japan.
Cogeneration, although still trivial in relation to grid supply, has doubled
to 1.9GW since 1989.
More gas companies are switching from LPG and towngas to imported natural
gas, thus developing the potential for household use. Perhaps most
significantly of all, Tokyo Electric Power is planning to build the world's
largest gas-fired combined cycle station at Yokohama, close to its area of
peak demand. At 2,800MW, this could be running in 1996, five years after the
proposal.
Needless to say, this does not suggest that Japan's nuclear expansion is
over. Certainly nobody would admit as much officially. Nonetheless, it may
be slowing down.

 -Andrew Holmes on the power stations that Communism built
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HOLMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent incident at the Sosnovy Bor nuclear power station near St
Petersburg has given rise to fears of another nuclear accident on the scale
of Chernobyl.
While the Sosnovy incident - a leak of radioactive gas on March 24 - bore no
relation to the Chernobyl disaster, it took place in the same reactor type,
the RBMK, and occurred only months after a fire at the Chernobyl 2 unit.
Another RBMK, lgnalina in Lithuania, has been the subject of safety reviews
by Swedish nuclear experts and, by all accounts, is in an alarming
condition.
Aside from the technical fallibility of these stations, reports from
Norwegian nuclear inspectors who have visited the Chernobyl and lgnalina
plants suggest that corruption has become endemic in equipment ordering and
in payment for repairs which are never actually carried out.
As one of the Norwegians put it in a recent interview with the
environmentalist newsletter, NNVF Bulletin, 'in a country with an economic
system where keeping accounts and auditing are unknown, fraud is an easy
business'. The command and control system in the USSR nuclear industry,
which was never very effective at the best of times, has now gone
altogether, leaving a dangerous vacuum in the oversight of nuclear
operations.
The RBMKs, and the whole nuclear sector, represent only one aspect of the
problems besetting the electricity industries of the former Comecon
countries.
It is nuclear power, however, which is causing the greatest alarm, not just
in the west, but in former parts of the USSR. Estonia was among the first
countries to demand a shutdown at Sosnovy Bor.
Nuclear power also poses most urgently the question which faces much of the
decrepit and highly-pollutant plants in eastern Europe: should technical
help from the West aim to refurbish the plants, or get rid of them?
Apart from the RBMKs, the nuclear plants which cause most trepidation in
neighbouring countries are the four pressurised water reactors at Kozloduy
in Bulgaria. The various western inspection teams which have visited the
site have reported a station which is badly maintained, run by an
under-trained and low-paid staff and in need of basic repairs at every
level.
A reactor in a similar condition, Greifswald in east Germany, was shut down
soon after German unification. Unlike east Germany, however, neither
Bulgaria nor any of the former regions of the Soviet Union which house RBMKs
can fall back into the arms of a rich western nation like West Germany.
Kozloduy exemplifies the key problem in the 'patch up or close down'
dilemma. Nuclear power provides more than a third of Bulgaria's electricity.
The country's hydro supply is limited and irregular at best, while its only
domestic fossil fuel sources are low-quality coal and highly-pollutant
lignite. The Ukraine, which houses 12 PWR units as well as the three
surviving units at Chernobyl, is in much the same condition.
The initial instincts of the numerous western companies which flocked into
eastern Europe when the Iron Curtain fell were to bring the stations up to
something approaching western safety standards. Experience has shown that
stations designed and built to such a low level of safety requirements are
in many cases beyond redemption. In any event, public pressure from the
Scandinavian countries, Germany and Austria is pulling governments and aid
agencies away from such solutions.
However, new power stations cost money. In the case of nuclear power, there
is also a large price to be paid in getting rid of the stations and the
enormous volume of waste which they leave behind in the form of irradiated
steel and concrete structures.
Outside the nuclear sector, there are other horrors such as the Polish
lignite-burning power stations which have turned parts of the country into a
poisonous wasteland.
A government survey in 1988 designated 27 areas as 'ecologically hazardous'.
These areas cover 11 per cent of the Polish land mass and house over one
third of the population. Power stations are only part of the problem, but
they are a large part. All but a tiny fraction of the nation's electricity
comes from coal of one type or another. The country's venture into the
nuclear sector proved short-lived and Poland has few if any other resources
which can be used in the short term.
Not all eastern European countries face problems on this scale. Hungary, for
example, is making swift progress, though even here, according to a recent
report by the International Energy Agency, the break-up of the centralised
Comecon nuclear structure, in which the USSR provided treated fuel and took
away waste for disposal, has presented the country's nuclear station, Paks,
with a new set of problems. These are tending to offset the good
performance, in technical terms, of the station itself.
Hungary is also suffering, like many former Comecon countries, from a lower
availability of Soviet electricity imports. The lEA sees positive signs that
an energy economy such as Hungary's can, with a cautious approach to
privatisation of basic industries, begin to get its energy market working on
something approaching western lines.
The dilemma which faces all these countries, however, is the most basic of
all, the pricing of energy supplies. In Russia, the 'liberalisation' of
energy pricing, involving an eight to ten-fold rise in consumer prices, due
to have taken place at the end of this winter, has now been delayed until
the end of the 'spring sowing season', in May or early June.
Further delays are possible, not to say probable, as the opposition to
market-based pricing grows. Liberalisation of pricing is a precondition
imposed by the International Monetary Fund on loans to Russia and the rest
of the ClS countries, but few if any will go ahead with price liberalisation
if Russia stalls.
It is, perhaps, difficult for westerners to appreciate the trauma which lies
ahead for every sector of the population in the ex-USSR and other countries
in the region, who have been taught to regard electricity as a basic
amenity, like bread and water.
It is here, at the most basic level, that the opportunity for change, in the
short term, must lie. The introduction of basic metering of electricity, and
the removal of incentives to waste it, could mark the way forward to the
beginnings of a more rational use of the vast resources of Russia and other
republics. Time, however, is pressing.
The eastern European countries do not have sufficient time to introduce
gradually the metering and payment systems which might ease the way towards
a more efficient use of energy sources.
Pressures from the lMF, among others, to raise revenue from energy tariffs,
along with even more misguided pressure to disaggregate and privatise the
electricity industry, threaten to make an orderly transition to energy
markets - as opposed to allocation systems - impossible.
In the meantime, western nations, and in particular the near neighbours of
the former USSR, need to find a way through the nuclear power problem. It is
already clear that neither privatisation nor the disaggregation of
monopolies will do much to improve these potentially lethal machines and end
the mismanagement which now makes them doubly dangerous.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (14): Power line under the ocean
 -Ulster is no longer an electricity island
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE ink was barely dry on the documents transferring ownership of Northern
Ireland's four power stations to the private sector when the province's
annual round of electricity price increases was announced.
A 4 per cent average rise in line with inflation was hardly surprising but
it handed detractors of privatisation a fresh platform for a bitter attack
on Ulster energy policy.
It underlined the fact that the Government is in the process of privatising
the power industry in spite of fierce opposition from consumer groups,
unionist and nationalist politicians and trade unions fearing massive job
cuts and higher tariffs.
Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), an amalgamation of four small municipal
authorities less than 20 years ago, ceased to exist as a public utility on
April 1. Its power stations were taken over and all of NIE's obligations and
employees moved to a new company, NIE plc. The new company, Ulster's
biggest, continues to have responsibility for providing a reliable supply of
electricity and controls the scheduling and despatch of all generating
units. The new power station owners have to compete for the right to sell
electricity to NIE.
It in turn has a statutory duty to operate the system in a manner
facilitating competition in generation and supply. NIE Plc is due for
flotation in November. In selling the power stations the over-riding concern
of Ministers was to inject as much competition as possible.
Historically, NIE's main problems have been its dependence on costly fuel
imports, isolation from national grids and its small size - peak winter
demand throughout the province was a mere 1,447MW last year.
The utility's 70 per cent dependence on oil led to big Government subsidies
in the early 1980s but modest profitability has been restored in recent
years as fuel costs have stabilised.
It could be argued that privatisation has provided an answer to all the
problems at a stroke and raised Pounds 353m for the Treasury's coffers.
British Gas has bought Ballylumford power station at Larne, County Antrim,
for Pounds 132.4m. The 1,080 MW oil-fired plant meets the demand of almost
half of NIE's 600,000 customers. The new owners will be converting the
station to run on natural gas by 1997.
Premier Transco, a new British Gas subsidiary, will be building, owning and
operating a pipeline to carry natural gas into Northern Ireland from
Scotland. Ballylumford will be the first user but the pipeline will also
service other suppliers wishing to bring gas to Ulster consumers.
Another subsidiary, Premier Energy Suppliers, is being established to market
the product in Northern Ireland. Both the pipeline and power station
conversion project have attracted European Community backing.
Terms have been agreed but British Gas has still to complete a detailed
undersea survey and complete negotiations with Bord Gais Eireann in Dublin
regarding the shared on-shore pipeline in Scotland.
Applied Energy Services and Tractebel, an American/Belgian consortium, have
formed a joint venture, NIGEN, to acquire Kilroot power station near
Carrickfergus and the Belfast West plant for a total of Pounds 214m.
However, the deal had not been finalised by the April 1 deadline. The
Department of Economic Development has taken over responsibility for running
the plants while NIE is providing a payroll system allowing wages to be
paid.
NIGEN has made it clear that an agreement with the Government has been
realised and the delay is due to 'technical reasons'. It said: 'It is not
because they can't raise the money. It is the process involved in project
financing which has led to the hold-up'.
NIGEN has Pounds 25m in place and is in the process of placing the remaining
capital with a syndicate of international banks.
Kilroot, Ulster's most modern station, is a dual coal and oil firing plant
with a capacity of 520MW satisfying about one third of the province's total
demand. Belfast West, the province's oldest station, is a 240MW coal-fired
plant covering about 10 per cent of demand.
Coolkeeragh power station at Londonderry, the only plant in the west of the
province, has been acquired in a management-employee-buy-out for Pounds
6.5m. The 420MW oil-fired station also meets about 10 per cent of demand but
is strategically important because of its geographical location.
The industry's competitive goals will be strengthened towards the end of the
1990s when an electricity inter-connector between Scotland and Ulster comes
on stream. Scottish Power and NIE reached agreement on the Pounds 170m
project before the power station sales. The cable will be capable of
transmitting 250MW of power and provide another mainland link.
There is also renewed interest in restoring the inter-connector with the
Republic of Ireland, out of commission since being repeatedly targeted by
the IRA in the 1970s. NIE and the Republic's Electricity Supply Board have
announced plans for a small power link providing back-up in the north-west
of the country.
With the new power station owners likely to figure in any competition for
future NIE generating requirements, it seems the industry is well placed to
meet demand, currently growing at 4 per cent a year.
The whole scenario throws a question mark over the exploitation of lignite,
the province's only indigenous source of fuel. It has been found in huge
quantities and studies suggest a lignite-fired power plant would be viable.
But given the environmental implication of such a project and the plans
already announced for meeting future requirements, lignite is unlikely to be
developed in the forseeable future.
The government has insisted that the privatisation is in the best interests
of tax payers and energy users.
But consumers will judge the restructuring of the industry by the bills
dropping through their letterboxes. Mr Geoffrey Horton, the new electricity
regulator appointed by the Government to protect consumers rights after
privatisation, is likely to be a busy man.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (13): Survivors share the spoils
 -Turbine makers cash in on gas revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's major suppliers of power generating equipment are emerging in
better shape from the painful restructuring of the late 1980s, but the flow
of deals in a complex industry has not yet been switched off.
Over the past five years, there have been two important and partly
overlapping corporate trends which have changed the face of the power
equipment industry.
The most obvious is the response of western, and especially European,
suppliers to a long-standing problem of overcapacity and to the challenges
of pan-Europe and global manufacturing.
The result was the mergers of the power engineering businesses of the UK's
GEC and Alsthom of France, and the creation of Asea Brown Boveri from Asea
of Sweden and Switzerland's Brown Boveri. Subsequently ABB paid Dollars
1.6bn for Combustion Engineering, the big US boiler maker.
Both ABB and GEC Alsthom have emerged stronger from the upheaval caused by
these link-ups, through eliminating duplication and consolidating
manufacturing to ensure they have the ability to withstand market downturns
and still spend heavily on research and development.
The second trend is based on technology, and especially the need for
equipment suppliers to have access to the gas turbine technology that forms
the basis for combined cycle power generation.
Deals exemplifying this trend include the 1989 joint venture between the
UK's Northern Engineering Industries, which lacked access to large gas
turbines, and ABB, which needed a direct presence in the UK power station
market; and the longstanding co-operation between General Electric of the US
and Alsthom of France - and hence now between GE and GEC Alsthom.
Most of these deals now look to be in place, and globally the industry has
coalesced loosely around four gas-turbine technologies - a reflection of the
high costs of staying in the combined cycle game.
The leaders in developing gas turbine technology are, naturally, at the
centre of these groupings: GE, which has gained leverage in power generation
from its aero-engine technology, and its mutually beneficial arrangement
with GEC Alsthom; ABB; Siemens of Germany; and the Mitsubishi/Westinghouse
partnership.
The two trends interlink because the strong growth of combined cycle has
exacerbated the overcapacity at European plants producing equipment for
large coal-fired stations and nuclear stations.
In the 1990s, however, a third trend is developing strongly from roots in
co-operation agreements struck on a one-off basis but now taking a more
central role in suppliers' regional strategies.
Mature Western markets, notwithstanding the importance for suppliers of
combined cycle orders in countries such as the UK and Netherlands, are
likely to grow only modestly, and attention is switching to the Far East -
and especially south-east Asia - and eastern Europe.
Western suppliers with finely-tuned political antennae have realised that
exploiting many of these markets increasingly involves co-operation
agreements, joint ventures, or technology transfers to partners or to local
subsidiaries. The requirement can be mutually beneficial for client country
and supplier - the former gets an enhanced manufacturing base and jobs,
while the latter can produce many large parts more economically when closer
to the end-user.
Some such links are longstanding, such as the agreement between Siemens and
India's Bharat Heavy Electrical (BHEL), but there have been a spate of
recent deals involving technology transfer and/or manufacturing under
licensing. In January GE, a past master at extending a helping hand via
partnership and associate relationships in around 60 countries, agreed to
transfer heavy duty gas turbine technology to Korea Heavy Industries (KHIC),
building on a 17-year association in steam turbines. ABB, Siemens, and GEC
Alsthom have also announced tie-ups in south-east Asia, with Korean
companies the most favoured partners.
In eastern Europe, another wave of takeovers and co-operation agreements has
developed since the fall of the former communist regimes and the
reunification of Europe. ABB and Siemens have been particularly active in
eastern Germany with a string of electrical engineering acquisitions.
Acquisitions have also taken place further east, notably ABB's takeover of
Zamech in Poland, and Siemens' purchase late last year of a 67 per cent
stake in the power engineering business of Skoda Pilsen in Czechoslovakia.
Such deals are motivated as much by the western suppliers' wish for
increased manufacturing flexibility, especially of low-value added
equipment, as by the necessity of preparing the ground for winning business
in markets with immense long-term power equipment needs.
Overall, therefore, the web of inter-relationships between power equipment
suppliers is increasing in geographical scope and complexity. Whether it
continues extending, or begins to contract further at its centre, will
depend on business trends.
Some in the industry question whether four separate gas turbine technologies
can survive long-term. But there is no sign that any of the main
protagonists are losing interest, and all remain committed to spending
heavily to increase still further combined cycle's thermal efficiency and
environmental friendliness.
Ultimately, the stability of the equipment supply industry's internal power
structure will hang partly on the pace of orders in the Far East, eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Another factor will be the market for plant specifically aimed at reducing
emissions, such as flue gas desulphurisation for large coal-fired power
stations. Here, suppliers rely on continuing popular and political pressure
for tougher controls - in strict commercial terms, after all, there is no
investment return from FGD.
However, there are also hundreds of power equipment companies that do not
fall into the web woven around the multinationals.
Many of the small- and medium-sized companies exploiting niches in the
developed world are benefiting from trends at the smaller end of power
generation, such as combined heat and power (CHP).
One such company is California-based Exergy, which is pioneering the
commercial use of a family of power system designs known as the Kalina cycle
technology. The company is controlled by Dr Alexander Kalina, a former
Russian scientist in the Soviet space programme who emigrated to the US in
1978.
Many such companies can retain their independence and still find the
resources to develop internationally.
Eventually, though, others form long-term agreements with larger suppliers,
which draw them partially into the web.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (10): Battle in the Vale of York
 -National Grid faces a baptism of fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S electricity industry is about to face one of its first public
challenges since its privatisation.
It will happen at a planning inquiry next Tuesday, into a proposal to build
90 kilometers of high voltage transmission lines to take power from the new
1,875 MegaWatt gas-fired power station at ICI's Wilton site, Teesside.
The power station, developed by a consortium led by the US Enron Corporation
and including a number of regional electricity companies, is the biggest
built in Britain for about 20 years. It is due to open in the autumn and be
fully operational next spring.
In order to distribute its power throughout the rest of the country, the NGC
plans the longest stretch of new 400 kilovolt 'super-grid' built in Britain
since the 1970s.
However, it has aroused protests from no fewer than 8,500 objectors,
including the North Yorkshire County Council and six other local
authorities, the Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Country
Landowners Association.
Most of the protesters are incensed at the suggestion that the new
super-grid line should pass through the Vale of York, at the foot of the
beautiful North Yorkshire Moors national park.
Although it will not prevent the power station from running, the hearing
will be something of a baptism of fire for the privatised electricity
industry as a whole and for the NGC in particular.
The NGC is responsible for developing and maintaining the transmission
system, a job previously carried out by the State-owned Central Electricity
Generating Board, which, unlike the NGC, was able to coordinate the planning
of transmission with that of new generating capacity.
The hearing will, therefore, also provide a forum for the widespread
complaints about Britain's lack of an integrated national energy policy.
Wilton power station is only the biggest of the new plants due to expand an
already bloated electricity generating industry. Several objectors therefore
query whether the Wilton power station should be built at all.
They point to the NGC's own comments last month when it published its third
annual seven-year projection of demand and supply in the electricity market.
It noted that some 28 new power stations have so far been committed to the
high voltage transmission system, and that the excess of generating plant
over demand would jump from 26.8 per cent in 1992/3 to 56.9 per cent in
1997/8, unless, as seemed likely, existing plant were decommissioned more
rapidly than would otherwise happen.
The statement reported a continuing imbalance whereby the south of England
contained 55 per cent of electricity demand but only 40 per cent of
generation. While not criticising any particular station, it added that the
further developments in the North would probably involve heavy additional
investment in transmission.
Many of the objections to the grid line and the power station are of the
'not in my backyard' variety. Some protesters argue that if more power is
needed it should be produced in the main centres of population where it is
needed and not be transported over long distances from other parts of the
country.
The electricity industry argues that the Wilton plant, fuelled by North Sea
gas, will improve the environment because it replaces 'dirty' coal-fired
electricity. It also claims that it will produce cheaper power and will
therefore be in the public interest.
The Inspector will probably regard this debate as outside his remit and
simply report it to the government. But the objectors have already
anticipated this by accusing the government of approving the power station
without the correct procedures.
The Council for the Protection for Rural England complained to Mr Carlo Ripa
de Meana, the EC commissioner for the environment, a year ago, saying that
Mr John Wakeham, the Energy Secretary, had breached EC rules by failing to
make the transmission lines and the new gas pipeline the subject of separate
assessments of the Wilton station's indirect environmental impact.
If Mr de Meana agreed, that could spark another clash between Brussels and
Britain on environmental issues like that over the controversial roadworks
at Twyford Down near Winchester.
In consultations over the super-grid extension, the NGC has tried to allay
local concerns by offering a choice of final routes for the cables. It has
tabled three alternatives for the sensitive 50km section from Picton to
Shipton and another two for the 27km immediately south of Teesside.
But that has not satisfied some objectors who say that the power should not
come south but should be routed over the Pennines to North West England. The
NGC says this is technically and financially difficult.
There have also been suggestions to make the cables invisible by burying
them. But this, too, has been rejected. Although there would be no overhead
lines, passers-by would still be able to see the series of pumping
installations needed to control the pressure of the insulation oil in which
underground cables are immersed.
All of which could leave the objectors with only the shape of the new grid
line's pylons as a subject for discussion. Here, too, the NGC is trying hard
to offer an unprecedented choice to the public.
The current standard shape of electricity pylons still roughly resembles the
Meccano-type structures designed for the industry by Sir Reginald Blomfield,
a member of the Royal Academy, back in the 1930s.
NGC engineers have now drafted a series of new styles, of which the least
traditional is a folded plate tower similar to motorway lamp standards. More
than 1.5 metres wide at its base, it requires deep concrete foundations.
To build them in the countryside could cause inconvenience to farmers, and,
unlike the slender feet of the existing towers, take up useful grazing land.
In addition to the folded plate tower, NGC engineers have also devised a
variants of the present latticed tower. Known as the L12, it is known among
NCG engineers as 'Eifellated' because of its vague resemblance to the
France's most famous landmark.
It has upward-swept arms compared with the drooping arms of most British
pylons. It is also lower and lighter than the biggest towers, the 50 meter
high structures, which were were the mainstay of the last significant phase
of grid construction in the 1960s and 1970s.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (12): North Sea bubble - Doubts
on the UK dash for gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Roosecote power station opened in Barrow-in-Furness last October, it
was hailed as the first in a new generation of gas-fired power plant that
would provide new competition for the privatised UK electricity industry.
Referring to the 20 'significant' private power projects that are in the
pipeline, Mr John Wakeham, the then energy secretary, said: 'I am convinced
that independent projects are poised to play an increasingly important role
in the future of the electricity generating market.'
But the proliferation of these projects has not been welcomed by all of Mr
Wakeham's fellow politicians. The House of Commons select committee on
energy has issued repeated warnings that the construction of many new
gas-fired stations could be a case of 'competition for its own sake'.
National Grid, the company which owns and operates the electricity
transmission system, cautioned last month that if all of the current power
projects came on stream, they would contribute to 60 per cent over-capacity
in the market by 1997.
The company said it had 28 applications from new independent projects to
join the national grid, amounting to 22,370 MegaWatts of new capacity by
1997.
This implies that around 10 older, coal-fired stations would have to close
in order to achieve a more reasonable margin of 30 per cent excess capacity.
It highlights a fear in the industry that the days are numbered for many
efficient coal-fired plants.
In addition, the economic case for many of the new gas stations has not been
proven. Critics argue that, for many of the projects, high gas prices will
lead to an electricity price higher than that of the coal-fired plant.
Since many of the regional electricity companies are partners in a number of
the gas-fired generation projects, the critics claim that higher electricity
prices will be passed on to the captive domestic consumer.
Gas-fired power stations are undoubtedly cleaner than coal stations and many
advocates of the new wave of generating plant point to their environmental
benefits. But British Coal has estimated that, if coal plant is fitted with
scrubbers which reduce emissions, the price of the electricity produced
would still be slightly lower than the cost of power from a gas-fired plant.
Mr David Porter, chief executive of the Association of Independent
Electricity Producers, justifies the dash for gas: 'Britain should enjoy the
benefits of diversity in power generation and that includes a role for coal,
but the electricity industry cannot sustain itself by pricing its product on
the output of fully depreciated coal-fired power stations.'
The great wave of interest in new generating plant came with the blessing of
the government when the electricity industry was privatised just over two
years ago. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary (the position has now been
axed), was keen to see the development of competitors to National Power and
PowerGen, the privatised generators of England and Wales carved from the old
Central Electricity Generating Board.
Overseas energy companies rushed to link up with regional electricity
suppliers in a bid to build new plant. Simultaneously, the two generators
themselves announced plans for an ambitious construction programme of
gas-fired power stations.
At the time, gas prices were reasonable and supplies were plentiful. But as
British Gas became inundated with a flow of enquiries for gas contracts, it
realised it would not have enough gas supply to fill them all.
By March last year, the company moved to push up gas prices and cut off
demand, in the process rendering many of the proposed power projects
uneconomic. British Gas was eventually forced by its regulator to reduce its
price increase although it has limited the availability of gas. Since the
new price under the so-called LTI3 schedule is still higher than the
pre-increase price, many of the projects teeter on the brink of viability.
So far, nine projects have signed contracts for gas supply with British Gas,
several others are pursuing deals with other producers and four additional
projects are confident of securing supply. In addition, 10 projects have
received planning permission.
As well as the cost of gas supply, the location of the project and the
efficiency of the plant will also influence its economics.
But it is probably true to assume that not all of the 28 projects which have
applied to the National Grid for a connection to the transmission system,
will eventually be built. Consultants and industry observers estimate that
between 14 and 20 projects are viable.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (11): House calls may end -
Meter men become an endangered species
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC meters combined with modern communications technology could
transform the relationship between electricity suppliers and their
customers.
Two-way communications enable the supplier to read the meter remotely
whenever it wants, without needing to visit the premises. And more
significantly, they enable the consumer automatically to buy electricity
from competing suppliers at the most advantageous price.
The UK electricity industry and meter manufacturers have been experimenting
with remote meter reading on a relatively small scale for more than 10
years.
But there was no impetus to introduce the technology nationwide - until last
January when Offer, the Office of Electricity Regulation, published a
consultation paper on electronic metering. It says the industry should have
'a framework of modern metering and communications' in place by 1998, the
date by which the UK's 22m households will be free to choose between
alternative suppliers.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, has
become an enthusiastic advocate of modern metering, in the face of
widespread doubt and scepticism inside the industry.
The electricity companies are frightened by the cost of giving every home an
electronic meter and communications links, estimated at well over Pounds
1bn. They doubt whether many domestic consumers actually want such
sophisticated service. And they fear confusion if incompatible systems are
set up, using different methods of communication.
However the companies know that in the face of the regulator's enthusiasm,
they have to respond positively to the Offer paper. The Electricity
Association is expected to submit a response on behalf of the industry next
month.
Three alternative ways of communicating between electronic meter and
electricity supplier have been developed:
Radio signalling is already used on a large scale in the UK as a one-way
communication system to households on the Economy 7 tariff. The electricity
companies send coded messages via BBC long-wave broadcasts to small
receivers fitted beside the meters. The signals (which are inaudible on an
ordinary radio set) activate switches to alter the tariff on a multi-rate
meter or turn selected appliances such as electric heaters on and off. This
system cannot be used for remote meter reading or two-way communications.
However mobile radio systems have been developed in the US to read meters:
vans equipped with short-range transmitters and receivers tour the streets,
sending signals to nearby houses; the signals activate a transmitter in the
meter, which sends its reading in code back to the van.
Telephone is the simplest technology for communicating between consumer and
supplier. Equipment is available to connect an electronic meter to the
household phone line. The electricity supplier can then interrogate the
meter automatically to receive a reading or change the tariff. But
disagreements between telephone companies and the electricity utilities over
pricing and technical arrangements have delayed the introduction of
telephone-based meter communications in the US and UK.
Mains-borne signalling sends messages down the electricity mains themselves.
Its supreme advantage from the industry's point of view is that it uses its
own infrastructure and does not depend on telephone companies or
broadcasters. The problem is that the flow of electricity creates such a lot
of interference, particularly at peak periods, that the signals may fail to
get through. However Thorn EMI in the UK and General Electric in the US have
committed considerable technical resources to make mains-borne signalling
more reliable.
As the Offer paper on metering points out, 'it is unlikely to be economic
for one customer to choose a mains-borne signalling system and a
neighbouring customer a radio teleswitch system'. In practice, the regional
electricity companies will have to choose the technology for each area.
But that does not mean the whole country need choose the same system, Offer
says. 'One system may be more suited to more or less densely populated areas
and in the longer term some comparison between systems will be helpful.'

CEGB's mighty offspring - Juliet Sychrava looks at UK privatisation two
years later

ELECTRICITY privatisation, the pundits agree, has been a curate's egg. Bits
of it - like trimming the fat from the Central Electricity Generating Board
(CEGB) - have been good. And bits of it - like failing to give the industry
any incentive to conserve energy - have been bad.
But the very worst bit of the egg, everyone from accountants to politicians
agrees, was the decision to create only two large privatised generators,
National Power and PowerGen, out of the CEGB's generation business.
Offer, the electricity watchdog, summarised the market's worries about the
'duopoly' position of the two generators in its December report on the
operation of the 'pool' or wholesale market in electricity.
Although some competition had emerged, Offer said, 'emerging experience in
the Pool suggests that the dominant market position of the two major
generators gives them the ability to influence and control Pool Prices. This
is not likely to inspire confidence in the Pool, nor be conducive to further
new entry.'
Offer did not, it said, rule out referring the two large generators to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
Offer's fears were echoed by the Commons Energy Select Committee, in its
February report on electricity privatisation. Offer, it said, 'should take
steps as soon as possible to reduce the dominance of the two generators,'
and by not later than 1995 it should decide if they should be referred to
the MMC. But neither the Commons committee nor Offer suggested a
satisfactory solution to creating more competition to challenge National
Power and PowerGen.
So far, the following strategies have been suggested:
Break up the generators:
The most extreme solution, and one often suggested by large electricity
consumers, and British Coal.
'It is physically and operationally feasible,' says an accountant closely
involved in the privatisation. But although the recent sale of Northern
Ireland Electricity's power stations showed there would be no shortage of
buyers for individual stations or groups of stations, it would be difficult.
A break-up would mean a loss of value for existing shareholders, who could
take legal action and call for compensation.
It would also be disruptive, in an electricity market that has scarcely
found its feet.
Swap the government's 40 per cent stake in the generators for assets, then
sell the assets to industry buyers:
It has been rumoured that the government might cancel its 40 per cent
shareholding in the generators, take over power stations of that value
instead, and then sell them to other generating companies. This would create
more competition and put pressure on the generators to keep their prices
down.
The idea has been discredited by the generators, who point out that this
would be against the interests of the other 60 per cent of shareholders,
because it would make the generators less competitive. It would also be hard
to find assets which equal the Pounds 2bn market value of the government's
stake without seriously damaging the generators' business, they argue.
Force the generators to sell off stations which they intend to close or
mothball:
This would stop them from manipulating supply and demand in the market by
opening and closing stations, and would give other generators a chance to
win more market share.
But, the generators have pointed out, if they cannot run plant, no smaller
generator will be able to do so. And if they can, they will keep it open.
Regulate the generators' costs/profits:
This would ensure that the generators do not overcharge the regional
companies and large customers who buy from them on contracts. Some large
customers have suggested the generators are already keeping too big a margin
over costs, while the generators insist they could not make money if they
sold contracts more cheaply.
But regulating costs or profits would be time-consuming - the regulator
would have to examine the power station business in detail. It would also go
against the principle of the new market, which was that the generators would
operate like private sector companies, and competition would keep their
costs down.
Change the rules in the pool and the contract market:
There are a number of proposals for modifying the pool, and the method
whereby contracts to buy and sell power are agreed outside the pool - most
power is still traded in contracts.
These include making contract negotiations more transparent, so that
customers have a sense of the market price.
Changing the way Nuclear Electric, the third generator with substantial
market share, sells power under contracts has also been suggested. At the
moment, the company invites tenders for the contracts and then sets a price
that customers argue may bear no relation to underlying costs. Making the
price for Nuclear Electric's contracts more transparent and cost-reflective
is important because National Power and PowerGen have used it as a benchmark
for their own deals with customers.
It might also help to have a more active market in contracts. There is
already an embryo market, set up by Gerrard and National, but so far trading
has been moderate. A liquid market in contracts would help promote
transparency and give the generators' consumers more information about the
market.
Encourage competition to enter the market by making sure the pool gives
clear supply and demand signals:
An important criticism of the pool is that it is not a good mechanism for
giving generators signals about whether to build new stations or not. The
way the price of electricity in the pool is set means that at times of peak
demand or short supply, a 'capacity' premium is triggered, pushing the price
up.
This is an erratic message, which makes it hard for companies to plan
investment in new power stations by assessing the demand for more power. It
thus inhibits competition to the two big generators.
Also, because withdrawing plant from the pool will push up the 'capacity'
element of the pool price the generators have an incentive to manipulate
supply and demand by closing plant. The Commons select committee suggested
that this system for rewarding generators for building capacity should be
changed, but had no exact plans for how this would be done.
Wait and see:
The government's answer to the problem so far has been to wait for the
market to mature, and for competing generators to emerge, and challenge the
big two.
But the Commons energy select committee has argued that that is not
happening. Although privatisation brought a rash of new independent
generators who announced they were building gas-fired power stations, many
of their projects have foundered because of a shortage of gas at the right
price.
More worryingly, it now looks as if many of the new stations that are built
will fail to provide the competition the government expected.
That is because the stations have secured long-term contracts to sell their
power to regional electricity supply companies, who then sell it on to
captive domestic consumers. Because these consumers buy power regardless of
the market price, the stations will not have to compete in the market.
Worse, they may capture demand that existing coal stations could have
supplied more cheaply. This, the select committee argues, must be urgently
investigated by Offer.
Even if Offer scrutinises every independent power project, the question of
whether it will produce power at a market price in 15 years time is highly
speculative. At best, Offer could assess how competitive the project's gas
price, site, and technology were relative to other projects.
So far, the independent power stations due later this decade show every sign
of using modern technology and bargaining hard for competitive gas and the
best financing package possible.
It is true that they rely on long-term contracts rather than the pool price
 -but most power is still sold in the contract market, if on shorter
contracts. There is even a chance that the pool itself will become marginal
to the electricity market.

ELECTRICITY prices in Britain will come down as a result of privatisation.
That is what Mr John Wakeham, former energy secretary, has said and what
industry leaders such as Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power,
believe.
The message to consumers is - wait and see. Give the new electricity market
a chance to work, and prices will begin to fall.
Not everyone is so sanguine. 'The competitive market which was promised has
not yet materialised,' was the damning verdict delivered by the Commons
energy select committee in February.
Offer, the electricity industry watchdog - itself the focus of much
criticism from large consumers who say it is not tough enough - echoed this
in its annual report. 'The lack of effective choice in the market this year
is a most unsatisfactory feature of the present situation,' it said.
These two reports came two years after Mr Wakeham launched the privatisation
of electricity with the words: 'From now on, there will be unprecedented
levels of competition in electricity supply. The price of electricity will
begin to be driven by market forces.'
He added: 'I believe that electricity privatisation is going to be good news
for all the industry's customers, and good news for its employees.'
Employees, especially those who have bought shares, may well agree.
Customers are a different matter. Over the last few months the complaints of
large electricity consumers about how privatisation has pushed up their
electricity bills have filled the press.
'Angry and frustrated electricity users' assembled on April 7 to complain
against 'unacceptable and unreasonable price increases,' said the Major
Energy Users Council (MEUC). New contracts had been forced on users faced
with little evidence of the promised 'competition' or opportunities to shop
around, it added.
The MEUC has long argued that its larger members - steel, paper and chemical
companies - face increases in the basic cost of their electricity of up to
30 per cent this year. Privatisation, it says, has failed large electricity
users, and made them uncompetitive in Europe.
Mr Neil Tribick, vice chairman of the electricity group of the MEUC and
group energy buyer for Rank Hovis MacDougall, says the company will have to
pay around Pounds 18m more for its electricity this year.
The National Health service, with 130 sites around the country, is expected
to face increases of between 14 and 28 per cent, according to the MEUC. One
paper company has written to Mr Wakeham saying it faces increases of 20-25
per cent.
But the government and generators argue that these companies are not
typical. Very large electricity users face especially high increases,
because they formerly received government subsidies removed at
privatisation.
Moreover, the government adds, the place for large consumers to complain
about their bills is Brussels. Prices are lower in Europe because
governments subsidise their electricity bills by charging domestic consumers
more, while the UK government has ruled out cross subsidies of this kind.
But what electricity costs the average industrial consumer is hard to
measure. Mr John Topliss, chairman of the MEUC electricity group, says most
companies are paying around 10 per cent more than before privatisation,
while National Power says they are paying just marginally more.
Surveys from consumer groups such as the MEUC and the Energy Intensive Users
Association suggest that prices to average industrial users fell by between
10 and 20 per cent after privatisation - in the year from April 1990.
They then rose by 5 to 6 per cent in the year from April 1991. This year
(from April 1992) increases are expected of 10 to 20 per cent.
The Department of Energy's publication Energy Trends shows large electricity
consumers paying 3.55p per unit at the end of 1991, compared with 3.51p at
the end of 1989.
But although some customers are paying more than before privatisation, some
are clearly paying around the same, or even less.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, says customers must just
be patient, because prices are starting to fall and will fall further.
'There are prospects for real long-term reductions, partly from the working
through of lower fuel prices - provided our plans for cheaper fuel aren't
frustrated - and partly from the impact of competitive pressures on our
costs.'
'Before privatisation it was said the old area boards used to treat large
customers like chattels. If they do that now, the customers can walk
elsewhere.'
So far, the generators' profits do not suggest they are overcharging. It is
equally hard to counter their argument that last year's lower prices were an
unsustainable phenomenon due to lower oil prices, high coal stocks and
post-flotation jostling for market share.
Domestic consumers, meanwhile, are not doing so badly. Their bills will go
up by around 2.5 per cent this April, compared with increases of an average
11.3 per cent last April, and around 4.6 per cent in April 1990.
But Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, argues that this year's
modest increase is no proof of privatisation's virtue. 'In the run up to
privatisation, prices were artificially high, as part of the fattening up
process.' Domestic prices, he calculates, have increased by around 40 per
cent since 1986, the year privatisation was announced.
There has, however, been other good news for all consumers. Not only have
the regional electricity companies improved their service, but the
government no longer subsidises heavy industry at the expense of
householders.
Consumers also know far more about the costs of nuclear power, previously
hidden in the CEGB. And investment in new environmentally-friendly
technologies has moved ahead.

Clive Cookson reviews progress towards the ideal power source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
OF ALL technologies currently under development for generating electricity,
nuclear fusion offers mankind the best prospect of clean and limitless
energy in the 21st century.
Or so supporters of fusion research say. Critics point out that the
commercial reality of nuclear fusion power always seems to lie about 40
years in the future.
In the 1950s when the Soviet, US and UK governments set up laboratories to
develop peaceful uses of fusion - the process that fires the sun and the
hydrogen bomb - many physicists believed that fusion power stations would be
delivering cheap electricity in the 1990s.
As it turned out, scientists achieved controlled fusion for the first time
last November, in a doughnut-shaped experimental reactor, the Joint European
Torus (JET) at Culham near Oxford. The ring of superheated gas reached a
temperature of 200m deg C - 10 times higher than the middle of the sun - and
generated almost 2MW of power in a two second pulse.
The JET experiment produced triumphant newspaper headlines, along the lines
of 'Science Tames the Power of the Sun'. And it was indeed a technical
triumph. But the output was only 10 per cent of the power put into the
reaction.
Several more decades of development, costing tens of billions of dollars,
will be required truly to replicate the power of the sun and make fusion
into a reliable energy source.
Even enthusiasts do not envisage a full-scale demonstration fusion plant
operating before 2030, with widespread commercial application in the 2040s.
The scientific case for fusion power seems irresistible. The process forces
together the nuclei of light atoms - in practice two isotopes of hydrogen:
deuterium and tritium. This releases energy in the form of radiation and
heat that could be used to raise steam and run a turbine-generator, as in a
conventional power station.
Fusion is the opposite of fission, the basis of nuclear power today, which
releases energy by splitting heavy nium. The theoretical advantages of
fusion are that it uses virtually inexhaustible raw materials (deuterium
extracted from sea-water and tritium made inside the fusion reactor from the
light metal lithium), it produces far less radioactive waste than fission
and it is inherently safe because the reaction stops as soon as anything
goes wrong.
The nuclear energy locked inside just 10 grams of deuterium and 15 grams of
tritium would be enough to generate a lifetime's electricity for the average
inhabitant of an industrialised country today. But formidable technical
obstacles must be overcome before that energy can be extracted under
controlled conditions.
The reaction cannot start until the deuterium-tritium fuel is heated to
become an electrically charged gas, known as a plasma. The reaction stops as
soon as the plasma touches the sides of the reactor because it then becomes
too cool to sustain fusion. JET and similar research reactors in the US,
Russia and Japan aim to confine the plasma inside a 'magnetic bottle'.
Powerful electromagnets loop around the torus, keeping the plasma away from
the walls for as long as possible.
Other approaches have been tried on a smaller scale, for example focusing
laser beams on to the fuel, but most fusion scientists believe in the torus
reactor - invented in the Soviet Union about 50 years ago.
(The highly publicised 'cold fusion' technique, announced in 1989 by
Professors Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, allegedly offered the
benefits of controlled fusion on a test-tube scale at a tiny fraction of the
cost of hot fusion. The Fleischmann-Pons work has been largely but not
entirely discredited. Experiments with cold fusion are still going on in
several laboratories, and EPRI, the collaborative research arm of the US
electric utilities, continues to support some research on it.)
Fusion research is one of the most expensive forms of 'big science'. JET has
cost 14 European countries about Pounds 1bn to build and run over the last
decade. And the next stage of development will cost much more than that. So
the four 'fusion powers' - Europe, US, Japan and Russia - are beginning to
design it jointly as a global project: the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor.
Planning ITER will take at least five years and cost an estimated Dollars
1bn. There will be three design centres (San Diego, US; Garching, Germany;
and Naka, Japan). Then, if the participants can agree on the design and a
site for ITER and find Dollars 5bn to build the reactor, construction could
start in 1997-98.
On present plans, JET is due to have a final series of experiments in 1996,
which should generate about 10MW of power. That will leave a gap of at least
eight years for European fusion research until ITER starts to operate - in
2004 at the earliest. However Japan and the US are planning to build interim
reactors to gain more information about plasma physics in the meantime.
Even if the world's fusion scientists manage to build ITER on schedule and
operate it successfully, at least one more stage - a demonstration power
plant - will be needed before utilities can contemplate constructing fusion
reactors.
By then more than Dollars 100bn will have been spent developing fusion
energy over 80 years. Compared with the Dollars 1,000bn a year which the
world spends on energy today, that is a modest investment in our long term
future.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (7): Electrification is the top
priority - China and India put coal first
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING rapid electrification of the Indian and Chinese economies will
keep power demand growing at 8-10 per cent annually during the 1990s,
resulting in a doubling in electricity demand and power station coal burn by
2000.
Growth could be higher, but the world's two most populous countries seem
destined to see demand capped by their limited ability to bring on new
generating sets. A blinkered emphasis on bringing capacity on stream quickly
pays scant regard for the environment.
The two countries' problems stem from the fact that they have much ground to
catch up. Both have a very low level of electrification. Some 400m people -
a quarter of their combined populations - still lack access to electricity.
Average power consumption per head is a fifth of that in Thailand
An extension of electrification into the more remote rural regins will boost
demand, but not as much as building new stations and improving the
lamentable performance of the existing stations.
China has for more than a decade acknowledged that her factories have
suffered regular and prolonged power cuts due to capacity shortages. It is
estimated that power cuts force industry to stand idle for a third of the
time.
In India, the situation is less desperate, although persistent shortages
have occurred in some areas, while all areas have been plagued by temporary
cuts because of fuel shortages or urgent repairs to power stations. Plant
availability, the proportion of time which generators can be on full power,
has been low in both countries: well under 75 per cent for most years.
While aid agencies, led by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, have
been keen to boost the performance of existing stations, most of the
emphasis has been put on building new plant. Both countries are planning for
coal fired capacity to be more than doubled by 2000.
Financing this build-up is a challenge for the state-owned utilities. India,
and to a lesser extent, China, has sought to involve private and foreign
investors in power generation. China took the initial lead in the mid 1980s,
with its Shajiao B (700MW) coal station built by Hong Kong's Hopewell
Holdings and operated under a build-own-operate deal.
However, it is India which is setting the pace now, having at the end of
1991 passed legislation, paving the way for private investment in power
stations.
More recently, in an effort to underscore the commitment to private power,
the government has said that private power station backers can also invest
in captive mines to feed the stations.
In this rush to build plant the environmental concerns, as the OECD sees
them, have been largely ignored. An analyst close to the World Bank says
mention of the environment in India or China brings the response of 'oh, the
problem with dams'. Acid gas and carbon dioxide emissions are nowhere near
the top of the agenda.
While Mrs Maneka Gandhi raised the exposure of India's environmental
department, the energy ministry have made few concessions in the direction
of cleaner power generation, save that of landscaping new power plants. Flue
gas de-sulphurisation, by which stack gases are scrubbed of sulphur dioxide,
is considered an excessively expensive option especially given that Indian
coal has a comparatively low sulphur content.
The Chinese environmental movement barely keeps its head above water. The
comment in Beijing about FGD is: 'very nice, but who's going to pay for it?'
Increasing the efficiency of generation provides some scope to limit the
damage from the planned increase in coal generation. Larger unit sizes with
higher operating pressures and temperatures, greater emphasis on
preventative maintenance, better system integration could boost efficiencies
from the current levels of around 30 per cent to near 35. This could save up
to 120m tonnes of coal in 2000.
Even so, China and India are set to see a big increase in power station coal
burn over the decade. By 2000, some 800m tonnes will be burned, virtually
all of it in plant without control on sulphur dioxide or nitrous oxide
emissions.
Telling these giants to clean up their act will be futile, especially when
these countries are still trying to raise per capital electricity
consumption to third the level of the OECD in the 1950s.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (5): Heavyweight champion of the
world - Electricite de France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL BOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S state-owned electricity company, Electricite de France, which
produced a fifth of Europe's electricity in 1991, is France's 17th largest
exporter and claims to be the world's biggest power utility.
It is also a nuclear power in its own right, with 55 operational nuclear
plants which supply 72 per cent of its total output.
Its growing capacity surplus has been used by the French government to
entice foreign business to invest in France and to sell EdF power abroad at
rates foreign companies cannot match.
In 1991, EdF exported approximately 14 per cent of all the power it
produced, bringing export sales to a historic high of Ffr12.1bn (Pounds
1.2bn), 22.6 per cent more than the previous year.
The leading purchaser was Britain, followed by Switzerland, Germany, Benelux
and Spain. At the same time, EdF cut power imports by almost 30 per cent.
Britain will not long remain the largest foreign customer, however. The
cross-Channel contract between EdF and the National Grid is up for renewal
on April 1, 1993. But it could fall victim to Britain's fast-growing
overcapacity of generating plant.
Most EdF export contracts are long-term, often for 10 years or more. On the
basis of such contracts, Delaporte has projected that its export balance
will continue to expand until 1997, after which it is likely to stabilise at
around 70TWh/year for five years.
However, if cross-border transmission capacities are increased, exports
could reach 80TWh by the year 2000, and would then represent about 15 per
cent of total EdF production, and an estimated Ffr17bn (Pounds 1.725bn) or
more in sales.
But there are clouds on the horizon. The company's usually robust nuclear
performance has started to falter, (down from a projected 78-80 per cent of
total production in 1990 to only 72 per cent in 1991, due to ageing in both
the 900MW and 1300MW plants). Hydroelectricity has also been cut by four
years of drought.
The two problems have led to a sharp rise in EdF coal purchases, cutting
potential profitability.
A more insistent problem is that of nuclear waste: despite improved
salvaging of spent fuel, France is accumulating over 5,000 cubic meters of
very long-term highly radioactive wastes, and attempts to find a deep burial
site have raised hackles throughout the country.
On the EC level, Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and his staff
have issued a series of Directives aimed at breaking up utility monopolies
like EdF and its twin, Gaz de France.
By decreeing that other independent utilities may transport and distribute
electricity over EdF networks, Brussels is threatening the highly profitable
captive domestic market on which EdF's transfrontier aspirations are built.
On the other hand, the EC's anti-monopoly Directives also allow EdF to sell
its power more easily to individual foreign companies.
Even if it were to increase foreign sales up to the level envisioned by
Delaporte, EdF will be hampered by the technical maximum of 300-400
kilometers over which power can be transmitted. Thus Britain, Benelux,
southern Germany, the Po Valley, Switzerland, and northern Spain remain the
company's physical transmission limits. However, Delaporte says EdF has 'no
intention of becoming the powerhouse of Europe'.
French public opinion, which tolerates nuclear production, was unlikely to
tolerate sales of French nuclear power to other nations reluctant to produce
it themselves. The alternative was to increase income by direct investment
in foreign facilities and markets.
The most enticing market remains Eastern Europe, formerly serviced largely
by the Ukraine, which with its network of Chernobyl-style nuclear plants
produced almost as much power as France. Although Eastern Europe lies beyond
EdF's 400-km transmission range, it can be reached by relay sales, whereby,
for instance, EdF would sell to Switzerland which would then transfer some
capacity eastward.
Before such east-west interchanges can take place, however, the
transmission/distribution networks of Eastern Europe must be upgraded to
western standards and voltages.
One means of doing so would be to transform alternating into direct current
(at a cost of Pounds 100m for 1,000 megawatts - the output of a standard
nuclear reactor). Another would be to upgrade the electrical facilities of
Eastern European countries.
In concert with the German utilities Bayernwerk and PreussenElektra, EdF is
moving aggressively into Poland,where the three are in early stages of
modernising the Dolna Odra power plant so that it can ship power west to
Berlin.
They are also active in Hungary, and are overseeing the construction of the
Mochovce nuclear plant in Slovakia. With another partner, the Belgian
Tractabel, EdF is planning another Polish power plant in lower Silesia.
EdF is also involved in upgrading nuclear plants, such as Bulgaria's
Kozloduy and Czechoslovakia's Bohunice and Dukovany.
With perhaps the world's most advanced distribution and tariff systems, EdF
has also been selling its know-how to cities such as Warsaw, Krakow, Lodz,
and Moscow.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (4): Single market stalemate -
Europe's monopolies defend their territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's plan for electricity represents one of the most
ambitious aspects of the single market - and also one of its most
controversial.
From the moment Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, put
forward his proposals in January, he has been subjected to a barrage of
complaint and criticism from much of the EC's electricity industry. So
heated have the exchanges been on occasions that an official from one large
member state described them as 'a dialogue of the deaf'.
Does this mean that Mr Cardoso's plan is ill-conceived, or that he has
successfully targeted deeply entrenched interests? Part of Mr Cardoso's
difficulty lies in the diversity of the EC's power industry, which ranges
from huge state monopolies such as Electricite de France to small
privately-owned local generators. In some countries, the industry is
monolithic, in others it is split between generators and distributors.
Mr Cardoso's original plan aimed to break up the monopolies using the EC's
special powers. But that was plainly an unrealistic goal, and Mr Cardoso
backed off. Instead, his proposal seeks to attack the monopolies through a
different route: by introducing more competition, and making it harder for
large companies to use their complex structures to disguise their true
costs.
The plan has two main parts. One will give power producers the right to sell
electricity to customers in another member state by guaranteeing them access
to the local power grid. This is known as third party access (TPA).
Initially, TPA will apply only to users of more than 100GW hours of
electricity a year, which would limit it to the 400-500 largest power
consumers in the EC. But after three years, it would be extended to smaller
customers, effectively opening up the entire EC market to cross-border
competition.
The second part will oblige integrated companies to unbundle their accounts
so that the various segments (generation, distribution, contracting etc.)
operate more autonomously. This should make it easier for outsiders to gauge
the market and compete.
Mr Cardoso's vision is of a market that will eventually be so fluid that
consumers will be able to buy their power from any generator in the EC, no
matter how distant. Power companies will also be able to locate plant in
other states and become, in effect, multinationals.
Mr Cardoso wants his plan to start next January, but an early timetable
seems unlikely, given the high level of opposition. At a ministerial meeting
in Portugal early last month, a majority of energy ministers agreed to end
monopolies on electricity production and construction of energy networks.
But they baulked at the TPA proposals.
Broadly, the EC has divided between the Continental countries, with their
well-ordered and (often) state-owned power monopolies which have objections
to the plan, and the UK with its newly privatised system which supports it.
In between are Mr Cardoso's Portugal, where the industry is partially
privatised and is looking for new opportunities, and smaller countries such
as Denmark which have given qualified support.
The objections of the Continental power lobby were summed up by Mr
Alessandro Ortis, vice president of Italy's Ente Nazionale per l'Energia
Elettrica, and president of Euroelectric, the Brussels-based trade group. He
told a recent meeting at the European Parliament that he favoured free
transit and price transparency. But he believed that the TPA proposals would
be damaging.
In Frankfurt, Mr Wolf Heinemann, the deputy director of VDEW, the German
electricity trade group, said his members also rejected the proposals. 'We
are not against competition as such,' he stressed. 'But we do not believe
the plan will lead to higher efficiency.'
He warned that it could even drive up prices for small consumers as power
generators tried to recoup the margins they lost in competing for the
large-customer business.
Mr Heinemann also said the highly integrated German power industry was not
susceptible to the same kind of unbundling as the UK industry. If German
consumers paid higher prices for their power than others in the EC, this was
not due to inefficiency so much as to special local conditions, such as
charges mandated to preserve the German coal industry, and tough
environmental regulations.
In France, Mr Claude Destival, the director of economics and strategy at
EdF, had similar reservations about the practicability of third party
access. But he also said that the introduction of unbridled competition
would prevent EC member states from having a national energy policy. 'Energy
policy is too important to be left to market forces,' he said.
By contrast, the UK industry is strongly enthusiastic about the plan - which
accords with the spirit of the post-privatisation market - though cynics
might argue that UK power companies are protected from external competition,
having only a single cable connection with the Continental grid.
But UK companies are less interested in exporting power than in establishing
themselves in foreign markets. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen,
the smaller of the two main UK generators, says his company doubts that it
can compete in France and Germany. But it plans to invest in projects for
gas and coal-fired power in Portugal, and in a gas plant in Greece.
Mr Cardoso faces a long uphill battle to win acceptance for his plan, which
will come up before its first ministerial council in late May. One political
factor in his favour is that the UK assumes the EC presidency for the second
half of the year, and will doubtless be gunning for it, though even that may
not be enough to get it approved by Mr Cardoso's original January 1993
deadline.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (3): Wired for growth - Asia
switches on to private power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY

<TEXT>
THE private power sector is now playing an important role in electricity
generation in Asia's developing countries.
Relentless economic growth, and an even faster growth in electricity demand,
have opened this door to the private sector. The countries most affected are
Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.
One reason is the high cost of adding new, efficient capacity out of
national financial resources, and the perception that the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank are no longer bottomless wells of concessional aid
support, particularly given the demands on them from Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
The two Banks have made clear that developing Asia must do more on its own,
and they have pressed their borrowers to boost power utility efficiency and
revenues through higher electricity tariffs and reduced subsidies to
customers.
In Asia, their power sector lending accounts for about 20-25 per cent of all
aid, but their own resources are being stretched.
This was underlined recently by Mr William Thompson, ADB vice-president,
operations, who said that electricity demand in the 1990s would require the
addition of 300,000MW of capacity, more than double that now in place in the
region's two-dozen developing countries.
He noted that in spite of a 100 per cent increase in electricity use in the
1980s, Asia's per capita energy consumption was still low by global
standards, and would rise sharply. Asia, with 40 per cent of the world's
population, accounted for only 20 per cent of total energy use.
With GDP expected to grow annually by 5.5-6 per cent over the 1990s and
current account deficits worsening, increased reliance on the private sector
to raise finance was required. He stressed such schemes as build-own-operate
and build-operate-transfer (BOO and BOT respectively), in which the plant
supplier finances the scheme through the sale of power to the state utility,
essentially owning and operating the plant until all financing and profits
have been recovered.
The use by the World Bank of BOT in Pakistan to structure the Dollars l5bn
Hab River power project, a 4 x 323MW oil-fired power station 50 km west of
Karachi, is credited with convincing Islamabad to restructure its two
unwieldy utilities, the Water and Power Development Authority and the
Karachi Electricity Supply Company, whose total capacity is 8,000MW.
Work on Hab is expected to start this summer, under a consortium of US,
British, French, Italian, Saudi and Japanese companies, with delivery of the
first unit in three years. Electricity would be sold by HubCo, the managing
company, into the national grid. This would pay for the project costs and
generate profits over 23 years before the station is turned over to
Pakistani control.
Pakistan is encouraging more BOT schemes and plans to hive off some of
WAPDA's thermal power stations into similar BOT operations.
India last year introduced laws to broaden the private power base and, in
some cases, to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of power companies. At
65,000MW, just 5 per cent of India's power comes from four private sector
companies, led by the Tata Group. All of these are profitable compared with
the 18 state-sector utilities, most of which are in deficit.
The issue has proven so successful that the private sector now claims to be
capable of adding 24,000MW of new capacity to the grid by 2000 if its
proposals are approved. The I990-95 five-year plan called for 38,000MW of
new capacity, but this looks like falling about 35 per cent short under
state plans. If the private bids are approved, the gap between private and
state electricity generation will narrow sharply.
Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) is now seeing through the flotation
of 23 per cent of its shares, the largest such flotation of a
state-utility's shareholdings in Southeast Asia. At 5,000MW, TNB plans to
increase capacity to nearly 8,000MW by 1995, hence the need for private
capital.
By comparison, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is
taking a different approach. Its target is to boost capacity to 13,075MW by
1996 from 8,193MW last year. In February it amended the EGAT Act to allow
the creation of wholly-owned power generating subsidiaries, whose shares can
be sold.
Under this scheme, it has designated three projects for mini-privatisation:
the 4 x 300 MW Rayong combined-cycle power plant, the 600MW Khanom combined
cycle plant; and the recently-proposed 2 x 700MW Aoi Pai coal-fired power
station.
The government has also endorsed the purchase by EGAT and the Metropolitan
and Provincial electricity authorities (the two electricity distributors) of
up to 50MW of capacity from individual private power generators operating
combined-cycle plants.
Uncertainty surrounds the privatisation plans of Indonesia and the
Philippines. Indonesia is steering clear of BOT projects.
Current installed capacity of the PLN, the state utility, is 9,000MW, all of
it on Java. Indonesian energy officials say plans are to boost this to
20,000MW by 2000. Such an expansion will cost Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn.
Indonesia hopes to offset much of this cost by encouraging more 'captive'
power stations, those built to fuel company towns and self-contained
industrial complexes. Government officials say 40 per cent of the additional
11,000MW of planned capacity could be developed this way.
The Philippines recently refloated shares in the Manila Electric Company,
which had been sequestered following the corporate shakeup of para-state
companies following the fall of the Marcos regime in 1986. It has said it
plans to restructure and privatise the National Power Corporation, the main
utility, once the political dust has settled following this month's national
elections.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (2): World energy producers on
trial - David Lascelles previews next month's 'green' summit in Rio de
Janeiro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS summer's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro has important implications for
the electricity industry.
But although this portentously named event is less than a month away it is
far from clear what practical results it will have. The final preparatory
meetings have tended to widen rather than narrow differences between the
more than 160 countries who are planning to attend.
Mr Maurice Strong, the Canadian organiser of the UN-sponsored event,
originally hoped to secure approval for a global action programme not merely
to clean up the environment, but to stabilise it for the next century. He
may only achieve worthy statements of intent.
One reason for this unpromising outlook is that the Rio agenda ran
hopelessly out of control during the two-year preparations. All the
participants were encouraged to put forward their ideas, and did. The action
programme expanded to nearly 1,000 pages, leaving delegates drowning in
words and lacking a clear focus.
Another reason is that the participants quickly polarised into a clash
between the rich countries of the north and the poor of the south over who
was to blame for environmental degradation, and who should pay for it.
The UN organisers calculated that the South would need Dollars 70bn a year
from the North, in addition to existing aid, to overcome its environmental
problems. The North agreed that extra money would be needed, but to the tune
of only a tiny fraction of this sum.
A third reason is that the industrialised countries failed to agree, even
among themselves, on the seriousness of the threat to the environment, or on
the measures needed to deal with it. The reluctance of Mr George Bush, the
US president, to commit himself to attend the Rio meeting indicated doubts
about its value.
Whatever happens, though, energy will loom large during the 12-day event.
The threat posed to the planet by global warming and climate change has
occupied much time in the preparatory meetings, and many participants are
keen for action of some kind to curb harmful gaseous emissions from
vehicles, power stations and factories.
But the debate in the run-up to Rio has done little to crystallise a world
view on the dangers of global warming. Many people, including senior
government figures on both sides of the Atlantic, doubt that the threat is
as serious as some scientists are claiming, and this has weakened the
political will for early action.
The question is whether the Summit will try to set global deadlines for
curbing emissions of carbon dioxide, rather as the Montreal Protocol of 1987
did for the CFCs that are eating up the ozone layer. The EC countries, which
(with the exception of the UK) aim to bring CO2 emissions back down to 1990
levels by the year 2000, want a clear timetable.
But the US has rejected this approach, and this obvious split between the
countries emitting the greatest amounts of harmful gases has removed any
incentive for other countries to make any commitments of their own.
Another question is whether the Summit will advance the cause of a carbon
tax, which some countries are advocating as a means of curbing consumption
of oil, gas and coal. The chief crusader for this cause is Mr Carlo Ripa di
Meana, the EC environment commissioner, who has been trying to promote a tax
on energy and carbon within the Community.
EC ministers are due to meet on May 25, days before Rio begins, to decide
whether to back a tax.
If they do, Mr Ripa will go to Rio brandishing a proposal which he hopes
will set an example for other countries to follow. But there are deep doubts
among EC members about the wisdom of adopting a tax unless other countries
follow suit, and neither the US nor Japan intends to do so.
A third energy-related issue has to do with the spread of environmental
technology. The Summit was supposed to draw up plans to encourage the
transfer of technology from the advanced countries to the developing. The
fact that Third World power stations tend to use old and dirty equipment was
frequently cited in the discussions in support of the case for more aid.
Thus the chances of specific action being adopted at Rio to curb or control
energy use seem very remote. There is a conspicuous lack of consensus among
participants both as to the size of the threat to the environment and the
best means of dealing with it. At its worst, Rio could be a huge
anti-climax, and greatly weaken any chance of international co-ordination.
But if it succeeded, Rio could add to the overall political momentum
building up for action on the environment anyway. Even if the result is only
a generalised declaration of green aims, the fact that leaders from dozens
of states signed it would be a palpable achievement.
It would be a conspicuous political act, and could provide a basis for more
specific action later on. One aim of the conference will be to set up
machinery to keep up the pressure.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (1): From public to private -
Many countries are privatising or restructuring their electricity
industries. But none has yet rivalled the radical nature of the reforms in
Britain, and EC efforts to encourage more cross-frontier competition have so
far made little headway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY industries round the world are being restructured. But they are
not, contrary to the predictions of Mr John Wakeham, Britain's former energy
secretary, following the UK privatisation pattern. Nor is Europe moving
towards the kind of free electricity market set up in Britain.
UK privatisation itself has been a mixed success. Some analysts, such as Mr
Andrew Johns of National Utilities Services, (NUS) are enthusiastic.
'It has enabled consumers to negotiate individual deals,' he says. 'There is
no doubt that it has changed the face of electricity purchasing completely.'
Most observers agree that privatisation has made the electricity industry
leaner and meaner, and although it is too early to say whether it has
brought prices down, most consumers appear to be better off.
'It has removed forever the CEGB mentality where you had engineers running
the industry for engineers, and the government handing them a blank cheque,'
says a financial consultant to the industry.
'The consumer now has a certain transparency when the CEGB was one of the
most opaque organisations,' says Mr Gordon MacKerron of Sussex University's
Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU). 'They now have a clear idea what
nuclear costs, and have an incentive to develop new technologies such as
renewable energy, which has moved ahead fast. Cross subsidies are more
difficult - you can't have blatant political fixes for big consumers.
'It is also good to have gas-fired plant - although the craze for gas has
gone too far. The CEGB's strategic planning function was pretty Stalinist -
we would have just had more gigantic coal and nuclear plants.'
But the market has detractors - and not only the large customers who have
lost their government subsidies under the new regime. MPs on the Commons
energy committee, and the electricity industry watchdog, Offer, are both
concerned about whether enough competition is emerging in electricity
generation.
Meanwhile, other European countries are showing few signs of following
Britain down the privatisation road.
The EC itself has made efforts to introduce more competition, and to make
the basis of electricity pricing more open, or transparent.
But draft directives aimed at liberalising the electricity market have so
far made little progress. In particular, several European countries
including France and the Netherlands, are resisting efforts to introduce
'third party access' or TPA, which would open up national monopolies,
allowing European suppliers to supply European customers across borders.
This is mainly because of the many large public sector European utilities,
which resist any encroachment on their protected franchises.
There are also logistical problems with introducing cross border trading of
electricity, such as establishing who pays for capital investment in the
grid systems. If a German company's purchase of power from a UK generator
means lines need to be reinforced to carry the extra electricity - who pays
for the work?
There would also have to be some equivalent of the UK 'pool' which acts as a
central clearing and settlement agency for all deals. A Spanish supplier who
is paid on contract by an Italian purchaser but fails to generate needs to
settle up with the Italian national supplier who actually supplies.
The chances of European countries adopting the UK 'pool' or wholesale market
in electricity are small, most observers say, not least because the pool
itself seems increasingly peripheral (some say unnecessary) to the UK
market.
But they will probably begin to unbundle their accounts, splitting
generation from distribution and supply, to give more transparent pricing.
Even if TPA does not develop across borders for some time, there will be
more competition in supply within domestic markets.
There has also been more of a trend towards restructuring than to
privatisation.
One group of European countries is still resisting any real change. France,
Italy and Germany have not restructured their industries, and are broadly
opposed to EC attempts to open their electricity markets.
Belgium, which previously had three private companies, now has a private
monopoly, Electrabel, over which the state has more control. It too, is
opposed to radical market reform.
Spain is more ambivalent. The country's utilities have been restructured:
the biggest private electricity companies, Iberduero and Hidrol, merged to
form Iberdrola, while Endesa, the state-owned company, has taken over two
other utilities. Some shares have been issued in Endesa. However, Spain's
enthusiasm for privatisation or for TPA is muted.
Three countries making more significant moves towards a competitive market
in electricity are Norway, Sweden, and Portugal.
Portugal has invited private sector bids to build new power stations,
notably a new oil-fired station north of Lisbon. The UK's PowerGen and
National Power are among the international companies bidding for the
business. The Portuguese electricity utility, Electricidade de Portugal, is
also being restructured, and 'corporatised,' and will later be split into
six separate companies. Some private capital may be injected into these
companies later.
In Sweden, meanwhile, the government has committed itself to introducing a
free electricity market with full TPA by 1994. It has created a new Swedish
National Grid, which may be partly sold off, but there are no firm plans for
privatising Vattenfall, the dominant state-owned utility.
The Norwegian system is perhaps the closest to the UK market, although no
privatisation has taken place.
Early this year, Norway began a radical restructuring of the electricity
industry, which comprises the publicly-owned utility, Statkraft, as well as
a number of privately and publicly owned electricity companies. Companies
will be able to compete to supply customers, and will have open access to
the electricity grid.
Statkraft was recently split into two parts, a generating company, and a
grid management company, giving the generating side more commercial freedom.
Norway already has a spot market for surplus electricity, and it is thought
that electricity contracts may be traded in the near future.
Privatisation, for most European countries, is a political issue. If they
are against it, it is often because their large public utilities are part of
the framework of government. But in Asia, where electricity industries are
also being restructured, privatisation is primarily an economic issue.
In South East Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia plan to inject private
sector capital into their cash-starved utilities.
'In the developing countries, privatisation is viewed primarily as a
mechanism for raising funds,' says Mr Andrew Barnett, who heads Sussex
University's Developing Country Group. 'There is a massive requirement for
electricity, and a shortage of funding.' Some South East Asian countries, he
says, have even had to resort to export credit finance, which is unsuitable
for infrastructure projects.
Privatisation will not necessarily mean utilities become more efficient, Mr
Barnett says. 'Competition in generation is a good thing, but in developing
countries it can mean a huge proliferation of small scale diesel generators
which are efficient only in the narrowest sense.'
Developing countries, he says, may experience considerable conflict between
government policy on electricity, (for instance its fuel policy), the
utility's plans, and the financier's requirements.
That is also true where World Bank financing is concerned, he believes. The
Bank has tended to encourage privatisation, but may come into conflict with
what the state wants.
Nevertheless, several Asian countries now plan partial privatisation of
their electricity industries. Malaysia recently sold off 22.8 per cent of
the capital of Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned electricity monopoly, which
was 'corporatised' in 1990. The company is likely to be restructured further
in the near future.
In Thailand, meanwhile, EGAT, the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand, is still state-owned. However, the government will sell shares in
three power stations which were recently set up as separate subsidiaries.
Thailand is also one of many Asian countries including India, Pakistan,
Malaysia and even China inviting private sectors to tender to build and
operate new power stations. This has become a widespread practice in Asia.
'The impetus for privatisation may have come from the UK,' says Dr Tony
Wheeler, manager at Ewbank Preece, an engineering consultancy which advises
governments on restructuring electricity industries.
'The World Bank has jumped on the bandwagon too. These countries really need
to raise capital - for instance Pakistan can only borrow enough to build one
power station - and they need 10.'
The country has long planned foreign investment in the power station it
plans on the coast near Karachi, but has made little progress in agreeing a
deal that suits all parties.
Although the South East Asian electricity systems are typically modern and
so in fairly good condition, Mr Wheeler believes bringing in private capital
could help the countries become more efficient. 'Pakistan has 165,000 staff
to sell 10,000MW - that does not look good for the efficiency of the
organisation.'
In South America, too, privatisation is underway. Argentina's aggressive
privatisation programme led to the sale of Central Nuevo, a generating
company created from the state-owned electricity monopoly Segba.
The company is now owned by two privatised Chilean power companies,
Chilgener, and Chilectra, which outbid European and US companies to win a 60
per cent stake in the company. Argentina plans to sell the whole of the
electricity industry.
Chile itself has already privatised its electricity industry: Endesa,
Chile's largest electricity business, is one of the country's most
profitable private sector companies.
Although Mexico expects to keep the electricity utility in the public
sector, it has invited private sector companies to bid to build electricity
plant.
A few other developed countries, notably Australia and New Zealand, are
making some moves towards electricity privatisation. But this is unlikely to
be in the near future, or to follow the UK model.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (12): A city that comes alive at night -
What to do in Buenos Aires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUENOS AIRES is probably the least stressful of Latin America's major
cities. Its relatively uncongested streets, and clear air make it a welcome
relief from Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro or Caracas. Although crime is
rising, murder, robbery and drug use - and other features of many modern
cities - are still rare enough to make the news.
Buenos Aires does take some getting used to. Argentine lifestyles are
demanding, with evening meals beginning at 10 and night life only really
starting after midnight and ending at dawn on weekends. Fortunately,
Portenos as the inhabitants of this port city call themselves, are not early
risers - the morning rush hour normally reaches its peak around 10 am
It is easy to get about, since government offices and corporate headquarters
are packed within walking distance of each other into a small part of the
city centre known as the microcentro. The city is swarming with taxis:
unlike many other Latin capitals, drivers know the city's streets well and
are often honest.
Buenos Aires has good restaurants, theatres, cinemas and several beautiful
parks. Many of the best bars, cafes and restaurants line the Recoleta park
in one of the city's most exclusive residential neighbourhoods. But be
prepared: going out is not cheap. Buenos Aires is among the most expensive
cities in the world. A meal for two with a local wine in Recoleta will cost
Dollars 100 for two. A tip of 5-10 per cent is expected.
As might be expected, beef is the staple food of Argentina. Vegetarians will
find it difficult to cope, all the more so as lettuce, onion and tomato
salads or potatoes are the only concessions to a balanced diet. Health
freaks will also have to put up with inhaling cigarette smoke. No smoking
signs are almost universally ignored.
Leading international credit cards are widely accepted, as are US dollar
bills. However, travellers should be warned to only use and accept dollar
bills that are in good condition: Argentines reject torn, crumpled or
defaced money.
Argentina changed its currency in January, replacing the austral with the
peso. One peso is worth 10,000 australs or just over one US dollar. Be
careful, because austral notes and coins are still in circulation and taxi
drivers and waiters occasionally try to fleece the unwary by 'accidentally'
confusing austral and peso values.
The San Telmo antiques market on Sundays is a favourite with foreigners and
locals. Also popular are visits to La Boca, a working class district with
brightly painted houses which was first settled by Italian immigrants in the
19th century. However, it should be avoided during carnival, when people
attack each other with buckets of water and hosepipes.
Browsing through the late night bookshops on Avenida Corrientes is a
well-established local habit. A visit to the Boca or River Plate football
stadiums is an unforgettable experience with fireworks, tickertape and
ecstatic chanting to greet the teams as they enter the pitch. British
visitors may also want to visit the exclusive Hurlingham Club, founded by
the Anglo-Argentine community, where cricket and bowls are still played.
Watching polo, even for the uninitiated, is fun. Buenos Aires has several
polo pitches and there are matches on most weekends during the season.
Visitors may also want to watch or even dance the tango. Most dance halls
are tourist traps, but a few venues can still be found which preserve the
traditions of tango with loving dedication.
Buenos Aires has several glitzy and expensive discos that open their doors
around 1 am Suits and ties for men and short, tight dresses for women are de
rigueur. Argentines are careful, if conservative dressers. Unpolished shoes,
crumpled clothes or unconventional fashions are viewed with disdain.
These days, Buenos Aires is brimming with business visitors from abroad,
filling its five luxury hotels to capacity. Finding a good hotel room can
often be a frustrating experience. However, English is widely spoken in the
city centre and by most business people.
Shop opening hours are strictly observed, particularly on Saturdays, when
many shops close promptly at 1pm. Central Buenos Aires is packed with
leather goods shops of varying quality and prices - shoppers are advised to
look around before buying. Silverware and handicrafts can also make good
presents. Argentine wines can be worth trying, and a hit with visitors is
Bodega Menem - the wines produced by President Carlos Menem's family
business.
Buenos Aires can be uncomfortably hot and humid in the summer, although most
buildings in the city centre are air conditioned. The city empties from
December to the beginning of March as Portenos decamp to the seaside for
summer holidays. Arranging meetings can be a problem at this time of year.
Winters are chilly, with temperatures falling to freezing in July and
August.
Although nearly all major businesses are headquartered in Buenos Aires,
where over a third of the population lives, the cities of Cordoba and
Rosario are also important business centres. There are frequent daily
flights to both cities. However, flights are far from punctual and are
expensive: the one hour flight to Cordoba costs Dollars 242 return.
Buenos Aires has two airports. The international airport at Ezeiza is a 40
minute drive from the city centre, with cabs costing Dollars 50-60. The US
government warns that security arrangements at Ezeiza are inadequate. The
Jorge Newbery metropolitan airport handles domestic departures and some
flights to neighbouring countries.
As for the mountainous south, hiking and fishing is recommended during the
summer in the spectacularly beautiful area around the resort town of
Bariloche. Its ski slopes are packed during the winter. However, the pistes
and prices compare unfavourably with neighbouring Chile.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (11): Scandals revealed - Why Pagina/12
has become required reading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW IS IT that a muckraking, stridently anti-establishment newspaper
launched on a shoestring five years ago has become one of Argentina's best
selling and most influential newspapers?
Pagina/12 is now required reading among businessmen, diplomats and
politicians as well as its target readership of professionals, students and
left wingers. It has built up an average daily circulation of 110,000 with a
diet of punchy news, investigative journalism, opinion and cultural columns.
Mr Jorge Lanata, the newspaper's 32-year-old editor, explains that 'people
read us to get information. We began attracting readers with our political
coverage and businessmen began reading us because they needed good
information.'
Pagina/12 - so-called because it was launched with just 12 pages - was
thrust into the vortex of national politics in January last year when Mr
Horacio Verbitsky, its leading political columnist, wrote that Mr Menem's
brother-in-law had demanded a bribe from an American company. The scandal,
which forced Mr Menem to purge half his cabinet, put corruption more firmly
than ever on the political agenda.
Three months later, Pagina/12 again beat the opposition by breaking the news
that Mr Menem's sister-in-law - who is also his appointments secretary - was
under investigation in Spain for laundering drug money. The ensuing scandal
almost brought Mr Menem down.
It is hardly surprising that he loathes Pagina/12 and its 110-strong staff.
Last year he even attempted to throttle the newspaper by cutting off federal
government advertising - a bid that boomeranged when it set off an
international outcry against press censorship. The advertising embargo was
quietly lifted after two weeks.
The paper's unconventional layout - it covers nearly all its front page with
photomontages that invariably ridicule a member of the government - also
sets it apart. Its bold headlines and snappy text makes it easily
digestible. Nonetheless, its narrow focus on capital city politics and
sterile government infighting can be tedious.
Pagina/12's success reflects the growing maturity of Argentine society. Mr
Lanata says: 'We are not a left or a right wing newspaper. I say we are a
liberal newspaper. The left attacks us for belonging to the new right and
the right attacks us for being on the left.' Nonetheless, Pagina/12 rarely
finds anything praiseworthy in Mr Menem's government.
The press, led by Pagina/12, has become one of the few effective checks on
Mr Menem's growing personal power. The courts, congress and supposedly
independent control agencies have come under growing government influence.
As Pagina/12 began publishing exclusive stories, people in the government,
the armed forces and business realised its reporters protected their sources
and would print almost any story it thought reasonably accurate and
newsworthy. That has made Pagina/12 the preferred medium for government
leaks, giving it access to yet more exclusive stories which have boosted its
circulation still further.
However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, like ministers all round
the world, complains that the media twist the news. He says: 'Verbitsky
suggests that the corruption now emerging means that what we are doing is
bad, and that is not true. What we are doing is a real struggle against
corruption. Eighty per cent of what he writes is true, but he adds 20 per
cent of his own version that changes the conclusion.'
He says the media, particularly Pagina/12, has a disproportionate influence
on public opinion because its readership is heavily concentrated in wealthy
and middle class areas of central Buenos Aires. Mr Cavallo claims the paper
is hardly read in the outskirts, where the government draws a lot of its
support among low income groups which have benefited the most from his
policies.
The competition is having to react to Pagina/12's successes. For instance,
the tabloid Clarin, Argentina's best-selling newspaper, has promoted younger
and more aggressive editors who have begun to outflank Pagina/12 with
exclusive articles of their own.
Pagina/12 has also shown considerable entrepreneurial spirit. Its solidly
faithful readership has made it an attractive vehicle for advertisers. Mr
Jorge Prim, the paper's vice-president, says: 'Businessmen pay, and pay
well, to advertise. Freedom of the press is good for business.' Revenues
have doubled since last year to an average of Dollars 1.2m a month.
It broke into the corrupt entertainments advertising market by refusing to
accept payment for positive notices of films, plays or concerts. Instead, it
began holding film previews of its own and sold tickets to readers from its
offices. When advertisers saw that Pagina/12's previews sold out in two
hours and could literally fill large cinemas to capacity, it began taking
out advertisements - irrespective of the critics' notices.
In a recent marketing effort, the newspaper has begun giving away paperback
books free once a month on Sundays. It finances the offer with advertising
on the back of the books, which are usually by highbrow local and foreign
authors. Mr Lanata says print runs of 150,000-160,000 on Sunday editions
with books sell out, whereas on most other Sundays he sells 7 per cent fewer
newspapers.
Mr Lanata had the idea of launching a newspaper shortly after Argentina
returned to democracy in 1982. He found a backer in Mr Fernando Sokolowicz,
a progressive young businessman who put up the capital and still owns all
the newspaper's shares.
While Pagina/12 still only breaks even or makes a small operating profit, it
has an entrepreneurial spirit that seems out of place in a newspaper that
rails against big business and struggles for a fairer society.
Like so many businesses in Argentina, Pagina/12 suffered greatly from
hyperinflation in 1989 and 1990, and like so many others, it is now
benefiting from low inflation and booming demand. So much so, that it is
running out of capacity as demand outstrips supply: Pagina/12's presses
simply cannot turn out enough newspapers.
It plans to increase circulation later this year by printing in Cordoba
Argentina's second city 650 km west of Buenos Aires. Mr Lanata says
Pagina/12 will be Argentina's first newspaper to use satellite technology to
transmit pages to the presses in Cordoba.
Using its customary flair, Pagina/12 is financing the introduction of
computer technology to the newsroom with an advertising swap with IBM. The
feasibility study was farmed out to university computer science students.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (10): Challenge of competition -
Industry's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE challenge to Argentina's manufacturing industry is clear: it must
modernise, begin investing and rapidly attain international levels of
efficiency. The challenge is all the greater, not just because Argentina has
invested little in recent years, but because it has not built an
internationally competitive industrial base, in spite of 60 years of
protectionism.
Import barriers, subsidies and cartelisation have led to grotesque
distortions and inefficiencies. Large swathes of industry are now unable to
compete. Businessmen realise the old days of government support have gone
for good: the bankrupt state is unable to protect them any longer. On the
contrary, President Carlos Menem has converted Argentina from one of the
world's most closed economies into one of the most open ones.
Analysts agree that large sectors of the car, steel and engineering
industries will succumb to foreign competition, especially from Brazil, as
economic integration deepens.
The government has ignored industry's appeals for help. But it is trying to
reduce the inefficiencies that weigh heavily on companies' costs. The
energy, transport and communications infrastructure is being privatised.
Unnecessary regulations are being scrapped, the labour market is being
reformed and the banking system broadened to cut financial costs.
Companies are benefiting from rising domestic demand, softening the impact
of import competition. Manufacturing industry raised output by an average 20
per cent last year, with productivity increasing by 7 per cent. However, the
trend is uneven: car output in the first quarter rose 167 per cent, while
steel production slumped by 27 per cent.
Few companies are focusing enough on controlling costs. An automobile
executive says: 'Argentine companies are not very competitive. Argentina
must make a greater effort to reduce costs of inputs and labour.' He says
labour costs are 40 per cent greater than in Brazil - hardly an efficient
economy - and component costs are 30 per cent greater. Overall, costs are 50
per cent above international levels.
Nonetheless, some multinationals have been able to operate well in
Argentina. Thus, Autolatina's new USDollars 220m state-of-the-art axle and
gearbox unit is as efficient as any in the rest of the world.
The government says industry must concentrate on areas where it can exploit
Argentina's principal strengths. These include low-cost energy, an efficient
agricultural sector and abundant capital. Private savers hold an estimated
USDollars 50bn in overseas bank accounts. A tenth of that flight capital
returned last year.
Companies should therefore expand in food processing, services, energy and
capital-intensive industries and specialist market niches such as
electronics or special plastics.
An example of growing economic specialisation is Arcor, a leading sweet
company. It plans to raise sales by 52 per cent over five years to USDollars
855m in 1996. It is capitalising on Argentina's plentiful supplies of
natural gas and foodstuffs and intends to increase its presence in Brazil.
Though sales across the board are booming and companies can sell all they
produce, the economy is still the same size as in 1980. There are few signs
of big ticket investments. Businessmen say the economic climate is too
uncertain. They are still unsure whether to hire more staff: most factories
are currently working a single shift. They add that they lack confidence to
take on more staff because the law makes it expensive to shed workers if
sales stop growing.
Furthermore, most large companies are too busy buying up state companies to
spare resources for industrial investments. Nevertheless, imports of capital
goods are growing.
But companies are not exporting much. Most lack experience in fiercely
competitive international markets. Industrial exports grew by only 2 per
cent last year to USDollars 1.09bn. Industrialists claim it is pointless to
sign up overseas clients or invest for the export market until stability is
consolidated and the economy's cost levels are revealed more clearly.
Argentina will at best balance its trade account this year. Next year, it
will almost certainly sink into the red. Hopes for achieving annual growth
of 5-6 per cent will inevitably peter out unless companies begin exporting
and investing soon.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (9): Interest rates on way down - Bank
mergers seem likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE IS one issue that unites bankers, farmers, industrialists and
politicians, it is the high cost of credit. High interest rates are
discouraging investment at a time when continued expansion depends heavily
on investment.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, and Mr Martin Redrado, president
of the National Securities Commission (CNV), are both acutely aware of this
problem and are working urgently on reforming the financial system.
Mr Cavallo's reforms are intended to eliminate the government's role as
borrower on the local and international markets, allowing the private sector
to occupy that space. Companies have already begun responding, firstly by
issuing bonds on the domestic market, followed by a flurry of Eurobond
issues in early 1991.
Interest rates have already fallen dramatically as inflation subsides,
capital floods into the country and Argentines regain confidence in their
currency. This is a significant change from previous adjustment programmes,
in which governments were forced to keep interest rates artificially high to
defend the exchange rate. Despite such action, sooner or later, the currency
would slide as speculative investors poured out of the market.
In March, Argentine banks had Dollars 16.84bn on deposit - almost twice
their volume a year earlier and almost seven times more than in March 1990.
Just as importantly, depositors are increasingly willing to leave their
money in the bank. For the first time in over three years, deposits with
maturities of over 30 days - Dollars 1.60bn - exceeded short-term deposits
of Dollars 1.41bn.
Businesses have made huge savings as their financial costs shrink and the
risk of devaluation recedes. Interest rates on fallen to 8 per cent a year,
compared with 17.5 per cent at the beginning of this year.
Mr Alan Clutterbuck, planning and financial manager at Alpargatas, a Buenos
Aires textile company, says: 'Our financial costs were 25 per cent a year in
1991. Now they are 10-11 per cent a year. You can add this as profit to your
bottom line.'
Companies have also been able to raise money on the local and international
capital markets with increasing ease and banks have been able to raise
capital at ever-declining rates, allowing them to lower interest rates
further.
The government intends to continue reducing reserve requirements which now
stand at an average of 40 per cent, and this will allow banks to reduce the
spread between interest paid to depositors and that charged to borrowers.
Despite the declining cost of credit, it is still hard to find many
investment projects that are financially rewarding. This is especially so
for smaller companies and those based outside greater Buenos Aires, which
are saddled with higher interest charges.
That is where further deregulation and development of the capital markets
come in. The financial system is in flux as it adjusts operating costs to
lower revenues: the retail sector is shrinking to a core of seven to 10
banks. Those unable to compete in retail banking are struggling in the
cut-throat investment banking market.
A few universal banks will operate in all sectors of the market. Banco Rio,
already the country's largest bank, says it intends to operate as a major
retail bank, an investment bank, strengthen international operations and set
up a pension fund.
Eventually, many of the country's 160 banking institutions will have to
merge or disappear. Many were opened during the 1980s, when specul- ation,
lax regulation and fraud were rampant. Bank failures cost the central bank
Dollars 15.8bn during the 1980s through liquidity loans to collapsing banks
and deposit guarantee schemes.
Bankers now say the risk of financial 'melt-down' has receded and expect the
system to adjust without much trauma. The central bank has abolished its
unlimited deposit guarantee, although regulation is still weak.
The capital market, too, has undergone sudden change. The Buenos Aires Stock
Exchange suddenly came alive last year, after decades of torpor. In 1991 the
exchange's Merval index rose by 370 per cent as Mr Cavallo's policies took
effect. Today, daily trading volume often exceeds Dollars 80m, compared with
an average Dollars 3.3m in 1990.
The boom has been due entirely to a sudden inflow of mainly Argentine funds
repatriated from offshore bank deposits that now pay low international
interest rates.
Mr Redrado has tried hard to make the market more fluid, by focusing on
deregulation, reducing transaction costs and bringing new equity into the
system. Response from companies has been disappointing, although several big
corporations are thinking of going public for the first time, while others
are planning rights issues. That will help slake the thirst for paper. The
largest company to state its interest in selling equity is Sevel, the
country's largest car manufacturer.
Simultaneously, the CNV is tightening up on policing by cracking down on
trading irregularities, demanding improvements in accounting standards, and
encouraging privately-run credit rating services. However, critics say that
while the direction of reform is positive, execution is still only patchy.
Two critical changes are due this year. One is the privatisation programme,
in which the government plans to sell more than 60 state companies. It will
float part of the equity of many of these companies on the local and
international markets. The flotation of the government's remaining 30 per
cent in the two telephone companies has already raised Dollars 2.06bn. A
raft of privatisation issues will hit the market not only in 1992, but over
the coming years.
The second reform will be the introduction later this year of a private
pension fund system, which is expected to channel Dollars 2bn a year into
the capital market from a 10 per cent levy on wages. The government is
establishing investment guidelines that are expected to favour the equity
market.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (8): Minimalist role of the state -
Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN THE depth of the economic crisis which faced Argentina in 1989, any
incoming president would have had to begin reform of the state wrought by
Juan Peron. But perhaps only a Peronist, such as President Carlos Menem,
could have begun to dismantle it with such vigour.
By the time the privatisation programme is complete - and the greater part
of it should be concluded this year - enterprises responsible for 30 per
cent of the country's gross national product will have been transferred from
the government to the private sector.
The airline and state telephone businesses have already been privatised.
They will be followed by gas, electricity, railroads, water and sewerage
systems, part of the banking system, steel mills, petrochemical plants and
more. Even the state oil company, sacrosanct in other privatising countries
such as Mexico, is going up for sale.
Since the federal government is also transferring some health and education
responsibilities to the provinces, central government will have a minimalist
role, accounting for less than 10 per cent of economic activity. If the plan
is carried through, the state will have responsibility for public security,
defence, health, education and not much more.
The government now admits that its early privatisations were not well
managed, and that the companies were privatised into an under-regulated
environment. This has meant, for example, that the buyer of Aerolineas
Argentinas - Iberia of Spain - has an effective monopoly on domestic air
routes since it also controls Austral, the other Argentine airline.
In a country such as Argentina, a giant privatisation programme is a
dangerous thing on which to embark in haste. So, when Mr Domingo Cavallo
took office as economy minister at the start of last year, he put the
privatisation programme on hold. Mr Cavallo recognised that in a country
where corruption had become almost institutionalised, privatisation offered
an opportunity for corruption on a grand scale. A discredited privatisation
programme would risk credibility of the whole economic reform programme.
His ministry set about developing new procedures to make the bidding process
more transparent and to work on the regulatory regimes into which the
companies would be privatised.
The concept of separating the functions of policy-setting and regulation is
not highly developed or widely understood in Argentina. However, using
models mainly from the US and UK, the establishment of the regulatory
regimes for gas, electricity and water is well-advanced. Mr Cavallo, seeking
to get the telephone regulatory authority to enforce its regulations more
aggressively, replaced the entire board.
In this time, the government has also moved more aggressively to knock
companies into better shape before they are sold. They raised tariffs as
subsidies were slashed: in mid-1989 the income of public companies was 37
per cent lower than their spending. Large numbers of employees were also
made redundant. According to Mr Juan Sanchez Arnau, assistant privatisation
secretary, the total 230,000 workforce in state enterprises was cut by
25,000 last year. By the end of 1992, the job cuts will have grown to 55,000
 -at a cost in redundancy payments of Dollars 1.2bn.
The ministry is now calling for bids for two or three companies a month,
under different procedures for each company. Controlling stakes of utilities
will be sold to operators, with the government retaining the rest to be sold
later on the domestic and international equity markets.
Also to be privatised, although the timing and methods of sale are less
clear, are 30-odd companies owned by the defence ministry. Some of these are
manufacturing companies in poor shape. For the sake of the credibility of
the privatisation programme, bankers in Buenos Aires say they hope the
defence ministry privatisations are carried out with the same transparency
as later ones in the economy ministry's programme.
The delay ordered by Mr Cavallo will probably mean higher prices for the
sales, as illustrated by the two telephone companies, Telefonica and
Telecom. When the initial 60 per cent of these companies were sold at the
end of 1990, the government obtained Dollars 214m in cash and Dollars 5bn in
debt paper, at that time valued at 17-18 per cent of face value.
When the remaining 30 per cent was sold to the local and international
market (employees hold 10 per cent), last November and in February, it
raised Dollars 2.057bn.
The most ambitious privatisation is probably of YPF - Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales, the state oil company. The state's parlous finances
were such that the company was unable to explore for and develop fields.
The first move to break YPF's monopoly was announced early in the Menem
presidency. Concessions were offered to other companies in secondary fields.
In the company's central fields, joint ventures were offered to foreign
companies in return for an equity share in the oil produced. The
deregulation of oil production and prices was announced, to come into effect
at the start of 1991, a deadline which was kept in spite of the crisis over
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Even though the monopoly was in effect broken, YPF remains the largest oil
company in the country. Having already changed its legal status to that of a
corporation which can suffer bankruptcy, it is now seeking congressional
approval to get rid of non-strategic assets such as its shipping fleet, 50
drilling rigs and its seismic crews, and to open its capital up to
outsiders.
It has already reduced its workforce from around 52,000 in August 1990 to a
current 21,000. By the end of this year, the number of employees will have
fallen to 12,000, still regarded as above the optimum number. The Dollars
350m bill for termination of employment is being paid from cash flow. The
company's balance sheet is also being cleaned up, with the writing off of
significant debts. A complete overhaul of the company's operating and
accounting systems is under way.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, said the aim is to transform YPF into
an 'integrated, well-balanced oil company'.
The plan is to sell over three years 50 per cent of the company on the
domestic and international markets. A further 10 per cent will go to
employees.
According to Mr Estenssoro, the initial offering will be of at least 20 per
cent of the company, which has been valued at about Dollars 8bn once the
restructuring is complete. The shares will be sold in the US markets in the
form of American depositary receipts (ADRs) and listed in London and Buenos
Aires. Since the New York market requires three years of internationally
audited results, a sale there would not be possible before the 1992 figures
have been published. (1991 profit was about Dollars 300m after tax, compared
with Dollars 70m in 1990, on revenues of about Dollars 5bn.)
Another element in the plan is to transfer ownership of the oil properties
(once the concessions have run out) to the provinces, and a settlement of a
legal battle between the state and the provinces over royalties for past oil
production. This debt over about Dollars 3bn may be paid in bonds
convertible into the remaining 39 per cent of the shares of YPF, shares
which could in time find their way on to the market.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (7): A relationship built on mutual need
 -Menem and Cavallo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a marriage made in hell. President Carlos Menem and his Mr Domingo
Cavallo, his economy minister could never survive for long without each
other. Equally, their relationship is racked with fear, jealousy and
suspicion. Little wonder then that they are regularly said to be on the
verge of splitting up.
Although they have wrought one of the world's least likely economic
miracles, their stormy relationship is also a permanent source of
uncertainty. The edgy business community would be deeply unhappy if Mr
Cavallo left, believing that the impetus of reform would suffer with his
resignation.
However, Mr Cavallo, 46, warns: 'Do not underestimate Menem and me. We have
demonstrated that, even when nobody abroad believed us, we continued in the
direction we decided on.'
The two men could hardly be more different. Mr Menem, 61, is a typical Latin
American politician - a charismatic populist with firm grip on all the reins
of political power, but only a limited grasp of the intricacies of diplomacy
and economic policy.
Mr Cavallo is a technocrat rather than a politician. He took an economics
doctorate at Harvard and has a clear understanding of how the worlds of high
finance and international relations work. He is also a glutton for work and
is notorious for rousing his aides in the dead of night to discuss policy.
Mr Menem is said to be easily bored or irritated by Mr Cavallo's laborious
efforts to explain recondite economic theory. While Mr Menem may have
established the broad political and economic strategy, he is only too happy
to leave execution in the safe hands of Mr Cavallo.
Others say Mr Menem feels frustrated in his relationship with Mr Cavallo and
is given to taunting and humiliating his minister - a claim Mr Cavallo
obviously denies. He does say Mr Menem's occasional bursts of anger subside
quickly when a decision is shown to be in line with government policy.
Still, the punctilious and unrelenting minister contrasts sharply with the
president's lighthearted and less intense personality.
Mr Menem's jealousy seems to be worsening as his minister goes from success
to success. Mr Menem said in an interview that Mr Cavallo 'will continue in
his job as long as he follows the directives of the president. Ministers
must know they are like fuses - they are the ones that get worn out. The one
who does not go is the president.'
Mr Menem added: 'There are two forces: the force of his capacity, talent,
honesty. And there is political force, which is more important, which the
president gives him.'
Mr Cavallo understands Mr Menem's jealousies and makes every effort to pass
off his achievements as those of Mr Menem. He does recognise that his
success depends strongly on Mr Menem's political backing. 'To carry out
change like this requires power, and power is essentially a political
question,' Mr Cavallo says.
Despite his claim to be an apolitical technocrat, Mr Cavallo is said to have
engineered the fall of several of his cabinet colleagues and some of the
more unsavoury members of the president's personal entourage. Mr Cavallo is
suspected of leaking some of the corruption scandals to the press that have
forced Mr Menem to purge the government. That is a charge Mr Cavallo
vehemently rejects. Nonetheless, he is hated by Mr Menem's close friends who
are widely suspected of corruption.
The two met after Mr Cavallo was elected to Congress as an independent in
1987. At the time, Mr Menem was the governor of the impoverished province of
La Rioja. When he came to power in 1989, he made Mr Cavallo foreign
minister. Mr Cavallo won international respect for renewing diplomatic links
with Britain and mending fences with the international community. He also
kept an eagle eye on economic policy. He became economy minister in January
1991 after an inflationary burst forced his predecessor to resign.
Politics are at the heart of their increasingly difficult relationship.
Opinion polls regularly place Mr Cavallo far ahead of Mr Menem, and his
policies are credited with winning last year's mid term elections. He is
therefore an obvious potential presidential candidate when Mr Menem's term
expires in 1995.
But Mr Menem wants to reform the constitution that bans successive
presidential terms and run for re-election. However, much as Mr Cavallo
denies presidential ambitions, he is generally assumed - by Mr Menem and by
many others - to want to become president.
There is a risk that Mr Menem will fire Mr Cavallo or try to compromise his
rigidly orthodox economic policies to win support for constitutional reform.
Another big worry is that the horse trading of a re-election campaign would
fuel corruption. Mr Cavallo and his team are seen as a bulwark against
corruption.
The general assumption is that Mr Cavallo will probably remain in office at
least until the end of the year. For his part, Mr Cavallo says he supports
and is working for re-election and says he hopes to be foreign minister in
Mr Menem's second government.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (6): Provincial burdens -
Decentralisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA IS a country with a small population that is crammed into one
corner of its huge territory. The province of Buenos Aires, where over
one-third of the 32m population lives, casts a long shadow over the other 23
provinces.
Its stranglehold may be weakening now that the key posts in the federal
government are held by outsiders. President Carlos Menem is from the
province of La Rioja in the west, and Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy
minister, is from Cordoba in the centre.
The government is trying to make Argentina a truly federal state, probably
for the first time ever, through a big decentralisation programme. When the
process is completed next year, Buenos Aires will be responsible only for
defence, federal justice, trade and economic policy, tax collection, foreign
relations and some educational services.
By law, 56 per cent of most taxes raised by the national government are
transferred to the provinces. Local revenues are increasing dramatically
with the rise in tax collection. Transfers are forecast at Dollars 12.8bn
this year, 26 per cent more than in 1991. Transfers should rise to Dollars
15.1bn next year. Oil-producing regions' revenues are growing faster still,
since they charge royalties on production.
Nonetheless, the provinces' atrocious finances are a permanent threat to
economic stability, and the federal government is trying as hard as it can
to force them to adjust. Only a few have advanced very far in reorganising
themselves. Far too many regions have a bloated, inefficient government
sector, burdened with over-regulation and corruption.
Mr Cavallo has ended the provinces' virtually automatic central bank
funding, and the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank have made
reform a condition for releasing Dollars 600m-worth of loans earmarked for
local government.
Provincial governors may complain of bullying, but in the end they have
little choice but to comply. Some provinces, like Cordoba and La Pampa in
the agricultural heartland, are reasonably well administered. Cordoba is
perhaps the only province to have fostered a flourishing enterprise culture.
Others, such as La Rioja - which Mr Menem governed until he became president
in 1989 - are a disgrace. Last year, one in 10 of La Rioja's population of
221,000 worked for the government and wages consumed 65 per cent of
spending. Like some other provinces, it used to cover its budget deficit by
printing provincial money. Last year it raised a mere 5 per cent of spending
from local taxes; the rest came from central government transfers.
The provinces must change their political systems. Many are run by political
clans that have clung to power for decades through a blend of patronage,
corruption and brutality. Some ruling families lost power in last year's
gubernatorial elections. Those that remain are finding that their old tactic
of extorting federal aid in exchange for support in Congress is becoming
less effective.
Mr Cavallo believes that voters will demand more efficient local government.
However, there is an obvious risk that increasing tax revenues will
strengthen the power of local strongmen and allow them to stave off economic
adjustment.
The provinces could make greater efforts to develop untapped resources. For
instance, the western Andean provinces have done nothing to encourage
mining, and those on the Atlantic seaboard could easily develop fishing
industries.
Some analysts wonder if certain provinces are viable administrative units.
Some cover huge areas with small populations. Others are relatively populous
but have small economies. The burden of providing provincial and municipal
levels of government may be too much for them, making some form of regional
administration or amalgamation necessary in the future.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (5): Pampered by the pampas -
Agriculture - future prosperity depends on adding value
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FARMING once made Argentina rich, but like other areas of the economy, it
has suffered a debilitating cycle of under-investment, protectionism, and
inefficiency.
Agriculture remains, nevertheless, the bedrock of the economy and is
benefiting from stability. Demand is growing, prices are rising and
profitability is improving. The next crucial step is for farmers to increase
investment. The collapsing transport infrastructure must also be overhauled
and marketing channels revamped.
Traders, farmers and government officials have also realised that the key to
future prosperity lies in adding value to the grains and beef that
Argentina's fertile pampas produce at very low prices, rather than exporting
them to processing plants in Europe or North America.
Instead of exporting soyabeans, Argentina should export more cooking oils.
Instead of exporting beef carcases it should sell more cooked beef products.
This trend is being reinforced by the US and European farm subsidies that
have driven world commodity prices down. Grain prices plummeted in the late
1980s and are only now beginning to recover.
Grain output and prices touched bottom in 1987, when exports collapsed to
10m tonnes from 22m tonnes in 1985 and export revenues fell by two-thirds to
Dollars 1bn. In 1991, grain exports rose to 15.7m tonnes, worth Dollars
2.05bn.
Exports of oilseeds have performed better, rising steadily since the early
1980s. . Exports roughly doubled from 650,000 tonnes in 1981 to 1.4m tonnes
last year. In value terms, shipments were worth touching Dollars 284m in
1981, rising to Dollars 773m in 1991. Exports of subproducts of soyabeans
and sunflower seeds have risen from Dollars 329m a decade ago to Dollars
1.13bn in 1991.
Mr Jorge Ingaramo, assistant agriculture secretary, points to the main
problem: 'Agriculture uses land as an input too much and does not use enough
of the modern factors of production - qualified labour, technology, capital,
services, that would add more value to basic products.' He says that while
it would be difficult to double the size of the wheat crop, it would be
feasible substantially to increase its value in four or five years.
At present, only one-quarter of Argentina's Dollars 8bn-worth of
agricultural exports are processed in the form of cattle feed or oilseeds.
And since Argentina's output is marginal to the world market, it could
double its value-added exports without depressing world prices.
Raising the capital component of farm produce will, of course, take time and
require heavy investment. Farmers' profits are growing as strong demand
pushes up prices. The government says they have already begun replacing worn
out equipment: it reports tractor sales up by 230 per cent in the first
quarter, compared with the same period of 1991. Nonetheless, farmers still
complain that real interest rates of about 20 per cent a year discourage
major investments.
Mr Luis Maria Flynn, president of the Argentine subsidiary of Cargill, the
US grain trader, points out that there is still a long way to go. 'Maybe
only one-third of farmers are using modern technologies.' Wider use of
modern techniques could easily raise annual grain output by 25 per cent in
five years to 50m tonnes, he argues.
The challenge, then, is how to encourage the other two thirds of farmers to
use more advanced equipment. Although farmers understand that there is no
point in lobbying the government for subsidised loans or grants, there is
still a lot the public sector can do to help. Mr Ingaramo admits that the
government must provide better rural extension services, better sanitary
controls, and develop marketing services, such as a country brand.
Farmers also need to become less tradition-bound and to be more
business-like, examining their costs carefully. They are already beginning
to use financial instruments like futures hedging to avoid price
fluctuations.
Even though the pampas, the most fertile tract of land in the world, provide
Argentina with an awesome competitive edge, protection from outside
competition over the past 60 years has atrophied agriculture. Argentina
never bothered to develop premium products such as fine cheeses or exotic
fruits.
Because Argentina was a closed market, the consumer could buy only produce
that was available locally. For the same reason, Argentina failed to develop
new export markets in fresh produce, exotic fruit or in wines, as Chile did
during the 1980s.
Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an economist at Coninagro the farm cooperative
organisation, points to the dilemma: 'The farmer wants to make the consumer
buy what he sells and not sell what the consumer wants. Yet when new
products arrive, they sell well. The problem is the retail system, which is
inefficient and has big margins that are not shared with the farmer.'
Argentina's atrocious transport infrastructure adds heavily to farmers'
costs. Mr Flynn reckons that costly and inefficient ports alone have lost
farmers Dollars 100m over the last five years in extra costs. Buenos Aires
is reputed to be the world's most expensive port.
Public services, such as ports, railways and toll roads, are being
transferred to the private sector this year. They should lower costs and
improve efficiency dramatically, although exporters complain that the
companies taking over port facilities are being allowed to set prices
artificially high.
Growing integration with Brazil will open a huge new consumer market for
processed beef, dairy, poultry, fruit and vegetable products. The bigger
market would enable Argentines to exploit economies of scale they lack at
present, allowing them to become more efficient. Agricultural specialists
see conquest of a significant slice of the Brazilian market as a first step
to penetrating European Community, North American and Japanese markets.
The shift from basic farm products to more sophisticated ones will require a
drastic shake-out. The government reckons that there are 200,000 family
farms that are no longer viable units. They will be bought out by larger,
more capital-intensive farmers.
Inevitably, farmers have major doubts. Their misgivings are similar to those
of industrialists. The key question is confidence: is it worth investing,
especially if a farmer cannot be certain Argentina's inflation, exchange
rate and cost structures will not get out of hand?
Labour is a major agricultural input, but wages have risen dramatically. On
average they have doubled to Dollars 450 a month in just one year. In some
cases, wages have risen more than fourfold, wiping out profits.
Farming requires long lead times. It takes six months to grow cereals and
three years to produce a steer ready for slaughter. Farmers fear that if
they begin investing now to meet rising consumer demand, the boom may end
just as their investment is ready to hit the market.
Mr Sarachu also points to the danger of social disequilibrium as small farms
are absorbed by larger ones and their former owners are either driven into
urban slums or retained as low wage labourers. This would be all the more
worrying if investment does not take place. He warns this would create
wealth concentration in a context of stagnation. 'High investment costs are
preventing diversification or expansion of output.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (4): Coming in from the cold - Foreign
Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem's love of the grand gesture makes him, on occasions,
a diplomat's nightmare.
The examples are legion. Rather than downgrade subtly the quality of the
Argentine delegation to the Non-Aligned Movement, as a diplomat might have
advised, he pulls Argentina out with a grand fanfare. Rather than wait for
an invitation to visit Britain, which would certainly have been forthcoming
in time, he announces, through the medium of the FT, a plan to pay a visit
to the UK in 1992, an election year and the 10th anniversary of the
Falklands war. (The visit seems likely to take place in 1993.)
In contrast to the awkward reaction of most Latin American governments to
the crisis in the Gulf, Mr Menem sends two warships to support the US-led
coalition. He also followed the hard US line on Cuba, breaking ranks with
the rest of Latin America.
Mr Menem is telling the world that Argentina is a changed country; that the
60 years of isolationism which marked Argentina's foreign policy is over. He
is seeking to bury Argentina's reputation as an unreliable player on the
world's diplomatic stage.
Mr Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, argues that 'Argentina's
internal and its international policies are a unity'. In other words, a
democratic, open economy requires a different foreign policy from a closed
economy run by a dictator. The wide-ranging manifestations of this policy
include:
Alignments: Argentina has aligned itself more closely to the west. This was
initially seen as a pro-Washington tilt to policy, an interpretation
disliked in both Washington and Buenos Aires. More recently, there has been
emphasis on relations with Europe, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of
external trade compared with 15 per cent in the US. Family ties with Europe
are strong - more than 1m Argentines are also citizens of EC countries.
International agreements: Argentina has professed an intention to comply
with a wide range of these that it had previously refused to sign. In April
President Menem signed a decree placing strict controls on the export of
sensitive materials. The government has signed agreements with Brazil on
nuclear inspection, and with Brazil and Chile on banning nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons. The nuclear safeguards laid down by the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have been adopted. The government has made a
commitment to the US to abandon the Condor missile project, expressed a
desire to join the Missile Technology Control Regime and committed itself to
nuclear non-proliferation and the Tlatelolco treaty which banks nuclear
weapons in Latin America. It has also signed treaties on international
investment protection.
Despite all this, many of these commitments have yet to be ratified by the
Argentine Congress. Furthermore, there will remain some doubts about the
ability of the government to force compliance on the military of some of
these agreements.
Nonetheless, the reaction from Washington has been positive. The US has said
that some 20 Skyhawk jets are available to the Argentine air force, the
first indication of US willingness to combat aircraft to Argentina since the
Falklands War.
Relations with neighbouring countries: Argentina has eased historically
tense relations with Brazil and Chile. This has a strong economic motive.
The government is intent on economic integration with Brazil, the key to
which is Mercosur, a customs union of the two economies with Uruguay and
Paraguay. That is scheduled to begin in 1995, though its implementation may
be delayed.
The hope is that Chile will join the group once Brazil's economic problems
abate. But there is little doubt that the excitement in Argentina over
integration with Brazil is not matched in Brazil. There are also some
worries that Mercosur may restrict Argentina's ability to act unilaterally
over trade matters, for example, in discussing a free trade agreement with
the US.
However, given the openness of the Argentine and the Chilean economies, and
the growing outward orientation of Brazil, further economic integration
appears inevitable with or without agreements among governments. Companies
from the three countries are already discussing mergers and joint venture
agreements, and Chilean companies have already been buyers (of two power
stations) in the Argentine privatisation programme.
Relations with the UK: Argentina restored diplomatic relations with Britain
in July 1990. These had been broken with the invasion of the Falkland
Islands 10 years ago. That was also the key to improving relations with the
European Community.
With the issue of sovereignty under a so-called umbrella - meaning both
sides retain their claim to sovereignty - fairly cordial discussions between
London and Buenos Aires have moved ahead on the practical issues of fishing
rights and aviation. There has been less progress on the more difficult
issue of oil exploration rights.
Mr Guido di Tella, the Argentine foreign minister, has also said that the
desires of the islanders will be taken into account in a settlement, a
statement viewed as constructive in London.
While Britain retains a garrison of 2,000 men on the islands that the
Argentines know as the Malvinas, Argentina must be considered now neither to
have the intent nor the military capability to invade. Thus the only risk to
the 2,100 islanders is the small one of an attack by some maverick force.
The Argentines have not given up on their claim to the islands, however, and
the war remains a traumatic experience over which they still agonise. Since
there is little chance of the British parliament cutting a deal over
sovereignty over the heads of the islanders, the Argentine government
appears to have embarked on a longer-term strategy of reducing the
islanders' fear of things Argentine.
If this is so, policy towards the Falklands fits neatly with the rest of
Argentine foreign policy: to convince the world that Argentina is now a
democratic, stable and reliable member of the community of nations.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (3): Power shifts to outsider - Stephen
Fidler on the impact of a period of political change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem has made a deliberate effort to transform Argentina's
economic future with, so far, beneficial results. He is also presiding over
a political change which is often less deliberate and the effects of which
are significantly more uncertain.
Some aspects of this change are linked to the new priorities of the
government's economic reform programme; some to President Menem's methods of
government; others to a long-term decline of traditional power bases: the
military, the trade unions and the church.
'Menem has atomised the traditional corporations of the state,' says one
western diplomat in Buenos Aires, 'but a clear picture of what will replace
them has yet to emerge.'
Although a Peronist, Mr Menem is from the poor state of La Rioja and thus an
outsider at the centre of power. This in itself is a challenge to
traditional Argentine politics. Moreover, his economic policy has made the
old divisions of political parties less meaningful.
While his use of patronage has meant that dissent within his own party is
practically non-existent, the success of economic reform has made it
difficult for the main opposition Radical Party to argue for a coherent
alternative. To suggest that the government's economic policy is wrong looks
like an argument for hyperinflation.
The economic policy has also weakened the trade unions. In common with their
counterparts in many other countries across Latin America and in the
industrialised world, trade unions have lost power. They will lose more as
reform continues.
Privatisation and bureaucratic reform have already meant a large-scale
reduction of the workforce in the highly-unionised public sector, a process
that will continue over the next year. The government is also seeking to
weaken centralised collective bargaining and to reform the corrupt system
under which unions provide medical services to members.
While some industrialists argue that the unions they face are still
powerful, others say that they see evidence of increasing flexibility on the
shopfloor which is helping to undermine the traditional trade union
leadership.
The church remains a relatively popular institution, but it too has appeared
divided in the face of the economic programme.
Meanwhile, the military - especially the army - still languishes under the
humiliation of its defeat in the South Atlantic war 10 years ago. Its
capability has also been reduced by a lack of spending: much big equipment
appears not to function while salaries are so low that many military
personnel have a second job.
While comparisons with Venezuela might suggest a dangerously unstable
military, the likelihood of a coup in Argentina is now considered remote,
particularly since the civilian government offers the prospect of economic
stability.
Furthermore, because of the new slant in Argentine foreign policy, the armed
forces, or at least parts of it, can begin to develop a more professional
role. This was exemplified by the decision to send two warships to the Gulf
as part of the US-led coalition against Iraq, and a contingent of 800 men
being sent as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia.
Economic reform has also thrown into relief some of the shortcomings of
Argentine political institutions. Privatisation, done properly, and the new
discipline imposed on the central bank should reduce the opportunity for
large-scale corruption. But corruption will be harder to root out on a
smaller scale: in the police, in the courts and among the officials in
central and provincial governments with whom Argentines still have to deal
on a daily basis.
A weak legal system is often cited as an obstacle to foreign investment
which is an important part of the government's long-term economic policy.
The system suffers from a lack of finance, which encourages corruption among
some judges. It is almost entirely based on written presentation, severely
delaying legal process. (In September, an important experiment will start
with oral public hearings). Mr Menem has also called into question the
independence of the judiciary from the executive by packing of the Supreme
Court in 1989.
Judicial reform is one possible aspect of the constitutional reform now
being widely discussed in Buenos Aires. However, cynics say that Mr Menem's
interest in the subject may be mainly a result of his wish to stand again as
president when his term ends in 1995. He is currently barred from doing this
under the constitution.
Mr Menem denies this, however. 'This is not a Peronist project or a project
of Carlos Menem,' he said. 'It's an old project that was begun by the
Radical party', which held the presidency before Mr Menem took power.
At the moment, there seem few obvious rivals to Mr Menem, except for Mr
Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister.
The opposition Radical Party is divided into three groups, one of which
supports the former president Mr Raul Alfonsin, who is seen as unlikely to
re-emerge as a political force. The more 'modern' incarnations of the
Radical Party are led by Mr Fernando de la Rua, now running for election as
senator for the Federal District of Buenos Aires, and Mr Eduardo Angeloz,
governor of Cordoba province.
Both are seen as relatively reliable but neither has yet to carve out a
strong image as a potential president.
Whoever is the next president, Argentina's opening up to the outside world
should help to provide incentives against reversing reform. For example, any
veering away from financial orthodoxy is likely to be punished by the
international financial markets. Meanwhile, privatisation and other economic
reforms should make it more difficult to defraud the state through the
corruption that became endemic in the 1980s.
Nonetheless, Argentina needs time to complete its institutional reform and
that time can only be bought through continuing stability in the economy.
That, for now, depends heavily on a powerful president, whose political
instincts are acute but essentially populist, and on a couple of his
ministers.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (2): Virtuous circle rewarded with
public support - Stephen Fidler looks at how inflation has been tamed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Carlos Menem assumed office, Argentina was in a frenzy of
hyperinflation.
In that month, July 1989, retail prices rose nearly 200 per cent. At this
level, commerce grinds to a halt. Simple transactions become impossible
because people have no idea at what price they will be able to replace what
they have sold.
Hyperinflation threatened again in early 1990. Since then, the inflation
trend has been dramatically down. Last year, prices rose 84 per cent,
compared with over 1,300 per cent in 1990 and almost 5,000 per cent the year
before. This year, inflation will probably be significantly below 20 per
cent.
For this brief insight into relative economic stability, the Argentine
people have been grateful. As voters, they have responded with support for
those who back the government's economic programme. As savers, they have
begun to bring back capital: they accounted for much of the estimated
Dollars 5bn that flowed into Argentina in 1991. As consumers, they have
started to spend, encouraged by the emergence of what for Argentines is an
unusual service: consumer credit.
As a result, while some sectors have suffered, there is no sense of overall
economic austerity. Gross domestic product rose some 5-6 per cent last year,
with employment rising 3 per cent and industrial production up 20 per cent.
This year growth could be higher: perhaps 7-8 per cent, according to Mr
Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister.
The economy appears to have entered a virtuous cycle. This dates back almost
entirely to a law, the brainchild of Mr Cavallo who took office in January
1991, that went into effect on the inauspicious date of April Fool's Day
last year. The convertibility law turned the central bank into a currency
board. It fixed the Argentine currency to the US dollar and only allows the
central bank to issue local currency when backed by inflows of dollars to
the central bank. (The dollar was set at 10,000 australs. This January, the
government renamed its currency the peso and made one peso the equivalent of
USDollars 1.)
This law halted the Argentine inflation machine - by which the central bank
printed money to cover a budget deficit estimated to have reached 14 per
cent of GDP at its worst in mid-1989.
It also made it imperative that the budget deficit was kept in check. The
government has managed to do this by raising tax revenues, mainly through
the imposition of an effective value added tax, and abolishing subsidies to
public sector enterprises. The government shrank its overall budget deficit,
including privatisation receipts, to 0.6 per cent of GDP last year, and a
small surplus is promised for the next two years.
A central part of the programme has been the privatisation of the
loss-making public enterprises. This was envisaged in a state reform act
which passed into law in 1989 and predated Mr Cavallo.
The Menem administration also moved quickly to bring down tariffs and
abolish almost all quotas on imports, turning Argentina very rapidly from
one of the most protected economies on earth to one of the most open. Late
last year, the reforms were supplemented by decrees abolishing large swathes
of the regulation which has hobbled private enterprise.
However, 60 years of state controls have produced a perverse economic system
that will take more than a year to dismantle. Mr Cavallo, most of whose team
came with him from the economic research group he founded, Fundacion
Mediterranea, admits that there is still much to do.
According to Mr Juan Llach, planning secretary in the economy ministry, the
following are among the priorities:
Completing Argentina's dramatic privatisation programme (see separate
article), which will remove Dollars 700m annually or 1/2 percentage point of
GDP from the budget deficit.
Concluding Argentina's deal with foreign bank creditors. The government's
aim is to complete the exchange of concessional bonds for loans by November
or December this year. While the Brady agreement has been criticised
internally for being too generous to the banks - interest payments to
commercial banks will roughly double to about Dollars 130m monthly - the
country will stop building up interest arrears to the banks. The deal is
likely to improve the country's access to foreign capital markets.
Winning congressional approval for reform of the social security system, an
important contributor to the fiscal deficit. The aim will be to move towards
a mixed system, allowing the creation of private pension funds It would also
put the state sector on a sounder financial footing.
Argentina has a higher proportion of old people than other Latin American
countries (apart from Uruguay): as a result its state pension bill has been
high. Argentina's monthly pension bill is about Dollars 800m, 7 per cent of
GDP, compared with the 1 per cent spent by Mexico.
While Argentina's pension system is in balance on a cash basis, old people
do not get the pensions they are promised by the state. This builds up every
month a notional deficit with pensioners. The ministry wants to lower the
entitlement, perhaps to Dollars 150 a month, but to make sure everybody gets
this amount.
The private pensions, to which everyone under 45 would pay 10 per cent of
salary, are also seen as playing an important role in the development of the
capital markets, as they have in Chile.
Reforming the labour laws. These help contribute to high labour costs in
Argentina. Reform has several facets, one of the most important of which is
the law on social medicine. This obliges trade unions to provide medical
treatment for members. While the system gives access to medical coverage to
a large sector of the population, it is seen as costly and inefficient.
The idea is for the state to provide a basic health service, but allow
people to opt for private medical care, which the vide. The ministry is also
seeking to tackle the laws of collective bargaining to allow for a much more
decentralised system of wage bargaining. Further tax reform would reduce
taxes on labour, which increase labour costs by up to 50 per cent.
More changes in the regulatory system. The government will seek further
deregulation, for example, by inducing Argentina's 24 provinces to
deregulate in areas where they have jurisdiction such as in the setting of
professional fees. In other areas, where natural monopolies are being
privatised, the state will seek to establish effective regulatory regimes.
The efforts by the ministry to establish an overall budget for the
government, divided into ministries is also important. In January, Mr
cavallo delivered to Congress and secured passage of the first budget since
1953.
For some time to come, if the government manages to preserve relatively low
inflation, Mr Cavallo's programme should retain his popularity. However, low
inflation will not secure eternal gratitude from Argentine voters. There
will probably emerge in time dissatisfaction about the ability of the state
to provide the social goods such as health and education which fall into its
much reduced remit.
In the longer term, growth is the key to Argentina's remaining in the
virtuous economic circle. Given the financial straitjacket that Mr Cavallo
is constructing around the public sector, the key to the long-term success
of the programme has to be private sector investment. This is why Mr Cavallo
has placed a high priority on normalising relations with foreign creditors
and why he wants to abolish the rules that inflate Argentine labour costs.
Private investment will depend on the world being convinced that Argentina
is a place where investment can be made under fixed and transparent rules:
something which cannot be said yet to have been achieved, in part because of
a lack of trust in the judicial system.
Such investment is also sensitive to economic confidence which can be upset.
For the moment, the fixed exchange rate regime has given Argentines
confidence to bring their money home. But a clumsy adjustment of that regime
could damage confidence badly. It seems almost certain - despite average
monthly consumer price inflation of around 2 per cent in the first four
months of the year - that Mr Cavallo can maintain the fixed rate for 1992.
The picture varies, but many manufacturers say that the combination of
tariff reductions and the relatively strong peso has left the cost of
imports little changed. The government emphasises too that wholesale price
rises are running at much lower levels than retail inflation - an average
0.6 per cent monthly in the first quarter.
However, if rises in retail prices lead to upward pressure on wages, then
the competitive position of Argentine exporters will be damaged. This will
in turn increase the pressure for a devaluation of the exchange rate. The
government in the meantime is hoping that deregulation can shake up the
services and oligopolistic retail sector, to put downward pressure on retail
prices. Meanwhile, the inflows of capital represent a two-edged sword in the
inflation fight: they make it easier to continue the exchange rate regime
but also cause an expansion in the money supply which puts upward pressure
on prices.
Most damaging to confidence in the short term would probably be the
disappearance from office of Mr Cavallo. He and President Menem are widely
reported to have differences, but know they need each other. The economy
minister denies suggestions he has ever threatened to resign, and says that
any fears that he and the president would part company in a damaging way
'underestimates me and underestimates President Menem.'
Mr Cavallo is widely considered to need another 18 months to complete his
programme. Another worry is that Mr Menem's assumed wish to stay on another
term (impossible under the present constitution) may involve him and the
Congress in unnecessary horse trading. The fear is twofold: that the
president may bargain away certain parts of the economic programme to secure
support for his reelection and that the constitutional changes might saddle
the government with unnecessary restrictions on its freedom of manoeuvre.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (1): Best chance in years - Economic
reforms are beginning to bear fruit, after the impetus given by Carlos
Menem, the head of state since 1989. Monthly inflation is now in single
figures. The president has the chance to reverse the economic decline of the
past 60 years

ARGENTINA'S reputation as an economic disaster zone has received a serious
blow over the past year.
The country has just enjoyed a year of slow inflation and high growth, with
every prospect for another year or two of the same. Argentina may be on the
road to a fundamental economic recovery.
If it is, it will be thanks to two men: President Carlos Menem and his
economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo.
They have opened Argentina's economy up to market forces, international and
domestic, and curbed its disastrously inefficient government.
The resultant stability has been popular: it is credited with winning Mr
Menem a vote of confidence in last year's mid-term elections. It has also
reversed a decade of capital outflows from Argentina, triggering an influx
of money. This has doubled the government's hard currency reserves in a year
to Dollars 8.3bn at the end of March.
It has won the support of the International Monetary Fund for an Dollars 3bn
extended fund facility, given only to countries that have a 'track record'.
This has brought agreement in principle with foreign bank creditors which
will lower the burden of Argentina's Dollars 62bn foreign debt.
Mr Menem is an unlikely free market crusader: a Peronist from the provinces
whose lifestyle and friends many Argentines find unsavoury. But he knows
what he wants and how to get it; and what he wants now is an Argentina freed
from the shackles of overregulation, state control and protectionism.
Mr Cavallo is a Harvard-trained economist who provides the intellectual
firepower for reform and who has put the economic programme back on track
since he took over in January last year.
The change in the economic outlook has also brought a more outward-looking
foreign policy. Argentina has aligned itself more closely to the west and
announced its intention to comply with a raft of international agreements it
previously refused to sign.
It has sought better relations and closer economic integration with its
neighbours. It is committed to the creation of a tariff-free common market,
which would group Argentina with Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.
Economic stability had eluded the previous government of President Raul
Alfonsin who was forced by economic crisis to relinquish power to Mr Menem
five months early in July 1989. The economy was in hyperinflation, and food
riots and lootings had prompted the implementation of a state of siege.
Mr Alfonsin had taken office in December 1983 from a military government
disgraced by seven years of political repression and economic mismanagement.
Its final humiliation had been the military defeat by British troops on June
14, 1982, following the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands.
During his time in office, Mr Alfonsin and his radical party had succeeded
in further weakening the influence of the military in government. He also
(rare enough in Argentine history) managed to hand over power to another
elected president.
But lack of success in handling the economy overshadowed his presidency. Two
economic 'shock' programmes - the first and second Austral plans of 1985 and
1987 - failed to stabilise the economy.
A mixture of wage and price controls and devaluations, the plans failed to
address the central cause of Argentine economic instability: an
out-of-control budget and a central bank with little monetary discipline.
Mr Menem dismisses the Austral plans as 'announcements, nothing more'.
Indeed, his administration can claim to have tackled the root of many of
Argentina's economic troubles by curbing the budget deficit and securing a
law forbidding the central bank to print money unless backed by foreign
currency.
An aggressive privatisation campaign is helping to keep the deficit in
check. Under it, companies accounting for no less than 30 per cent of the
Argentine economy will be transferred rapidly from the state to the private
sector.
The government has fixed the Argentine currency to the dollar and pledged to
keep it there, despite complaints that it is hurting business. Mr Cavallo is
convinced that Argentines are so inured to inflation that the competitive
benefits of a devaluation would be offset by price rises in a matter of
weeks.
With a lowering of tariff barriers and a removal of much of the regulation
that has hobbled the private sector, Mr Cavallo reckons the government is
removing the causes of the severe malfunctioning of the Argentine economy.
There will be no going back, he says, to the system of multiple exchange
rates, industrial promotion, over-regulation and state lending that fostered
enormous corruption. Argentines are not lazier or more corruptible than
other people, he says: they respond to incentives like everyone else. 'Under
the old system, there was an enormous incentive to corruption and the result
was huge corruption. That has now gone.'
The reform programme should indeed reduce the opportunity for corruption in
Argentina, but it will take time to erase it from the system. As one former
central bank governor says: 'There are still thousands of subterranean
contacts between the government and the private sector which can lead to
corruption.' The head of one US company told the FT that a project his
company had won to build a new port in Argentina was being held up by his
refusal to pay a bribe.
Indeed, one of the important consequences of economic stability is that it
removes the distorting prism of rampant inflation. This allows a clearer
vision of the challenges that will have to be faced for Mr Menem to achieve
his much-vaunted desire to bring his country back into the first world.
The picture is far from negative. Argentines are more literate and their
wealth is distributed far more evenly than in most other Latin American
societies. Its traditional natural resources, such as its abundant, fertile
land, remain.
However, the vital questions are whether the private sector can respond in
its new role as the engine of growth; and whether the public sector can be
effective as provider of public goods, such as health, education, security,
and as a reliable arbiter of justice. The two issues are interlinked:
private investment, for example, will be discouraged by a corrupt justice
system.
There is selective evidence of the private sector responding to the cold
wind of foreign competition, but it is too soon to say in what sectors,
apart from food production, the country can carry comparative advantage.
Similarly, the ability of the state to provide public goods has
deteriorated. Turning this round will be critical: the Argentine people will
not be satisfied for ever with stability. If they are lucky enough to obtain
a few unbroken years of low-inflationary growth, they will start to demand
that the state performs effectively its reduced role, particularly in the
provision of education and health services.
The next 12 to 18 months are widely viewed as critical to further and
consolidate the economic programme. Reform is needed, for example, of labour
and social security legislation. In this period, it is quite likely that the
exchange rate regime will have to change and this will need to be done
carefully to avoid fracturing confidence.
The continuation in office of Mr Cavallo is also viewed inside and outside
Argentina as critical to the maintenance of confidence. While elements of
the economic reform will remain with or without Mr Cavallo, it is difficult
to identify anyone who would do the job better, observers say, and there are
legions who would do it worse.
In this sense, the reform programme may still be said to be fragile and
unhealthily dependent on a few enlightened members of the government.
One fear is that Mr Menem's commitment to economic reform is that of a
populist, albeit an astute one, rather than that of a 'conviction'
politician. His response in the event that he becomes unpopular is thus
unknown.
There are also concerns about his apparent desire to run for office again,
which is forbidden under the current constitution. Mr Menem says he has not
yet made up his mind on the issue. There may be a risk that he will trade
away part of his economic programme to secure support for constitutional
change. And the other changes which would have to be made to give the
project an air of respectability could lumber the country with an unworkable
constitution such as that which is now hindering Brazil's reform efforts.
Mr Menem has given Argentina its best chance in years to reverse the
economic decline of the past 60 years. Further increasing those chances
would seem a more important priority for his country than a personal project
to rule Argentina almost to the next century.

FT  13 MAY 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Reject opportunistic bid says
Cronite director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 14th May 1992) appended to this article.
MR DAVID Pinsent, the lone voice on the Cronite board against the
recommended Pounds 7.3m offer from AFE, the quoted French engineering
company, has strongly advised shareholders to reject the 'opportunistic'
bid.
Mr Pinsent, who controls 0.9 per cent of the Birmingham-based engineer, said
that all Cronite's subsidiaries were now trading profitably.
However, Mr James Lindsay-German, chief executive, described Mr Pinsent's
letter to shareholders as 'a damp squib', saying it did not worry him as it
contained nothing new. 'Most of it has been trailed for some time.'
Mr Pinsent said Cronite's positive cash flow from current trading was
reducing gearing, now down to about 50 per cent and falling. By contrast,
AFE's was about 100 per cent and would rise with the acquisition. 'It would
seem that AFE needs Cronite more than Cronite needs AFE.'
Mr Pinsent said since the offer in April, the UK stock market had risen
about 12 per cent, interest rates had been reduced, and there were growing
signs of recovery in the UK economy. He asked: 'Could there be a less
appropriate time to accept a cash offer for a recovering company ?'
Mr Lindsay-German countered by saying that AFE now controlled 26 per cent
and had irrevocable undertakings for a further 14.8 per cent.
Cronite returned to the black in the six months to March 31, helped by lower
interest charges. Profits were Pounds 311,000 (losses Pounds 2.21m).
Cronite shares were unchanged yesterday at 45p.
Correction (Published 14th May 1992)
AFE, the French engineering company, yesterday said it owned or had agreed
to acquire 26.1 per cent of Cronite, the Birmingham engineering company for
which it has mounted a Pounds 7.3m recommended bid, and had undertakings in
respect of a further 3.6 per cent. In yesterday's Financial Times, Mr James
Lindsay-German, Cronite's chief executive, mistakenly stated that AFE spoke
for 40.8 per cent.

OPERATING profits at Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German regional public
sector bank, climbed by 'more than 50 per cent' in the first three months of
the current year against the comparable period for last year, the bank's
chief executive said yesterday.
Mr Friedel Neuber said that the good performance to date would put the bank
on course for total operating profits of about DM1bn (Dollars 600m) for the
year, up from DM970m for 1991.
He cautioned that first-quarter operating profits were inflated by the
inclusion of a contribution from the housebuilding promotion facility of the
state of Westphalia for the first time. Stripping this out, profits would
have risen by 30 per cent in the first quarter.
The figures confirm that the German banking sector is still enjoying
excellent lending conditions in the wake of a vintage year last year.
Last month, Commerzbank reported total operating profits up by 75 per cent
in the first two months of the current year.
Spelling out some details of last year's results, WestLB said that group net
profits rose from DM56m in 1990 to DM224.64m last year, while group
operating earnings for last year more than doubled from DM340m to DM714m.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Cosmetic surgery cuts a dash with China's new face: How a
change in attitudes in the People's Republic lets women alter their looks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE Chinese want wider eyes and bigger noses and are subjecting themselves
to cosmetic surgery. Surgeons performing the operations, excising part of
the upper eyelid and inserting a silicon strip in the nose, say the aim is
not to look more western.
But to many young Chinese western standards of beauty are part of a
revolution in style which has come with a taste for hamburgers and Kentucky
Fried Chicken, rock and roll, imported designer sunglasses and jeans.
At Shanghai's 9th People's Hospital 2,000 cosmetic surgery operations were
performed last year. The hospital has a waiting list of another 2,000 and
there were an estimated further 1,000 operations in other Shanghai
hospitals, a tiny number in a city of nearly 14m people, but growing.
Most are for eye rounding and nose augmentation, but the hospital's plastic
surgery department also offers face lifts, stomach tucks, breast enlargement
and lyposectomy, sucking surplus fat from the body.
Patients are overwhelmingly female and local. Lured by the low cost more are
coming from Hong Kong, Macao and south east Asia. For around Dollars 11 a
local patient can have both eyes widened. A nose costs Dollars 14. Overseas
Chinese and Hong Kong compatriots pay 10 times as much, but the price is
still attractive. Professor Wei Wang, director of the plastic surgery
department, expects to put it up to Dollars 50 by the end of this year.
In the 1950s cosmetic surgery was forbidden by the government. In the
cultural revolution self-beautification was bourgeois, decadent and
dangerous. 'We just asked Deng Xiaoping if it was alright to go ahead,' said
Professor Wei with a chuckle. Since 1982 the department's surgeons have
performed 500 face lifts.
Cosmetic surgery was approved after the fall of the gang of four, according
to Professor Guan Wen Xiang, head of the hospital's research institute into
plastic and reconstructive surgery.
Standards of beauty change in China as everywhere else. In the Tang dynasty
fat was fashionable. For centuries tiny feet were seen as beautiful, many
women being crippled by the cruel custom of foot binding. The westerner has
long been mocked as a Big Nose but Chinese fashion now dictates that the
small, flat Chinese nose is enlarged with silicon - 'but not like yours',
Professor Guan added hastily.
In the shapeless 1970s curves were taboo and the Chinese female figure in
its Mao jacket looked little different from the Chinese male. Women such as
Wang Ling, sitting on her bed at the 9th People's Hospital after having her
breasts enlarged with silicon implants, are now embarassed by their lack of
curves. 'My husband is a businessman and he wanted satisfaction,' she said.
'He wanted me to look good socially.'
In the bed opposite Lu Feng Hua, 40, is about to spend Dollars 250 on a face
lift. All the way from Inner Mongolia where she practices traditional
Chinese medicine, her tight smooth skin shows a few laugh lines at the eyes
and frown lines across her forehead, but nothing to warrant a face lift.
Of 8,000 patients seen last year by the plastic surgery department, 25 per
cent were about 'making people look more beautiful and younger than they
are,' as Professor Guan puts it. The rest were seen for disfigurement by
burns or congenital deformity.

MOSLEM and democratic opposition demonstrators in Tajikistan, describing
government concessions as inadequate, demanded the resignation of President
Rakhmon Nabiyev yesterday, Reuter reports from Dushanbe.
Thousands packed into a central square in the capital Dushanbe, keeping up
pressure on Mr Nabiyev after seven weeks of unrest in which more than 100
people have been reported killed in the former Soviet republic bordering
China and Afghanistan.
Many voiced discontent with Monday's agreement between opposition leaders
and Mr Nabiyev, a former Communist Party boss elected last November, on
forming a coalition government and creating an interim legislature until new
parliamentary elections are held next December.
The influential Tajik poet Bozor Sabir captured the mood of the people with
a rousing speech.
'Most of you are not happy ..and I am not happy. Even before the casualties,
I called on Nabiyev not only to resign but to leave the republic,' he said.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Queen Elizabeth makes right royal Strasbourg debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS as close to a full house as Strasbourg ever gets, when Queen
Elizabeth II arrived to bestow her royal assent on 'this ever more important
Parliament of Europe'.
Downing Street previews of what Her Britannic Majesty was to tell Euro-MPs
had whipped up a fine froth of controversy, with Conservative Euro-sceptics
scenting a Foreign Office plot to sell the prerogatives of the mother of
parliaments down the Rhine to the mother-in-law of parliaments.
Labour European MP John Tomlinson, the inspiration behind previous
invitations to the Queen in 1988 and 1990 which Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
government had not seen fit to authorise, complained that the eve-of-visit
storm gave 'credibility today to a group of yesterday's men, wheeled out to
give knee-jerk reactions to things that everybody has now accepted'.
Lively, pre-speech discussion in Strasbourg on the insignificance of
national parliamentary traditions when set against the reconciling
enterprise of Europe - the bombshell allegedly embedded in the Queen's
address waiting to go off in Westminster - appeared to indicate the need for
an EC directive on the harmonisation of platitudes.
It either meant the Euro-sceptics' nightmare; or it meant there are not
really any significant differences in Europe's national systems; or it
paraphrased into 'please don't mind our parliamentary idiosyncrasies, which
are terribly useful when we want opt-outs of monetary union and the social
charter"; or perhaps even 'my ancestors gave up their sovereignty so why
can't they?' Once translated into the nine official languages of the
Community, the possibilities were likely to increase exponentially.
However, a 'Buckingham Palace spokesman' made clear that 'as a
constitutional monarch, Her Majesty speaks on the advice of her government'.
So that was the end of the bombshell story.
More than anything else, this visit by the only EC head of state not to have
addressed the parliament symbolised the transition from Thatcherite
hostility to the Community to the intention of Mr John Major, her successor,
to put the UK at 'the heart of Europe'.
The exercise went off without a hitch - unless it was the unsewn hem on the
Queen's blue coat, which prompted a 'hem, hem' from a noted royalist
newspaper.
The Queen drew up in the Renault model favoured by Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, who appeared in the chamber without
the emperor's crown Euro-sceptics assume him to covet, and was first to his
feet upon her entry.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the regal former French president, made his
entry after she had begun speaking - a tactic much favoured by his successor
Mr Francois Mitterrand at European summits.
She got a warm welcome from MEPs who spent part of yesterday squabbling
about seating arrangements. This row was triggered by the Euro-Conservative
adjunct of Her Majesty's government, which now that it has swelled the ranks
of the Christian Democrat bloc in Strasbourg has had to reseat (physically)
to the right of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's neo-fascist group.
The Queen's theme was the reconciliation of post-war Europe, strength in
diversity, and 'the necessary balance struck at Maastricht' enabling action
'on a European basis where the nature of a problem requires a European
response'. Enlargement of the EC and the nurture of eastern Europe were
emphasised - as much as anything by the 22 flags of the Council of Europe
flying where normally the 12 members of the EC club hang their pennants. But
unlike Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands at Maastricht, Queen Elizabeth did
not offer to 'sacrifice her head' (on the coinage of the realm) for European
Monetary Union.
It turned out to be 'differences of opinion and style' which were
'insignificant against the background of the proven commitment of Europeans
today to reconciliation and democracy', and the Buckingham Palace sources
insisted that no, there had been no change in the wording.
Her Majesty permitted herself a joke on the vigorous debating style British
members 'will no doubt have brought to the deliberations of this house . . .
a style which can be confrontational, as some of my ancestors found'.
Republican sentiment was wholly absent yesterday, however, and the Queen got
two ovations. At the lunch, the toast was 'Europe', washed down by Moet et
Chandon 1986. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the current Portuguese president of
the Council of Ministers, said he felt 'the European spirit was always there
(in the UK), but now it's slightly more visible.'
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner who prompted the UK
government's pre-Maastricht outburst about Commission meddling in national
'nooks and crannies', said he was 'moved and overcome by the presence of Her
Majesty the Queen'. One measure of her triumph was his decision to eschew
his habitual bright green-rimmed spectacles, and wear royal blue ones for
the occasion.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (11): A wealth of spare
talent - Drastic cost-cuts in research and defence projects have left top
scientists with an uncertain future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR DECADES one of the showpieces of Communist rule, Russian brains are
turning out to be one of the better buys for investors seeking opportunities
in the newly-capitalist country.
The Soviet Union's collapse last December, followed by price liberalisation
and drastic government spending cuts in January, has left an impressive
state-sponsored system of scientific research in complete disarray.
This, in turn, has opened up the chance for outsiders to tap the wealth of
scientific talent in Russia and the other newly-independent republics.
In the meantime, the disintegration of the old Soviet system has triggered
fears among western governments that under-paid scientists will sell Soviet
nuclear and other military secrets to Third World dictators.
These fears are no doubt exaggerated  - there are still restrictions on the
scientists' movement, the Russian government has promised to increase their
pay, and many do not actually want to leave the country.
Still, the future appears extremely bleak to many scientists, who have been
looked after by the state all their lives and now have to find their own
solutions  - 'if they told us to be patient for a year or two, then we could
at least go and work as doormen in the meantime,' says Sergei, a computer
programmer who has not been paid this year.
While his institute waits for overdue grants from the state (the government
blames a physical shortage of banknotes for the delay), Sergei and his
colleagues are surviving on a few unofficial orders from defence and other
state-owned plants.
But even these are at risk because the industry's own financial resources
are rapidly declining as a result of 'across the board' spending cuts. These
include a reduction in defence procurement  - a leading employer of
scientific talent  - to 13 per cent of last year's level.
Some scientists have lost no time in helping themselves. One such pioneer is
Professor Boris Babayan, who created the supercomputers used in the Soviet
space programme and the design of nuclear weapons. He and a team of
colleagues at the Institute for Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology
are now putting the finishing touches to an agreement to carry out research
in Moscow for Sun Microsystems, a Californian computer company.
Prof. Babayan, seeking funds to complete work on a new super-computer, the
Elbrus 3, began talking to foreign computer companies a year ago. He is not
saying how much Sun will pay him and his colleagues, but it does not take
much to improve on his current monthly salary of Rbs2,000 (Dollars 20) a
month.
Other scientists are choosing to leave the country. One of Prof Babayan's
colleagues is emigrating to the US, while three others have taken a
prolonged leave of absence of abroad.
While such solutions may secure the future of the very top scientists or
those with easily marketable skills, such as programming, they will not be
applicable to all.
Nowhere is this clearer than in the akademgorodok (scientific village) set
in beautiful forest-land, 30km outside Novosibirsk, the biggest city in
Siberia.
Conceived in 1957 as a place for scientists to think in peace and live in
comfort, it contains more than 20 research institutes  - ranging from
nuclear physics, mining, inorganic chemistry, and semiconductor physics. The
livelihood of 30,000 scientists, receiving an average monthly wage of
Rbs1,400, depend on it.
'Our policy is to hang in here until the very last. There's nowhere else to
go,' says Mr Sergei Kuznetsov, a 44-year-old mathematician at the local
Computing Centre, which can carry out mathematical modelling for everything
from the weather to military aircraft.
Apart from the shortage of housing which makes it difficult to move ('we're
no longer tied here by internal passport rules but by our apartments'), Mr
Kuznetsov says sharp price rises make it prohibitively expensive to travel
around to look for other jobs. An air ticket to Moscow costs Rbs540  - or a
third of his monthly salary.
He heads the Computing Centre's department for seeking foreign grants to
fund joint research projects with the outside world  - 'it's embarrassing to
seek help,' he says. 'But we perfectly understand that the hand of the state
will not reach out to us. We have to do something ourselves.
'Before, we always felt important. Fundamental science used to be one of the
achievements thanks to which we compared ourselves to the civilised world,
but now we live in a situation where there is little money, poverty and
unemployment.'
Some western public money, at least Dollars 40m already pledged by Germany
and the US, has already been promised for a centre within Russia to occupy
scientists involved in nuclear weapons production.
Western backers of the project explain that the aim is to attract matching
private funds for joint research projects.
Another way out is through domestic entrepreneurship. In a small factory set
up on premises belonging to the Botanical Gardens, just outside the
akademgorodok, Mr Yuri Yurchenko, a microbiologist who used to be involved
in the production of biological weapons, now oversees the production of
cosmetics.

STOCK INDEX futures traded in a narrow range for most of the session, with
turnover down on recent levels, writes Joel Kibazo.
A 2,760 opening level for the June contract on the FT-SE proved to be the
session's high point, for selling shortly after the opening caused a
retreat, pushing June down to 2,741 by 11am. A further dip to 2,738, the
day's low, was recorded shortly after. For the next few hours June traded in
a narrow range between 2,741 and 2,750.
Traders were concerned by the stock overhang in the underlying equity
market, following recent deals in ICI and Pilkington shares.
A brief rally was seen towards the end, but June eventually stood at 2,741,
down 23 from the previous finish and around 12 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover, at 5,986, was poor.
The traded options market was dull with turnover of only 26,765 lots. The
FT-SE option accounted for a sizeable part of that total, having had 11,310
contracts traded by the close, with the June 2,600 series particularly
active.
Business in stock options was very poor. Boots was the most active stock,
with 1,127 lots dealt. The July 460 puts were the busiest series.

FT  13 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling of electricity package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY issues were heavily traded as securities house Kleinwort Benson
was said to have carried out a large switch out of the Electricity Package.
Kleinwort was believed to have sold around 9,000 package contracts,
equivalent to 9m underlying shares in the regional electricity companies
(Recs), and bought into Yorkshire, Southern and Eastern.
There has been considerable switching recently ahead of the results season,
which begins in earnest with East Midland's full-year figures on June 15,
and ahead of the forthcoming break-up of the package in the late summer or
early autumn.
The Recs saw two-way business as some investors sold out on worries that the
impact of British Coal privatisation talks would spill on to the electricity
sector. Yorkshire gained 1 1/2 to 390 1/2 p with 4.2m traded, Southern lost
5 to 321p on turnover of 4.8m, and Eastern fell 9 to 276p on 3.5m dealt. The
package lost Pounds 90 to Pounds 3255.
Switching in banks
Clearing banks National Westminster and Barclays took separate paths
yesterday after securities house Kleinwort Benson advised clients to move
funds from the first to the second. NatWest lost 12 to 353p, while Barclays,
in spite of a downgrade of its long-term debt by credit rating agency
Moody's Investors Service, put on 5 to 386p.
Mr Norrie Morrison, of Kleinwort's banking team, said NatWest had
outperformed the market by 20 per cent since the general election and outrun
Barclays by more than 45 per cent since last July. 'We think the talk about
Barclays' exposure to property is a little over the top, and there is a very
significant upside there.'
Figures from Marks and Spencer were in line with expectations but, as
feared, the level of UK sales proved to be disappointing. To emphasise the
point M and S chairman Sir Richard Greenbury said the recession was not yet
over and sent shivers through the rest of the retailing sector.
The gloomy UK outlook prompted most analysts to downgrade their forecasts,
with cuts from the Pounds 775m level to around Pounds 755m. The shares
firmed a penny to 331p.
In similar vein, Argos also reported sluggish first-half sales at its annual
meeting, the shares sliding 6 to 278p.
Insurer General Accident reversed an intraday gain to close a net 9 off at
489p. Better than expected first-quarter results, accompanied by a positive
trading statement, had prompted an initial rise of 11.
However, the market then concentrated on the net asset value which, at
around 470p per share, was disappointing and showed the shares to be
slightly expensive. Also, Cazenove was said to have recommended a switch out
of GA and into Guardian Royal Exchange, steady at 158p.
Life insurer Britannic saw unusually heavy turnover as its own pension fund
halved its 8.8 per cent stake in the company by placing 3m shares in the
market. The shares were traded as a number of small agency crosses with
institutions at 895p.
The sale was prompted by the 1990 Social Security Act, which came into force
in January and demands that investment by a pension fund in its own company
is limited to 5 per cent of the fund's assets.
Yesterday's placing by company broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had been expected
and had been suppressing the price of the shares as potential buyers waited
to pick up stock at a discount. Britannic rose 5 to 910p.
Analysts said the next company in the sector to be affected is United
Friendly, where 19 per cent of the pension fund assets are in United stock.
United firmed 3 to 358p.
BP attracted US buying and bucked the general trend after stating that it
was selling its 57 per cent stake in BP Canada for CDollars 374m. The sale
is something of a drop in the ocean compared to BP's debts, but it took the
market by surprise and appeared to demonstrate that BP was serious about
getting its books straight.
Weekend press comment suggesting Hanson might buy a stake in BP, and also
firmer crude oil prices, helped the shares. BP gained 5 to 257p and was
actively traded with 15m shares changing hands.
There was talk that one of the market's leading agency brokers had attempted
to place 11m shares in Racal Electronics, although no deal was recorded by
the end of the day's trading. The shares slipped a penny to 61 1/2 p.
A recent buy note issued by SG Warburg Securities failed to sustain BT,
where the fully-paid declined 4 to 347p. Traders said there was some
nervousness ahead of BT's fourth-quarter figures, due next week, and that
Cazenove, the company's broker, had been an aggressive seller of the shares.
Theme park operator Euro Disney dropped 52 to 1268p on a French press
report, vehemently denied by the group, that attendances were well below the
level anticipated.
Rolls-Royce declined 5 to 168 1/2 p after Nomura weighed in with a 1993
profits downgrade. Leaving the 1992 figure at a low Pounds 105m, the
securities house reduced the following year's figure by Pounds 30m to Pounds
170m.
Mr John Lawson at Nomura said: 'The scale of the pick-up in civil spares is
still disappointing.'
News of a Dollars 50m order and, at the company's annual meeting, improved
demand lifted Simon Engineering 8 to 291p.
A sizeable amount of stock continued to overhang Pilkington following
Monday's bought deal between BZW and BTR. Pilkington ended 6 lower at 154p,
while BTR fell 8 to 488p.
The hard-hit US hotel industry weighed heavily on Bass, also affected by a
1.5m line of stock reported as being offered by Panmure Gordon. The shares
shed 16 to 637p.
United Biscuits slipped 9 to 419p after warning that first-half profits
would show an 'overall decline'. BZW promptly cut its 1992 profits forecast
by Pounds 9m to Pounds 218m.
USM-quoted TJ Hughes, the discount retailer, made an impressive market
debut. The shares closed at 90p, compared with the 75p issue price.

FT  13 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking triggers market slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INEVITABLE bout of profit-taking emerged yesterday, sending London share
prices lower after a prolonged bull run that has seen the Footsie moving to
record levels for four consecutive trading sessions.
Yesterday's fall was triggered by more evidence that the recent run of big
gains in the equity market would see the emergence of some hefty lines of
stock for sale, coupled with concern that the market had run too far,too
fast.
There was also the worry, according to traders, that the Wall Street market,
which has been attaining record highs over recent weeks, may be due for a
sizeable correction.
The market was in good form at the outset, edging higher in response to the
latest record achieved by Wall Street. The Footsie opened five points
stronger at 2,742.8, marginally short of the all-time best, but suddenly
began to slide.
The decline was caused by an uninspiring statement issued by Marks and
Spencer along with its preliminary figures.
Although not causing any major damage to the M and S share price, the news
quickly caused a ripple of unease around the market, with the Footsie on the
slide and showing a fall of almost 19 points by mid-morning.
Thereafter, the market managed to hold its lower levels, before coming under
renewed pressure towards the close of business when Wall Street began to
lose ground. The latest UK economic data on producer prices failed to
generate any enthusiasm in the gilts market, although sterling improved
strongly against the US dollar over the session.
A couple of medium-sized programme trades, one said to have been carried out
overnight and the other executed in midsession, also impacted on the market.
By the close, the Footsie had struggled back to end the session 15.4 off at
2,722.4. Yesterday's turnover in the equity market, 592.1m shares, was well
short of recent levels, but was regarded as a good performance from a market
ripe for profit-taking after the recent surge of buying interest.
Stock overhangs from the market's most recent bought deals were said to have
been partly responsible for the reluctance of potential buyers to chase
prices higher yesterday. ICI, after the Goldman Sachs bought deal, and
Pilkington, in the wake of BZW's purchase of the BTR stake, were two
examples of this, according to specialists. There were suggestions that a
number of large lines of stock - notably Racal Electronics and Bass - had
been offered around the market, causing more indigestion.
An agency cross of 3m Britannic Assurance at 895p a share was later
confirmed as representing the sale of the shares by Britannic's own pension
fund. General Accident kicked off the composite insurance sector's
first-quarter results season with better than expected figures.
The utilities sector was among the market's busiest areas, with Kleinwort
Benson Securities said to have played a big role in the day's activity. This
mainly involved unravelling of the Electricity Package and reinvestment in
specific electricity stocks.

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data fail to spur
Dow to 3,400

Wall Street
GOOD inflation news and another fall in bond yields failed to boost US stock
prices yesterday, as investors passed up the opportunity to push the Dow
Jones Industrial Average above 3,400, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was off 12.46 at 3,385.12. At one point the index was
more than 20 points down, but a late rally halved the mid-afternoon losses.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.20 to 416.29, while
the Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.17 to 583.96. Turnover on the New York
SE was 193m shares.
The day's inflation news - a 0.2 per cent rise in April producer prices -
was well received. The increase in prices was slightly smaller than
expected, and some analysts said fresh evidence that inflation was not a
threat to the economy left the door open for the Federal Reserve to cut
interest rates further.
That the inflation numbers, and the subsequent fall in bond yields, failed
to provide a boost to prices was primarily due to technical factors. Dealers
said that a short-term ceiling on prices had been set at 3,400 on the Dow,
and profit-taking emerged as soon as the index threatened to breach that
level.
Citicorp dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 in heavy trading after the
banking group offered to exchange newly issued common shares for all of its
second and third series adjustable rate preferred shares.
General Mills put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 on news that its three
continental European snacks businesses would be merging with three similar
operations owned by Pepsico, which lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 35 7/8 .
News Corp rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 in the wake of a turnround in the
Australian parent group's fiscal third-quarter earnings.
The Limited fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 21 3/4 after disappointing the
market with first-quarter net profits of Dollars 51.5m, barely higher than a
year ago in spite of enjoying a one-off pre-tax gain of Dollars 9m.
On the American Stock Exchange, Sbarro plunged Dollars 11, or almost a
third, to Dollars 27 after Morgan Stanley cut its earnings estimate and
investment ratings for the stock in the wake of the company's poor
first-quarter performance.
On the Nasdaq market, Midlantic jumped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 10 1/4 in
turnover of 3.5m shares after senior executives from the regional bank
holding company were reported to have told analysts in New York that the
company anticipated a further decline in its problem loans.
In the same sector, Star Banc moved forward Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 and
Fifth Third Bancorp declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 on reports that
institutional investors were putting pressure on Star Banc to consider a bid
from its rival Ohio banking group.
Canada
TORONTO stocks tumbled from midday highs to end flat as bullish sentiment
over the slight rise in the US producer price index waned late in the day.
The downturn in New York muted growing optimism that has been seen in the
Toronto market over the last few days. Traders noted, however, that Toronto
may continue to outpace New York as it has over the last two sessions.
The composite index was up just 0.7 at 3,427.9 after reaching 3,444.8.
Volume totalled 26.06m shares. Advances ran neck and neck with declines,
finishing at 286 each.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips on trade comments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR suffered signif-icant losses against the Japanese yen and other
currencies in the foreign exchange markets yesterday after Mr David Mulford,
the US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, expressed concern
about Japan's rising trade surplus, writes James Blitz.
The move, described as the biggest change in yen/dollar trading for three
months, came after Mr Mulford had said the US was 'very, very concerned'
that Japan's trade surplus with the United States would grow soon as the US
economy recovers. He told a Senate Banking subcommittee that the US was
pressing Japan to take action in the form of a supplementary budget.
There was furious yen buying immediately after the statement, as traders
anticipated that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries would be
prepared to intervene in the currencies markets to keep the yen high. The
dollar quickly fell through what was seen as the important support level of
Y131.70 to finish at Y130.45 in London. In New York it closed steadier at
Y130.65.
A forex analyst said yesterday: 'People have been bullish about the dollar,
but Mulford's comments about the trade surplus have made people think
again.' Another felt that the market was over-reacting, bearing in mind that
there has been little real intervention to keep the yen high since the idea
was first mooted at the G7's Garden City summit in January.
Either way, traders in Europe and North America were expecting the yen to
strengthen substantially after Tokyo's opening, perhaps reaching Y128.00 to
the dollar.
Mr Mulford's comments, combined with speculation about an imminent cut in US
interest rates, weakened the dollar against other currencies. It closed at
DM1.6215, down nearly two pfennigs on the day. It also lost ground to
sterling, which closed at Dollars 1.8125, up nearly two cents from its
previous close. The dollar finished at DM1.6241 in New York and the pound at
Dollars 1.8118.
In contrast to the dollar, the D-Mark was well supported by comments
yesterday from a senior official. The president of the State Central Bank of
Bavaria was reported as saying that interest rates would not be reduced
before the end of the year.
Analysts said this was the first time a Bundesbank official had produced a
definite comment on the outlook for rates. The statement helped the D-Mark
against sterling, which ended at DM2.9400 in London, down  1/4 pfennig.
But the German unit lost further ground to the French franc, which has
surged following the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as prime minister,
and the easing of credit conditions last week. It was at FFr3.3565 to the
D-Mark by the close of European trading, from a previous FFr3.3626.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Paper held back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY'S lingering hopes about an imminent base rate cut were extinguished
yesterday, as traders in the sterling money markets hardened to the view
that 10 per cent base rates are here for some time to come.
In spite of yesterday's low rise in the April producer price index, the
market is convinced that the UK authorities are unlikely to respond by
bringing rates down now. 'For all the hype about low interest rates, the
market's perception is that we are hard up against Germany,' said one
trader.
A few market participants may be hopeful. The unwillingness of discount
houses in recent days to offer paper to the Bank of England has suggested
that market players think a cut could come soon. On Monday, there was a
shortfall of Pounds 270m in paper offered to meet the shortage, and that was
repeated again yesterday to the tune of around Pounds 100m.
'Historically, when interest rates come down, people do not offer paper
because they hope it might happen again,' said one trader yesterday. But
other market players read little into this, believing that it is due to
technical factors, such as a number of banks being long on money.
In the interbank market, period rates continued to form a virtually flat
curve: everything from 1-month to 5-month money registered a rate of 10 1/8
per cent yesterday. 6-month and 9-month money ended the day a fraction lower
at 10 1/16 per cent.
In the futures market, the June short sterling contract ended the day
trading at 89.93, a figure which assumes that base rates in June will be
10.07 per cent.
In the discount market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage in the
morning of Pounds 750m. In early operations, the Bank purchased bills
totalling Pounds 129m, of which Pounds 50m were Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8
per cent, Pounds 48m were Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 31m
were for resale to the market on June 1 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per
cent.
The forecast was then revised to a shortage of about Pounds 800m. In further
operations, the Bank bought Pounds 99m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per
cent and Pounds 117m for resale to the market on June 1 at an interest rate
of 9 15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 327m of Band-1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 170m.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea crop 25% behind last
year's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN tea crop was down by 14.55m kg in the first quarter of 1992
compared with the corresponding period last year.
The shortfall was biggest in south India, which remains under the grip of a
severe drought. Out of total production till March of 44.12m kg south India
contributed 29.85m kg, which was 10m kg lower than the crop in the first
quarter of 1991. Tamil Nadu the crop fell by 6.9m kg, in Kerala by 3.03m kg
and in Karnataka 7,000 kg. In north India, according to Mr Vijay Dudeja,
spokesman for the industry, the output decline of 4.55m kg was caused by the
absence of early showers in north Bengal, where tea bushes have suffered a
large-scale pest attack. And in large tracts of Assam tea plucking has been
hindered by the prolonged winter. Parts of Assam have also been hit by
exceptionally dry weather. The first quarter north Indian crop was 14.27m
kg.
Of the total Indian first quarter crop the share of CTC - cut, tear and
curl, the type favoured in Britain - was 33.12m kg, of orthodox 10.65m kg
and of green tea 350,000 kg. To cater for the change in demand pattern,
particularly following the shrinkage in orders from Russia and the other
constituents of the former Soviet Union, the Indian tea industry is
gradually reducing production of orthodox tea.
According to Mr Dudeja, there have been tea production setbacks in other
countries too. Sri Lanka which is in the same agro-climatic zone as south
India is way behind last year's production and the African producers have
also been contending with drought.
It is estimated that by the end of April, the world tea crop shortfall could
be as much as 40m kg, of which India's share is likely to be 25m kg. Tea
industry officials consider it highly improbable that the shortfall can be
made good in the remaining period of 1992.
In spite of the sharp fall in production, tea prices remain depressed . For
example, at the Calcutta auction the average price for leaf CTC up to the
end of April was Rs38.49 a kilogram (70.5p), compared with Rs41.07 a
kilogram in the corresponding period of 1991. As for orthodox leaf, the
price has been Rs38.56 a kilogram, down from Rs43.92.
The virtual disappearance of Russian buying earlier in the season is said to
have been the principal reason for the depression in tea prices.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian company leads
Russian gold chase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL Australian company is trying this week to complete the first ever
deal giving foreigners a direct stake in Russia's closely guarded gold
mining industry.
Star Technology Systems, a private consortium led by Mr Ian MacNee, is
negotiating terms with Lenzoloto, a local Siberian gold producer, to buy a
31 per cent stake in all its operations - including the development of the
Sukhoi Log mine, said to be Russia's largest proven hard rock gold deposit.
State-owned Lenzoloto holds exclusive government licences for mining
operations covering 105,000 sq km (40,000 square miles).
It will be a coup in every respect if the deal goes through.
Star, with recommendation from the Australian Embassy in Moscow, last month
overcame a mountain of bureaucratic obstacles and vested interests to reach
this stage of negotiations.
The Russian government, which is anxious to attract foreign investment in
its effort to introduce a market economy, had to overcome fierce internal
wrangling in order to give Lenzoloto the right to negotiate the
participation of a foreign partner.
For Lenzoloto, this represented a considerable triumph: A local producer, it
was able manage its own affairs after decades of tight control from Moscow.
That control was exercised through the centralised monopoly organisation,
Glavalmazzoloto, which dominated the mining and marketing of gold and
precious stones. The organisation, which has since been renamed
Rosalmazzoloto to cover only Russia rather than the former Soviet Union, led
the resistance to the Star project.
Star's achievement so far looks even more impressive considering that
standing behind it is Central Mining Corporation - a listed Australian
company which is also headed by Mr MacNee and which has an option to buy
Star's interest in the joint stock company being set up by Lenzoloto for the
purposes of bringing in badly-needed foreign capital.
Central, which made losses in 1989, 1990 and 1991, was suspended from the
Australian Stock Exchange from November to April for failing to file the
quarterly exploration and working capital reports required by the Australian
authorities.
Its 1991 accounts were delayed because of inquiries which were made by Price
Waterhouse, the auditors. And in December 1991, it had working capital of
only ADollars 75,000 (Pounds 31,000).
These factors do not constitute an argument against Central Mining's
involvement in the project, however. When small exploration companies come
up with a big project, they simply look for bigger sources of financing.
But the fact that such a small company - rather than one of the established
giants of the western gold mining industry - is now negotiating the first
big gold deal in Russia, reflects the difficulties and risks of trying to do
business in Russia.
Two years ago, while big mining companies remained on the sidelines,
apprehensive about gaps in legislation, continuing political instability and
unclear ownership rights, Star began scouring the country for opportunities.
It all began when a husband and wife team came over to work on a deal to
extract platinum from waste left by Russian miners.
Through a combination of luck and coincidence, they also became acquainted
with Mr Boris Yeltsin, who said he would support them if they could find a
partner in the gold business.
It was a bold challenge at a time when Mr Yeltsin, who was still chairman of
the Russian parliament, had not even wrested control of Russian gold
resources from the Soviet leadership.
Two years on, Mr Yeltsin is president and the country's supreme master. His
young government of economic reformers is actively seeking foreign
capitalists in order to underpin its market reforms.
But even now, it is still unclear whether or not the deal will be allowed
too go through.
A government official said legal questions remained over whether it could go
ahead. He also suggested that there could be problems with the price Star
was prepared to pay for the stake, which he put at Dollars 50m.
Part of the problem he explained, was the secrecy that traditionally
surrounded the Russian gold mining industry, which meant that it was 'not
quite clear what Star would be getting 31 per cent of'.
He said Star had managed to get close to the deal because the big companies
had not shown any interest - 'They usually prefer to have a controlling
interest' - while Lenzoloto needed money quickly. He said the government had
not done 'much digging' into Star's background.
Mr Greme Ellis, Central's company secretary said last week that it was too
early to predict the cost of developing the project, but that the deal would
be financed through a mixture of equity and debt.
Central has a shareholder agreement allowing it to expand its capital from
100m shares of 2 cents each to 500m. This implies the ability to raise some
ADollars 80m at last Wednesday's market price of 21 cents, which compares
with the 6 cents at which they were relisted last month.
Mr MacNee said capital increase by Central was one of the options being
considered, if the company was to be involved at all. 'Money is not the
problem, the main issue now is getting the documentation right,' he said.

Papua New Guinea's coffee industry is facing a crisis of confidence, with
overseas buyers threatening to withdraw because of quality problems,
according to Mr Ricky Mitio, chief executive of the Coffee Industry
Corporation, reports Reuter from Port Moresby.
Mitio told reporters that German, British, US, Australian and New Zealand
buyers were increasingly reluctant to place orders. Germany's Jacobs
Suchard, which normally buys about a quarter of the country's export volume,
withdrew last year because of a drop in the quality of premium 'Y' grade
coffee, said Mr David Smith, the corporation's economist.
'Quality has been gradually deteriorating over three to four years,' Mr
Smith said. 'It really reached a low last year. It basically stemmed from a
lot of new, inexperienced exporters.' Mr Smith said a prolonged slump in
coffee prices had resulted in many small growers neglecting crops, while
government officials said some growers now preferred the more profitable,
but illegal, marijuana, which grows wild in Papua New Guinea.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's coffee pot begins
to overflow - Enthusiastic growers have not been deterred by historically
low prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING

<TEXT>
A CHART the length of the lobby of the Association of Indonesian Coffee
Exporters logs the demise of the world price for Indonesia's robusta coffee
from 1985. With London robusta contracts languishing at 22-year lows, space
on the wall has mercifully run out; the price has dropped off the chart.
The response of Indonesia's 1.8m coffee farmers to market forces has been
perplexing: whilst reducing exports in an attempt to hold up prices, they
are expanding production.
The association has forecast exports of coffee at 303,540 tonnes for the
year ending September 1992, down 21 per cent from last year. That would
compensate for relative over-supply of the market the year before: trade
officials say world demand for Indonesian coffee for blending is between
330,000-360,000 tonnes a year.
Between last October and the end of March, Indonesia exported 78,000 tonnes,
and harvesting of the main crop began last month. Production of 476,280
tonnes is forecast this year, continuing the upward trend which has led to
53 per cent growth in production since 1985 making Indonesia the world's
third largest producer. The association forecasts production next year of
511,920 tonnes.
Association officials say Indonesia's 1.8m smallholders, who produce 90 per
cent of the crop, are stockpiling their harvest. Historically, farmers have
normally held between 100,000 and 120,000 tonnes in stock, but by last
October stocks had fallen to 47,880 tonnes. The association forecasts that
stocks will rise to 145,620 tonnes by September.
The bearishness of the international market about robusta coffee has been
exacerbated by expectations of heavy sales from Indonesia over the next few
weeks. However, Mr M. Yahmadi, head of the exporters' association's
production and quality development department, says the farmers will not
rush to the market. 'It is common for our farmers to keep coffee as savings.
When the time comes they will sell, for instance, to go to Mecca'.
The association is also lookly for government intervention to help stabilise
the export market. It has 1,072 members, but only 300 are active and 'making
any money'. A recent agricultural report by US embassy in Jakarta described
the majority of exporters as 'now in dire economic straits'.
The problem is not just the low world market price but competition between
exporters in Indonesia. Despite static domestic consumption at 75,000 tonnes
a year, the association estimates the domestic price of a kilogram of grade
4 robusta coffee at Rp1,650 (81 US cents), as against an fob export price of
80 cents.
'Exporters lose Rp200 per kilo,' says Mr Noer Madjid, the association's
executive secretary, after redrying, handling and bagging costs are
included. The only incentive to export, officials say, is to maintain
customers while waiting for prices to improve.
The association believes that exporters need to be better regulated and last
October set out proposals to government. It wants all traders to register
their exports and to deposit with the association between 10 and 20 per cent
of the value of all export commitments. The greater the quantity committed
to export, the higher would be the percentage of export value deposited.
This is to ensure that exporters do not commit themselves beyond their own
financial resources or beyond Indonesia's production capability.
A government response to the proposal was expected in January, but none has
been forthcoming. Association officials want to implement the plan 'as soon
as possible' and clearly feel frustrated.
The association has also recommended that its members form groups to reduce
competition and enjoy greater economies of scale but the idea has not met
with much response.
Steps are being taken to diversify Indonesia away from robusta coffee, which
accounts for 93 per cent of production. The remaining 7 per cent is of the
milder and more sought-after arabica variety.
A three year trial programme testing high-yielding arabica plants is being
undertaken by the association, particularly for use in the higher altitude
areas of north Sumatra. But weaning farmers away from robusta will take
time. Industry officials expect arabica to increase its share to 15 per cent
of production in the next two years but attaining the target of 25-30 per
cent of the crop may take 'a decade or two', predicts Mr Yahmadi.
The industry says there is substantial room for growth domestically,
although the price of packaged robusta at Rp12,000 per kilogram in
supermarkets puts it out of reach of the average wage earner.
The association's figures give cause for pessimism. Production is forecast
to outstrip international and local demand by 76,920 tonnes next year. This
would leave farmers holding unprecedentedly high stocks of 222,000 tonnes.
The bright spot on the horizon is Indonesia's strong case for a higher quota
if an international coffee agreement is signed. From 1986 to 1990, Indonesia
increased exports to quota countries by 49 per cent and the country now
accounts for more than 7 per cent of the world export market, association
officials say.
Costa Rica is suspending coffee exports indefinitely from today in protest
at low prices on the world market.
Costa Rican vice-president Arnaldo Lopez said the board of the Costa Rican
Coffee Institute, of which he is president, had taken the decision
unanimously after consultations with all sectors of the country's coffee
industry.
Lopez said Costa Rica, which produces three per cent of world coffee
exports, hoped the move would hasten an international coffee agreement.

US TREASURY securities firmed across the board yesterday after a modest rise
in April producer prices left the monetary authorities with room for another
policy ease.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year issue was up  11/32 at 101 19/32 ,
yielding 7.855 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  3/32 at 100
3/8 , yielding 5.154 per cent.
The morning's inflation news was good, with the core producer prices index
rising just 0.2 per cent last month, a slightly smaller increase than
expected. Analysts said that while the data was unlikely to trigger a cut in
interest rates, it did leave the window open for any easing if the Federal
Reserve felt inclined to provide the sluggish economic recovery with some
additional stimulus.
Although the consensus in the market appears to favour an interest rate cut,
analysts said monetary policy was unlikely to be changed until after next
Tuesday's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee.
UK government bond prices rose yesterday following the release of factory
gate price data which suggested that inflationary pressures in the economy
were weakening.
The June gilt futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, opened
at 98.18 and fell to 98.13 early in the session before the inflation data
was released. However, in the afternoon the contract traded up to 98.26
before settling back to close at 98.20. Volume was light at 28,000
contracts.
In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed at 98
23/32 , unchanged on the day, for a yield of 9.04 per cent.
Analysts were encouraged by figures for factory gate prices in April, which
showed a 0.4 per cent rise on the month, well below market expectations of a
0.8 per cent rise.
Prices rose at a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent, from 4.5 per cent in
March, the largest monthly drop in this measure of inflation since 1983.
However, while the figures were encouraging, investors will be paying more
attention to retail price inflation data due to be released on Friday.
THE GERMAN government bond market remained subdued yesterday, with most
market participants waiting for the outcome of the current round of wage
negotiations before committing funds.
Yesterday, IG. Metall, the engineering and metal workers' union, said that
it would decide whether to ballot its 65,000 members over strike action on
May 18.
The June bund future on Liffe opened at 87.18, and drifted down to 87.10 by
mid-morning, in line with other European markets. However, the future rose
though the afternoon session encouraged by the positive tone of the US
Treasuries market and closed at 87.22. Volume was again sluggish at 40,000
contracts.
The benchmark 10-year 8 per cent Unity bond closed at 100.17 for a yield of
7.97 per cent, unchanged from Monday.
The French government bond market consolidated the gains of the last week,
with the yield spread over the German market stable at just over 60 basis
points through the day. The 8 1/2 per cent French government OAT maturing
2002 closed on a yield of 8.57 per cent, also unchanged on the day.
JAPANESE government bond prices were firmer overnight in Tokyo, led higher
by the strong performance of US Treasuries.
However, in the absence of new domestic factors trading remained thin.
Trading in the benchmark bond amounted to just Y112bn.
The benchmark government bond issue No 129 actually fell on the day, closing
on a yield of 5.60 per cent, from 5.59 per cent at the opening. Analysts
said that investors were starting to switch into longer-dated paper. The
issue No 129 matures in June 2000.

ACTIVITY in the international bond market slowed yesterday after Monday's
busy start to the week, with a handful of deals in Australian dollars and
European currencies.
Shell Australia and Coca Cola Amatil both came to the market with Australian
dollar deals which were well-received, helped by the fact that the
short-to-medium end of the market has been relatively .
Westpac, which lead managed Shell's ADollars 100m five-year bond, noted
strong demand for Australian dollar bonds, saying that recent redemptions
have left investors with Australian dollars which need to be reinvested.
The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) launched a DM500m 10-year issue
with a coupon of 8 1/8 per cent and priced to yield 8.22 per cent, or 10
basis points over the September 1991 German government bond.
The IADB issue represents part of the bank's core funding and Deutsche Bank,
the lead manager, said the bonds were bought mainly by domestic investors
given that foreign interest in D-Mark issues is rather limited. The bonds
traded at 99.80 - within fees - by mid-afternoon.
In the French franc sector, SNCF launched a FFr1 bn zero coupon bond, lead
managed by Credit Commercial de France. The six-year bond is fungible with
SNCF's earlier FFr1bn issue. It was priced to yield 8.67 per cent, the same
as the 9.5 per cent OAT due 1998, but 22 basis points over the level where
the first tranche is trading in the secondary market.
The bond was reoffered at the issue price of 58.60 and traded at 58.55-58.65
according to the lead manager. About 35 per cent of the issue was sold to
Swiss investors and 20 per cent to French investors.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: TWA's deal on Chicago hub slots
rearranged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn,
announced yesterday that it had renegotiated a deal with American Airlines,
the much larger Dallas-based carrier, involving the sale of TWA's landing
slots and gates at Chicago's O'Hare airport.
The deal originally formed part of a larger asset sale package agreed
between the two airlines in late 1990. The Chicago slots and gates were to
be sold by TWA for Dollars 70m, and the airline said it would shift
operations to Midway Airport, Chicago's second, smaller airport.
Under the new arrangements, the sale price for the 40 landing slots and
three gates comprises a Dollars 500m zero coupon note payable in monthly
instalments over 20 years. TWA is still talking of moving to Midway,
although, under the new deal, it also retains the right to use one of the
gates. Neither American nor TWA had any immediate explanation for the
changed structure of the deal.
TWA, whose operating losses in the first quarter of this year have amounted
to almost Dollars 100m, has faced opposition to previous asset sales
transactions in the bankruptcy court - notably from the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which has argued that sale proceeds
should be used first to repair TWA's pension plan deficit. The new agreement
is subject to various closing conditions.

BERLITZ, the US language instruction company, yesterday turned in
first-quarter net income of Dollars 4.4m, or 23 cents a share, against
Dollars 5.9m, or 15 cents, a year earlier.
Operating income in the quarter fell to Dollars 4.4m from Dollars 7m, while
sales rose to Dollars 68.3m from Dollars 64.8m.
Macmillan, the US publishing subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC) owned 56 per cent of Berlitz shares. The ownership of this stake is
currently the subject of litigation.
Berlitz's interest income from affiliates fell by Dollars 3.9m to Dollars
1.7m, reflecting payment defaults of the notes from MCC and some MCC
affiliates in the 1991 fourth quarter. MCC has filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code.
Berlitz reiterated yesterday that preferred stock dividends have been
suspended and are not expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
In the 1991 first quarter, the preferred stock dividend reduced net income
available to common shareholders by Dollars 3.1m.

INCREASED volumes, improv-ed market share and higher exports allowed Nampak,
South Africa's largest packaging company, to record increased turnover and
earnings in the six months to the end of March.
Turnover at the Barlow Rand subsidiary was 13 per cent up at R2.21bn
(Dollars 770m), while operating profit was 16 per cent higher at R250.3m.
Improved margins were the result of 2.4 per cent volume growth, improved
productivity, plant rationalisation and tight cost controls.
Attributable profit rose 14 per cent to R123.4m. Earnings per share were 13
per cent higher at 258 cents, while the dividend was lifted 5 per cent to 79
cents per share.
Two other companies in the Barlow Rand group have also reported higher
interim profits. Attributable profits at Tiger Oats rose 13 per cent to
R154.4m, while earnings at Imperial Cold Storage (ICS) were 29 per cent
higher at R30.8m.
Mr Robbie Williams, chairman of Tiger Oats, said the higher profits,
achieved on a 4.4 per cent rise in turnover to R4.4bn, reflected the group's
diverse base, strong brands, and the benefits of upgrading plant and
technology.

<TEXT>
MGM-Pathe Communications has made a non-binding proposal to Orion Pictures
to distribute Orion's unreleased motion pictures and its library products,
AP-DJ reports from California.
MGM said that it would make an advance under a distribution agreement and
provide a line of credit for print and advertising expenses.
In addition, MGM said that its proposal contained an option for it to
purchase the film assets of Orion.
Terms of the MGM proposal were not disclosed.
Orion, which last December filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors, has 10 films ready for release but has lacked the funds to
release them.
An agreement with Orion would give MGM-Pathe films to send through its
existing distribution pipeline. MGM-Pathe needs additional films to release
because its prolonged legal and financial problems have halted production.
MGM said that the proposal, if accepted, would effectively benefit MGM's
distribution infrastructure and would make the most of the value of the
Orion library and also the unreleased motion pictures.
MGM-Pathe is principally owned by Credit Lyonnais following the bank's
recent foreclosure on MGM's stock.

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance (SGS), the world leader in product
inspection and testing services, increased turnover by 17 per cent in the
first four months of 1992, Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, chairman, said
yesterday.
This figure was boosted by the weakness of the Swiss franc against the
dollar and poor business last year due to the Gulf conflict. The chairman
said she faced 1992 with confidence despite the difficult international
environment.
In 1991 SGS boosted revenues by 9.7 per cent to SFr2.2bn (Dollars 1.44bn)
with a 'marginally favourable' contribution from currency movements. Mrs
Salina said the Geneva-based group would continue its policy of balancing
internal growth with acquisitions of small and medium-sized companies
designed to strengthen its core activities.
Ascom Holding, parent of the Swiss telecommunications group, says it plans
to abolish any remaining participation certificates, which have now been
largely converted into registered or bearer shares. Ascom, which had a
consolidated group turnover of SFr3.1bn last year, plans an unchanged
dividend of 14 per cent.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Procordia improves 14% to
SKr1.12bn in first term

<TEXT>
PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group jointly controlled by
Volvo and the Swedish state, announced yesterday a 14 per cent improvement
in profits (after financial items) for the first three months of the year to
SKr1.12bn (Dollars 189m). This compares with SKr928m for the same period of
1991.
But in his final address to shareholders yesterday before he moves on to his
new post as Volvo chief executive, Mr Soren Gyll, Procordia president and
chief executive officer for the past eight years, warned that he did not
expect the past twelve months of strong growth to continue for the rest of
1992.
He added that Procordia would continue with its SKr1.4bn rationalisation
programme so it could regain the profit level of SKr13.20 per share it
enjoyed two years ago before its business merged with the Pharmacia drug
group and Provendor, the food company. Last year Procordia doubled its
profits to SKr4.2bn and a profit of SKr11.60 per share.
Mr Gyll has not disguised his disappointment over the past few days at the
failure of the proposed Procordia-Volvo merger in the face of opposition
from the Swedish state. The compromise agreement entails the government
selling off its entire shareholding in Procordia at the price and moment it
feels appropriate with an increase in Volvo's voting rights in the company
to 45 per cent.
Today Mr Jan Ekberg becomes Procordia president and chief executive officer
in place of Mr Gyll who takes over as Volvo chief executive at the same
time, but who will also take on the chairmanship of the Procordia board. Mr
Ekberg was previously head of Kabi Pharmacia, the group's pharmaceuticals
business.
Procordia's strong performance in the first quarter stems from a
particularly impressive result from Kabi Pharmacia that reported a 22 per
cent growth in sales over the period to SKr3.404bn from SKr2.781bn and a 19
per cent boost in operating income to SKr742m from SKr625m.
The highest growth in sales of 59 per cent and in income was for peptide
hormones with rising sales in Japan and Germany. Ophthalmics, with Healon as
its principal product, increased its sales in most markets, especially Japan
and the US.
By contrast nearly all of the rest of Procordia's businesses recorded falls
in operating income and sales with a 62 per cent drop in operating profits
for its beverages division to SKr13m from SKr34m. A 48 per cent fall in
operating profits in Pharmacia Biotech, was blamed on 'a poor investment
climate for large instruments'.
But the company's food business made a 12 per cent improvement in operating
profits to SKr46m from SKr41m and there was an 8 per cent growth in
operating profits to SKr208m from SKr192m for Procordia's tobacco and
confectionery sectors.

SPAIN'S Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) said yesterday it had signed a general
industrial co-operation agreement with the Belgian utility Tractebel, AP-DJ
reports.
In a short statement, the Spanish bank described the agreement as 'a general
accord on global co-operation in the industrial sector'.
Details on the accord will not be available until the two companies finish
defining the agreement, a BBV spokesman said.
The spokesman was unable to say how the accord would affect Proindesa, the
industrial holding BBV formed in January with Spain's largest private
utility, Iberdrola.
However, in its statement, the bank said it had increased its stake in
Iberdrola to almost 10 per cent from 5.9 per cent 'by virtue of' the accord.
Tractebel has acquired around 3 per cent of Iberdrola since the start of the
year under an agreement to strengthen the ties between the two utilities as
a basis for creating joint ventures.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Hopes of savings may be over-optimistic -
The Battle For Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOPES of Lloyds and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation of making
big immediate cost savings if either of them buys Midland Bank may be
over-optimistic.
That is the implication of a detailed study of European bank mergers by
Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, and Mr Steven Davis, the banking
consultant and founder of Davis International.
Mr Davis argues, on the basis of an investigation of nine mergers involving
big European banks, that shareholders in those banks have benefited only
modestly from post-merger cost cuts.
He says: 'While many European merger partners have largely achieved targeted
savings in staff, branch numbers and overall expense levels, we believe that
most if not all of those economies could have been obtained without the
merger.'
The combination of Algemene Bank Nederland and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank,
which was announced in 1990, was in one sense a model for Lloyds' proposed
bid. It involved the merger of two of the Netherlands' biggest banks, of
roughly equal size, to create by far the largest Dutch bank, now called ABN
Amro.
Mr Davis highlights two hitches in ABN Amro's attempts to make cost savings.
It did not want to make forced redundancies, so was forced to pay more than
projected in voluntary severance packages. Lloyds has also said that it
hopes not to make forced redundancies in meeting its target of reducing
staff numbers at the combined banks by 20,000.
Potential redundancy costs are less of a concern to Hongkong Bank than
Lloyds, since it has relatively small operations in the UK and therefore
would be unlikely to shed staff in great numbers.
ABN Amro also encountered problems in linking the computer systems. It is
unlikely to unify the administration or back office systems till late 1994.
This is relevant to both Hongkong Bank and Lloyds, since both hope to make
savings by unifying their computer systems with Midland's.
As a result of such redundancy costs and systems problems, Mr Davis is 'not
optimistic about the possibility of realising significant net cost savings
(at ABN Amro) in the near future'.
Mr Davis also argues that mergers tend to work better, in terms of
generating additional profits, if the managers of one bank become the
dominant force in the combined banks.
A failure to eliminate managers is costly in itself. But a multiplication of
managers often also leads to delays in the process of making decisions on
how to reorganise and reduce overheads.
Lloyds Bank has to date not spelled out its proposals for top management.
Hongkong Bank is planning to retain most of Midland's senior directors, who
would run Midland as an autonomous subsidiary.
However, Hongkong Bank's directors would fill the senior positions in the
parent company and therefore play the dominant role.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Midland chief eases Hong Kong fears over
offer - The Battle For Midland
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PRESENTATION yesterday by Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland
Bank, to Hong Kong's investment community has left a growing sense that the
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid for Midland can succeed and
that it would benefit the banking group.
Fund managers had expected few revelations. But Mr Pearse provided
reassurance to HSBC shareholders in his commitment to the merger and his
view that the counter-bid by Lloyds Bank stood little chance of passing the
scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
'If the exercise was designed to get Hongkong Bank shareholders to look at
this deal favourably, then I think they achieved this purpose', said one
research director who attended the meeting.
There had been considerable initial scepticism towards the deal from Hong
Kong investors. They were opposed to the dilution of high growth south-east
Asian earnings through the acquisition of a European bank. Suspicions remain
as to the benefits of global banking.
'The arrival of Pearse has helped develop an understanding of Midland by
Hong Kong investors. It also shows he is keen and it shows he gets on well
with the Hongkong Bank', said Mr Peter Philips, portfolio manager at
Fidelity International Investment Management. I can't think there will be
enough opposition to block it. Given the dispersion of shareholdings, if
there was any opposition we would have felt the groundswell by now.'
Fund managers said the meeting provided reassurance that Midland's earnings
cycle was in a strong recovery phase, while Lloyds Bank's interest in
Midland had already helped persuade analysts that HSBC could be on to a good
deal. The HSBC share price reacted favourably to the Pearse presentation,
climbing 25 cents to HKDollars 44.50.
The main concern in Hong Kong remains the possibility of the bank being
forced to sweeten its offer. This will clearly depend on the existence of
concrete alternative bidders.
But analysts took encouragement from the comments of Mr John Gray, HSBC's
deputy chairman, who also attended the meeting. He would not discuss the
possibility of a higher offer, but pointed out that such a move would be
likely to hurt the HSBC share price. This would lower the value of the offer
for Midland, which has now risen to 422p,, compared with 378p when the offer
was announced on April 14.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fenner falls 38% to Pounds 2.3m and halves
pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABSENCE of a recovery in its UK businesses led Fenner, the engineering
group, to halve its interim dividend and to warn of a similar cut in the
final payment. Its share price fell 11p to 86p yesterday.
An uncovered dividend of 1.7p (3.45p) was announced alongside a 38 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 3.71m) for the six months to
February 29.
The UK part of the business, which accounted for about 40 per cent of the
Pounds 97.7m (Pounds 100.5m) turnover, incurred a loss after interest. This
aggravated the problem of unrelieved ACT and the tax rate rose from 53 per
cent to 62 per cent.
After a minority charge of Pounds 685,000 (Pounds 728,000), mainly relating
to the 50 per cent-owned South African subsidiary, earnings per share fell
to 0.41p (2.36p).
Mr Peter Barker, chairman, said power transmission had been worst hit by the
UK recession.
Other UK companies were profitable, including conveyor-belt manufacture
which had been concentrated on Hull after a closure in Scotland.
A further 5 per cent of the UK workforce had been made redundant, bringing
the total cut to 20 per cent - well over 400 jobs. Altogether cost cutting
moves had knocked Pounds 800,000 off operating profit.
One of the group's priorities was to enhance UK earnings, for instance
through acquisitions offering rationalisation opportunities.
About 85 per cent of the Pounds 4m (Pounds 5.63m) operating profits were
made overseas, with South Africa a star performer. Profits held up in North
America, where the fluid power subsidiary had a record order book.
In continental Europe, deteriorating demand in France and Germany had had an
adverse effect on the UK factories. Australia was undergoing its third
depressed year.
Net debt rose from Pounds 30.5m last August to Pounds 38m, gearing of about
60 per cent. Interest costs were nearly Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.37m).
COMMENT
Fenner is showing all the signs of being squeezed for cash. Halving the
dividend will save Pounds 2.5m this year and capital spending has been cut
from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 4m, two thirds of depreciation. Interest cover
has shrunk to roughly 1.5, if you leave out the 50 per cent of the South
African business that it does not own (South Africa accounted for nearly
half of operating profit). Year-end gearing will still be near 60 per cent.
In terms of trading, the most encouraging area is North America. In the UK,
demand in the capital goods sector remains depressed and Fenner will not be
an early recoverer. Meanwhile, continental Europe and South Africa are
deteriorating. A full-year pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 4.5m leaves the
prospective p/e ludicrously high after big tax and minority charges. It
still looks high on a Pounds 7m forecast next year. Dividend support? A
halved total gives a prospective yield of 6.6 per cent, above the market but
not sufficiently so to give cast-iron support.

FT  13 MAY 92 / PepsiCo in snack food joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPSICO and General Mills, the US multinationals, are to merge their snack
foods operations in six European countries, creating a company with annual
sales of Dollars 640m (Pounds 355m).
The joint venture - subject to approval by the European Commission - will
combine PepsiCo's snack businesses in Spain, Portugal and Greece, with
General Mills's snack and biscuit units in France, Belgium and the
Netherlands.
PepsiCo's Walkers and Smiths crisps companies in the UK are not affected.
The new company will rival United Biscuits' KP Foods for leadership in the
Dollars 25bn European snacks market.
No cash was involved in the agreement announced yesterday. PepsiCo will
receive a 60 per cent stake and General Mills 40 per cent in the new
company. PepsiCo Foods International will assume responsibility for
day-to-day management with the partners naming directors in proportion to
their equity.
The venture will employ 4,650 staff and operate eight manufacturing plants
in the six countries. PepsiCo has earmarked Dollars 70m for a manufacturing
plant at Carregado in Portugal; and General Mills is building a Dollars 55m
production facility at Raamsdonksveer in the Netherlands.
Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of PepsiCo's international foods and beverages,
said the businesses were a perfect fit in terms of geographical markets,
technology, distribution systems and product lines.
Products marketed by the venture will continue to be sold under their
existing brand names. Mr Jordan added: 'The combined strength of PepsiCo's
salty and sweet snack production technology and General Mills's expertise in
the grain-based snack and sweet biscuit segments will enable us to provide
European consumers with a wider choice of products.'
Mr Stephen Sanger, executive vice-president of General Mills, said shared
research and development would enable the venture to improve product
innovation - a key to market growth.
It is General Mills's second joint venture in the European food business.
The group formed an alliance with Nestle in 1989 to challenge Kellogg's
dominance in breakfast cereals.
For PepsiCo, the deal is another step in its ambitions to repeat globally
the success of its US snack foods business. Its international snacks
operations extend to 24 countries and are the group's fastest-growing
segment.
In New York yesterday, shares in General Mills rose Dollars  3/8 to close at
Dollars 62 5/8 while PepsiCo fell Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 35 7/8.

FT  13 MAY 92 / News Corp advances 76% to ADollars 334m at nine months
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group, yesterday underlined its
recovery from financial problems with a 76 per cent increase in net profits
to ADollars 334m (Pounds 142m) for the nine months to the end of March.
News Corp said the improvement in profits was largely due to better results
from its newspaper and television operations, offset by disappointing
results at Twentieth Century Fox.
The biggest contributor to profits was an ADollars 170m reduction in
interest expenses to ADollars 728m, reflecting lower interest rates and
falling debt after the group's USDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 4.2bn) debt
refinancing, completed in early 1991.
The reduction in interest expense was offset by an increase from ADollars
11m to ADollars 77m in the group's share of losses at BSkyB and Ansett
Transport Industries, the Australian aviation business jointly owned with
TNT. News Corp also confirmed that BSkyB, the British satellite television
operation in which the group has a 50 per cent interest, moved into profit
in March.
Revenue fell from ADollars 8.3bn to ADollars 7.7bn, mostly due to disposal
of assets and the flotation of a 55 per cent interest in the group's
Australian commercial printing business. Net profits were ADollars 437m,
after taking account of abnormal profits of ADollars 103m, mostly reflecting
the flotation of the Australian printing businesses. Abnormal losses of
ADollars 189m in the comparable period last year reflected financing costs
of debt rescheduling.
The result represents a recovery since the end of the year to June, when
News Corp made a net loss of ADollars 393m after abnormal losses of ADollars
714m. The group forecast 'significant' gains in profits in the current year.
At the trading level, US profits fell 17 per cent to ADollars 655m, on
turnover down 1.3 per cent to ADollars 4.8bn. News Corp said the lower
figures reflected the sale of nine consumer magazines in June, together with
foreign exchange gains in the earlier period. UK profits increased 158 per
cent to ADollars 275m, reflecting the transfer of satellite broadcasting
losses to BSkyB and a 49 per cent improvement in profits from the newspaper
division.
Profits from Australia and the Pacific basin increased 4 per cent to
ADollars 259m, helped by a 12 per cent improvement in profits at the South
China Morning Post in Hong Kong.

FT  13 MAY 92 / BP sells Canadian stake for CDollars 374m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum, in the wake of disappointing results last week, is
selling its 57 per cent stake in its Canadian subsidiary BP Canada for
CDollars 374m (Pounds 174m).
The move marks BP's withdrawal from oil and gas business in North America,
apart from ventures in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. BP has been in
Canadian oil exploration since 1953.
Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration, said the sale was a
further step in the process of rationalising and focusing the company's
exploration and production activities.
'We have to make choices, on a worldwide basis, about the allocation of the
resources we have available,' he said.
The sale follows disposals of BP's Houston-based subsidiary Tex/Con last
year, and of its stake in the Canadian Hunter joint venture in British
Columbia earlier this year. It will be lead-managed by RBC Dominion
Securities.
Shares will be priced at CDollars 13, to be paid in three instalments over
the next two years. Analysts said yesterday it could eventually represent a
book profit of around Pounds 100m.
BP Canada has been reorganised in the past three years into a focused oil
and gas business with significant interests in the deep gas fields of the
Western Canadian Basin. Its gross reserves are 40m barrels of oil and 743bn
cu ft of gas.
Total market capitalisation at the current market price is CDollars 688m. A
wholly-owned subsidiary of BP, BP Canadian Holdings owns 56.94 per cent of
issued shares.
BP disappointed the stock exchange last week with an 80 per cent drop in
first-quarter profits on a replacement cost basis - insufficient to cover
its dividend.
When stockholding losses are taken into account, the company made its
first-ever quarterly loss, of Pounds 61m, compared with a Pounds 10m profit
a year earlier.
Analysts said the BP Canada sale was consistent with BP's policy of
divesting its North American interests and concentrating on more significant
projects in fewer countries.
The sale will also help to ease BP's heavy cash flow burden.
BP shares gained 5p to 257p in London yesterday, although analysts said this
was largely on the back of a rise in New York.

FT  13 MAY 92 / M and S profits rise 1.3%: Group damps hopes of imminent
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS and Spencer reported a 1.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last
year as it successfully defended its operating margins in severe trading
conditions but damped immediate expectations of a consumer-led recovery.
The international clothing and food group warned it was still experiencing
'no upturn in UK consumer spending' and plans to close 25 more stores at its
loss-making Canadian operations by the end of January.
In the year to March 31, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 615.5m to Pounds
623.5m on sales 2 per cent higher at Pounds 6.36bn.
Store sales in the UK fell 0.6 per cent to Pounds 4.92bn as the company lost
market share due to discounting by competitors.
However, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, said M and S
had refused to buy extra sales by cutting prices and was in a strong
position to attack when confidence recovered.
'The biggest difference between us and our competitors is that we have sold
goods at full price and full margin. Their attempts to build their sales
have been at the expense of their profitability,' he said.
M and S pre-tax figures were held back by exceptional costs of Pounds 46.9m
(Pounds 16m) relating to M and S's voluntary redundancy programme in the UK
and rationalisation of its Canadian operations.
Stripped of these, pre-tax profits advanced 6.2 per cent to Pounds 670.4m as
M and S reined in costs, made productivity gains and lifted operating
margins from 11 per cent to 11.7 per cent.
Mainland Europe showed good growth and the up-market Brooks Brothers chain
in the US and Japan improved its profitability. But Kings Super Markets in
the US and the group's three Canadian businesses again disappointed.
After swallowing an extraordinary charge of Pounds 29.8m relating to the
goodwill write-off and loss on the anticipated disposal of its Canadian
Peoples Division, M and S reported a slight rise in earnings per share to
14.8p from 14.7p.
A proposed final dividend of 5p will lift the annual pay-out by 6.4 per cent
to 7.1p.
The company's shares rose 1p to 331p.
Mr Mark Husson, retailing analyst at Warburg Securities, said: 'This result
must qualify as a rabbit out of a hat. M and S could not buck the trend in
terms of absolute demand but it could improve its performance because of its
accelerated productivity growth.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / EC monitor team pulls out from 'dangerous' Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community monitors withdrew from Sarajevo yesterday, declaring it
was too dangerous to remain in the war-torn capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Although local Serb leaders later declared a five-day unilateral ceasefire
in Bosnia, the EC monitors' pull-out signalled pessimism about peace
prospects in the breakaway Yugoslav republic.
Serb irregulars, backed by the Yugoslav federal army, yesterday again
pounded the capital, where the main television transmitter was knocked out.
The army also continued to bombard the south-western city of Mostar, while
Croat and Serb militias fought for control of a swathe of territory
bordering Croatia.
The ceasefire, due to start at 6am today, was called by an unofficial Serb
parliament at a meeting in Banja Luka, north-west of Sarajevo.
The Serb leaders called on the EC to renew its Yugoslav peace conference
before the five-day ceasefire came to an end. If the EC failed to act, local
Serbs would appeal to Serbs throughout the world to join them 'in their
struggle for survival', they said.
The EC pull-out coincided with other steps to isolate Serbia in an attempt
to increase pressure for peace between the warring Yugoslav ethnic groups.
The 52-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe decided in
Helsinki to exclude the new Serb-dominated Yugoslav state from any decisions
taken on Bosnia. Russia had earlier rejected excluding Yugoslavia from the
CSCE.
In addition, the US withdrew its ambassador from Belgrade, the Serbian
capital, to protest at Serbian involvement in Bosnia. EC foreign ministers
agreed to withdraw their ambassadors from Belgrade earlier in the week.
More than 1,300 people have been killed, and more than 500,000 displaced or
made homeless since the federal army attacked Bosnia after it was recognised
by the international community six weeks ago.
In London, Lord Carrington, chairman of the peace conference on Yugoslavia,
said he was increasingly pessimistic about any successful outcome of the
conference. He said: 'It looks even more unlikely that, in the present
circumstances, a peace conference would be successful.'
Lord Carrington rejected secret talks held last week between Bosnia's Serb
and Croat leaders in which they planned to divide Bosnia, eventually
annexing parts of it to Croatia and Serbia.
He said this was 'basically a carve-up of Bosnia-Hercegovina and that, of
course, would be quite unacceptable to the Community because it leaves the
Moslems, who are the majority, out in the cold'.
In Geneva, a UN envoy described Bosnia as 'a state of horror.'
Mr Jose-Maria Mendiluce, an official at the UN's High Commission for
Refugees, said: 'What we are seeing is something like the Second World War
with population centres being destroyed and towns and villages attacked, not
as military objects, but with the sole purpose of driving the people away.'
In Croatia, there is growing concern that the federal army, which still
controls parts of eastern Croatia, is deliberately delaying the deployment
of UN peace-keeping troops in the region.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Foreign Affairs: America's blurred borders - Brazil is
sharply divided between rich and poor and has surprising similarities to
society in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flying from the US to Brazil last week, I expected a complete contrast: from
north to south, First World to Third World, wealth to poverty, Anglo-Saxon
protestantism to Latin catholicism. But one should always beware such simple
categories. In Brazil, what did I find? First, I arrived in a city, Sao
Paulo, which has 2m more inhabitants than Los Angeles and is at least
comparable in the area it covers and the size of its buildings. Whenever you
think you are getting near the edge of it, another clutch of skyscrapers
appears on the horizon.
Much of Sao Paulo seems pure First World to the casual visitor. The streets
and flyovers are thronged, or often choked, with Fiats, Volkswagens and
other 'European' cars (all made in Brazil, one soon learns). There are bank
headquarters in clusters of blue glass towers. There are areas for
pedestrians spaghetti junctions, leafy residential quarters. The metro
(underground) is clean, modern and fast - suffering only from a lack of maps
inside the carriages.
For two and a half days, I listened to bankers, management consultants, bond
brokers, academics and the state governor, all discoursing on inflation
accounting, the difficulties of the recession, the chances of the
government's economic strategy succeeding, and the origins and nature of the
foreign capital now flowing into the country. They discussed the signs of a
change in Brazilian mentality as privatisation even of sacred cows like
Petrobras (the state oil company) is widely debated, imports of goods and
capital are welcomed, and the successes of other Latin American countries -
Mexico, Chile, Argentina - are increasingly publicised and envied.
Of course, I knew that this was not the whole story. Although beggars in the
street are not much more numerous in downtown Sao Paulo than in London, the
favelas or cardboard cities of Sao Paulo are far more extensive. About 1m
people live in these shanty towns which are dotted all over the city, though
often crammed inconspicuously into narrow strips, underneath a flyover or
beside a railway track, constantly invaded by noise, fumes and other forms
of pollution. Another 3.5m live in corticos (crowded, multiple occupancy
buildings).
On the third afternoon, I got Father Patrick Clarke, an Irish Catholic
priest who has worked for 15 years in the city, to take me to the favela of
Vila Prudente. It is a surprisingly cheerful place, probably because it is
one of the older favelas (dating from 1978). The 8,000-10,000 inhabitants
have at least had time to convert their shacks into rudimentary houses, and
to develop some institutions of their own, such as a creche and a handicraft
centre.
It reminded me of Palestinian refugee camps where, with a minimum of help
and leadership from outside, the inhabitants have usually constructed some
sort of township, with its own economy and society. And, of course, these
Brazilians are also refugees, in a sense: refugees from the abject poverty
of the rural north-east which makes even their present way of life seem
privileged.
At least here they are not starving. The alleyways and schoolrooms are full
of children, who infect you with their cheerfulness until you remember that
for many of them the future holds little prospect other than drugs and
crime.
Families are large, but have decreased over the last few years. It is now
common for women to have their fallopian tubes tied after the third or
fourth child, whereas in the past families of 15 were not unusual. Although
this operation is still officially illegal, it is sometimes performed by
doctors without the knowledge or consent of the woman herself.
More often, though, it is the fruit of a conscious decision on the woman's
part, as the old rural logic of having more children as an insurance for
your old age is replaced by the new, urban one of not having more than you
can cram into your tiny home, or feed from your pitifully low income.
This explains why the latest census reveals Brazil's population to be 'only'
145m (still more than 10 times what it was in 1900) instead of the expected
150m, and why the annual rate of increase has fallen to 2 per cent. That is
still a very daunting figure, but should make it easier for President
Fernando Collor de Mellor to confront the issue at next month's UN summit on
environment and development ('Eco92'), which he is to chair. Unprecedentedly
for a Brazilian politician, he wrote in a newspaper article last week that
he intended to give the population issue priority, and would himself take
the initiative in raising it at the summit.
The Catholic church, much blamed by First World social theorists for its
hostility to birth control, does not seem to be actively opposing this
change of attitude among the urban poor. And in any case, it is not the only
or perhaps even the main conduit for their religious feelings.
Father Patrick sees his role as more political than religious in the
traditional sense. He quotes Dom Helder Camara, the much revered (and
reviled) archbishop of Recife in the north-east - 'if I give bread to the
poor they call me a saint; if I ask why they have no bread they call me a
communist' - and says that his role is to help people ask and find answers
to that second question. He is also full of praise for Sao Paulo's socialist
mayor, Mrs Luiza Erundina, who has helped favela dwellers to set up housing
co-operatives and move into proper homes - 'an achievement any municipality
should be proud of yet scarcely mentioned in the mainstream Brazilian
media.'
'That spire,' says Father Patrick sadly, pointing at a church some half mile
from the favela, 'is very far from these people, culturally and
economically'. By contrast, the new pentecostalist protestant churches
proselytise actively in the favelas, preaching a fundamentalist gospel
without political overtones, and winning a substantial following.
Perhaps Brazil is not so different from the US after all. Per capita gross
national product is not everything. Both countries are settler-colonial
states which expanded to occupy the lion's share of their respective
continents. Both have federal presidential constitutions which give great
prestige to the head of state but rather little power, whether to push
legislation through congress or to control the expenditure of states and
municipalities. Both are wrestling, partly for that reason, with intractable
public sector deficits - although the inflationary consequences in Brazil
are much more drastic, and the recession much deeper. Both have very high
income disparities between rich and poor, and an urban underclass
increasingly given to violence, mainly against itself, but enough to make
the rich flee into their own fortified suburban ghettos. Both feel
ambivalent about celebrating the fifth centenary of 1492, because they
contain remnants of indigenous peoples for whom that date marks the
beginning of centuries of expropriation and genocide.
One important difference seems to be that Brazil, after 50 years of
sheltering behind protective barriers, is now opening to the outside world,
whereas the US, after 50 years of confident world leadership, shows
increasing signs of insecurity and xenophobia. But then the US is plagued by
a trade deficit, while Brazil is running a handsome trade surplus.

While we're talking about interfering newspaper barons, Lord Stevens's
annual bash for the great and the good at the Savoy Hotel yesterday wasn't
quite up to scratch. There was nothing wrong with the guest list. Everyone
from the Daily Telegraph's Conrad Black and the BBC's Michael Checkland to
Chris Patten and Kenneth Clarke turned out to listen to the United
Newspapers' proprietor.
But why was Stevens handing out free copies of the Pick of Punch? Not only
has he himself just closed the 150-year-old satirical magazine, but the book
is published by one of his arch rivals, Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins.

Leaving aside an over-powering belief in Britain's Conservative party, it
would seem that on certain key issues the Daily Mail's 66-year-old publisher
Viscount Rothermere is less in tune with his own paper than with its
gutter-press rival, The Sun.
He and it both support the Archbishop of Canterbury's attack on greedy
executive pay rises - which is more than can be said for the Daily Mail
itself.
'It is not surprising that the churches are so empty when the leadership of
its priesthood is intellectually so mediocre and so out of touch with the
mood of our times,' opined the Mail on Monday.
Yesterday, it was forced to publish a prominent letter from its proprietor -
who supplements his Pounds 359,000 salary with the earnings on his Pounds
200m-plus family fortune - distancing himself from the Mail's criticism of
the archbishop.
Meanwhile, the archbishop may be heartened by being told by a Sun editorial
that 'if we cannot have Savonarola or Billy Graham, you are the next best
thing'. Pretty profound stuff.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The drift and indecision afflicting German government makes itself felt in
ever-widening circles. Take the annual conference of German tax accountants
in Wurzburg this week.
Wilfried Dann, president of the accountants' professional association, has
been railing at the growing legal uncertainty plaguing his industry. He has
totted up that it is now 16 months since an income tax directive had been
classed as a 'final decision'. Instead, the relevant authorities have taken
to pushing out directives invariably qualified as 'provisional'.
The problem, he concedes, starts with the Karlsruhe constitutional court,
which has a backlog of two years or more on key tax decisions. This
encourages the accountants to lodge appeals on related cases, which might
one day qualify for tax relief.
So the tax inspectors attempt to stem the flood of appeals by issuing a
counter-flood of provisional memoranda to clarify existing law. Worse and
worse, the authorities in the various German Lander issue conflicting
'clarifications'.
The result is an appalling cat's cradle for the accountants to sort out. One
almost feels sorry for them.

Paris' mayor Jacques Chirac is determined to get to grips with the one
enormous stain on his reputation for city management. He has declared war on
his city's 200,000-strong canine population.
For the past nine years, Paris' front-line defence has been its squadron of
green and white motos crottes. With an estimated 10 tonnes of dog dirt
dumped daily on the city's 2,500 km of pavements, Chirac's pooper scooters
have been kept on round-the-clock alert. Armed with vacuum tubes, they buzz
around schlurping up every little mess in sight. But, as with painting the
Forth Bridge, the problem piles up anew behind them.
However, the time has come, says Chirac, for the citoyens to take a stand.
His officials cannot let the bill for running the motos crottes - FFr 43m a
year - rise any higher.
So those Parisians who dare lift their eyes from the pavement should not be
fooled by the delightful new posters by cartoonist Ronald Searle round the
city, one showing a desperate owner on his knees, begging his dog to use the
gutter. The propaganda is just a diversion.
Chirac's most potent weapon is a new list of fines of up to FFr 1,300 for
owners of naughty dogs. Not only are the fines considerably tougher than
comparable penalties in London and New York, but they also put the
fastidious Swiss to shame.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Shadow boxing in the Labour ring: The leadership contest and
signs of schism in opposition thinking are delaying a far-reaching
post-mortem says Ivo Dawnay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Just a month after its humiliating fourth successive election defeat and
only days after a drubbing in the local authority polls, the Labour party is
still proving fiercely resistant to deep-rooted change.
A few fragile green shoots of new thinking have sprouted as to how the party
should address its future. But for each there are numerous party
traditionalists cautioning against further revision of long-held
orthodoxies.
It remains unclear whether Labour is ready, able or willing to take the
steps necessary to reverse what some think might be a trajectory of
permament decline - or for that matter to decide what those steps should be.
Evidence of disarray came last Sunday when a tentative olive branch from Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, met a chorus of public criticism
from senior Labour figures. Despite this some are known privately to support
the significant strand in the party now favouring a measure of inter-party
collaboration.
Increasingly, there are signs of a profound schism between the 'one last
heavers', who advocate only a fine-tuning of policy and party institutions,
and the radical reformers, some of whom want not only a Lib-Lab electoral
pact but even a review of Labour's historic commitment to wealth
redistribution.
The traditionalists cling to Harold (now Lord) Wilson's definition of
Labour's objectives as 'an irreversible shift of wealth and power in favour
of working people'. But the reformers counter that such goals merely confirm
an outdated Marxist world view that threatens Labour's survival.
A prime example is Clause Four of Labour's constitution - the controversial
commitment to state control of the means of 'production, distribution and
exchange'. The traditionalists argue that to reopen the debate on what is
largely now a symbolic clause would court unnecessary internal strife.
Others, like Mr Frank Field MP, say that tackling such anachronisms is
essential. 'Some say leave it alone as it is only symbolic. But the whole
point is that the public understands symbols. That is exactly why we should
discuss it.'
With the election for leader and deputy leader in full swing, Mr John Smith
and Mr Bryan Gould, the two contenders, are eschewing such controversies and
concentrating on how best to woo the two main strands of party opinion
without offending either.
In consequence, the perennial struggle for party unity is postponing a
root-and-branch post-mortem that addresses the reservations of the
electorate. One senior frontbencher, close to the Smith camp, recently
remarked that the serious rethinking of the party's future would only come
in about 18 months, possibly within two years of the next general election.
Two parallel though interlinked debates are now in train. The first attempts
to address reforms to the party itself, in particular the role of the
unions: the second centres on Labour's goals and policy agenda. Both are
highly influenced by how the party interprets its recent defeats.
For some, like Mr John Edmonds, the GMB general union leader, the election
result was a profound disappointment but not a disaster. Labour gained more
than 40 seats, he has pointed out, cut deeply into the Liberal Democrat vote
and was within 1,000 votes of victory in 17 - enough to have missed a hung
parliament by an ace.
For that reason, he cautions calm. Union representation at the party's
annual conference could be retained at a lower level, he says. It could be
'democratised' by rule changes requiring delegates to be directly elected by
co-workers, free from the control of the union leadership. The union role in
Labour's electoral college could go altogether.
In the past four years, he argues, Labour discarded unpopular policies, but
concentrated too heavily on damage limitation. Now it needs to improve
presentation, get off the defensive and explain its agenda more clearly.
'Do we need a radical reappraisal of policies?' Mr Edmonds asked. 'For God's
sake, what do we campaign on if we abandon an element of redistribution,
support for the public services, individual workplace rights and equal
opportunities?'
But to the radical reformers, such prescriptions are seen as Micawberism
gone mad - a recipe for further decline that fails to acknowledge the
profound changes wrought by the Thatcher years. The new social landscape,
they say, has sharply eroded collective loyalties and promoted individualism
in a way that forces Labour to address its appeal not to the community as a
whole, but direct to the citizen.
They point out that in a deep recession Mr Major managed to hold the
Conservative vote steady at 42 per cent, leaving Labour more than seven
points adrift. To the party's horror, polls showed that the increase in its
so-called core votes - council tenants, unskilled manual workers and the
unemployed - was less than among affluent professional voters.
Advocates of profound change say that without a reassessment of the party's
paternalist view of the citizen's relationship with the state - indeed of
the very nature of what a modern political party should be - Labour will end
up as no more than an anachronistic pressure group for the industrial north,
the Celtic fringe and the underclass.
At an election post-mortem seminar, the Labour Co-ordinating Committee - a
group representing reformers in the constituencies - concluded that the
party was now widely identified with the vested interests of the state
sector, dominated by the public sector unions.
The adoption of a positive attitude towards the market and a readiness to
embrace changes in the management of the welfare state were now a
prerequisite for victory, it decided. 'At the moment, we make voting for
Labour sound like an act of altruism,' Mr Mike Craven, the LCC secretary,
said.
Where, then, do the two leadership contenders stand between what might be
not unfairly be caricatured as the blue-collar traditionalists and the
smart-suited radicals? The answer is: catering to both. As Mr Tom Sawyer,
the National Union of Public Employees deputy leader and influential head of
Labour's home policy committee has put it: 'They are setting out their
stalls to where they think people are, not where they think they ought to
be.'
Supporters of Mr Gould, the long-shot challenger, are keen to present him as
both left-wing and reformist. But his differences with Mr Smith are often
more of tone and style than of substance.
Charges that his advocacy of devaluation represents a reversion to the
outdated politics of the 1970s are firmly denied. Mr Gould insists that
while he is pro-Europe he is also determined that the progress to a single
currency should embrace a continent-wide debate as to how to achieve it,
while also securing full employment, a minimum wage and employees' rights.
All that is aimed at the old left. To the new radicals, his claim is that he
has a breadth of imagination and an appeal to the south of England that Mr
Smith lacks.
In Mr Smith's camp, initial irritation at the audacity of Mr Gould's
challenge has turned to relief. It has allowed the shadow chancellor to
rebut charges that the leadership was being decided by union bosses in
smoke-filled rooms. He has pledged to reduce their future role in the party
more swiftly than might otherwise have been the case.
To meet criticism of his tax plans from the party's reformist wing, he has
offered a full-blown review of tax and benefit policy through a new
Commission on Social Justice open - as would be Labour's current review of
electoral systems - to other interested parties including the Liberal
Democrats.
Arguably more important as an indicator of his alertness to Labour's
predicament are Mr Smith's observations that the challenge is to reconcile
the interests of the two-thirds of society that are relatively well-off with
those of the one third that is not. His analysis attempts to address the
thorniest question for Labour: the resistance of modern income taxpayers to
make sacrifices for the poor.
Both leadership contenders veer to the radical reforming wing of the party,
claiming that everything except Labour's commitment to redistribution is
open to challenge. But the left-wing candidates contesting the deputy
leadership, Mr John Prescott, the transport spokesman, and Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the shadow chief secretary, both reject as defeatist any
accommodation with the Liberals or adoption of electoral reform. One
front-bench critic, however, comments: 'It is all very well for Prescott to
boast about how they love him in Hull; what he needs to explain is why they
hate him in Harlow.'
Ultimately, this question of Labour's sharply differing appeal north and
south of the Wash to Severn line is far more crucial than bickering over the
merits of proportional representation or the value of a deal with the
Liberal Democrats even if these issues must, eventually, be addressed.
Of the more prominent shadow cabinet members, only Mr Tony Blair, the shadow
employment secretary, has dared raise the crucial issue of whether Labour
has adequately addressed 'a tide of history' that is altering the
relationship between citizen and state. The Conservatives have already laid
a claim to the title of champion of consumer interests. To be credible, many
believe, with Mr Blair, that Labour must leapfrog them.
The best of the Kinnock legacy - the decline of dogmatic leftism and
factional politics alongside the party's new-found determination to win  -
have all helped build Labour's credibility. Mr Smith, as the all but certain
next leader, will be well-placed to add to that achievement not least by
virtue of his authoritative yet pragmatic personality. What is more, a
phalanx of Labour MPs - many of them frontbenchers, Scots, or new arrivals
from the April election - believe above all in preserving the unity achieved
over the past five years.
But in the bitterness of defeat, Labour's discipline and cohesion is again
at risk. To reverse its electoral decline, the shadow chancellor must
skilfully forge an alliance not merely between the 'one last heavers' and
the advocates of more deep-seated change. To achieve that end and to win
over millions of disenchanted Conservatives, many now believe he must
abandon Mrs Beckett, his preferred candidate for deputy, and harness Mr
Gould to the cause.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Leading Article: More housing choice needed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not always easy to reconcile choice and ownership, the two central
themes of the Conservative manifesto. Last week's Queen's Speech included
details of rents-to-mortgages schemes designed to give a further boost to
home ownership. Yet with the housing market mired in a depression and
mortgage repossessions at historically high levels, increasing choice in
housing should now be the priority.
The growth in home ownership over the 1980s has been impressive. The number
of owner-occupied homes has risen from 11.5m in 1979 to 15.5m last year,
1.4m acquired by council tenants under right-to-buy legislation. The
incentives to become a home owner are attractive, with tax breaks for
owner-occupiers and discounts for council tenants who buy their homes. The
result is that 67 per cent of UK homes are owner-occupied, one of the
highest levels of home ownership in the EC.
The government now proposes a measure to encourage a further growth in home
ownership among council tenants whose income is too low to benefit from the
right to buy law. Rents-to-mortgages schemes offer tenants part-ownership of
their homes for payments no larger than their current rents. They can either
buy the rest in the future, or cash in their share on selling the home.
However, pilot schemes have not been raging successes - despite the
considerable cost of selling the idea to tenants. In Basildon, for example,
of 6,000 tenants eligible, just 264 have applied for the scheme, and only 36
sales have been completed, with about 50 more in the pipeline. The tenants
the schemes are aimed at are entitled to better discounts if they wait until
they can afford to exercise their right to buy.
Housing insecurity
In any case, it is arguable that home ownership is reaching its limits in
the UK. The surge in repossessions last year suggests that many people who
cannot afford it have been tempted into owner-occupation. With almost one in
10 mortgage-holders more than two months in arrears with payments, the
growth in home ownership appears to have brought an alarming degree of
housing insecurity.
Yet for many people, there is little alternative to home ownership.
Privately rented accommodation now accounts for 7.5 per cent of homes and
has been in decline for 70 years. There has been a pause in the decline in
the last year, which may be attributable to the ending of rent control and
security of tenure in the 1988 Housing Act. But the depressed housing market
has also been a factor, forcing people to rent out homes they cannot sell
when transferred to new areas and encouraging would-be buyers to rent until
house prices stabilise.
Pressing need
The choice of 'social housing' - subsidised rented accommodation provided by
local authorities or housing associations - is just not available for many.
Access is rationed by lengthy queues, and moves within the sector between
areas are almost impossible. Increasingly social housing has become a ghetto
for the aged, the jobless and low earners who cannot afford to buy their
homes.
The pressing need is to widen choice by reviving the rented sector. And
while some of this can come through the housing associations, financial
institutions should be encouraged to support the private rented sector. Yet
the only incentive available to developers - the badly targeted Business
Expansion Scheme - is to be abolished next year.
New tax incentives may be needed to redress the balance between home
ownership and renting. For example, exempting rented property from capital
gains tax - in the same way as owner-occupied housing - would improve the
long-term return on owning rented property. And treating rents as trading
income rather than investment income would allow landlords to claim more tax
allowances and set business losses off against them.
Such incentives would require additional resources which should be found
from the subsidy paid to owner-occupiers through mortgage interest tax
relief. It is time to tilt the balance somewhat away from home ownership in
order to widen choice in the housing market.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Management: The French connection / Charting the dealings of
Japanese companies with Parisian protectionists and finds they are getting a
warmer welcome these days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since General de Gaulle insultingly described one Japanese prime
minister as a transistor salesman, France has had a schizophrenic attitude
to Japanese investment.
Yet it hosts more Japanese factories than any European country except
Britain.
A year ago, corporate planners in Tokyo were scratching their heads over the
protectionist and anti-Japanese remarks of Edith Cresson, France's former
prime minister. More recently, the new premier, Pierre Beregovoy, has been
trying to convince the Japanese that they are, after all, welcome in France.
Which one really represents French policy; the hostile Cresson or the nice
Beregovoy?
The experience of three very different kinds of Japanese investors in France
 -Canon, the office equipment group, Nissan cars and Ajinomoto, the food
processor - suggests that the truth is somewhere in between.
Japanese - indeed any foreign - investors are welcome, so long as they do
not disrupt local competition. Several lessons for newcomers can be drawn
from the 10 years or more that each company has spent in France.
First is the power of the industrial lobbies, which are strongest in
telecommunications, cars and electronics. The civil service is sensitive to
them, employs some of their top people, and exerts an all-pervasive
influence.
Nissan and Canon found local partners to guide them through the system,
while Ajinomoto got on by striking a joint venture with a pillar of the
French industrial establishment.
Second, government policy switches are only a brake on foreign companies,
rather than a deterrent to them. They are seen by Canon as a costly irritant
and offered by Nissan as one reason why France has missed the wave of
Japanese investment in European car plants.
'The political changes just make us hesitant,' says Hiroshi Nakamura, who
recently became president of Richard-Nissan, the Japanese group's French
distributor.
Despite the difficulties, the trio are increasing their commitment to
France. They say they are there for the long-term, rather than making a dash
in under trade barriers.
Canon, for example, opened its European research centre in Brittany last
month, which it claims makes it the first Japanese manufacturer to have all
its functions represented in France.
Nissan has just bought control of its French distributor, while Ajinomoto
and its French partner, the Lafarge Coppee subsidiary Orsan, plan to open a
new Italian plant in Venice to make animal food protein supplements.
They are not alone. Elsewhere, Sony has opened its fifth plant in France,
Hitachi will in July open a disk-drive centre in Orleans, and Toyota is
planning to take a minority stake in its distributor.
Getting into France was the least of the three investors' problems. The
French administration welcomed Canon to Liffre, Brittany, in 1983, because
government attempts to create a French-owned photocopier industry had come
to nothing, says Jacques Le Gall, an adviser to Canon France.
Since then, Canon has followed a classic Japanese step-by-step investment
pattern. Starting with local assembly of imported components, it has built
up a broad base of local suppliers and has set up a club to keep them up to
date on its rigorous quality requirements.
Local content is around 60 per cent and Canon recognises it is politically
advisable to keep it high, says Le Gall. The new research centre in Brittany
completes the chain.
Canon's difficulties began in 1987, when its electric typewriter production
in Brittany was subject to European Community anti-dumping duties on the
grounds that it contained a high proportion of dumped components.
More seriously, Canon found it impossible to get government approval to sell
its facsimile machines in France, a product that faces competition from
politically-influential French companies like Alcatel, Matra and Sagem.
The reason given again was not enough local content. It was at that point
that the Japanese group head-hunted Le Gall, an adviser to the then regional
development minister.
Canon had to export its French- made fax machines for two-and-a-half years
until mid-1989, when the government was at last satisfied that the local
content was high enough to sell faxes in France.
Inside the plant itself, Canon has found it surprisingly easy to persuade a
mainly French workforce and management to adopt Japanese methods, such as
total quality control and consensus decision-making.
Instead of reacting to fast decisions from the top, French executives have
had to get used to making their own input to a very slow decision-making
process, says Le Gall.
Out of the 750 staff at Liffe, 30 are Japanese, mostly in management. The
French staff have adapted well: the plant is 97 per cent as efficient as its
counterpart in Japan and more efficient than Canon's German operation.
Nissan's experience is similar to Canon's; years of frustrating resistance
from officials, but a harmonious relationship with French staff and
customers.
Its entry to France started in the early 1980s when the Japanese company
appointed a French distributor, Jean-Pierre Richard.
At first, Nissan wanted a 34 per cent interest in the new company,
Richard-Nissan, but the government refused. 'They never gave us a reason,'
recalls Akinari Okabe, marketing director.
Nissan waited until 1986, before taking 9.55 per cent, below the threshold
then needed for official clearance.
Then, three years ago, Richard told Nissan that he wanted to retire and sell
his 72.09 per cent stake to the Japanese car group.
Nissan was granted permission to buy last summer, with no conditions
attached.
'The atmosphere has dramatically changed since that agreement,' says Okabe.
Nissan's path was also eased by getting Societe Generale, a leading French
commercial bank, to present its case.
With that hurdle out of the way, Nissan is now setting about transforming
its French dealer from a small company with 'one man top-down management' to
a group where responsibility is widely spread, says Nakamura.
Since Richard's retirement, the group has brought in four Japanese managers
to join the 250 staff, heading up new departments, from sales to marketing
and personnel.
So far, the French staff are taking well to the change, says Herve de
Villeplee, Richard-Nissan's vice president.
Ajinomoto's 19-year-old joint venture with Orsan never experienced such
bureaucratic teething problems.
This could be because the market for animal food protein is free, with no
government interference, argues Alain Crouy, chairman of Eurolysine, the
joint venture with Orsan.
The French partners reckon they have benefited from adapting Ajinomoto's
production methods to their jointly-owned plant in Amiens, which has
increased productivity by a third in three years.
They have kept a French union structure and workforce, but the management is
split equally between Japanese and French staff. 'What we try to do is to
marry French creativity with Japanese methods,' says Crouy.
On one thing all three agree. France has been getting less protectionist
over the last decade as the government has become anxious not to fall behind
on foreign investment of all kinds.
The door may be swinging open. But the trio's experience shows that an
inside track to the establishment is still useful, whether it be a
head-hunted government official, an influential bank or a joint venture
partner.

The last thing one might expect to find in a remote town deep in the Amazon
jungle is a karaoke bar full of Japanese singing 'My Way' in broken English.
But the song at least is peculiarly appropriate. Tome-Acu, the oldest
Japanese colony in Amazonia, is being studied increasingly as a possible
model for the sustainable development of the world's largest rainforest.
In the closing weeks of the rainy season the small muddy town of Tome-Acu,
seven hours by dirt road from the nearest port, looks an unlikely success
story. Initially, all that marks it out is a preponderance of banks and the
Japanese faces behind the wheels of mud-splattered Beetles hurtling between
potholes.
But Tome-Acu has shown that through flexibility and good management it is
possible to progress from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture in
the Amazon without mass deforestation.
Established in 1929 with the arrival of 43 families from Japan, the colony
has seen numerous highs and lows as prices of its cash crops fluctuate on
world markets. But it has survived through continuous adaptation and crop
diversity.
Its beginning was hardly auspicious. Sponsored by a Japanese textile company
as part of a wave of immigration to relieve population pressure at home and
provide needed agricultural labour in Brazil, attempts of the first arrivals
to establish a cacao plantation were thwarted by inexperience and lack of
capital.
Instead of making money and returning to Japan as they had planned, they
resorted to subsistence farming of rice and beans.
A co-operative was formed to try to market products brought from Japan such
as tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers which were not known in Brazilian
households.
Over the next decade another 325 families and 128 single men arrived, but
many left because of economic crises or fell victim to malaria. By 1942 only
98 households remained.
The community was on the verge of bankruptcy when it discovered its miracle
crop - black pepper brought from Singapore. As the Second World War
disrupted pepper production in Asia, prices rocketed. By 1961 the small
colony was responsible for more than 5 per cent of total world production.
Tome-Acu's prosperity was brought to a sudden end in the late 1960s by a
combination of declining world pepper prices and a fungus which attacked
pepper plants.
Many people left and those that stayed had learnt an important lesson. 'We
have never again depended on a single crop,' says Kozabura Mineshita,
director general of the co-operative.
Although the community did not abandon pepper it began introducing other
crops such as passion fruit, rubber, melon and oilpalm.
Today, the 180 farms of the co-operative produce around 40 crops. Jorge Ito
is typical, growing seven crops on his 200-hectare farm in a mosaic of crop
systems, native forest and secondary forest regeneration.
Ito interplants short-lived plants such as papaya and passion fruit which
take only two years to grow with longer-life crops such as pepper. Rubber
and cacao grow together, the rubber trees providing necessary shade for the
cacao. He has started growing berries for natural colour dyes, acerola, a
fast-growing, cherry-like fruit, and kale for cattle feed. 'This way we
spread our risk,' explains Ito.
However such a system - involving heavy use of nutrients to prevent soil
exhaustion - requires considerable capital investment and management
techniques which may make it difficult to copy.
The co-operative set-up has facilitated access to credit, machinery and
techniques, employing two agronomists. There is considerable interchange of
information with working groups for each crop.
The current low pepper price of only Dollars 850 a tonne with no short-term
prospect of improvement means passion fruit has now taken over as the
colony's main crop, producing 1,285 tonnes last year.
With a Dollars 900,000 loan from the Amazonia Bank last year the
co-operative set up a factory to process tropical fruit into pulp and then
freeze it to be used for juices and ice creams on both the domestic and
export markets. 'We decided that the only solution was to stop being a
producer of primary materials which will keep us forever backward. Rather
than supplying industry we must begin processing ourselves,' says Mineshita.
They are focusing on three fruit: passion, acerola and cupuacu. Passion
fruit was chosen because it already has a market in the US and Europe,
although the co-operative's only contract is with a fruit juice company in
Sao Paulo because it does not yet have sufficient production for export.
Acerola is native to Brazil and its high vitamin C content (around 50 times
that of an orange) has made it popular in Japan. The co-operative is hoping
to develop a market in Europe and is currently negotiating with a French
company as well as in Korea, Portugal, South Africa and the US.
Cupuacu is a hard, coconut-like fruit with a coating of brown dust on the
outside and an interior of fleshy white fruit with a strong aroma. The fruit
is unknown outside Brazil but Mineshita is hoping this will change through a
deal recently struck with American non-profit organisation Cultural Survival
International.
'It is crucial for these communities to get control over production. In
studying agriculture in the Amazon there has been over-emphasis on technical
roadblocks and under-emphasis on capital, marketing and processing which is
where the game is really won or lost,' says Christopher Uhl, a biologist at
Penn State University who has been studying the colony.
The co-operative is now concentrating on increasing production and testing
other fruits such as baricuri and graviola. The stress is always on quality
through continuous testing and selection of the best plants.
According to Evandro Kikuchu, deputy factory supervisor: 'The risk is, if we
develop markets for these fruits, that other people will begin to produce
and saturate the market causing the price to fall. We know the survivor will
be he who produces best quality.'
The focus on native Amazonian fruits may win points from ecologists but the
real motive is economic. 'We know we cannot compete with the south where
they have advanced technology and access to market, so it is better to
concentrate on native fruits,' says Mineshita.
'If we fail our only option will be to use our land for pasture or
woodcutting which will destroy the forest.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Management: Talking turkey on foreign language lessons /
Picking and choosing from the many training programmes now on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention foreign language training and most Britons still flinch.
In despair, many managers spend thousands of pounds on training programmes
they have not seen or tried, nor evaluated to see whether they meets the
needs of staff.
Some send employees on lengthy courses without any idea of the value of the
training to either the individual or the company.
This lack of quality control is endemic in British business, according to
Stephen Hagen, curriculum director for languages at the CTC Trust, the
government initiative to bolster industry's involvement in higher education.
He has co-edited a new book* setting out guidelines for companies planning
to buy language training packages. 'Too many companies are adopting a
'quick-fix' approach,' says Hagen, 'while failing to apply the normal rules
of purchase to language services as they would to, say, buying a computer
system or a company car.'
The wide variety and styles of language training means that the potential
purchaser faces a vast array of choices.
A typical corporate response to language training would be:
to send for some well-advertised tapes;
to hire a French student to teach a lunchtime class;
to send staff along to the local college;
or to expect staff to learn in their own time and at their own expense.
For Hagen, this type of response is irrelevant and can even be damaging.
'All our competitors in other countries are now pursuing integrated language
strategies and it is important that we follow suit,' he says.
Hagen recommends that companies establish a formal language training policy,
setting out the objectives and including a specific budget.
A company should also undertake a 'language audit' to gauge the language
learning abilities of existing personnel. Linguistic aptitude tests,
available from the Open University and from colleges affiliated to the
Export Language Training programme, would play a part in this to determine
how long tuition for individual employees would take and the consequent
cost.
The savings for a company pursuing a qualitative approach can be enormous.
Using data from the Australian government, Hagen has calculated the average
time it takes business people to reach a set level of language skill. A
'slow-track' learner can take 210 hours to reach the same 'survival' level
in a European language as it can take a typical 'fast-track' student to
reach in 75 hours. At a training cost of Pounds 40 per hour, the difference
can be a staggering Pounds 5,400 per employee. If the language is Japanese,
the difference can be 300 hours.
There are other issues to be considered.
Should the training be conducted on- or off-site?
Should it be condensed or given on a continuing basis?
What are the abilities of the teaching staff and are they relevant to
commercial needs?
At the end of it all, return on investment should be measured.
With the debate in continental Europe now centring on which third of fourth
foreign language should be studied, Hagen says that it is time for the era
of consciousness-raising over language training in the UK to move on.
'The message is slowly getting through. The debate now is about quality of
training, about how individuals can best be utilised and how companies can
get value for money.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Value promised in DoE Canary Wharf
decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR assurance that any decision by government departments to rent office
space in Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development or elsewhere in London's
Docklands would be taken on 'strict value-for-money grounds' was given by Mr
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, in the Commons last night.
During the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech he was closely questioned by
Labour MPs about reports that the government was about to throw a lifeline
to the troubled property developer.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary and a candidate for the Labour
leadership, said it was quite remarkable that the 'white knights' who
appeared to be riding to Olympia &amp; York's rescue were Mr Howard and Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The two departments they controlled - environment and trade and industry -
were apparently contemplating paying 'very large sums in rent to Olympia &amp;
York for otherwise unlettable office space'.
Mr Gould recalled that it was Mr Heseltine who initiated the London
Docklands Development Corporation 'and invested so much of his reputation in
its success'.
Denying that there was any 'mystery' about the decision to consider renting
office space in Docklands, Mr Howard said it was well known that the
building occupied by the Department of the Environment in Marsham Street,
Westminster, was to be demolished.
Mr Howard said that, according to the advice given to ministers, the best
value for money now available was in Docklands, although not necessarily in
Canary Wharf.
'We will make our decision on the basis of the best value-for-money
available,' he said.
The government secured a majority of 31 (323-292) to defeat a Labour attack
on its environment and education policies in the Commons last night.
Liberal Democrat and Ulster Unionist MPs joined with Labour in the first
challenge to the government since it secured an overall majority of 21 in
last month's general election.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory seeks probe into Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TORY backbencher yesterday supported Labour calls for a full public
inquiry into alleged insider dealing, financial mismanagement and corruption
at the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, who is himself a Name, said
that the sooner such a step was taken the better. 'The fact is we are
investors and the market has been found seriously wanting,' he said.
Mr Marland is a member of a number of syndicates managed by Rose Thomson
Young and Gooda Walker, which are expected to produce some of the worst
results in the insurance market for 1988, 1989 and 1990.
His remarks came as other Conservative MPs responded furiously to
suggestions made by Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath, that the crisis
at Lloyd's could result in the government losing its 21-strong Commons
majority.
Mr Hain said in an early day motion that this was because 23 Conservative
MPs could face individual bankruptcy and disqualification as a result of
their membership of catastrophe syndicates with losses totalling hundreds of
millions of pounds. If 'even half' of the 23 - including several ministers -
were indeed declared bankrupt, the government could lose its majority. It
subsequently emerged that one of those referred to in the motion was no
longer an MP.
Several of those pinpointed by Mr Hain yesterday denied that they faced
bankruptcy, while a number questioned either his motives or the accuracy of
his information.
Mr Archie Hamilton, a junior defence minister, dismissed any notion that he
might be made bankrupt. 'The sort of money that I am losing is not something
that would cause me serious financial embarrassment,' he said.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, said the prospect of having to
relinquish his seat for the reason suggested by Mr Hain was 'nil'.
Mr Henry Bellingham, MP for Norfolk North West, attacked Mr Hain for
publishing the motion, describing the action as 'a gross misuse of the
Commons order paper'. He added: 'I am in no danger of going bankrupt.'
Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme, said: 'It is a very cheap party
political publicity stunt. I am not on any syndicate that could be described
as having catastrophic losses.'
Lloyd's criticised Mr Hain's motion on the grounds of 'faulty methodology'.
Lloyd's pointed out that Mr Hain did not take into account the fact that the
23 backbenchers he named are members of many other Lloyd's syndicates which
will make profits in 1989 and 1990 as well as loss-making catastrophe
reinsurance syndicates.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Extension likely on ITV takeover
ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID MELLOR, national heritage secretary, has agreed to consider further
a proposal to extend the moratorium on takeovers of ITV companies until the
end of 1995.
Central Independent Television has been campaigning against moves to relax
the rules on overseas stakes in Britain's independent television companies.
The rules could in theory allow companies elsewhere in the EC to buy all or
part of ITV after the end of next year. In most other EC countries there are
barriers to takeovers of television networks by foreign companies.
UK takeovers, which are subject to the approval of the Independent
Television Commission, are blocked until the end of next year. Mr Leslie
Hill, chairman of Central, wrote to Mr Mellor last month calling for a
two-year extension of the moratorium. Mr Hill argued that EC rules governing
television takeovers were unlikely to become fair before 1995.
Mr Mellor, whose responsibilities include the media, replied that he was not
yet convinced that an extension requiring primary legislation was justified.
The government is preparing a complaint to Brussels about barriers
preventing British companies from acquiring television organisations abroad.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs urge swift move on Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS faced calls to provide a 'mini-lifeboat' for Maxwell pensioners
from a cross-party group of MPs which met yesterday.
As a first step, Mr Richard Page, Tory MP for Hertfordshire South-West, who
convened the meeting, and Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social
security committee in the previous parliament, are to seek urgent talks with
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary.
If necessary they are ready to appeal to Mr John Major, the prime minister.
More than 60 MPs attended the meeting at which many Labour and Tory MPs
expressed anger at the plight of the pensioners.
The MPs have also called for an immediate government statement or time for a
debate so that ministers' positions can be clearly set out.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office minister and the MP for Watford,
proposed that the group should make contact with lawyers to see what legal
actions might be taken.
The MPs were particularly concerned about pensioners who worked for
companies other than Mirror Group Newspapers.
There are fears that some of these pensioners could lose all their pension
money from the end of this month. The case of the Headington pension fund
was especially highlighted.
The renewed pressure on ministers came as Mr Major confirmed that the
government had alerted social security offices to be aware of the need to
put emergency support from the benefit system in place if necessary.
Among the offices reminded within the past month of the support available
was the Leeds office, which is expecting to deal with many Headington
pensioners.
Mr Page said that a majority of the meeting endorsed the call for a
government examination of ways of keeping the pension funds alive 'until
this tangled web is unwoven and we know where we are'.

<TEXT>
WHODUNNIT? Was it Sir Robert Fellowes, HM's Old Etonian private secretary,
wielding a quill pen in his book-lined office overlooking Buckingham
Palace's garden?
Or was it some ambitious young Scottish speechwriter in Mr Douglas Hurd's
office, distractedly dreaming of an exotic posting?
The great royal storm in a porcelain teacup has all the Edwardian flavour of
a game of Cluedo. But hopes of a republican plot to undo the monarch's
political neutrality were quickly dashed.
As the buck of responsibility about the early briefing on the Queen's speech
to the European Parliament was passed around the high offices of government,
it became obvious that blunder, not malice, lay behind the row.
As early as Monday night, Buckingham Palace was saying that the offending
language - most crucially words suggesting that the different parliamentary
traditions of the EC states were insignificant - was Whitehall's work.
The prime minister's office first said that the speech was all the Palace's
doing, guided by the Foreign Office and shown to Downing Street as a mere
courtesy. But it changed its tune yesterday morning.
It conceded that briefing papers misrepresented the sentiments the speech
would express. In short, it was the Foreign Office poorly reporting its own
text.
After all, Downing Street said, when the speech was delivered, from the
original text, it was differences in the 'style' of national parliaments
that were deemed insignificant, not their traditions or practices.
In 30 years' time, when the Cabinet papers are finally published, one can be
sure that it will be some redfaced ambassador who will choke with
indignation on his whisky and soda when he reads the authorised version.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Paper industry seeks boost for
recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S paper industry risks destruction from imports unless its raw
material costs are reduced through increased recycling, the British Paper
and Board Industry Federation warned yesterday.
It said mill closures, job losses and increased imports of finished paper
were inevitable unless the government acted to increase the supply of paper
for recycling.
The federation called on the government to introduce levies to discourage
the disposal of recyclable paper in landfill sites. Similar measures in
Germany and France have increased the supply of paper for recycling and have
pushed raw material prices down.
Mr Dermot Smurfit, president of the federation, said raw material costs in
the UK, which account for 55 per cent of the cost of making paper, were
between 300 per cent and 400 per cent higher than in Germany. Mr Smurfit is
joint deputy chairman of Jefferson Smurfit, the paper and packaging group.
The federation said legislation on recycling would be popular in the UK. A
Mori poll showed that 89 per cent of the public supported legislation
forcing shops and offices to collect and sort waste paper and cardboard for
recycling.
The federation has launched a campaign to encourage commercial organisations
to re-cycle waste paper and cardboard. He added that only 30 per cent of
paper in the UK was recycled compared with 60 per cent in Germany - and the
UK proportion was falling.
Falling continental prices meant that companies in the UK could no longer be
expected to pay for their waste paper, Mr Smurfit said. The shortage of
recycled paper meant that companies were being forced to import from the
Netherlands and Germany, and the UK was the largest importer of finished
paper in the world.

MINISTERS should not quote selectively from Christian principles in support
of government policies if they wanted to have moral authority, Dr George
Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday.
In a rare speech in the House of Lords, Dr Carey added that it was against
Christian teaching to emphasise individual rights without referring also to
the individual's duty to society, and said that public morality could not be
privatised.
His speech comes soon after he aroused controversy with a sermon in which he
criticised businessmen who awarded themselves big pay rises during the
recession.
'All of us are commanded to love our neighbour and to subordinate ourselves
to the service of God and of other people,' he said yesterday.
'To emphasise individual rights without acknowledging individual and social
responsibilities to others is contrary to Christian teaching.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major to ride out Euro-storm - How
the government is facing the renewed debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTORY does not carry with it the assurance of tranquillity. His success on
April 9 left Mr John Major as strong a prime minister as any in recent
history. But the mild hysteria which gripped some Conservative MPs this week
over the Queen's comments to the European parliament was a timely reminder
that he will not be immune from occasional squalls.
There was nothing remarkable in the sovereign's speech, though the very fact
of its delivery marked again the prime minister's break with his
predecessor. The balance she struck between the role of the European
Community in securing permanent peace in western Europe and the need for
national diversity was entirely consistent with her government's stance.
Even the garbled precis of her remarks released by Downing Street on Monday
went little further than to recognise the enhanced authority which the
Community and the European parliament secured at the Maastricht summit.
In politics, however, language, perceptions and timing are often more
important than substance.
Tensions building in a small but vocal section of the Conservative party
over the Maastricht legislation always threatened dissent if there was any
suggestion that the Queen was siding with the Euro-enthusiasts. The idea in
Downing Street's briefing that she would downplay the significance of
national parliaments guaranteed a row.
If there is a single thread linking the Euro-sceptics within the
Conservative party, it is their jealousy of the prerogatives of Westminster
and their disdain for Strasbourg.
The timing of her visit - linked to Britain's forthcoming presidency of the
Community - was also unfortunate. The Maastricht treaty legislation is due
to be debated in the Commons next week so the Euro-sceptics had anyway been
marshalling their forces.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher had let it be known at the start of the week that a
speech she plans to deliver in The Hague on Friday will include as scathing
an assault on the federalist cause as in her Bruges speech four years ago.
The former prime minister's fellow travellers in the House of Commons - who
met last night at the Carlton Club to refine their tactics - have been
seeking to muster support among Conservative MPs in the lobbies and bars of
Westminster.
So the Queen's appearance on the Strasbourg stage - Mrs Thatcher refused to
contemplate a visit by the sovereign to an institution she holds in scarcely
concealed contempt - was a catalyst needed to push those tensions into the
public domain.
Despite Mr Major's assurances that Maastricht would not allow the Community
to usurp the authority of British MPs, there are more un-welcome headlines
to come.
Mrs Thatcher's influence has been diminished by her departure from the
Commons, but her speeches on Europe play still to receptive media.
There will also be not insignificant rebellion when the Maastricht
legislation is voted on. The best estimate at present is that about a dozen
Conservative MPs will oppose it and perhaps half that number will abstain.
The figures could rise.
In theory that could comfortably rob Mr Major of his majority of 21.
In practice the present disarray in the Labour party - it has not yet
decided on its stance and may well abstain on the substantive vote - and
likely support for the treaty from the Liberal Democrats appear set to
guarantee the prime minister a comfortable majority.
Yet even for a prime minister who has proved himself supremely adept at
filling the philosophical divides in his own party, there is no such thing
as a quiet life.

FT  13 MAY 92 / British Rail holds up the Euston Stagecoach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRAIN arriving at London Euston's Platform One from Aberdeen every
morning is the first regular privately operated passenger service to run on
British Rail since nationalisation in 1948.
But some things never change. The inaugural train, bearing public transport
minister Mr Roger Freeman as passenger of honour, pulled in yesterday in
much the same fashion as any ordinary BR train: 12 minutes late.
In fairness, no blame could be attached to Stagecoach, the entrepreneurial
bus operator providing the service. So far, its two carriages are merely
appended to BR's existing sleeper service, so passengers remain at the mercy
of BR timekeeping.
Stagecoach stepped in when BR decided to drop seat-only accommodation on
night trains between London and Aberdeen. It has taken over the seat-only
carriages, repainting them in its own livery.
Hostesses provide Stagecoach customers with a free hot meal in the evening,
unlimited soft drinks and beverages (but strictly no alcohol) through the
night and a bap with butter and jam for breakfast.
Some fares are lower, too. BR charges Pounds 57 for a one-way ticket between
London and Edinburgh, plus Pounds 25 for a sleeper berth. The price for
Stagecoach's seat-only tickets, which can be bought from BR, is Pounds
33.50.
On the inaugural run the worst advertisement for de-regulation turned out to
be the minister himself. Under close questioning, Mr Freeman confessed that
he had slipped away from the private-sector part of the train to grab a few
hours' rest in the comfort of a public-sector sleeping compartment.
'I've got a full day's work in front of me,' he remarked, somewhat testily.
'I am 50 years old and I didn't feel like sitting up all night.'

BRITAIN'S biggest power station - Drax in North Yorkshire - may be forced
out of business by the end of the century, according to National Power, the
privatised electricity generator which owns the station.
Drax, which supplies enough power for six cities the size of Liverpool, is
on the River Ouse near British Coal's Selby colliery complex. National Power
argues that Drax could be priced out of the new electricity market if
negotiations with British Coal over coal pricing cannot be resolved.
Mr Mike Grasby, manager at Drax, warned that the station could be switched
off most of the time because of tough competition from gas-fired power
stations.

CONTINUED pit closures in Nottinghamshire would have a 'devastating' effect
on the economic and social life of the county, the North Nottinghamshire
Training and Enterprise Council (Tec) warned the government yesterday.
It called for a national energy policy based on the use of coal as a
strategic fuel.
This is the first political intervention by a Tec, 82 of which have been set
up to bring training closer to the needs of the private sector and to foster
business growth.
'Everything we do on the training and enterprise front can be negated by a
rapid reduction of the (coal) industry,' said Mrs Pat Richards, chief
executive of North Nottinghamshire Tec.
The stand taken by the Tec reflects disquiet in the region's business,
voluntary and political circles about the plans of - and for - British Coal.
Nottinghamshire County Council has this week published its coalfield
strategy for this year. It opposes coal imports and urges support for
deep-mined coal.
The council and the Tec are to put pressure today on Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, when he visits pits in the county. They will seek assurances about
the future of the local mining industry under whatever organisation emerges
after privatisation of British Coal. The council and Tec are seeking a
meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to urge a
review of coal policy.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Braque and Picasso lift market: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE art market received a boost in New York on Monday night when Christie's
sold 91 works from the collection of the late Bill McCarty-Cooper for
Dollars 21.5m, (Pounds 12m), with an important late (1952) work by Georges
Braque, 'Atelier VIII', making Dollars 7.7m.
The other exceptional painting in the auction, 'Compotier et Guitare' by
Picasso, went to a private US buyer for Dollars 3.85m. Not only did these
two important paintings find buyers, but spirited bidding ensured that the
auction was 95 per cent sold by value. Mr Christopher Burge, president of
Christie's in the US, said the results were 'tremendous, sensational'.
Christie's was fortunate in offering a collection with an excellent
pedigree.
It had been put together by Douglas Cooper, a friend of Picasso and Braque
and one of the greatest collectors of 20th century art. In 1949 Cooper
adopted McCarty-Cooper, then aged 25, who inherited the collection on
Cooper's death in 1984.
Many of the paintings were acquired directly from the artist. In the case of
the Braque this included the provision that the work should never leave
France.
In addition to offering fresh paintings of undoubted quality, Christie's had
the advantage of dealing with a deceased estate. That helped to ensure that
reserves and estimates were kept low to encourage bidding. Three years ago,
at the height of the art boom, the Braque might have sold for nearer Dollars
12m and the Picasso Dollars 10m.
'Guitare sur une Table' by Juan Gris sold for Dollars 1.485m, slightly below
estimate, and another Picasso, 'Homme a la Sucette', for Dollars 968,000.
Both went to US collectors. A Giacometti sculpture in bronze, 'Buste de
Diego', almost doubled its estimate at Dollars 935,000.
This was the first successful auction for two years in the troubled
Impressionist and modern art sector. It will give confidence to the market,
but the very high quality of the works makes it untypical.

FT  13 MAY 92 / European blow to equal pension rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN for equal pension rights for men and women in the UK suffered a
setback yesterday. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg gave a
preliminary opinion that European Community law does not require equal
treatment between men and women in National Insurance contributions.
The advocate-general's opinion in a case brought by the Equal Opportunities
Commission is not binding on the full court, which will give a final
decision later. In most cases the court upholds the advocate-general's
opinion.
The EOC said it was disappointed by the opinion. It had sought a declaration
that the UK government was in breach of an obligation in the EC social
security directive to give equal treatment in statutory social security. To
qualify for a state pension in the UK, men must have paid National Insurance
contributions for at least 44 years. But for women the figure is 39 years.
After the age of 60 women may not make any further NI contributions. But
working men between the ages 60 and 64 must pay NI contributions even if
they have already contributed for 44 years.
The advocate-general's opinion is in stark contrast to recent European Court
decisions on equal treatment in the employment and pension fields. In the
Marshall case in 1986, the court ruled that women in public-sector
employment had the right to remain in work until the same age as male
colleagues.
In the 1990 Barber case involving occupational pension schemes, the court
ruled that men and women should receive equal pensions as well as equal pay
for equal work. The stumbling block in the present case appears to be that
the social security directive specifically permits member states to
differentiate between state pension ages for men and women - though it also
sets out a number of aspects of state pension schemes where equal treatment
must apply.
The advocate-general concluded that where a member state has a fixed pension
age differing according to sex, it 'may still derogate from the principle of
equal treatment laid down in the (social security) directive . . . unless
such unequal treatment of men can be eliminated by the national court
without unduly jeopardising the coherence or financial equilibrium of the
national social security system concerned'.
The government has already announced its intention to move towards a common
state pension age.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Mystery madonna
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An amateur collector yesterday issued a challenge to the art world, claiming
a painting he bought for Pounds 360 is a Raphael. If genuine, the painting
could sell for as much as Pounds 10m. Without expert endorsement it would
fetch no more than thousands.
Amid tight security and considerable secrecy, the Madonna And Child,
pictured above with a security guard, was revealed to the world at a London
hotel by Timothy Benoy, solicitor for Lester Winward, who owns the painting.
Mr Winward did not attend.
However, Nicholas Penny, the only Raphael expert yet to examine the
painting, immediately dismissed it as the work of a copyist.
Mr Winward, a Cheshire businessman who wants to sell the work, responded
later by saying the tests he had carried out were the same as those used
last year by Mr Penny to authenticate a Raphael owned by the Duke of
Northumberland.
The painting, bought in 1981 at an auction at Leeswood House, near Mold,
north Wales, bears a strong resemblance to part of Raphael's Sistine
Madonna. Mr Benoy said research suggested the picture might have come to
England in 1636 as a purchase by Charles I, a keen art collector, or as a
gift to his queen from the Vatican.

FT  13 MAY 92 / TUC moves to avert row over recruitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Trades Union Congress were yesterday trying to avert a fresh
row over inter-union recruitment which could jeopardise the admission of the
electrical section of the newly formed Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union to the TUC.
Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC, yesterday wrote to all
unions involved saying that the AEEU had agreed not to go ahead with a
merger between its electrical section and Cabin Crew '89 while TUC-led
discussions were continuing.
Cabin Crew '89 is a 5,000-strong union of airline cabin-crew staff which
broke away from the TGWU general union.
The TUC hopes that the engineering section of the AEEU will veto any move by
the electrical section, formerly the EETPU, to take Cabin Crew '89, or any
other disaffected union splinter groups, into membership. Both sections of
the AEEU are voting on TUC membership next year.
Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the electricians' section, responded
to a sharply worded statement from Mr Bill Morris, general saecretary of the
TGWU, by saying they would not allow other unions to run their affairs. Mr
Morris had warned the TUC that unless it took firm action to stop the merger
the TGWU would have to consider its own future in the TUC.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Auditors face radical shake-up of their role:
Standard-setting body proposes enlarged report - Clear opinion on a
company's chances of survival to be included
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS will be required to comment on whether a company can survive for at
least one year after its financial statements are approved, in a radical
shake-up of their role proposed yesterday by the profession's new
standard-setting body.
The Auditing Practices Board is proposing that from early next year all
annual company reports should contain a substantially enlarged audit report
giving an unambiguous opinion on the financial statements provided by a
company's directors.
Details of the initiatives are in the first three draft documents produced
by the board, which was created early last year. Mr Bill Morrison, board
chairman, said: 'This is equivalent to trains moving from narrow gauge to
wide gauge and coming out of a different station altogether.'
Two of the new statements provide detailed standards for part of the
statutory audit of all limited companies. They would fundamentally alter and
lengthen the text of the report provided in accounts.
The first addresses the issue of whether the company is a 'going concern' -
to determine whether it is able to survive for a period of at least one year
beyond the period to which the latest accounts refer.
Auditors would be required to assess more actively the directors' view of
their company as a going concern and use their judgment to identify
'material matters' such as inadequate borrowing facilities, litigation or
significant debts falling due.
They would also be required to look forward up to one year after the period
to which statements refer, well beyond the timescale demanded under existing
guidelines.
The second statement deals more generally with the format of the audit
report. It says the report should be addressed to the shareholders and state
the date on which the opinion is expressed.
It should describe and distinguish between the responsibilities of the
directors for the preparation of the financial statements and the
responsibilities of the auditors to express an opinion on these statements.
It would have to contain a clear and unequivocal opinion on the financial
statements.
The third statement lays out the roles of the Auditing Practices Board. It
has 18 voting members, including nine who are not practising accountants.
The document says the board will issue two forms of document in the future:
statements, which are mandatory, and practice notes, which represent best
practice on emerging issues.
The new standards establish six types of opinion with which the auditors'
report can conclude:
Unqualified opinion - no emphasis: the financial statements give a true and
fair view.
Unqualified opinion - with emphasis: the statements give a true and fair
view but are affected by 'fundamental uncertainties'.
Qualified opinion - partial disclaimer: all evidence reasonably expected to
be available to the auditors has not been obtained and evaluated.
Qualified opinion - disclaimer: the evidence has not been obtained and the
effect is sufficiently material to make the statements as a whole
misleading.
Qualified opinion - disagreement: the statements are not prepared in
accordance with accepted accounting principles or do not give a true and
fair view, but the effect of the disagreement does not make the statements
as a whole misleading.
Qualified opinion - adverse opinion: the effect of the disagreement is so
pervasive that the statements as a whole are misleading.
The documents are open for comment until August 31, and the board aims to
issue standards in the autumn applying to companies with year-ends after
December 31 this year.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, surprised the teaching establishment
yesterday by appointing Professor Stewart Sutherland, a leading university
administrator, as chief inspector of schools in England, Andrew Adonis
writes.
The chief inspector's powers were greatly increased earlier this year,
giving control over the expanded - and soon to be semi-privatised -
inspection regime for schools. Prof Sutherland will take up the post in
September. A philosopher of religion, his career has been largely spent in
academic posts and university administration.
The appointment of an outsider was criticised by teachers' unions.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said: 'It shows
that the inspectorate is going to be no more than an administrative
machine.' The government released an extra Pounds 4.4m yesterday to help
councils upgrade facilities in schools.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Water companies told to improve metering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER COMPANIES have been warned by the industry's economic regulator they
must make metering cheaper, fairer and simpler for customers, who are too
often deterred by unreasonable installation charges and unfavourable
tariffs.
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, has written to the companies
emphasising that they must bring metered charges into line with other
charges. Metered customers have been found in some cases to be paying more
than those without meters for the same amount of water.
Metering is likely to become much more widespread as the present charging
system, based on domestic rates, is phased out by the end of the decade.
All customers have the right to a meter, and Ofwat believes that many should
benefit by controlling their consumption.
Mr Byatt said: 'The choice of a meter must be made easier for customers,
particularly those on low incomes and living alone, for whom current charges
are disproportionately high by comparison with their actual use of water.'
Mr David Gadbury, the industry's spokesman on metering, rejected the Ofwat
criticism. He said customers who chose metering were likely to make savings,
and the industry was making 'every effort' to extend metering.

<TEXT>
VAUXHALL, with second-biggest sales of new cars in the UK, has told dealers
it sees no reason to adjust prices in the wake of last week's critical
report from the European Commission.
The study of car prices found large differentials between countries for some
models at certain times between January 1988 and January last year.
According to the EC report five carmakers - Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda and
Audi - had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per
cent in one of the five time periods selected.
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said it had
'serious reservations' about the validity of some of the EC analysis.
Mr David Wallis, Vauxhall director of business planning, said it was 'hard
to accept the EC report, or to reconcile its detailed findings with the
alleged 'high-price' character of the UK car market'.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Council swaps case is settled out of court

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH COURT action in which Hammersmith and Fulham Council in London
faced a Pounds 2.94m claim by the US Chemical Bank over two interest rate
swap transactions was settled out of court on undisclosed terms yesterday.
A deal was agreed after only two days of what was expected to be a
seven-week Commercial Court hearing.
Opening the case for Chemical Bank last week, Mr Richard Southwell QC had
said that the bank's policy was not to deal with rate-capped authorities. It
would not have entered into the 1988 swaps deals with Hammersmith if it had
known the council was trading for profit and acting as an intermediary for
two capped authorities in London - Haringey and Camden.
The case was the fifth of six test case actions to be settled out of court.
A hearing has been fixed to decide whether new lead actions should be chosen
to determine key issues in the swaps litigation between banks and local
authorities.
Mr Justice Hirst is to hear argument on June 8 as to whether further cases
should be selected and, if so, which ones.
In July last year, six lead actions were chosen with the aim of deciding key
points and enabling the remainder to be resolved without recourse to the
courts. Five of these settled and the sixth, between NationsBank, of North
Carolina, and Hammersmith and Fulham Council, began last week and is still
being heard.
Mr Justice Hirst said there were still 196 live actions involving several
dozen banks and a much larger number of local authorities.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Terminal plan will fly in face of local opposition: The need
for expansion at London's main airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fifth terminal at London's Heathrow Airport is an important but only
partial step towards giving the London region capacity to meet passenger
demand forecast to rise from just over 60m people this year to 170m by 2016.
Although BAA, formerly the British Airports Authority, yesterday tried to
focus attention on its plans to build the Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m terminal
at Heathrow, it conceded that it would have to consider building a second
terminal at Stansted Airport in Essex to cope with passenger growth in the
next century.
The Civil Aviation Authority also believes a new runway will be necessary in
the south-east soon after the turn of the century. A working party is
studying possible sites for the additional runway, which many in the
industry believe is likely to be built at Stansted.
But the fierce public debate and local opposition traditionally provoked by
airport expansion has forced BAA to adopt a softly-softly approach to its
long-term plans for its London airports.
Local authorities reacted strongly to BAA's announcement. They fear that the
new terminal would increase the number of flights at Heathrow, cause even
greater noise and disturbance and worsen traffic congestion on the
over-crowded M25 and M4 links to the airport.
However, for BAA and the air transport industry as a whole, an additional
terminal at Heathrow has become an urgent priority if the airport is to
maintain its position as a leading international aviation hub and
accommodate the steady growth in passenger numbers and a new generation of
large wide-body aircraft.
Mr Gunter Eser, director-general of the International Air Transport
Association, said: 'Terminal 5 is the key to the continued development of
air services to the UK. Without the terminal . . . Britain alone would stand
to lose a billion dollars of economic activity every year.'
Sir John Egan, BAA chief executive, warned that if the terminal was not
built, the UK air transport industry risked facing 'the general decline we
have seen in other industries'.
Other European airports such as Paris or Amsterdam would take over some of
Heathrow's share of the international passenger market, he added.
The tortuous process of planning applications (there are expected to be
several public inquiries) is expected to take five years. BAA hopes the
government will give the go-ahead for the project in 1997. That will enable
the first phase of the terminal to be completed by 2001.
The new terminal would provide additional annual capacity at Heathrow for
10m passengers from 2002, giving the airport total capacity of about 60m
passengers a year. The second phase would be completed by 2016, adding room
for an extra 20m passengers a year.
Even with the completion of the first phase of the project, demand is
expected to exceed capacity in the London area by 2005. With the completion
of the second phase, there would still be a capacity shortfall of 27m
passengers by the year 2016, according to current traffic forecasts.
That is likely to lead to construction of a second terminal at Stansted.
Although the Pounds 400m Stansted complex opened last year is still
struggling to attract traffic, BAA remains confident that the airport will
eventually fill up as passenger growth recovers from last year's downturn in
air travel caused by the Gulf war and the recession. Demand at Gatwick is
also expected to grow during the next few years.
Although a further runway will be necessary in the south-east, the expansion
of Heathrow will not involve construction of a fourth runway there.
'The new generation of larger, quieter aircraft will help to deliver many
more passengers without the need for any extra night flights or an
additional runway at Heathrow,' Sir John said.
Apart from accommodating the forecast 3.8 per cent annual growth in
passenger traffic between now and 2016, the project will also be closely
integrated with a broader scheme to improve road and rail access into
Heathrow.
In addition to the proposed fourth lane for the M25, BAA is discussing with
the Department of Transport plans to improve other road links to the airport
including the M4 and the A4. BAA is expected to be involved in the funding
of these crucial infrastructure projects.
BAA also intends to go ahead with its plans to open a Pounds 235m express
rail link between Heathrow and central London in 1996. But BAA's original
rail link project in partnership with British Rail has now been overtaken by
the government's privatisation plans for BR.
Sir John said he saw no big obstacle to halt the project, although it is
likely to lead to a different partnership to finance and eventually operate
the link. The new terminal would also be connected to the Piccadilly
Underground line.
Without improved road and rail links, the new terminal would do little to
ease the growing stress levels of air travellers.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Civil servants to ballot on strikes over pay reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE-RANKING civil servants are to ballot on strike action in protest over
the government's attempt to reform Civil Service pay.
Delegates at the annual conference of the 110,000-strong NUCPS Civil Service
union yesterday voted against an offer worth 4.5 per cent on the pay bill.
The offer is in line with the government's attempt to strengthen the link
between pay and performance and to decentralise negotiations for all 550,000
civil servants. The proposals mean they would lose their traditional right
to annual earnings increments.
The decision to renegotiate the existing pay agreements was announced last
July by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. It followed publication of the
Citizen's Charter stressing the role of performance-related pay as an
incentive for improving the quality of public services.
So far the Treasury has calculated what it says are final offers for just
two groups affecting 300,000 civil servants with settlement dates of April
1. The CPSA union, which represents clerical grades, is recommending that
its members accept a basic offer of 4.25 per cent with an extra 0.5 per cent
in performance-related pay.
The NUCPS is opposed to its similar offer because it says that the 4.1 per
cent basic increase, with 0.4 per cent in performance-related pay, breaches
the spirit of the existing formula that ties settlements to private-sector
deals.
Under the formula, this year's offer should be at least 4.5 per cent but
civil servants who are not eligible for performance-related pay are being
offered only 4.1 per cent.
The NUCPS also opposes the break-up of national pay bargaining and the
principle of performance-related pay, which it says is divisive and open to
abuse.
Three other groups - senior managers, scientists and professionals and
Inland Revenue staff - have settlement dates of August 1 and are still in
negotiations.
The result of the NUCPS ballot will not be announced until June 12, two
weeks after the current agreement lapses on May 29. The government may
simply impose the offer without waiting for the result and might then also
abandon the link with private-sector pay, under which pay settlements must
fall within the middle half of private-sector deals concluded in the
previous year.
Local government white-collar workers yesterday rejected a 3.6 per cent pay
offer. Further talks covering the 740,000 group are planned for May 27.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Caterpillar in truck pact with Russians

<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR of the US, the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment,
said yesterday it had reached an agreement with Zil, Russia's biggest truck
manufacturer, to pursue an industrial and marketing arrangement for diesel
truck engines and fuel systems.
Neither side would disclose details of the agreement, the second between a
big Russian truck producer and specialist US engine maker.
Cummins, the world's largest independent producer of diesel engines, and
Kamaz, the heavy truck maker, formed last year a joint venture aimed at the
eventual manufacture of Cummins engines in the then Soviet Union.
Zil produces about 200,000 trucks a year but its Moscow plant has suffered
from under-investment since the 1970s. The trucks it has been producing are
little changed from those of the 1950s.
It is shortly to begin making 75,000 newly-designed diesel engine trucks,
some expected to be fitted with Caterpillar's engines.
Mr Donald Fites, Caterpillar's chairman, said he believed the two companies
could build a mutually-beneficial truck diesel-engine business and 'together
make a strong contribution to Russia's transportation system with engines
that have good fuel economy and low emissions'.
Mr Evgueni Brakov, Zil's general director, said that co-operation with
Caterpillar could make his group's trucks more competitive in Russia as well
as in the global market-place.
The deal would appear to have similar potential to the Cummins-Kamaz
venture. The latter envisages producing about 25,000 engines a year by the
late 1990s. Local engine assembly could begin by the mid-1990s.
Cummins has said that, at maturity in the next decade, production volumes
could reach 150,000 engines a year.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Bush draws up plan for inner cities: President will veto any
bill with compensatory tax increases
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday announced a six-point Dollars 3bn-plus
(Pounds 1.6bn) programme to relieve conditions in America's inner cities,
but said he would veto any bill that included a compensatory tax increase.
Speaking before a meeting with congressional leaders, Mr Bush was unable to
put a sum on the cost of his proposals, which appeared mostly an amalgam of
long-standing administration policies. Some exist in pilot form, some may be
implemented by bureaucratic fiat and some require new legislation, but none
had been a priority before the Los Angeles riots two weeks ago.
The six points are:
Expanding the Weed and Seed programme, designed to increase law enforcement
and targeted social efforts in high-crime areas.
Expanding home ownership for those in public housing.
The creation of federal enterprise zones.
Encouraging greater choice in public education.
Allowing those on welfare to have savings of up to Dollars 10,000, 10 times
the current limit, before becoming ineligible for welfare support.
Job training, specifically the expansion of a youth apprentice scheme.
Later, White House officials, while conceding the imprecision of some of
their hurriedly compiled sums, gave a rough cost breakdown.
The enterprise zone bill, consisting of tax breaks for inner-city investors,
might come to Dollars 1.5bn; home ownership provisions about Dollars 1bn, up
from Dollars 361m in the current budget; Dollars 500m for the Weed and Seed
programme, now only in pilot form; and nearly Dollars 700m for job training.
Emergency assistance to Los Angeles already amounts to about Dollars 600m,
while unemployment insurance claims are likely to top Dollars 2bn. These,
however, are covered under existing laws.
With an eye on the November election, Mr Bush emphasised his opposition to
tax increases to finance additional spending. 'The idea that you have to
raise taxes at this time, when the economy is starting to recover, I'm
sorry, I will not support that,' he said.
Congressional reaction was guarded. Mr George Mitchell, Senate majority
leader, promised co-operation with the president, but 'I don't promise we
will enact precisely everything he proposes'. Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the
House, said it would be worthwhile looking at transferring funds from the
defence budget.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN and KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firms, plan to expand
their joint venture networks in China by opening offices in at least two
other cities within the next year. Both firms are considering developing
operations in Shanghai and Guangzhou to complement their first joint
ventures approved by the Chinese authorities last month.
Mr Eoghan McMillan, Arthur Andersen managing partner for Hong Kong and
China, said the venture was considering opening branches in Shanghai and
Guangzhou, possibly also in Shen Zhen. Peat Marwick signed documents
formally approving a joint venture with a firm of certified public
accountants in Beijing to be called KPMG Peat Marwick Huazhen on April 25
after two years' discussions with the Chinese. Arthur Andersen finalised a
similar deal two days later, to be called Arthur Andersen Hua Qiang.
The ventures have allowed foreign accountants to certify statutory audits on
companies operating in China. Certification is required for tax returns and
enterprises joining the Chinese stock market.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Reduced fiscal deficit sought: Pakistani Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pakistani government will unveil its annual budget tomorrow amid
widespread expectations of measures to narrow a PR72bn (Pounds 1.61bn)
budgetary deficit. These are expected to include cost-cutting efforts as
well as possible tax rises.
The deficit, estimated at 6.1 per cent of gross domestic product, has broken
an earlier target ceiling of 4.8 per cent. It is regarded as a big pressure
on the economy at a time when Pakistan is trying to encourage large-scale
privatisation and deregulation.
At the same time, though, the government yesterday claimed the growth rate
for 1991-92 had risen to 6.4 per cent from 5.6 per cent a year earlier.
According to Pakistan's official economic survey, announced before the
budget, the manufacturing sector registered the largest growth rate of 7.7
per cent followed by 6.4 per cent in farming.
The government is also expected to take credit for a 25 per cent increase in
fresh private investment and a 13 per cent increase in exports. Inflation is
down to 9.5 per cent from 12.5 per cent a year ago, the government says.
Foreign exchange reserves stand at some Dollars 650m (Pounds 362m), up from
Dollars 300m a year ago.
However, failure to meet the earlier deficit target is attributed to an
adverse international economic situation and lower than expected response in
the privatisation programme which is eventually expected to raise up to
PR250m.
According to the economic survey, the current account deficit during 1991-92
is likely to end up higher than the Dollars 2.2bn last year.
This has occurred because of a failure to meet an export growth target of 20
per cent, and a rise in imports of 10.5 per cent compared with an earlier
projection of 2.5 per cent.
A drop in international cotton prices and yarn has also affected export
earnings. Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers have also fallen. But
the current account deficit is expected to be made up in part by deposits in
foreign currency accounts at Pakistani banks, allowed last year under
government liberalisation measures.
Under the privatisation programme, the government has partly sold 50 public
sector factories with transfer of management to private owners, compared
with an earlier target of 100. The programme has raised PR10bn through these
partial sales while another PR15bn is expected to be raised through future
sale of more shares in these factories.
Among other economic constraints, the government is unlikely to cut the
large defence budget, expected to stand at PR76.9bn. Some of Pakistan's
foreign aid donors have expressed concern over defence expenditures,
regarding this as an area where cuts would reduce the deficit. But
resistance from the politically influential army together with continued
tensions with India over Kashmir and instability in Afghanistan have
prevented such reductions, officials say.
Another PR79bn is expected to go towards debt servicing, where Pakistan's
total external and internal debt stands at approximately PR900bn. Last week
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, said the country has accumulated a
large debt burden, making it the biggest obstacle in the way of balancing
the budget.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Europeans urge better Japan investment deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN must improve direct investment conditions for foreign companies or
face 'increasingly strong' political pressure to redress the present
imbalance in investment flows, according to a paper produced for European
companies.
Japanese investment in Europe had been more than 20 times larger than
European investment in Japan in the past decade, the European Business
Community (EBC), a Tokyo-based advisory committee to the EC, said in a
paper. Tokyo had to ensure European companies had equal access to the
Japanese market.
'If such opportunities are not created, this problem, which today has mostly
commercial and economic dimensions, will develop an increasingly strong
political dimension as well,' the EBC said.
The paper focuses on the manufacturing and distribution sectors. It came as
the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro) released a report suggesting
the pace of Japanese manufacturing expansion in Europe is slowing.
At the end of January, 721 manufacturing companies had operations in Europe,
an increase of 69 over the year, against an increase of 132 the previous
year. About 21 per cent of those companies procured all of their components
in Europe, up from 15 per cent a year earlier, while 34 per cent had
Europeans as chief executives, against 31.6 per cent in January 1991.
European companies listed five conditions hindering investment in Japan:
high cost of land; a relatively long wait for returns on investment; high
corporate taxes; problems of attracting well-qualified Japanese staff; and
'extreme difficulty' in acquiring Japanese companies.
EBC officials said Japanese mergers and acquisitions abroad last year
totalled 294, while only 18 foreign transactions took place in Japan.
There were no legal obstacles to acquisitions but the environment 'was not
conducive to foreign investments'.
The EBC asked that Japanese government agencies 'affirm their commitment' to
an increase in European investment and, more specifically, that the Japan
Development Bank increase its pool of funds available to foreign companies
from Y88bn (Pounds 373m) to Y120bn (Pounds 508m).
Tokyo was urged to lift formal curbs on foreign investment in farming,
mining and the leather industry, and allow foreign lawyers more freedom.

A political breakthrough in bilateral negotiations with Israel is vital for
a wider discussion on the Middle East ecnomy to make progress, a Palestinian
delegation said yesterday after a two-day session of the 35-nation working
party on regional co-operation.
Professor Youssef Sayigh, the Beirut-based leader of the Palestinian
delegation, criticised Israel for not attending the meeting because
Palestinian representation was not confined to those from the West Bank and
Gaza.  The EC, which chaired the working party, made the same criticism to
Mr David Levy, Israel's foreign minister.
The Brussels meeting was also boycotted by Syria and Lebanon, which are
first demanding progress in their bilateral talks with Israel.  Another
Palestinian delegate, Mr Khalil Hindi said he understood the attitude of the
Arab absentee countries, by 'the pros of attending outweight the cons'.  All
participants agreed that the multilateral discussions on regional
co-operation would only blossom if and when there was a political
breakthrough in bilateral Arab-Israeli talks.
Mr Samir Hulaileh, a Jerusalem economist, admitted Palestinian
disorganisation was partly to blame for not taking more advantage of the EC
scheme to promote Palestinian fruit and vegetable exports to the Community.
 Israel was also frustrating such exports with systematic searches of
Palestinians farm trucks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia, one of the world's most popular destinations for European and
Asian emigrants, yesterday announced plans to cut immigration by 27 per cent
next year to about 80,000 people.
Mr Gerry Hand, the immigration minister, said Australia would also require
more skills and a higher level of competence in English from applicants
other than refugees and close relatives of earlier migrants.
The changes follow an anguished debate over the historically high level of
immigration in the wake of an 18 month recession which has increased
unemployment to 10.4 per cent.
Immigrant organisations argue that high immigration benefits Australia by
increasing economic activity.  However, the government has accepted trade
union arguments that immigration has worsened unemployment during the
recession.
Mr Hand said the level of immigration for future years would be decided in
the light of 'national economic and social objectives'.  He said the intake
was likely to average 80,000 for several years.
The cut was welcomed by Senator Peter Walsh, a prominent campaigner against
high immigration, who urged a further cut to a maximum of 60,000 people in
1993-94.
Immigrant organisations said the increased focus on English language skills
was discriminatory, and would discourage applications from talented migrants
from non-English-speaking countries.

China is planning to set up a special economic zone in Lhasa, the troubled
capital of Tibet, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The zone will imitate those operating in China's flourishing coastal
regions, the official China Daily said yesterday.
It quoted Tibet's vice governor Gyamtso as saying lack of open-mindedness
had impeded the region's development in the past.
Tibet has been rocked by sporadic riots since Buddhist monks demonstrated
against Chinese rule in late 1987, prompting police to open fire on
protesters.
The region's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, syas more than 1m
Tibetans have been killed since China took control of his country, now
called the Tibet Autonomous Region, in 1950.
China Daily said Tibet's local government is drawing up preferential
investment policies for the Lhasa special economic zone, including tax
breaks and low land-use fees.  The isolated region plans to open several new
border trading ports.  Currently Tibet's sole air link is with Chengdu, in
neighbouring Sichuan province.

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Protectionist countries have become
pollution havens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANT evidence exists that pollutive industries migrate to countries where
environmental standards are lax, the study concludes. Closed, protectionist
countries have become 'pollution havens', it says, contradicting
environmentalist views that economic growth and free trade lead to
environmental degradation.
The report shows developing countries have seen rapid growth of pollutive
industry, due to the stage of industrialisation these countries are going
through, rather than to investment targeted to escape tough environmental
rules. Pollutive industry, that spends heavily on controlling or treating
resulting pollutants, is still concentrated in First World countries.
Industrial countries account for three-quarters of trade in products of
'dirty industry', with the EC accounting for 40 per cent. While North
America has in the past 25 years cut its share of environmentally dirty
goods by a third from 20.5 to 14 per cent, rapidly industrialising countries
of south-east Asia more than doubled their share from 3.4 to 8.4 per cent.
Concentrations of dirty industry are greatest in eastern Europe, where they
accounted for more than a quarter of exports. 'There is clear evidence of a
relative decline in the importance of these products in industrial
countries' exports, while increases are observed in eastern Europe, Latin
America and West Asia.'
The report traced no evidence of investment decisions influenced by
variations in environmental standards. Research in Chile, which has no
controls on industrial emissions and is open to trade and foreign
investment, shows the opposite. 'Openness to foreign investment and absence
of barriers to technology imports encourage multinationals to invest in
Chile, and ensure domestic producers will have to compete with them.
Openness in Chile is associated with, if not contributing to, the opposite
of the pollution haven effect.' Companion studies of Latin American
countries show more open economies end up with 'a cleaner set of
industries'. 'Developing countries selling their environment cheaply have
little to offer investors, against those offering a cheap, efficient labour
force, to take one example'.
By contrast, east European protected economies show 'the extravagant
carelessness with which the environment has been treated there'. Less than 5
per cent of Poland's river water is drinkable, with 40 per cent so polluted
that it cannot even be used in industry. Czechoslovakia, east Germany and
Poland have nitrous oxide emissions twice those of France, Italy or west
Germany, with sulphur dioxide emissions 10 times higher.
'Environmental degradation of eastern Europe is mainly explained by
political suppression of consumer choice.'
Four reasons are given why dirty industry migration is not a matter of
environmental concern:
Scant evidence exists of such migration;
Costs of compliance with environmental regulations are low as a proportion
of total costs, so do not influence location;
Legal liability and reputation in a company's home market weaken the
temptation to cut environmental costs in a world of rising environmental
standards;
Companies anticipate rising environmental standards in developing country
markets by introducing state of the art technology in the first place.
To test whether tariffs should be used to induce countries to raise
environmental standards, the report examines US industry demands for a
'pollution tax' on Mexican exports subject to laxer environmental
regulations. It finds total pollution abatement costs across US industry
amount to 0.54 per cent of total costs. The cement industry carries highest
costs, at 3 per cent. The report concludes: 'It is not obvious that the
threat or imposition of trade restrictions will have a positive effect on
environmental quality.' The US policy would be flawed because it would be
'driven by considerations of competitiveness, not environmental quality'.
That would amount to 'bad environmental policy and bad trade policy'.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Environment: Deals set up trade in pollution permits
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first US deals to trade pollution rights were announced yesterday when
the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority said it had agreed to buy
allowances to emit 10,000 tons of sulphur dioxide, a key cause of acid rain,
from privately owned Wisconsin Power &amp; Light.
The Wisconsin utility, based in Madison, also said it sold allowances to
Duquesne Light of Pittsburgh for emissions of between 15,000 and 25,000
tons.
The exact terms of the sales were not disclosed but the price of each
allowance was between Dollars 250 and Dollars 400 (Pounds 140 and Pounds
223), an official said.
The deals are, in essence, forward contracts on allowances that will be
issued next year by the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the
implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act.
The act requires utilities to cut their sulphur dioxide emissions in half by
the year 2000, or from a national total of 19m tons to 9m tons. The first
deadline for partial compliance is in 1995.
To help ease the high costs of converting to cleaner technologies, the US
government has created a system under which 'dirtier' utility companies can
buy allowances for sulphur dioxide emissions from 'cleaner' companies that
have exceeded federal standards. The allowances have been allocated, but
will not be in the hands of utilities until an auction in March 1993.
Mr Erroll Davis, president of Wisconsin Power &amp; Light, said the transactions
'clearly demonstrate that a market-based approach can be an effective way to
address environmental problems'. If a market develops for the allowances, it
is believed the public will save on rates because utility companies will be
able to meet their clean air requirements at a lower cost than building
scrubbers or switching to harder, lower-sulphur coal.
There is, however, scepticism over how well such a market can work, as state
and locally controlled utilities have been slow to set clear policies for
trading allowances.
Among other matters at issue, such as whether a given community wants to be
'dirty' even at a lower cost, is how to price the allowances. But Mr John
Henry, president of Clean Air Capital Markets, a Washington-based investment
banking firm that arranged the TVA transaction, said: 'It's a shot that will
be heard around the utility world.'
Its significance, he says, is that it will publicly set a price on the
allowances which is below the cost of most scrubbers.
He also said such transactions are less disruptive than switching fuel that
must be transported from more distant sources. Soft, high-sulphur coal is
produced largely in the eastern part of the US, where most of the offending
utilities are located; hard, low-sulphur coal is produced in the western
states.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's biggest futures market, plans to
begin trading futures contracts on the allowances, to be dubbed pollution
futures.

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Environment better served by free-trade
carrot than protectionist stick - Co-operation produces better results than
coercion, says a World Bank report intended to fuel debate at the Earth
Summit next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUNISHING poor countries through trade bans is unlikely to help protect the
global environment, the World Bank concludes in a report published this
month.
While free trade is no panacea, co-operation will produce better results
than coercion, it says. Developing countries, in particular, should not be
forced to take action they cannot afford, such as stricter environmental
legislation. 'In the case of worldwide global problems like global warming
or in the case of regional problems like acid rain, there is no viable
alternative to international co-operation,' says Mr Lawrence Summers,
vice-president and chief economist, in his foreword to the report on trade
and the environment.
The study focuses on the pressure in the developed world for trade bans and
other punitive action against countries whose environmental regulation falls
below the standards of other countries. Blanket harmonisation of
environmental regulation, sought to ensure fair competition between
exporters, is inappropriate and runs counter to accepted principles of
international trade, it argues.
The report, intended to fuel debate at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
next month, acknowledges that the failure to take proper account of
environmental costs has led in some cases to environmental degradation. It
examines six broad themes: how trade and environment policy are linked;
whether 'dirty' industries migrate in the face of higher environmental
standards; whether higher standards hurt competitiveness; whether liberal
trade, and the quest for economic growth underpinning it, necessarily
results in degradation of the environment; how protectionists have captured
environmental issues to aid their cause; and how international trade
co-operation, including measures aimed at forcing harmonisation of
environmental policies, can help to protect the environment.
Attention should be paid to sustainable development, the use of unexploited
natural resources, energy consumption, the possibility of environmental
accidents, and threats to the 'global commons' including the oceans, the
ozone layer and the world's forests, it says. Among its main conclusions,
the report says:
Companies have no environmental grounds on which to demand tariff protection
against imports from countries with less rigorous environmental rules. Nor
are there good economic grounds, since the cost of meeting environmental
standards account for such a small proportion of total costs.
There is no evidence that 'dirty' industries migrate to countries because
their environmental standards are lax, and there is scant economic sense in
doing so.
International harmonisation of environmental standards is not necessarily a
sensible aim, and may be used by governments to delay domestic environmental
reform. In developing countries where poverty alleviation is a greater
priority than environmental protection, different environmental standards
may be valid.
Trade bans, punitive tariffs or other forms of coercion are unlikely to be
effective: 'Countries coerced into action by threats are unlikely to comply
either very thoroughly or for very long, leaving the environmental outcome
in doubt,' says Mr Summers. 'When consumption in the petitioning country is
20 times that of the country asked to bear additional costs for
environmental improvement, or when countries are asked to forgo the benefits
of their natural resources, equity more than economic logic suggests that
threats to reduce poor countries' incomes further by trade restrictions are
inappropriate.'
A recurring theme in the report is the 'strong preference' governments show
for 'direct command and control measures, which come far down in the
efficiency hierarchy' when it comes to tackling environmental problems.
Governments 'have omitted to give adequate consideration to the
justification for measures they have adopted, or to the nature of the
options available', the report concludes.
Confirming the findings of a report by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) published in February, the World Bank accepts that trade
measures may be justified as environmental policy 'in very narrowly defined
circumstances', but that 'there is almost always a better way of meeting
environmental objectives.' It rejects the 'deep ecology' view that
environmental assets such as rain forests or endangered species have
infinite value. From this, it follows that countries have a right to decide
what value they give to environmental quality, traded against the need to
provide jobs, relieve poverty, provide proper health care and education.
'Environmental standards and pollution abatement and control activities will
be different among countries, and there is no valid presumption in favour of
uniformity or harmonisation,' says Mr Patrick Low, the report's editor.
While the report challenges the claim that a failure to harmonise
environmental standards will result in 'dirty' industries migrating to
countries with lax standards, it concedes that the amount of 'dirty'
industry output in developing countries has grown steadily over the past two
decades. It suggests, however, that this has more to do with the stage of
industrialisation of many developing countries than any other factor.
Studies in Chile and more widely across Latin America also contradict the
claims that free trade leads to environmental degradation and that
industries migrating to developing countries seek comparative advantage in
their lower environmental standards.
'The more open an economy, the more rapidly clean technolsays. It also
suggests that migrating companies have imported their technologies with
them, rather than exploited lower local environmental standards. Several
reasons are given for this: companies have become fearful of liabilities
arising in the event of environmental accidents, and are sensitive to the
demands of 'green' consumers in export markets.
They economise by using common production standards in all plants, wherever
they are based, and find it cheaper to start new plants with
state-of-the-art technology rather than face the comparatively expensive
prospect of 'retrofitting' ageing plant. They also have to anticipate that
developing countries will over time demand more stringent environmental
standards.
The report attacks the case for protecting industries forced to meet high
environmental standards because research shows the costs of pollution
abatement and control to be small. Even in the US, which has generally high
standards, these costs add up to an average 0.54 per cent of a company's
overall costs. Even in the cement industry, which pays more for pollution
control than any other, it accounts for just 3 per cent of costs.
It argues that any attempt in the US to introduce a tax to 'level the
playing field' would be 'strongly suggestive of a protectionist reflex, with
little or no environmental justification'. It alerts environmentalists, who
have often allied with protectionists in trade issues, that this provides a
good example of how protectionist interests have no concern for better
environment standards - only for the elimination of competitive
disadvantage.
'Trade restrictions are an economically costly means for one country to use
in trying to induce another to (take proper account of pollution costs), and
they do not guarantee success in terms of the environmental outcome.'
The report examines options to compensate developing countries undertaking
environmental protection - including cash transfers, debt-for-nature swaps,
technology transfers and sanctions for nature. It concludes that only the
transfer of clean or pollution-reducing technology is without adverse side
effects.

PRESIDENT George Bush confirmed yesterday he would go to the Earth Summit in
Brazil next month, and rejected criticism that his demands have blocked
chances for a breakthrough there, Reuter reports from Washington.
White House officials have been divided over whether he should attend the
conference, but concessions by other nations on a global warming treaty
tipped the scales in favour of his going.
In London, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, also to attend the meeting,
sought to play down expectations of what might be achieved, saying there was
'bound to be a limited amount of success' at the Earth Summit.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Environment: Di Meana attacks UN over CO emissions timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STINGING new attack on the United Nations' dilution of the climate change
convention, due to be signed at next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,
was launched by Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner,
yesterday.
Mr di Meana was speaking on the eve of today's European Commission debate on
its controversial energy tax as a means of combating global warming.
The EC commissioner said he was bitterly disappointed that, in order to
persuade the US to sign the convention, UN drafters had put aside any
binding timetable to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The EC is committed to stabilising CO emissions at 1990 levels by the year
2000, and Mr Ripa di Meana believes a mixed energy and carbon tax is an
essential tool to meet this target. The tax would begin as Dollars 3 on the
equivalent of a barrel of oil in 1993, rising to Dollars 10 by 2000.
The US, which emits nearly twice as much CO as the EC, has until recently
refused to accept any emissions target and at federal level has ruled out a
carbon tax.
Now that Washington appears to accept an emissions target, it is holding out
against a timetable to achieve it.
Wide-ranging exemptions from the carbon tax are proposed in today's
Commission debate, adds David Lascelles.
A draft which was being circulated yesterday would empower the Commission to
exempt industrial sectors which voluntarily undertook to cut their carbon
dioxide emissions, as well as companies which agreed to invest an equivalent
amount to the tax in measures to cut emissions or conserve energy.
Individual member states could also reduce the tax or seek temporary
exemption if their economies were hard pressed or if they had made
substantial progress in reducing carbon dioxide. This would require
unanimous approval of the Council of Ministers.

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek government yesterday launched a wide-ranging fiscal package
intended to boost revenues through broadening the tax base and curbing tax
evasion.
The new legislation, tabled in parliament, is also expected to promote
growth by streamlining corporation tax, at present hemmed in by complex
regulations which serve as a disincentive to investors, finance ministry
officials said.
Reduced income tax rates introduced in the bill will at first cause a sharp
drop in revenues, estimated at about Dr50bn (Pounds 144m) for 1992.
The top income tax rate will fall from 50 to 40 per cent, while the
threshold for paying income tax rises to Dr1m, excluding junior civil
servants and other white-collar workers. In 1993, the top income tax rate
will drop to 30 per cent.
Tax on corporate profits, currently between 42 and 50 per cent, is reduced
to a single 35 per cent rate and companies are required to revalue fixed
assets every four years.
Stricter penalties for tax evasion include lifting of bank confidentiality,
confiscation of professional licences and jail sentences for major
offenders.
Greece's most notorious tax evaders are self-employed professionals such as
doctors and lawyers who avoid issuing receipts for their services. Under the
new system, doctors must keep registers of their patients and lawyers are to
be taxed under a co-efficient worked out with their union.

DEEP divisions in the ranks of France's opposition conservative parties
yesterday seemed to promise the government a comfortable majority on its
bill to revise the French constitution, as the prelude to ratification of
the Maastricht treaty on European union.
The leadership of the right-wing Gaullist party put forward four amendments
to the bill in the hope of presenting a united front with the centre-right
UDF umbrella grouping.
But former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, swung the
prospects for the vote by breaking ranks with his ostensible Gaullist allies
and advocated a Yes vote in Parliament.
Ultimately, almost all of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's party, and all of the
Centrists, were likely to vote with the government because they are in
favour of European integration and the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing cut through the Gaullists' procedural manoeuvering,
which was set to delay a vote until late last night or today, by
dissociating himself from two of their four amendments.
The Folketing yesterday approved the Maastricht treaty on European union by
120 votes in favour to 25 against with one abstention, Hilary Barnes reports
from Copenhagen. The treaty will be submitted for approval to a popular
referendum on June 2. The referendum result will be binding on the
Folketing.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Delors denial on Brussels powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission president Jacques Delors vigorously denied yesterday
that he had any intention of trying to increase the powers of the
Community's executive at the expense of small member states as the
precondition for admitting new EC members.
He made his denial in an interview with the Danish newspaper Politiken in an
attempt to scotch rumours before next month's delicately poised referendum
in Denmark on the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Delors was reported to have been canvassing changes to make it possible
for a bigger Community to function. Decisions are already slow in coming
with 12 members in EC institutions set up to accommodate the original six
member states.
A smaller Commission, with greater supranational powers but more accountable
to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, was the central
idea Mr Delors is said to have been considering.
The suspicion was that such a Commission would weaken the role of the
six-month rotating presidency of the Community.
This would weaken the position of small member states, which hold it just as
often as the large, core countries, while the latter would maintain their
influence through more prominence in the new executive.
Mr Delors said yesterday that criticism of his alleged intentions was 'based
on untruthfulness and lies.
'I have never put forward these proposals, because I do not intend them. On
the contrary the meaning of the Community is that small and big countries
are heard with the same interest.'
Earlier this week, Mr Uffe Elleman-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, warned
him that the widespread rumours were endangering the outcome of the
referendum in Denmark and could cost Mr Delors his job.

   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany will next week finalise the concept and tasks of their
planned European defence corps, including an independent command structure,
which could run into strong objections by other Nato member states.
A joint Franco-German military delegation yesterday met UK defence officials
to try to allay British fears that the attachment of German units to the
corps would conflict with Nato planning.
The German embassy in London described the talks as 'constructive'.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday that the planning staff for the corps,
intended to be the nucleus of a future fully-fledged European defence arm,
would begin its work in July.
According to government officials in Bonn, the two sides have ironed out
their principal differences, and will set a timetable culminating in final
establishment of the corps in October, 1995.
They said Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand would sign a treaty on
the creation of the corps at a summit at La Rochelle in France on May 21-22.
The chancellor said any other member states of the Western European Union
were invited to join the unit, which will be built on the existing
Franco-German brigade and is intended to be put under the WEU umbrella.
The German troops in it will also remain assigned to Nato.
The fear of some other Nato members, including Britain, is that the command
arrangements for the new corps will dilute the German units' commitment to
Nato and interfere in their full participation in Nato exercises.
The German argument is that, on the contrary, the plan will bind the French
contingent in the force more closely to Nato forces.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Fall in core inflation to 3.8 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT revealed a lower than expected figure for core inflation
yesterday but this potentially good news for the economy was accompanied by
indications of continued weakness in consumer demand.
The Central Statistical Office said the index of prices of manufactured
products for domestic consumption rose in the year to April by 3.8 per cent.
The rise was the lowest recorded for more than four years.
But leading retailer Marks and Spencer - whose sales are tracked on a
monthly basis by the Treasury - said in its annual results statement that
consumer spending had yet to show an upturn.
Indications that the removal of political uncertainty after the April 9
election has so far failed to stimulate the economy were reflected in a fall
on the London stock market. It ended four successive days in which prices
had closed at new records. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares finished at
2,722.4, down 15.4.
The inflation figure highlighted the lack of success of many manufacturers
to restore profit margins - which have suffered since the recession started
around mid-1990.
Meanwhile Sir Richard Greenbury, the chairman and chief executive of M and
S, said in announcing a 1.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
623.5m that the recession had not ended as far as his company was concerned.
Hopes of a sustained recovery later this year are linked to projections
about a broad increase in consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds
of gross domestic product.
However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, put a more positive gloss on the
economic outlook, emphasising the 'dramatic change' in business and consumer
confidence since the Conservatives' general election victory.
The inflation figure also contained good news for the government in that
ministers believe the strong pressures on manufacturers to cut their prices,
together with low wage settlements, will eventually spur increased output.
Between March and April, the index of output prices at the wholesale level
increased by 0.4 per cent, after a 0.7 per cent increase in March. That
pushed the year-on-year rise in the index to 3.8 per cent, after 4.5 per
cent in March.
The extent of the reduction in the year-on-year figure was partly explained
by this year's earlier than usual Budget statement on March 10.
The early statement meant the normal Budget-time increases in excise duties
for alcohol and tobacco showed up mainly in the March producer-price index
number, rather than in April.
The index of prices of products excluding food, drink and tobacco is the
Treasury's favoured index for core inflation. It rose in the year to April
by 2.8 per cent, as opposed to 2.9 per cent in March.
Further indications of weak inflationary pressures emerged from the index
for factory input prices. It showed a fall of 0.6 per cent last month
compared with April 1991.
Further figures for inflation - at the retail level - are to be released on
Friday. The year-on-year change in the retail prices index last month is
expected to be about 4.4 per cent, after 4 per cent in March.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Germany's engineering union gives employers ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPEN hostilities between Europe's biggest trade union and the mighty German
engineering industry will break out on May 25 unless employers improve their
3.3 per cent pay offer.
The industry - which produces annual sales of DM1,000bn (Dollars 606bn) -
has been given until the end of this week.
Announcing his ultimatum and the starting date for the long-expected strike,
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of the IG Metall union, which represents 4m
engineering workers, said yesterday that his only options now were
'capitulation or strike'.
Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, said its 3.3 per cent offer
remained the basis for any further negotiation. A deal approaching last
year's 6.7 per cent would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, added Mr
Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the association president.
Both sides have rejected arbitration. A structured deal giving more to the
lower paid, similar to that agreed in the recent 5.4 per cent public sector
settlement, is also ruled out.
The union claimed yesterday that such 'social elements' were unsuitable in a
workforce where pay ranged from DM2,000 to DM6,000 a month.
In the absence of a new offer, Mr Steinkuhler said, an extraordinary union
executive meeting would be called next Monday to decide which regional
members would be balloted for strike action. Voting would be from May 20 to
22. The dates ann-ounced yesterday comprise the final data needed to
complete the programming of a strike which seemed inevitable from the start
of negotiations in early March.
If it follows its tradition of seeking maximum effect with minimum outlay in
terms of strike pay, IG Metall is most likely to start by calling out
suppliers to the motor industry. The industry employs some 900,000 and has
annual sales of almost DM300bn.
Beyond the pre-strike rhetoric, there is wide agreement that German
manufacturing industry faces a drastic slimming cure as it strives to
restore competitiveness and cut unit labour costs. However, most plans are
based on natural wastage and early retirement.
Employers' threats of job losses have yet to make much impression on a
workforce determined not to see living standards undermined. Forced
redundancies are rare and difficult to implement in the rigid German labour
market, and unemployment benefits are about two-thirds of basic pay.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Japan laments loss of old work ethic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE executives are lamenting the disappearance of a breed of model
worker delighted to do unpaid overtime, inspired by a passionate loyalty to
the company and even 'genetically inclined' towards hard work.
As part of an intensifying debate about whether the Japanese work ethic is
being eroded by 'western-style' individualism and materialism, the
Keidanren, the country's federation of economic organisations, surveyed
2,125 chief executives and senior managers. They agreed that the work ethic
was changing but disagreed on the impact.
The debate was inspired by Mr Akio Morita, the Sony chairman, who recently
announced that managers should reduce working hours, raise workers'
salaries, increase dividends and generally become more philanthropic.
He also suggested that companies abandon their quest for market share and
concentrate on profit quality.
Mr Morita's comments were taken by some outraged executives as a direct
attack on the terms and conditions of a social contract that had ensured
Japan's success. There was also concern that employee enthusiasm may be
undermined by a chairman's confession that they were under-compensated.
The federation's survey showed that Japanese companies are indeed dependent
on the enthusiasm of their staff, as 88 per cent of the companies rely on
'service overtime', that is, unpaid overtime.
About 53 per cent of managers surveyed said unpaid overtime should decline
but only 19.4 per cent supported an end to the practice, which makes the
working year far longer than the official estimate of 2,052 hours. Japan's
company-backed unions say the actual figure is closer to 2,400 hours.
Asked to describe their employees' source of motivation, 30.9 per cent of
managers said promotion prospects were most important and 26.9 per cent
thought it was salary. But 37 per cent suggested that the love of work
itself was the prime factor.
A Nippon Steel executive said 'Japanese corporate energy' came from
Japanese-style work values, self-realised desire and a now-declining, but
essential love of teamwork. An executive at JR Tokai, the railway operator,
said 'individualism' was replacing company loyalty as the most important
motivation.
Increasing wealth was seen as a threat to the old order, with 41 per cent of
executives believing that work values were being eroded by material comfort,
although 23 per cent disagreed, and 36 per cent were unsure.
These questions prompted the not uncommon answer that the Japanese
work-style was fundamentally different because of the rice cultivator
tradition - westerners are said to be imbued with the spirit of
hunter-gatherers and thus have become more individualistic and aggressive.
Mr Tsuneo Aki, vice-chairman of Obayashi, the construction company, said
that as cultivators, Japanese people had to toil more diligently. The
result, he suggested, was that Japanese became 'genetically inclined' to
working hard, with genes quite distinct from those of westerners.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sought to reassure Conservative MPs yesterday that the
sovereignty of the House of Commons was not under threat after the Queen
delivered a historic address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
Amid recrimination in Whitehall about the official briefing which sparked a
political row over her first visit to the parliament, the Queen delivered a
carefully measured address emphasising the enthusiasm for, and the
limitations of, Britain's role in the Community.
Mr Major told MPs that the sovereignty of the Commons 'is not a matter that
is up for grabs'. He tried to assuage the fears of Tory Euro-sceptics by
stressing the importance of 'subsidiarity' - by which decisions would be
taken at the lowest appropriate level.
'Decisions do need to be taken as close to the citizen as possible. That was
the principle we fought for and obtained in negotiations at Maastricht,' he
said.
Although ministers believed they had quelled the row over the Queen's
speech, some Euro-sceptic MPs continued to attack the content of her
address.
Eighteen Tory MPs, in an as yet unnamed anti-Maastricht grouping, met last
night to discuss not only the prospect of voting against the bill in
principle, but also possible amendments to the legislation ratifying the
Maastricht treaty.
The rebels are confident they will gain the backing of colleagues during
debate of the bill which begins next week.
Downing Street yesterday blamed a misleading briefing on Monday from the
Foreign Office for provoking protest from Tory MPs. Mr Major was angry at
the reaction it had received.
In a thinly-disguised reprimand, a senior Downing Street official said the
Foreign Office had 'conflated' two sentences which, when set in context, had
a different meaning.
The early Foreign Office summary said the Queen would speak of 'differences
of national parliamentary tradition insignificant against the background of
European commitment to reconciliation and democracy'.
Her actual words to members of the European Parliament, in a passage
described by Downing Street as a 'lighter moment' in her speech, were: 'The
British members will no doubt have brought to the deliberations of this
house the vigorous tone of Westminster debate: a style which can be
confrontational, as some of my ancestors found.
'But differences of style and opinion are insignificant against the
background of the proven commitment of Europeans today to reconciliation and
democracy.'
However, Mr Michael Spicer, Conservative MP for South Worcestershire and a
Euro-sceptic, said his worries were more than 'just a matter of comparing
different styles of debates between the parliaments'.
His comments presaged what is set to be a controversial intervention by Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, on Friday. In a speech in The
Hague, she is expected to make a fresh attack on Federalism.
In her speech, the Queen stuck to the government's stance on Europe. She
spoke of the EC's founders not envisaging, 'a comfortable club with closed
doors, but a community of challenge, where members were exposed to different
points of view'.
Other countries in Europe were 'knocking on the door' of the EC, the Queen
said.
She told MEPs that they were 'part of an effort which is unique in the
world's history.
'Decisions need to be taken as close to the citizen as is compatible with
their success. But at the same time we have to strengthen the ability of
Europeans to act on a European basis where the nature of a problem requires
a European response. That was the balance struck at Maastricht.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Personal View: A dose of market reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN LE GRAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative government's market-oriented reforms are transforming the
provision of public services in Britain. Advocates of markets or
quasi-markets usually support them on the grounds that they promote
efficiency, improve responsivness and accountability and expand the range of
opportunities and choices open to users. Critics argue that they may have
such effects under certain favourable circumstances, but that those
circumstances rarely arise in the provision of welfare services. area, that
Markets, critics add, generally have other, undesirable consequences,
notably increased inequalities and that administration and other transaction
costs that may offset gains in efficiency.
More precisely
There are four specific conditions that which must be satisfied if these
reforms are to achieve their ends without adverse consequences.
First, the market structure must be competitive on both sides, with many
providers and purchasers. Competition is the engine of efficiency; if
dissatisfied purchasers cannot take their business elsewhere, or if
providers are at the mercy of monopolistic purchasers, incentives for
efficiency or responsivness are reduced, and providers are driven into other
activities.
Second, both sides purchasers and providers need access to cheap, accurate
information, particularly concerning costs and quality. Providers must be
able to cost their activities so as to be able to price them appropriately.
Purchasers must be able to monitor the quality of the service they are
purchasing so as to limit the opportunity for providers to reduce costs by
surreptitiously lowering quality.
Third, providers must be motivated at least in part by financial
considerations. If, instead, they are not, if they are public duty,
motivated largely by a sense of public duty, they will not respond
appropriately to market signals.
Finally, there must be restricted opportunities for 'cream-skimming' -
discriminating in favour of the less expensive user. Providers must not be
able to avoid discriminate against the expensive costly or the troublesome
user - the chronically ill patient, the incontinent, confused elderly
person, the disruptive child from a deprived background. If providers can
select for their clients the relatively healthy, the competent and the
easily educable, that is, if they can skim off the cream, then welfare
services will not reach those who need them most.
It is too early as yet to say definitively whether these condition are being
met in practice. in the services concerned. However, preliminary studies at
the University of Bristol, the London School of Economics and elsewhere
indicate some disturbing signs.
In the case of health authorities, the typical market structure, far from
being competitive, is often closer to a bilateral monopoly, with a single
purchaser and, at best, a few providers. Also, purchasers are heavily
dependent on the providers for information; and they have few mechanisms for
monitoring quality.
In community care, the quasi-market is more competitive on the provider side
but, as with health care, there are substantial information gaps. In
response to this, purchasers often prefer to contract with voluntary
organisations, whose non-profit motivation makes them less likely to exploit
their informational advantage and to engage in cream-skimming.
However, precisely because such organisations are not largely motivated by
profit, profit-maximisers, they lack the incentive to minimise on costs. be
cost-minimisers; Hence any gains due to their reluctance to exploit their
monopolistic position may be offset by a reduction in efficiency due to the
absence of incentives for cost-minimisation. minimising costs.
The situation with respect to concerning GP fund-holding and education is
rather different.  In the case of education, the market structure does seem
to be broadly competitive both for providers and purchasers. on both sides
(although entry and exit into the market is limited). Also, the information
gap is less than in other areas. (although it still exists).
Moreover, there do appear to be signs of some, surprisingly rapid, changes
in behaviour in the direction that theory would predict, with parents
exercising their opportunities for choice and schools being motivated to
make financial surpluses. However, there also appear to be preliminary signs
of cream-skimming, with schools setting up formal or, more commonly,
informal, means of selection.
GP fund-holding also appears to have considerable potential for improving
efficiency. The quasi-market is competitive on both sides. Even More
important, GPs have access to the best possible information concerning the
quality of care. they can assess a patient's health before he or she goes
into hospital and they can assess it when he or she comes out. On the
negative side, the costs to providers of negotiating with large numbers of
fund-holders is high. And there is an obvious danger of cream-skimming by
fund-holders in their selection of patients, although as yet there is little
sign of this actually happening.
None of this is to suggest that these changes have failed. The systems they
these reforms are designed to replace replaced also had their inefficiencies
and inequities. The re-election of the Conservatives last month election
result means that the reforms will be given time to work their way through.
We will then be Only then will it be possible properly to assess whether
quasi-markets in the provision of welfare services are the way forward to a
more efficient and more responsive system, or a retrograde move towards
commercial exploitation and greater inequality.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (14): Money for butter,
not guns, is the priority - A radical overhaul of the armed forces presents
big problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the legal successor to the former Soviet Union, the reforms which are
being undertaken by the Russian government will include a radical overhaul
of the armed forces. More importantly, the Russian government will remain
committed to introducing sharp and deep cuts in its strategic weapons, as
well as drawing up a new military doctrine.
This seems a packed and ambitious agenda over the coming months. But without
reductions in the defence budget, coupled with reductions in the production
of weaponry, Russia's economic reforms could be jeopardised. Money for
butter, not guns, is one of the Russian government's priorities.
Revamping the armed forces is easier said than done. First, there is the
question of how to cope with the 12m people who are employed directly, or
indirectly with the defence industry. The Russian government is only now
coming to terms with this enormous task which will entail retraining, and
accepting large unemployment. In the meantime, Russia is trying to convert
part of the military industrial complex into civilian projects.
For instance, in some of the military factories in the Urals, managers,
admittedly with a sense of regret, and shame, about the way the Soviet Union
as a super power has collapsed, have stopped manufacturing tanks. At a giant
tank factory at Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, Mr Oleg Guz, a floor manager,
explained how the plant is now switching production to earth-remover
tractors, and equipment for hospitals.
However, besides airing nostalgia for the old days of regular orders for
tanks from the Soviet ministry of defence, he conceded that his plant was
still producing parts for tanks.
Nor is the task of converting tanks into household goods welcomed by
sections of the former communist nomenklatura in Chelyabinsk. They still
believe in the 'potential enemy' (the west), seeing little reason for
accepting such sharp cut-backs in arms productions. Indeed, they also still
believe they should continue to export weapons as a means of earning hard
currency.
Conversion is not an easy process. Besides the social cost of rising
unemployment - in one enterprise in Chelyabinsk alone, a work force of
60,000 will be reduced by at least 5,000 - it is costly. Mr Andrei Nechaev,
Russia's economics minister says the government would provide Rb40bn in soft
credits to cover social costs. 'To stop military production, you need money
to stop it,' he explained recently. Mr Nechaev reckons that the defence
budget in 1992 will account for about 6 per cent of GDP.
If military conversion will be a costly, and time-consuming process, so too,
will be the attempts to pare down the Russian army. Mr Andrei Kokosin, one
of Russia's two deputy defence ministers - Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, is commander-in-chief of the armed forces - says the army will
eventually total between 1.2m and 1.5m people.
'It will be leaner, more efficient, and more professional,' he says.
But he, and other defence experts in Moscow are quick to add that provisions
have to be made for those who will be retired, or retrained. The last thing
Russia wants is a disgruntled, redundant officer class, which is partly at
the root of the Yugoslav crisis.
Because of these concerns, Russia is in no hurry to withdraw its remaining
troops from the Baltic states, eastern Germany, or the central Asian
republics.
Besides the fact that Russian troops continue to play an important role in
guarding the frontiers which borders with Turkey and other countries in the
south of the former Soviet Union, there is a widespread consensus that if
these troops were withdrawn, they would have no homes to go to. This is one
of the reasons why troops from the Baltic republics have not yet been
withdrawn.
'It is not yet clear when and how we will withdraw these troops. It will be
carried out on a case by case basis. But withdrawing troops from the border
with Turkey - which is a Nato country, will be subject to negotiations with
Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and with NATO as well,' says Mr Kokosin.
Parallel to the question of troops withdrawals, and reductions of Russia's
armed forces, is the question about formulating a military doctrine. Since
the cold war has ended, Russia must now ask itself what role the army should
play and what defence strategy it should adopt. Mr Kokosin says Russia 'will
have the foundations of a doctrine pretty soon which should be ready in
detail by the end of the year.' He envisages the doctrine to include the
following elements:
A Russian army would consist of a growing proportion of professionals. There
will be a shift away from big formations, to corps and brigade structures,
with a much smaller number of tanks - a long-standing tradition of the
Soviet army.
'We will be moving towards a west-European structure,' said Mr Kokosin. The
emphasis will also be placed on rapid deployment forces - and rapid reaction
forces; The 'shock armies' which had been stationed in eastern Europe - the
equivalent of the US's green berets - will act in the rear of the enemy in
case of war, and will be integrated into the rapid reaction forces.
The doctrine will not be based on the existence of a potential enemy or
adversary. The role of the armed forces 'will be like an insurance for some
unexpected events - for deterrence of any kind of aggression. Also, there
will be more emphasis on international peace- keeping exercises,' says Mr
Kokosin.
The Russian military establishment believe that low intensity conflicts will
be the main challenge in future. The ethnic conflicts in Moldavia,
Tadjikistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia, and Georgia confirm this assumption.
It will be impossible to protect every kilometre of the border (that is, the
entire former Soviet Union) with troops and other military formations - 'but
we should control territory, in some cases, with our allies (of the former
Soviet Union),' Mr Kokosin explains.
'We will have special arrangements with the former republics of the Soviet
Union, and probably we should have some basic framework of security and
co-operation. Russia is already drawing up a set of bi-lateral or
tri-lateral agreements with regard to bases, stockpiles of ammunition, and
ways in which to bring forces into action,' he adds.
In the case of a conflict, if the Russian army was not able to deter, the
role of the armed forces would be to act quickly and decisively to restore
the peace on the terms favourable for those who were attacked.
In some cases, units of the Russian army could be stationed on some of the
territories of the former Soviet Union - 'there will be national armies in
these newly formed states. But in some cases, there will be special
agreements between the Russian armed forces and the national armed forces -
co-operation on training of officers, providing them, not just with
equipment but with spare parts, and technical assistance,' explained Mr
Kokosin.
Air defence will also be the subject of bi-lateral negotiations between
Russia and the republics. At the moment, air defence is under the control of
the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russian defence experts say it is
impossible for the Baltic republics to have any kind of serious air defence
system of its own.
'I would prefer to have a special agreement with CIS forces and Russia
Federation and the Baltic republics, whereby we could keep our radar in
Riga, for example, which is very important for air defence. We should
probably have a joint air defence system, but under special agreements,'
explains Mr Kokosin.
So far, so good. But the road to a military doctrine will not be smooth.
There are many problems facing the more liberal sections of the Russian
defence establishment.
Relations with neighbouring Ukraine, in particular, the future of the
Crimea, and who should control the Black Sea Fleet, have to be sorted out.
More nationalist-minded politicians, especially those grouped around the
Russian Congress of People's Deputies, resent any concessions Russia might
make with Japan over the future status of the Kuril islands. And
negotiations with the Ukraine over ratifying the START treaty, which entails
deep cuts in the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal (see report, left:
Moscow's concern) have to be resolved.
In the months ahead, Mr Kokosin and his colleagues can expect few days rest.

Ratification of the START treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AS THE successor to the former Soviet Union, the Russian government will
undertake to ratify the START treaty signed between the United States and
the USSR in July 1991, writes Judy Dempsey.
This treaty involves the implementation of deep cuts in strategic weapons on
both sides. By 1994, the missiles in the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) must be cut from 9,700 to 4,900.
However, ratification of START has encountered some difficulties. The
independent republic of Ukraine, led by President Leonid Kravchuk, has
intimated that since Ukraine has nuclear weapons stationed on its territory,
it should be a signatory to the ratification of START - and perhaps even
seek a seat at the START 11 negotiations. The Russian government is
reluctant to accommodate Ukraine's wishes.
Moscow's position is that since it is the successor to the former Soviet
Union, Russia, on behalf of the CIS, should ratify START and then begin
negotiations on START 11. Furthermore, as Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's
foreign minister argued: 'If Ukraine wants to sign the Non Proliferation
Treat (NPT), but at the same time, it wants to be a signatory to START, this
position amounts to a contradiction in terms.'
Mr Kravchuk has repeatedly said that Ukraine remains committed to the idea
of a nuclear-free state. However, it appears he may be trying to extract a
price for this status.
So far, and in line with the START reductions, Ukraine has agreed to
withdraw 140 of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). The
question of the remaining 46, each of which have 10 warheads remains open.
Mr Kravchuk, who is anxious to allay fears, particularly among nationalists,
that neighbouring Russia would threaten its security, wants compensation
and/or some form of security commitment by western countries in return for
withdrawing the remaining 46 ICBMs.
Moscow is also concerned about the 104 strategic weapons located in the
republic of Kazakhstan, and the 54 based in the republic of Belarus. These
weapons are also included in the START reductions.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (13): Much illness linked
to pollution - After decades of environmental abuse, drastic reforms are
needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDWARD CRANKSHAW once published a set of essays entitled: 'Putting Up with
the Russians.' But perhaps now, since massive military-industrial cities
have been opened to the outside world, a subtitle could be added to the
book: 'What the Russians put up with.'
Apart from the appalling state apparatus of fear and coercion which kept
this vast country together, the Russians endured decades of ill-health, not
only caused by malnutrition, but by the pollution and radio-active waste
which devastated large parts of Russia.
A visit to any large city in the Urals confirms what independent-minded
scientists knew for many years. Compared to west European levels where the
average life expectancy is 76 years, Russia's level has fallen to 69 years
over a period of 20 years.
Experts, including Prof. Alexey Yablokov, President Yeltsin's advisor on
ecology and public health policy, says over 40 per cent of illnesses are
connected with the environment.
In Chelyabinsk, a city earmarked by Stalin in 1929 to forge ahead with the
arms race, people constantly complain of headaches. The most common
operations performed by the local hospital are for heart-related diseases.
The military-industrial complex is one of the roots of the country's
enviromental problems. There are many others. The absence of public
accountability meant that enterprise managers, regardless of fictional legal
penalties, could dump radio-active waste in the rivers and lakes.
Indeed, in the suburbs of Moscow, scientists say the dumping of radio active
waste has, and will continue, to affect the health of the capital's
citizens.
These same scientists are hoping that the revolution affecting the economy
will also have a beneficial affect on the environment. But in addressing the
problems of the environment, where does one start?
The accident at the power plant in Chernobyl, April 1986, provided the first
tentative step towards galvanising public opinion against the poor safety
standards of these RBMK reactors.
Mr Yablokov believes that all sixteen of the RMBK reactors which are of the
Chernobyl-type, should be closed down, immediately.
The problem is that since these reactors provide about 12 per cent of
Russia's total energy needs, any immediate shut-down would lead to a
shortfall in energy supplies.
But Mr Viktor Danilov Danilan, Russia's ecology and resources minister,
admits that his country's use of energy is inefficient. Not only are prices
still low; waste is phenomenal.
'We lose between 10 and 15 per cent of our oil and gas in the pipes, of
which many are leaking. We lose about 25bn cubic metres of gas a year. I am
sure the real losses are more considerable. They could amount to 30 per cent
of our total energy supplies,' he explains.
He and other energy specialists also bemoan the fact that households cannot
monitor their own energy consumption. Not only is the idea of a thermostat
non-existent in most Russian homes. But energy supplies to the domestic
consumer are centrally-controlled - normally by the local district council.
Mr Danilov-Danilan's office had its own, if not uncommon, thermostat: the
window.
The ministry estimates that a sum of Dollars 10bn could enable Russia's
energy supplies to become more efficient, and modernised. This could also
allow the sixteen RBMK plants to be closed down. But in a country committed
to holding down public expenditure, Mr Danilov-Danilan is not optimistic.
'I asked the Russian government to allocate to our ministry 2 per cent of
the credits we will receive from the international community,' he adds. He
is still waiting for a reply.
Mr Yablokov, a ceaseless campaigner on the environment over the years says
he is in a more fortunate position because he has the ear of Mr Yeltsin.
He says that Mr Yeltsin, since coming to office, has already issued six
decrees related to the environment.
In practice, this means very little. The giant engine of the
military-industrial complex, particularly in the Urals, is not yet, nor will
it, grind to a halt. So any reductions in arms production will not have an
immediate affect on the environment.
Moreover, a committment to dismantling Russia's vast arsenal of tactical and
nuclear weapons offers nightmares as well as hope for the environment.
Defence experts in Moscow recall how, as part of the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces (INF) treaty, signed between the US and the former Soviet Union,
dozens of tactical weapons were exploded in Kazakhstan.
'I dare to ask what this did to the environment,' commented one senior
Russian defence analyst.
In the meantime, Mr Yablokov is campaigning for three things: identifying
'zones of ecological disaster,' creating national parks; and making the
water in Moscow and other cities clean enough to drink.
The many maps on his office wall - a splendid room overlooking the Kremlin -
bear testimony to many of these zones which are scattered throughout Russia
and the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Mr Yablokov wants all nuclear testing, and other experiments, stopped.
Setting up national parks, he believes, would give the earth time to
overcome the decades of abuse. His account of the pesticides and chemicals
which have destroyed Russia's forests and lakes are well-known. That fact
also explains the sorry nature of the water supplies.
'For us, the ozone layer is academic. The big issue is the quality of our
drinking water,' said Mr Yablokov.
Some western financial institutions are carrying out studies on ways to
clean up Moscow's water system. A new water network would, among other
things, involve ripping out the worn 19th century sewerage pipes and
replacing lead pipes. But the root of the problem would not be resolved:
stopping waste from being poured into the republic's rivers and lakes.
'We do not expect miracles overnight,' said Mr Yablokov, adding: 'it will
take years to improve our environment - maybe 20. But we have to start
today, otherwise the next generation will have nothing to inherit.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (12): Out of the shadows
at last - The ingenuity and ability of Russian entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a little district in Moscow, not far from the prison where the
leaders of the August putsch are held, where the names celebrate the huge
plant in the midst of it: there are electrozavodskaya, or electric factory
streets and lanes, an electric factory metro station and so on.
The original plant works still, though there are now three different state
enterprises instead of the previous one turning out heavy electrical
equipment - transformers, generators and switchgear.
In its shade is a smaller building, which encloses sterile rooms in which
white-coated technicians produce quartz crystals, oscillators and
microchips, together with calculators, fax machines and telephone handsets.
The smaller plant is called Fonon International: its juxtaposition with its
neighbour emphasises the point made by Mr Dmitri Nikitin, Fonon's president
 -this is that 'when the 80 per cent of the economy which made industrial
goods, largely for the military, begins to collapse, the 20 per cent which
makes for the consumer, begins to be set free.'
Fonon International works in the sector now freeing itself from the shadow
of the giants: as the first declines towards collapse, his grows and
flourishes. He is an example of what is happening, here and there: an
industrial restructuring, forced by government policy, carried out by
entrepreneurs, taking him from the state sector into private business.
'One day I sat down to count how many organisations - of the party, the
state, the enterprise, the local authorities - could interfere with my
decisions. There were 45.'
He also noted that while there were highly skilled people available, 'we had
no experience of quality mass production.'
The company has identified growth markets - of which remote-controlled
television sets, not produced until last year, was a significant one.
Fonon's quartz crystal oscillator is the technical basis of this industry,
and helped explain the enormous explosion in its sales from Rbs26m in 1990
to Rbs1.2bn last year.
The company is determinedly Russian: Mr Nikitin and his colleagues insist
that in the high tech area, equipment and know-how is available which rivals
the leading edge anywhere else in the world - 'the educational level is even
higher,' he says.
His specifications for production machinery have been produced for him in
military industrial plants desperate for new orders: his engineers are all
Soviet-trained: the good-looking calculators which now come off his lines at
the rate of 50,000 a month have some foreign components and casings, but
were Russian-designed.
As the official economy contracts sharply, his company is growing wildly.
The main expansion this year and next will not, he says, be electronics, but
in the wholesale business, trading under the name of Roditi Moscow and run
by Mr Vladimir Krysolov, a former physicist.
Mr Nikitin believes that the immediate future will see a drop in retail
sales, as people struggle to exist under a high-price regime: but this will
be accompanied by a boom in goods for the new shops and businesses and
restructured enterprises. Thus he is importing, besides food and textiles,
office equipment and furniture, and computers. The company has set up a
distribution network with affiliates around the country: it has even
developed a credit card for its customers, who are store and business
managers.
The operations of Roditi show the ingenuity and ability to take risks needed
for the Russian entrepreneur. The company has just signed a deal with Moscow
to import 5,000 tonnes of meat for the city: the price set by the Moscow
authorities was so low that Roditi must make up a difference amounting
Rbs100m between the (hard currency) purchase price and the (rouble) selling
price.
Why do it? 'Because, in return, we would get a licence from Moscow to sell
nickel: and the profits from that would make up for the subsidy we paid on
the meat.'
He pauses, then adds: 'This is risky. We've delivered the meat, but we still
have to get the licence. If someone changes his mind, or the person himself
changes jobs, then it could all be gone.'
In the manner of Russian companies, he has branched into areas quite
different from the core business. Fonon has a company, Yarestavratsia, in
the ancient city of Yaroslavl, near Moscow, with around 1,000 employees,
which specialises in restoration - both of ancient Russian monuments and
churches and of modern western hotels. It is now just beginning a small
air-cargo operation.
Mr Nikitin and his fellows are young enough still - in their 30s or 40s:
with a training which they are putting to use, but with the ability to learn
the ways of business.
'This is the most difficult area for us. But I think that Russian people are
very intelligent and also resourceful: they had to think of so many ways
round obstacles that business does not present any problems in principle.
But of course they need experience. In three or four years time, Russian
businessmen will be an international force.'

most prized resource / The industry needs investment that the government

OIL remains the most prized and precious resource of the Russian state: the
one which gives this, of all the states of the former union, the best long
chances of success - if the industry, now failing, can be renewed and
revived.
In the short-term, the industry presents a grim picture. The London-based
Centre of Global Energy studies forecast earlier this month that the 515m
tonnes of production last year from all the former Union republics -
dominated by Russia, but with significant production from Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan - would fall to between 460-470m tonnes in 1992.
Separate figures from the World Energy Analysis and Forecasting Group
earlier this year show Russia down from a level of 462m tonnes this year to
between 396-412m this. At the same time, demand in these states would remain
high - at about 420-470m tonnes in spite of falling production - because of
difficulties in the supply of other energy sources, notably coal and nuclear
electric power.
On this analysis, it is easy to see states formerly oil-rich realising a
scenario only last year dismissed as absurd: that they become oil importers
in the first half of the 1990s.
To avoid this, the industry needs investment the government does not have,
technology the country does not make and management and exploitation skills
the industry has not developed. Logic thus points to extensive foreign
involvement: as yet, there have been only tentative engagements which give
mixed signals.
After a prolonged and confusing struggle between different levels of
administration, the government awarded a contract for the feasibility study
of offshore oil reserves off Sakhalin, in the far east, to the 3M consortium
of Mitsui(Japan), McDermott and Marathon Oil, (both US). The award of the
feasibility study would normally be expected to result in a substantive
exploitation contract - but while this is world practice, there is no
precedent in Russia.
The French company, Elf Aquitaine, has signed two exploration deals - one
with Kazakhstan and one with Russia for exploration in the Saratov Volgograd
area. In doing so, it has put itself ahead of the rest of the foreign
companies, who still worry about legislation, tax rates and political
instability: Elf executives admit to the risk, but decided to plunge.
These worries are real and intense. They have not stopped most of the oil
majors, and many of the minors and oil service companies, beating paths to
the former Soviet Union: but they have, as yet, stopped subtstantial deals.
In particular, the recently imposed export tax of 26 per cent a tonne is
seen as a big deterrent, and is the particular object of lobbying on the
part of the companies. Mr George Reese, the managing partner of consultants
Ernst and Young in Moscow, says that 'without the tax, you would have had a
dozen major deals by now.'
The various authorities still active in the industry compounds the problem.
A new Vladimir Lopukhin, is thrashing out legislation: but the state oil
company, Rosneftigas, continues to operate as a kind of holding company for
the state oil corporations: while the local authorities, especially the
republican authorities, like those in Tatarstan and Chechen Ingushetia (both
of which, significantly, have declared 'independence' from Russia), insist
on oversight at least and more often on the right to choose and to veto.
Rosneftigas has taken advice from the Daiwa Bank and from Bankers Trust on
how to restructure itself: it remains, however, an anomaly, poised awkwardly
between the companies which fund it and the ministry which duplicates many
of its functions. Mr Reinhold Heus, head of Daiwa's energy division, says
that 'there is now a debate on Rosneftigas' future - it may become a state
oil and gas comopany, as we have in the west; it may provide central
services for the companies on the purchase and supply side; it may become
more of an association. It must justify its existence to the companies: if
it doesn't provide a service, then there would be serious questions asked
about its existence.'
There is now legislation passed on underground resources, and a licensing
law is in draft. The latter puts foreign and Russian companies on an equal
basis, and proposes an auction system for licensing rights: as in many
western countries, the companies cannot buy the wells outright. Further
legislation which, it is hoped, will flesh out the details of licensing
procedures and pipeline transportation, is now being prepared with the aid
of western experts under Professor George Hardy, former Dean of the Law
Faculty at Houston University.
Domestically, the government has allowed the producers to sell up to 40 per
cent of their production at free prices through the oil exchanges (it can be
exported only under licence): and it still plans to 'free' prices (up to
about one third of world levels) by the middle of this year, a move expected
to add 50-70 per cent on all prices.
Mr Lopukhin says that he wants to get 'vertical integration' in the industry
to bring together the former conglomerates organised territorially: once
that is effected, the companies will be transformed into joint stock
corporations and shares will be issued. Already, two conglomerates - KNOS
and Lukoil - have been formed which unite transport and refining facilities
across Russia
Change is now relatively rapid, but confusion remains - and even, is
multiplied. At the core of it is a still unformed relationship between the
centre and the regions on the one hand and the companies on the other. This
is not in itself out of line with world practice: Ms Christine Ferguson, a
lawyer specialising in energy with the UK law firm, Norton Rose in Moscow,
says that 'most western federal countries which are oil producers have
disputes between the centre and the states, some of them very bitter. There
is usually a deal which splits the proceeds.'
For all the confusion, the movement is presently clear: towards greater
integration of the industry with the world. Given success for the economic
reforms, that integration should proceed.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (10): Food supplies - the
biggest threat to political stability / Farmers face formidable obstacles
and agricultural machinery is prohibitively expensive
</HEADLINE>

   By LEYLA BOULTON

<TEXT>
'THERE'S going to be a war here,' declared Mr Sergei Boyakov, a fighter on
the front line of Russia's battle to switch agriculture from Communism to
capitalism.
One of Russia's fledgling fyermers (private farmers), Mr Boyakov, 41, is the
proud owner of 228 hectares of land in Russia's rich southern Penza region.
He has already made more than a million roubles raising cattle for meat and
dairy production. But for months, his biggest headache has been trying to
persuade local state farmers to keep their cows off his pasture.
'I cleared this land and planted grass on it, and now they bring their cows
to graze on it. I won't have it,' he fumes.
Despairing of a negotiated settlement, he is going to hire police to guard
his fields. But he fears the quarrel will end in bloodshed.
Mr Boyakov's battle with members of the 'Shining Path' state farm goes to
the heart of the difficulties of reforming Russian agriculture, six decades
after Stalin herded peasants into collective and state farms.
After millions of peasants died in resisting collectivisation, their
descendents are now too used to being paid by the month, with fixed
holidays, salaries and social benefits, to go it alone. Or at least they are
waiting to see what happens to those who do.
This returns Russia roughly to where it was at the beginning of this
century, when Pyotr Stolypin, the reformist tsarist premier, started land
reforms to break up the prevailing communal system and develop a class of
private farmers. Before they had time to make real headway, the reforms were
interrupted by World War One, and then buried by the Bolsheviks. As a
result, a country which before 1917 was a leading exporter of grain, is
today one of the world's biggest importers.
Today, the collapse of food supplies, which helped trigger the 1917
revolution, is again the biggest threat to the country's political stability
 -raising fears of a golodny bunt (hunger revolt) this winter. It is with
this fear in mind that western governments, to the delight of their own
farmers, are likely to continue subsidising grain exports to Russia for some
time to come.
President Boris Yeltsin has ordered the accelerated distribution of land to
private peasants, and the 're-organisation' of the kolhozy (collective
farms) and sovhozy (state farms) which account for the bulk of agricultural
production. This includes cutting off subsidies to loss-making state farms.
But it will still take at least a few years before Russia is able to begin
meeting its own needs. Practice shows that the state is still unable to
support private farmers on any significant scale, even though their number
doubled to 100,000 between January and April of this year.
Meanwhile, the re-organisation of the state sector on market principles  -
which would have the benefit of maintaining the economies of scale of large
scale farming - is so far too superficial to make any difference to its
effectiveness.
In Mr Boyakov's Pachelma district for instance, local authorities said they
were planning to introduce the unpromising concept of 'private collective
property.'
On one farm which had been reorganised in this way, peasants said the main
benefit was that lazy people could be expelled - but they had a very hazy
idea of what it meant to hold shares in their farm.
On another state farm, the director helplessly complained that unless he
received more money from the state and the government maintained subsidies
on energy supplies, he would sink.
In one small sign, however, that new financial pressures may be having some
positive impact on state farmers, he also let slip that he planned to raise
some cash to pay salaries by selling some produce to a local fair the
following day.
But even if some progress is made at farm-level, time and investment are
also needed to rectify the structural problems which account for the loss of
a third of whatever is produced.
These include an inefficient state-dominated transport system, a
monopolistic trade system, and a dire shortage of storage and processing
facilities. Agricultural machinery is also prohibitively expensive because
of a lack of competition among the state enterprises which produce it.
In Pachelma district, both state and private farmers complained they had no
facilities to pasteurise and refrigerate fresh milk, giving them no
alternative but to turn most of it into butter.
It is not difficult to see why milk is still so hard to come by in Russian
cities. Mr Boyakov's main complaint is the absence of a developed wholesale
market which often forces peasants to use shady intermediaries to find
buyers.
'They rake off huge percentages and call it marketing,' he jokes bitterly.
Another brake on reform is the fact private property in the strict sense of
the word is not yet allowed because of the Russian parliament's refusal to
endorse the sale and purchase of land. Land given to peasants by local
authorities can be resold only after ten years.
Given deep psychological resistance to change, it is hardly surprising that
two signs put up by Mr Boyakov proclaiming 'Private Property' have been torn
down over the past year.
The first, made of wood, was chopped down. The second, made of steel, was
ripped out of the ground.
The principle is indeed difficult to comprehend for peasants used to being
looked after by a state on land which was supposed to belong to everybody
and yet belonged to nobody. Running deep in their psychology is a preference
that all should be poor together, rather than allow the more enterprising to
be better off.
Wearing a neat jeans outfit and trainers, Mr Boyakov looks every bit the
part of the 'kulak' (the historical word for rich peasant) as he takes on
one of his 'enemies' - Volodya, a state peasant with a crudely stitched scar
on his cheek and a tattered cloth jacket falling off his shoulders.
Mr Boyakov reiterates an offer to lend his tractors and equipment for them
to clear pasture land, while Volodya looks unconvinced and questions his
right to the land in the first place. Another headache is theft of his
equipment by neighbours.
Mr Sergei Papshev, the former local Communist party chief turned head of the
local administration, says he is doing his best to help private farmers. But
he claims his efforts are hampered by 'the unpreparedness of a material
basis' for private agriculture. Mr Vladimir Yeskin, director of Valovaisky
state farm, explained why he himself would not dare strike it out on his
own.
'Where would I get fuel and tractors from?
'Where is the guarantee people won't burn my grain or poison my cattle?
'Who will stop drunks coming to my farm and doing whatever they want? There
is no protection from the law.'
Despite all the obstacles, it is clear that farmers like Mr Boyakov, an
engineer in a big city before he moved to the countryside, will survive. But
as he himself admits, he is really the exception who confirms the rule.
'I succeeded because I knew how to manage, because I could express myself,
because I could argue my case, because I knew how to ask for things, and
whom to give money to and who not to give money,' admits Mr Boyakov. 'Only
this has saved me. But it is much more difficult for peasants who have lived
in the countryside all their lives because they don't even know the basics
of doing business in this country.'
Since he received land in December 1990, Pachelma district has registered 57
private farmers, who have got under plough 2718 hectares of arable land - a
modest start in comparison to the 80,000 hectares held by the district's 14
state farms. Because it is in his interest to have allies, Mr Boyakov is now
trying to help six brothers make a success of their private farm near the
Valovaisky sovhoz.
But the obstacles may prove insurmountable for the weaker farmers who do not
even know where to turn for help.
Three months ago, Ms Galina Knitchkova, a former nurse turned 'fyermer' in
the Smolensk region west of Moscow, could look to the future with optimism.
She had bought machinery, built a house, and been given both land and soft
loans by the local authorities. Since then, her house has been burnt down
and she has run out of money to buy seeds.
Unless she is able to raise Rbs131,000 by the end of the month, she will
miss the sowing season, and the chance to begin repaying her bank loans. If
she fails, all the soft loans spent on her so far by the state will simply
have been wasted, and a dream of a lifetime shattered beyond repair.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (7): Battle against
corruption - Many Russians believe the mafia has simply changed its colours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YES, a clever man cannot but be a cheat,' wrote Alexander Griboyedov, the
19th century Russian writer, in the play, Woe from Wit.
Throughout the centuries, Russia has been notoriously corrupt. But
racketeering, influence-peddling and embezzlement have come to play such a
large role in everyday life that the word mafia is now one of the most
frequently-used words in the Russian language, writes Leyla Boulton.
Another peculiarity of life in the former Soviet Union is that the word as
used in Russian has no precise analogy anywhere else in the world. It
describes not a group of 'godfathers' (although there are such figures, too)
but an all-embracing system of crooked practice created by seven decades of
Communist rule.
Its foundations: artificially low fixed prices, shortages, total
state-ownership of the economy. Its multiple actors: a haphazard but
wide-reaching assortment of state or party functionaries, gangsters,
entrepreneurs, and petty employees.
'Countries which are called civilised are far from rid of the mafia, but at
least they are based on democratic principles which are opposed to the
mafia,' says Mr Arkady Vaksberg, the country's leading expert on the
subject. 'A system which is fundamentally rotten cannot fight against
itself.'
Now that the new Russian government is pursuing bold market reforms to
dismantle the old economic system, there is some hope that society can
defeat the mafia because its root causes are finally being tackled. Whereas
before most forms of business activity could be described as mafia because
they were illegal, their unbanning removes the justification for at least
some of the dishonesty.
However, a weak federal administration, a poorly-developed legal system, and
the continued state ownership of most of the economy mean that corruption is
thriving as never before. Resistance from old vested interests to the
government's privatisation and demonopolisation efforts is also an obstacle
to tackling the mafia's root causes.
At stake is the credibility of market reforms which are supposed to benefit
all, and not just those who know how to use the prevailing system to enrich
themselves.
Today, and not without reason, the Russian public believes the mafia has
simply changed its colours. A perception that the new rulers are not only
impoverishing people with price liberalisation but may be as corrupt as
their Communist predecessors, could well sink the whole reform process. The
main reason many ordinary people voted for new 'democratic' politicians was
hope for a more just system.
But mafiosnost (literally 'mafia-ness') has simply adjusted to new
circumstances - a government official sells off state assets at less then
their worth in a private transaction disguised as 'privatisation.'
Prices have been freed but it is still profitable for shop assistants to
hoard goods on sale in the shops in anticipation of further price rises.
Communist officials have either taken new jobs in the administration or have
set up companies with laundered party money.
Poorly-paid civil servants fearful for their future as a result of the
political and economic changes have even more incentive to steal than
before. Instead of transferring assets from the state to the people,
different sets of government officials are fighting each other for control
of what they see as lucrative sources of personal wealth.
Foreign businessmen privately complain that they are being asked to pay more
bribes even though no company will publicly admit to ever paying any bribes.
Foreign companies which do pay bribes are disturbed by the fact that it is
no longer clear whom they have to pay to obtain results.
Those which do not pay bribes continue to complain they lose out to other
companies which do. The final straw is that whatever morality or discipline
which existed under the old Communist system has fallen by the wayside in
today's chaotic free for all.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's new anti-corruption service,
claims that even the attempt by last month's conservative Congress of
People's Deputies to remove the government of young economic reformers was a
rearguard mafia action to sabotage their reforms.
The reason he agreed to join this government, he says, is that it 'owes
nothing to nobody' - unlike the previous administration which he claims
relied on support from shadowy entrepreneurs to defeat the old Communist
nomenklatura.
Mr Yuri Boldyrev, head of President Yeltsin's government inspectorate,
argues that 'what is happening in our country now is not even a battle
between Communists and democrats, it is a struggle between different power
groups in a vacuum of any rules.'
While Russia searches for new rules, officials from top down are apparently
free to do whatever they want. The older generation is particularly used to
disposing of state property as its own.
One high-level example was provided by Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, who
is himself constantly accusing the government of corruption but who last
month rang up the chairman of the central bank, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, to
demand Rbs7bn credit for the Renaissance Bank.
This commercial bank, which has personal links to Rutskoi, is supposed to
provide funds for private farmers - a noble enough cause which the
vice-president is supposed to promote. The problem is that when Mr Matiukhin
refused to grant the funds, the vice-president threatened to have him
removed within a week.
Mr Leonid Zapalsky, former first deputy economics minister last December
signed an order one month after the ministry's dissolution, giving valuable
export licences for 10m tonnes of oil and 10m tonnes of oil products to a
private 'charity.'
He also transferred computers and cars to a joint-venture called
'Russian-Japanese University.'
The assets are now being returned after a government crackdown. But,
somewhat inexplicably, charges are not being pressed by the state
prosecutor.
Equally revealing from the readiness of many Russians to admit to crooked
dealings is the fact that few see that corruption as a crime. Even fewer
understand the notion of conflicts of interest.
A senior official at the state oil company of Tatarstan, a republic within
Russia which is pressing for independence, admitted in conversation to
taking a Dollars 20,000 bribe from a foreign company in helping it work out
projects for investing in his republic.
'I've got expenses to cover,' he explained, saying his Rbs4,000 (Dollars 40)
monthly salary was not enough to survive on.
A Soviet government official who was laid off in December when the country
collapsed told me about how he had received Rbs20m from Soviet finance
ministry officials who were loath to pass on the money to the Russian
government.  The money was to set up a socially-useful project.
President Boris Yeltsin last month issued his first decree against
corruption, forbidding public servants from getting involved in business,
either as intermediaries or employees of private firms.
But Mr Gurtovoi says this is only a first step, which must be followed up by
higher pay for government officials so that the administration does not lose
its best people to the private sector, 'leaving behind the idiots and
hardened criminals'.
'A civil servant can't live on 2,500 roubles (Dollars 25) a month. If we ban
him from using his government position to make money on the side, we need to
give him conditions for a decent life - that is a high pension, a guarantee
he won't be fired, and a system of privileges which we as democrats used to
fight against,' he explains.
Likewise, a policeman must know that if he dies, his pension will be big and
somebody else will look after his children.  Otherwise he will run away from
thieves, rather than catch them.'
In the mean time, Mr Gurtovoi, who used to blow the whistle on government
corruption as a top investigative journalist, is intent on catching specific
individuals red-handed pour decourager les autres.
An opposite view is expressed by Mr Arkady Murashov, head of the Moscow
police who says there is no point in conducting an active battle against
corruption until the old system is dismantled, demonopolised and privatised.
A leading young liberal politician, he was appointed police chief last year
to clean up the police force.
He agrees that police pay must be increased and says that more effective
commercial courts would help reduce violent crime since businessmen would be
more inclined to settle their disputes in court rather than employing
gangsters to deal with unsettled accounts.  But he sees the fight against
the so-called mafia as an evolutionary process.
'By the highest standards, the Soviet system is totally corrupt,' Mr
Murashov admits with refreshing candour.
'All decisions are made by Yeltsin and millions of little bureaucrats. If
somebody famous comes to the mayor of Moscow and says 'I need a building to
set up the Gorbachev Fund,' who will take that decision? The mayor.
'And so a building worth millions of dollars will be transferred to that
person.  And after a certain amount of time, he will be able to let office
space to commercial insitutions.
'And after yet some more time, it will be transformed into his private
property.  Is that corrupt?  Yes, it is.  But that is how decisions are
taken.  It is the system.'
It is not surprising that from this perspective, Mr Murashov is looking
forward to the day when he has just a 'normal' mafia to fight - say, a
US-style drugs trade.
Mr Gurtovoi retorts that the fight must begin now - otherwise 'there will be
no tomorrow'.  He warns of a terrible backlash if market reforms are simply
associated with chaos and lawlessness.
'Out people won't let this country turn into another Colombia.  Instead, a
new Stalin will appear and simply shoot people.  If we don't catch thieves
now, there won't be anything left to steal.
'We'll show up one day and find the Kremlin has been sold.'

MR MIKHAIL GURTOVOI, who is in charge of fighting state corruption and
financial fiddles, is refreshingly above suspicion, writes Leyla Boulton.
But this former journalist for Moscow News, who used to expose corruption
scandals on paper, sometimes feels that despite the trappings of power, he
is fighting a losing battle.
Appointed in January as Mr Yegor Gaidar's adviser on dealing with one of the
scourges of Russian life, Mr Gurtovoi says he has changed his mind about how
to deal with the problem.
Rather than perfecting Russia's legislation and law enforcement, he now
believes it is essential to catch as many crooks as possible - 'like
plugging holes in a ship so it does not sink' - while providing officials
with incentives not to steal.
Since he and his team - which include top investigators from the Soviet
anti-mafia days - moved into offices in the former Gosplan headquarters in
Moscow, they have been able to stop a few cases of embezzlement, as well as
a big financial swindle involving the laundering of illegally-earned funds.
But another headache, apart from the extent of the corruption, is inertia in
the rest of the system. After he reversed an attempt by Mr Leonid Zapalsky,
a former deputy economics minister, to give out valuable oil export licences
to a charity while he was supposed to be winding up the economics ministry,
the case has not been pursued by the state prosecutor.
Part of the problem, he says, is that a lot of the corruption is tied to the
system of patronage under which the previous generation of Russian
politicians relied on new entrepreneurs for financial support to defeat the
old Communists - 'for the mafia, supporting upcoming politicians was like
putting money on horses.'
He says that while President Yeltsin had enough popular support to get
elected without paying bribes, the same is not the case for all those in
power before the Russian leader appointed a new cabinet of economic
reformers.
Since a lot of the cases of big-time corruption involve getting money from
foreigners, he would also like to hear from foreign businessmen who have
specific cases to complain about.
Is this naive behaviour, ask the cynics. Maybe, but it is Russia's only
chance to maintain some credibility now that market reforms under way have
finally begun removing some of the justification for cheating in the past.
Mikhail Gurtovoi's address: 6, Okhotny Ryad, Moscow.

<TEXT>
THAT A COUNTRY as conservative and closed as Russia should have such a
bright and westward-looking government is really something of a miracle.
It is a sign of Russia's desperate situation that the team of economic
reformers led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the 36-year-old first deputy prime
minister, has come to power. With most of the key ministers in their
mid-30s, the youngest cabinet in Russian history is being entrusted with the
momentous task of switching the country to a market economy after 75 years
of state planning.
Six months on, they are still in office because the older generation,
discredited by the failure of the socialist experiment and five years of
tentative economic reform under President Mikhail Gorbachev, has failed to
come up with an alternative.
Apart from a package of go-it-alone market reforms which would bypass
disagreement among republics, Mr Gaidar, an academic with no experience of
government, was able to sell President Boris Yeltsin a ready made government
team - made up of like-minded economists who also happened to be his
friends.
The team's roots go back to the 1980s, when they held unofficial seminars on
market economics at a time when such ideas were just beginning to gain
currency in very limited circles. Mr Gaidar, an exceptionally bright, suave
and persuasive figure, very soon emerged as their leader, his time as
economics editor of the Kommunist party journal in the late 1980s giving him
the opportunity to publish pro-market views.
The 36-year-old privatisation minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, a graduate from
Leningrad's Economics Institute, had been friends with Mr Gaidar ever since
they began clandestine studies of market economics together in 1979.
The Latvian-born Mr Peter Aven, the foreign trade minister, who is also 36,
and the only non-Russian in the cabinet was in Vienna researching economic
reforms in eastern Europe before he came back to Moscow.
Mr Alexandr Shokhin, who used to advise Mr Eduard Shevardnadze when he was
still Soviet foreign minister, acted as the stalking horse for the Gaidar
team to take over. He was labour minister in the previous back-biting
Yeltsin administration.
Although only half a dozen are ministers, there are several other allies
scattered round in the top echelons of the administration. There are so many
qualified economists in the Gaidar team that there will be very few
economists left to take over should they fail.
Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, who is responsible for negotiation with
international organisations, provided an international connection for the
group when he set up a Market Institute sponsored by the London-based
Institute of Economic Affairs, the Thatcherite think-tank.
Like their predecessors in eastern Europe - Poland's Mr Leszek Balcerowicz
and Vaclav Klaus in Czechoslovakia - the Gaidar team is more free-market
than many of their foreign advisers. Their common ideological front -
allergy to the old system - translates into a mix of orthodox free market
economics and admiration for Margaret Thatcher's strength of character.
This is tempered by political realism - about what it is possible to get
away with in Russia - as witnessed by their decision last month to loosen
their tight credit policy at the risk of triggering hyperinflation.
Apart from the support of Mr Yeltsin, the team's unity has proved its main
strength in surviving the murderous world of Russian politics. In the
absence of strong parties, Russian politics, usually depressingly, and
dangerously, boils down to petty jealousies and power struggles among
personalities, all jockeying, in true Soviet fashion, for the top leader's
seat.
Mr Gaidar and his critics started off by not expecting him to last long in
office. But having matured fast as a politician since taking office in
October, and then putting up a ferocious fight for his reforms in
parliament, Mr Gaidar emerged from lat month's bruising Congress of People's
Deputies with a new self-assurance.
Although disarrayed by their trouncing, many of his pro-market opponents
still see themselves as a second tier of pro-market reformers, waiting in
the wings to prevent a fascist Communist takeover should the government
collapse under a wave of spontaneous popular anger.
'We want more gradual reform more focused on the population, because Russia
is used to living slowly but is used to equality, explained Mr Oleg
Plotnkov, a young pro-market member of the Smena ('Change of Guard')
parliamentary faction which wants more power for parliament.
Although superior to anything else on offer so far - 'we are often accused
of being arrogant,' says one Gaidar aide, 'but perhaps that arrogance is
justified' - the government is by no means all sweetness and light.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the chief Soviet economic strategist, who struggled
between the August coup and the collapse of the Soviet Union to build some
kind of economic union, accuses them of outright opportunism. He proudly
describes a stormy scene in his office late last year, when he turned down a
job offer from Mr Gaidar and accused him of tailoring his go-it-alone
Russian economic reforms to suit the new isolationist mood of the country's
political masters.
Their appeal to the West as normal, articulate human beings eschewing the
old traditions of Soviet bureaucrats, does not necessarily translate into
affection for them within the Commonwealth.
The team's self-confidence - which took the form of bypassing parliament and
offending people like the central bank chairman - has also irritated many
older Yeltsin supporters who have been shunted out of the president's 'in'
crowd.
Ms Bella Kurkova, an influential St Petersburg journalist and deputy in her
50s, recently complained on her own TV programme that the government was
inaccessible. What she really meant to say, as she commiserated with St
Petersburg mayor, Mr Anatoly Sobchak, was that they were inaccessible to
them.
But one intelligent thing this team has done is to hire, as government
advisers, outside experts who might otherwise criticise it, or whose
prestige enhances their image - 'all you have to do is criticise the
governmen to get a job offer,' joked Mikhail Leontiev, economics
correspondent for Nezavisimaya (Independent) newspaper, who claims he turned
down such a proposition.
Mr Yuri Boldyrev, a rising young star of Russian politics who made a name
for himself pushing for the split of the Communist party, was recently
appointed head of the government inspectorate. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, a top
investigative journalist, is Mr Gaidar's adviser on fighting corruption.
They have also used foreign advisers - including economists such as Jeffrey
Sachs whose support has even extended to helping one minister give his first
foreign press interview - to drum up support and sympathy for their reforms
in the West.
The Dollars 24bn aid package - granted by western governments in time to
support them at the Congress of People's deputies - has become another
argument for them to stay in power. But as President Yeltsin demonstrated
when he said Russia would not be taking orders from the International
Monetary Fund, the government - which openly says it would like its central
bank to be run by the IMF - has to be careful to avoid accusations of being
too subservient to the West.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (5): A new balance must be
struck - The regions and peoples within Russia face three massive
interlocking sets of problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DEPRIVED of an empire in the space of six years, Russia now struggles to
control her own territorial space. Reform here has marched at a much slower
space than in the economy, or in such civil freedoms as speech and travel:
naturally, for here is the most intricate knot which the new state must
unravel.
It faces three massive interlocking sets of problems. First, the Russian
government must find a new relationship with the peoples within Russia,and
with the authorities of the administrative/national divisions which have
been bequeathed it by the Soviet system.
These divisions - autonomous republics, districts and regions - were
formally 'autonomous:' actually, they were strictly subordinate to a
centralised state and party.
In the time of collapse of these institutions over 1990-91, the republican
and local administrations took powers into their own hands - indeed, they
were explicitly encouraged to do so by Mr Boris Yeltsin, who later became
President of Russia with a necessarily quite different agenda.
Now, a new balance must be struck: one which allows devolution of government
to effective administrative authorities while retaining - or rather, winning
back - effective power for the centre.
A Federation Treaty, signed in April of this year with much celebration, was
advertised as doing just that. In fact, it leaves out of its scope two
important republics, Tatarstan and Chechen-Ingushetia: even more
importantly, those republics within the treaty have in many cases struck
unpublicised deals with the central government which give them large control
over, particularly, exports - and which undercut the ostensible rule of law
with a reversion to the past practice of backstairs arrangements.
Secondly, and linked to the first, is the necessity to make the central writ
run everywhere. The dissolution of the centralised state has left, not
market relations, but a legislative and economic free-for-all in which all
seek to maximise their position.
Regions, districts, cities, even enterprises seek to escape government
control, especially taxes. Where they can, they look abroad for export
contracts, in order to obtain hard currency.
The buying, selling and grabbing of property, nominally under state control,
goes on relatively freely, usually without effective intervention or
hindrance.
The corruption of public authorities at every level, against which the
Government and the parliament constantly rail, makes the observance of
central power not a matter of law, but at best of negotiation.
Thirdly, Russia must come to terms with the fact that millions of Russians
now live in 'foreign' countries which they had been accustomed to regarding,
at least in part, as extensions of their homeland.
In Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the Baltic States, the Caucasus and in Central Asia,
men and women who had settled in areas often colonised by Russia for
centuries find themselves in the vertiginous and poignant position of having
to choose a nationality, and all that goes with it - language, culture,
education, loyalty.
It is as yet ill-equipped to deal with these issues. Most importantly, it
has no reform constitution. The Congress of Russian Peoples Deputies which
met for much of April had before it several competing drafts of a new
Russian Constitution - but refused to consider any of them.
The state thus still operates on the basis of a patched up Soviet-era
constitution - which still, bizarrely, acknowledges the existence of the
Soviet Union, thus giving the communists the opening to argue that the
destruction of the Union was unconstitutional.
The official draft of the constitution assumes the existing territorial
divisions, and seeks to apportion powers between them and the central
government: only the draft of the constitution prepared by Mr Anatoly
Sobchak, the Mayor of St Petersburg, seeks to replace these divisions with
new administrative areas - on the basis that the old are hopelessly enmired
in the structures of the old regime and cannot be 'democratised' simply by
being shifted under the aegis of a presidential, or for that matter a
parliamentary, republic.
The creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States in December last year
 -even while the Soviet Union still had a formal, legal existence  - was
designed in Russian minds to provide a framework within which some things
would continue as before - including a common citizenship.
The inability of the CIS to provide such a framework, or so far to
substantially mitigate the tensions between communities within its
territories, faces the Russian state with the necessity of finding for its
'expatriates' a modus vivendi with the states in which they are now located.
This has yet to appear.
Three critical areas will point the way. In the three small Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania live nearly 2m Russians.
All three of these states have set out constitutions which, at the minimum,
would force the Russians who stay to learn the local language (which many
had never tried to master, living as they often do in Russophone
communities) in order to hold a job, and would often disqualify recent
entrants from citizenship.
Discussions between the Russian and the Baltic governments on these issues,
and on the removal of the former Soviet army from these states' territories,
have been sporadic and slow: constant expressions of frustration are made on
both sides.
Second, in the TransDnester area of Moldiova, a strip of land between the
Dnester River and Ukraine, live a majority of Russians and Ukrainias: the
former have been especially active in proclaiming the area a republic, and
have conducted a sporadic war with the Moldovan militia.
The desire of the Russian government to seek a federal solution to the issue
meets the so far uncompromising demand on the part of the Moldovan
authorities that Moldova be a unitary state - while powerful elements in or
near the government raise the possibility of a future unification with
Romania, to whose people the Moldovans are ethnic kin.
Third, the Crimea, in the south of Ukraine, is soon to hold a referendum on
independence with the option of an alliance with Russia.
Crimea, Russian territory until capriciously given to Ukraine in 1954 by Mr
Nikita Kruschev, has a majority of Russians: it is also home to the Black
Sea Fleet, the bulk of which Russia claims.
The return of Crimea is a popular cause in Russia: its loss cannot be
tolerated by the Ukrainian government. A crisis over its status could
threaten the security of the very large Russian community in Eastern
Ukraine, until now peacefully integrated with the Ukrainian population.
These are the national challenges which now face Russia: all are, of course,
susceptible to compromise and to negotiation, and in most cases there are
forums and mechanisms in which such negotiations can take place, or actually
are taking place. But their success depends on the ability of the
governments in question to be able to deliver, and to survive, compromise:
and in nearly every case, the post-Communist governments have come to power
under the banner of a resurgent nationalism, often at least covertly
strongly anti-Russian.
At the same time, as the recent Congress showed, both the 'nationalist' and
the 'democratic' forces in Russia regard the protection of Russian interests
as the fundamental base of their politics, the neglect of which would
threaten their fragile cohesion and popularity.
The largest element of hope is that the present Russian government is headed
by leaders who appear ready to go to the political limits to avoid the
charge of acting in an 'imperialist' fashion. There has been no official
support for the TransDnestr rebels: no official agitation among the Baltic
Russians.
In a recent interview, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, made
clear that in every one of these crucial theatres, he was open to compromise
and to a settlement which answered the criteria of human rights, not of
narrow Russian national interests.
Internally, the flashpoints of Tatarstan and Chechen Ingushetia have not
been confronted with military power but finessed - put into negotiating
processes with the clear statement that seperate arrangements should govern
the relationship between the Russian authorities and these states.
In both these cases, there are signs that internal dissent to the present
governments might take a 'pro-Russian' form - or at least, propose a
solution in which the clear dependence of both on the Russian market and
infrastructure would find a correlative in the political level. The example
of Georgia - where a violently anti-Russian nationalist government was
overthrown in favour of one led by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet
Foreign Minister, which seeks rational accommodation, is encouraging.
But the problems cannot be forever finessed. To withstand the further, and
deeper shocks which economic reform promises all of the states of the former
Soviet Union, central power must be seen to be both effective and
undiscriminating.
The law must be seen to be the law from St Petersburg in the north west to
Vladivostok in the south east. The construction of a law-governed state, the
as-yet unrealised project of national independence, is a its earliest, most
fragile stage.

enterprise - Profile of a young Russian entrepreneur

A PHYSICS graduate, Mr Karim Arginbayev, 28, used to dream of devoting his
life to science. As it happens, he turned out to be more suited to making
money in the new Russia.
Occupying a little office leased from a scientific institute in Siberia,
Karim Arginbayev has all the qualities it takes to make it as an
entrepreneur in the former Soviet Union: brains, contacts, daring and a
willingness to get his hands dirty.
His path to success is typical of a first generation of biznesmyeny
(businessmen) to grow up in the rubble of Communism but who are still
perceived by the people at large as vile spekulyanty (speculators).
The day I met him he was taking a second-hand Japanese car to a bank manager
as a present for lending him Rbs15m at 30 per cent interest for nine months.
With monthly inflation estimated at 40 per cent, such a negative interest
rate was indeed worth such a gift.
Karim's career started just three years ago when he decided, upon finishing
his military service, to take advantage of a new law allowing the
establisment of co-operatives.
Thanks to the new legislation, Karim was able to do legally what
blackmarketeers under the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev did illegally.
He set up a co-operative to bottle ginseng lotion made in his native
Kazakhstan. But 'because it takes time to get money back on productive
investment,' he also opened a small firm called ARNA for lucrative trading
in goods in short supply.
His business plan for ARNA, of which he designated himself chairman with a
board of directors, was breath-takingly simple.
On the strength of a contract he concluded to buy imported audiocassettes in
the far eastern port of Vladivostok, he persuaded a friendly bank manager to
lend him Rbs1m for three months at 15 per cent. He put Rbs50,000 into ARNA
as its starting capital and bought a container full of audio-cassettes.
He then sold the cassettes, bought himself a car, a house, and a dacha, and
returned the money to the bank. He then borrowed a further Rbs3m from
another bank, hired some people to work for him, bought a second car and. .
.a new batch of audio-cassetttes.
Having repeated this process a few more times, but not returned the
subsequent bank loans, he now has outstanding debts of Rbs28m.
While other entrepreneurs laundered Communist party funds or stole state
property to get started, Karim accumulated his capital on the back of the
primitive Soviet state banking system. Each loan was rewarded by a present
for the bank manager - usually an audio-cassette player or a microwave oven
 -without which he would have been told that credit was either not available
or only offered for a triple-digit rate of interest.
The beauty of the whole scheme now is that should he default, the banks will
not be able to seize the cars and dacha because the money was lent to ARNA
as a limited company.
On the production side, Karim has used some of the money to set up a small
factory on leased premises at the state-owned Botanical Gardens, just
outside the Novosibirsk akademgorodok (academic township). In return for his
co-operation, the Botanical Gardens director has been given shares in the
enterprise, which produces ginseng essence to revitalise tired Siberian
miners.
From Karim's viewpoint, he is simply spreading wealth and benefitting from a
vacuum of effective laws to regulate business activity.
From a young age, he was well-disposed towards free enterprise and
capitalism - 'my grandfather was shot by the Communists; my father brought
me up not to like them.'
Having attended a special school for children with scientific talent, the
affable young man quickly decided after univerity and a year working at the
Institute of Inorganic Chemistry that science was not for him. He preferred
'working with people.'
His next project is to set up investment trusts for Russian capitalists to
fund research by Russian scientists into new civilan-oriented technology -
'otherwise we will pay for this in future by relying on foreign brains.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (3): The difference
between economic reform and revolution - Optimistically, the government
hopes to achieve large-scale privatisation by the end of 1993
</HEADLINE>

   PRIVATISING the Russian economy is the most revolutionary
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or rather counter-revolutionary - policy of the Russian government. For mass
privatisation is the difference between economic reform and revolution.
Price liberalisation and macroeconomic stabilisation could, in theory have
been attempted by reform communists. But successful privatisation would
spell finis to Bolshevism. Its aim is not just to create a new, more
competitive economy. It is to create new classes, new attitudes and new
relations between government and the governed.
Counter-revolutions are prima facie no easier to make than revolutions,
especially when, as was true of Lenin's proletariat in 1917, the class that
will be the obvious beneficiary - the bourgeoisie, both big and small - now
hardly exists.
The government does not even possess secure control over the levers of
national power. Its sole advantage is, in the words of Anatoly Chubais,
minister for privatisation (or, more precisely, 'chairman of the committee
for the management of state property of the Russian Federation'), that the
planned privatisation involves a move 'from an absolutely artificial to a
normal economic system'.
Privatisation means the assignment of existing socialised property to
private owners. But, more fundamentally, it demands effective establishment
and protection of private property in its three main aspects - the right to
use property, the right to enjoy the income and the right to dispose of it.
The government hopes - over-optimistically, beyond a doubt - to achieve much
of the transformation by the end of 1993.
For 1992, Mr Chubais has set himself three main tasks:
To make irreversible the privatisation of small enterprises, by auction or
tender.
To turn large enterprises into joint stock companies, followed by at least
partial privatisation of most of them in the course of 1993.
And to solve the problems involved in distributing privatisation vouchers to
the population.
Experience in both Poland and Czechoslovakia suggest that rapid
privatisation of small enterprise is both feasible and effective. Partly
influenced by these successful examples, the decree of the president of the
Russian Federation on privatisation, promulgated on 29 December 1991 (decree
number 341) puts most small enterprises into the category of 'obligatory
privatisation'.
However important it may be, even small privatisation has gone slowly so
far. But a start has been made with a programme that the government hopes
will prove a replicable model for the whole of Russia: that for mass
small-scale privatisation in Nizhny Novgorod (previously Gorky), Russia's
third largest city and traditionally its main trading centre.
This city was chosen by the government and the International Finance
Corporation (an affiliate of the World Bank), because of the enthusiasm of
the governor and mayor and because of the relatively low level of corruption
in that city.
The intention in Nizhny Novgorod has been to sell off some 2,000 small
businesses over the six months following the start of the programme in
March. Privatisation is by auction, either of long-term leases or of
outright ownership in the case of stand-alone premises. But some product
lines, notably bread, will have to be kept by auctioned shops for a year. In
addition, existing employees enjoy discounts in the auction.
The auction in Nizhny Novgorod has started successfully, argues the
minister, if in a small way, with just 21 shops sold at the first auction on
4 April. But a precedent has now been established, one that the rest of
Russia will be required to follow. To that end, the government will use what
Mr Chubais calls 'traditional instruments, acceptable to the normal Russian
mentality. We have mandatory tasks for each region, which show the
proportion of enterprises that must be privatised by the end of this year.'
As is shown in the chart, the December decree lays down such quotas in fine
detail, to be acted upon by regional governors appointed by the president.
What will be the fate of recalcitrant governors? They will be dismissed,
says Mr Chubais. But he is hopeful that this will be unnecessary, since
'normal bureaucrats don't want to be the first, but also don't want to be
the last. Each must now choose his own strategy, because the way is now
clear. They know that if they are the last in the queue, there is a danger
that they will be dismissed.
'This is not just a governmental position, but the position of President
Yeltsin. We have enough instruments to force local authorities to do the
job,' he says - though, Mr Chubais admits, this may well not apply to the
autonomous republics.
Resistance of local authorities is only a part of the problem. That of
managers and workers is at least equally significant. The need to carry out
privatisation speedily is why Larissa Piyasheva, adviser on privatisation to
Gavriil Popov, the radical mayor of Moscow, recommends selling property at
low prices to workers' collectives.
Strong objection to Ms Piyasheva's views comes from Yelena Kotova, until
recently General Director of the Moscow State Property Office. For her, as
for Mr Chubais, auctions of property are essential. Such ideological
conflicts, along with the fierce political struggle between the mayor and
the Moscow City Soviet (council), have led to a stalemate on privatisation
in Moscow. Mr Chubais, for his part, reluctantly accepts Moscow's autonomy
as, in his words, 'another republic.'
But for Russia as a whole, he far prefers auctions: because merely granting
enterprises to workers at a negligible price does not change their
behaviour; because the revenue generated by privatisation - Rbs2bn in the
first quarter of 1992, up from Rbs200m in the whole of last year - is itself
valuable; because benefits from transfer of state property into private
hands should be shared by the population as a whole, not just by workers;
because experience in Nizhny Novgorod demonstrates that the objections of
workers' collectives can be overcome, especially if many win in the open
auctions, as they have in about a third of the cases; and because auctioning
need be no slower than giving enterprises away.
The government believes that it is its duty to 'find a balance between the
interests of those inside and those outside the enterprises.'
It intends, therefore, that in the privatisation of both small and large
enterprises 'there will be privileges for different social groups; it is
very important that people do not feel this exercise is for the benefit of
the old nomenclatura and the mafia.' Workers, for example, will receive 25
per cent of the equity in larger enterprises, and managers 5 per cent, but
both in the form of non-voting shares free of charge.
Workers will also have the opportunity to purchase an additional 10 per cent
of shares in their enterprise at a discount of 30 per cent. For similar
political reasons, privatisation vouchers will be distributed, not later
than autumn this year, says the minister, with the precise details of the
scheme to be decided by mid-May.
Meanwhile, for Russians who can afford to pay - of whom a part will, indeed,
be drawn from those who had been high up in the previous power structure, or
who had acquired their money illegally - there will be an open auction of
shares, without any privileges.
All this assumes that the government can halt, or at least contain the pace
of 'spontaneous privatisation', whereby managers of enterprises and local
bosses are diverting the assets of state enterprises into their own hands.
Mr Chubais is optimistic - 'we have had no legal basis for privatisation
until now: all privatisation has been semi-legal. The only way to curb
spontaneous privatisation is to introduce a normal legal structure,' he
says.
Now that the west has made a commitment to provide Dollars 24bn to Russia,
Mr Chubais also expects that there will be a substantial capital inflow into
the country. Foreigners will, therefore, be allowed to play a part in
privatisation. But the minister says that there should be no special
exchange rate for the rouble, to be used when buying shares, as was formerly
mooted.
Instead, Mr Chubais says that the Government intends to 'multiply the book
value of the property (when sold to foreigners) by some co-efficient. There
could be special auctions only for foreigners - but this is still to be
decided.' A special privatisation programme is also being prepared in the
energy sector.
Most state enterprises are to be involved in privatisation by the end of
1993, though the plans for next year are far from firm - 'there will be
resistance and so we must be quite flexible,' says Mr Chubais. Flexibility
will certainly be needed.
An immediate problem is the financial straits to which attempted
stabilisation has already reduced many of these enterprises, a problem the
minister regards as 'serious, but temporary.' Where enterprises are bankrupt
for technical or structural reasons, privatisation will be combined with
attempts to make enterprises healthier, says Mr Chubais, perhaps through use
of foreign credits.
Nobody can have any doubt about the scale of the obstacles - social,
political and economic - to the property transformation that the government
is intending. The question of privatisation of land, for example, is still
highly sensitive, as was shown in the debates in the Congress of People's
Deputies.
Privatisation of large enterprises raises still more difficult questions.
Will the government be able to bring these enterprises under effective state
ownership once more, this being a necessary condition for their
privatisation?
Can it implement the kind of voucher system that has so far defeated the
Poles?
Will owners and managers be found who are capable of steering the giant
enterprises of the former Soviet economy within a competitive market
economy?
Can the government make bankruptcy a credible sanction against their
failure?
Last, but far from least, can the government avoid the need for
comprehensive prior restructuring of unviable enterprises and, if not, does
it have the resources, both human and financial, to bring such restructuring
about?
Privatisation is, it is now clear, no magic wand. The Polish precedent shows
that Russia will be struggling with the industrial legacy of the Soviet
state for years, if not decades. Nevertheless, if the government were to
achieve even a small part of what it now intends, its counter-revolution
should prove irreversible.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (2): Starting down a bumpy
road to the market - After the fumblings of the Gorbachev era, Boris
Yeltsin's government of young technocrats at last takes reform in hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF

<TEXT>
YEGOR GAIDAR, Russia's dynamic young deputy prime minister in charge of
economic reform, deserves sympathy.
Working with his team of equally young ministers, under the leadership of
President Boris Yeltsin, he is engaged in perhaps the most difficult and
ambitious programme of economic and social reform ever undertaken. Yet not
only are the people at large sullen and the apparatchiks of the former
regime volubly opposed; but even the small band of westernised intellectuals
criticises the government at every turn.
They complain of the failure to start structural reforms before price
liberalisation; they complain of the failure to privatise housing; they
complain of the failure to de-monopolise industry; they complain of the
failure to sustain monetary coordination throughout the the former Soviet
Union; and they complain of the harshness of the monetary squeeze. Soon they
will convince the people that their difficulties are owed to the present
government, not to its predecessors.
Indicators of acute economic crisis
They will not convince the government itself. As it told the International
Monetary Fund in its Memorandum of Economic Policies of February 1992, 'by
the beginning of this decade, the economy was in a state of acute crisis,
marked by declining output, accelerating inflation, obsolescent capital
stock, pervasive distortions in the relative price structure, serious
structural imbalances, and severe ecological problems.'
This is, if anything, an understatement. Russia is the largest remnant of a
defeated and bankrupt empire. Of that there is one nigh on perfect
indicator: so despised has the Soviet ruble become that at present market
exchange rates, Russia's annualised gross national product in the first
quarter of 1992 was smaller than Belgium's.
Consider the government's short term inheritance:
Falls in the former Soviet Union's measured gross national product of 4 per
cent in 1990 and 13 per cent last year.
External debt of over Dollars 80bn and virtually no foreign exchange
reserves.
Rapid declines during 1990 and 1991 in production and export of oil,
Russia's most valuable single commodity.
Real industrial wages up by over 20 per cent between 1987 and 1990, and by
still more in 1991, if only on paper, despite falling productivity.
Years of fiscal profligacy, culminating last year in a budget deficit for
the Union of 20 per cent of GNP.
A monetary overhang at the end of 1991 of large, but unknown dimensions.
A debauched currency shared by 15 largely uncoordinated central banks.
And a breakdown of economic relations among enterprises and, still more,
among republics.
No government would wish to start from here. But reform could hardly have
started from anywhere else. Only the bunglings of the Gorbachev era could
have made radical reform inevitable. How, other than in the name of
perestroika, could the command system created by Stalin have been so
thoroughly dismantled?
Yet that very bungling makes successful reform exasperatingly difficult.
For, as was the case in Poland in 1989, though to a still greater extent,
the Russian government starts with a severe stabilisation crisis, itself a
symptom of the breakdown of the Soviet state.
As Mr Gaidar remarks with justified bitterness, 'we have had three years of
strongly negative growth from 1988 to 1991. We paid for the absence of
reforms: now we must pay for reforms. We cannot stand three more years of
that: one year only (1992) is possible.'
Mistakes should be judged with tolerance
So bleak an inheritance means that the efforts of the government should be
regarded with sympathy and its mistakes judged with tolerance. But it also
offers a ray of hope: can a country so rich in resources, yet so extravagant
in their waste, not do better?
On 28 October 1991, President Boris Yeltsin, freed by the failed August coup
from both the communist party and the Soviet government, announced a
programme of radical reform focusing on economic stabilisation, financial
reform and privatisation.
Then, on 19 December the government approved the liberalisation of most
prices, except only for a few staple foodstuffs (including vodka), energy
(particularly oil) and housing.
The decision to liberalise prices was, and remains, controversial. It
violates, for example, the sequence recommended in the 500 day programme for
radical reform put forward at the end of 1990 by a group headed by President
Gorbachev's close adviser at that time, Stanislav Shatalin. That programme
recommended starting with structural change, including radical
privatisation, before price liberalisation.
The government started with price liberalisation for four main reasons:
Reduction in the huge budget deficit would be impossible if subsidies were
not dramatically reduced.
Shortages, queues, and grey and black marketeering were social cancers.
Both greater competition and reductions in waste require sensible prices.
The easiest thing for a government that wishes to show it means business is
to stop doing things that are harmful, like controlling prices.
Yet the best indication that formal price liberalisation is, indeed, not
enough is the chaotic expansion of street trading that followed the
government's controversial decree on freedom of trade. This was a crisis
measure, which allowed people to take goods from the official distribution
chain - be it by the front or the back door - and resell them.
As a result, the pavements of Moscow now host one of the world's most
densely thronged street bazaars.
Surge in prices has eliminated queues
As happened elsewhere, notably in Poland, prices rose by far more than
expected: three and a half times in the first month even on official
figures.
The surge in prices has lowered the unrealistic official estimates of real
incomes by 40 per cent. But it has also eliminated the shortages and queues
that reflected not only the gap between wages and the value of output, but
also the 'monetary overhang', or unspendable store of roubles.
At the end of last year the stock of broad money (M2 on the Russian
definition) was about 80 per cent of GDP. By the end of March 1992 that
ratio had fallen to below a quarter.
Inevitably, money became very short, particularly cash, the demand for which
(at the present face value of the notes) surpassed the capacity of the four
printing plants (all located in Russia): many workers have been told that
there is no cash for their wages.
Substantial progress has been achieved on the budget deficit. Mr Gaidar
insists that in the first three months of the year the budget was balanced:
the Ministry of Finance says there was a deficit of about 1 1/2 per cent of
gross domestic product on an expenditure basis and 5 per cent on the basis
of commitments, although international financial institutions suspect it may
be over 10 per cent.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Finance has achieved something that has eluded
most post-Communist governments: the establishment of a reliable source of
revenue independent of profits in the state enterprise sector.
Revenue from value-added tax has risen from Rbs10.5bn (roughly Dollars 80m
at the market exchange rate) in January, to Rbs54bn in March. To this will
soon be added taxation of both domestic consumption and exports of oil and
gas as their prices are raised towards world levels.
After initial difficulties in January, following the introduction of a new
system of export taxation, export performance has also recovered.
Postponement of the export taxes, introduction of a market exchange rate for
hard currency and curtailment of administrative regulations reversed the
decline in exports at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, rescheduling of
payments of principal on medium- and long-term loans due in 1992 has saved
Russia Dollars 11bn of the Dollars 21bn that comes due this year.
The action so far has had a high, if predictable, price: industrial output
is estimated by the government to have fallen by 13 per cent in the first
quarter of 1992 below the level of a year before.
The behaviour of Russian large enterprises has been similar to that in other
post-communist countries. The failure of such large enterprises to respond
in ways that would make sense in a market economy is the central problem of
post-communist reform. The problem for government is that it can do almost
nothing with these enterprises, but can also do little without them.
Soaring debts
The combination of price liberalisation with credit control has been greeted
by higher prices, lower output, non-payment of debts due to other
enterprises (with such debts soaring to some 20 per cent of GNP within a
little over three months) and screams of anguish.
The response has been made worse by the collapse in military expenditures.
These were once somewhere between 15 and 25 per cent of Soviet GDP, but are
now down to a mere 8 per cent of Russian GDP in the first quarter of 1992.
The catatonia of the larger state enterprises is predictable. Since the
'reforms' embodied in the Law on State Enterprises of 1987, enterprises
answer almost entirely to their managers and, still more, to their workers.
Russia is no longer a country of 'state capitalism'. Yugoslav
self-management is a more relevant parallel.
The principal concern of such enterprises is with meeting their wage bills
and preserving employment. In the short term, their behaviour can only be
changed by starving them of money. But the problem with starving enterprises
of money is that they are little more frightened of the government than it
is of them. They, too, have a sanction: the social consequences of their own
collapse.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, says he has noticed an
encouraging shift in the petitions of the steady stream of enterprise
managers he receives in his office in the former Gosplan state planning
commission building in the centre of Moscow: they no longer assume he can
help them with supplies, but want him to dole out cheap money. He claims he
tells them to cut their prices, wages and staff, instead.
Mr Nechayev also expects Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to sign a
decree on bankruptcy. This will allow the government to force 10 or 15
companies into liquidation, he says: a small beginning, but an important
demonstration to others of the consequence of failure. But can the
government force, or even permit, more than a handful of enterprises to
close, when the result will be huge increases in open unemployment?
Inextricably linked to the behaviour of enterprises is that of wages.
'Given the rapid growth of wages in the material sphere in the latter part
of 1991 and early 1992', says the government in its memorandum to the IMF,
'which risks fuelling inflation and may cause unnecessary unemployment, the
government is prepared if necessary to introduce measures to prevent
excessive growth in wages.'
The chances are that it will have to. Here too, however the question is
whether the government will be prepared to allow the bankruptcies that alone
would make the envisaged wage tax effective.
Macroeconomic control is, in fact, almost impossible without changes in the
structure and ownership of enterprises. It is largely because of the scale
of inter-enterprise indebtedness that the government has felt it necessary
to authorise Rbs200bn in extra investment credits from the Central Bank of
Russia over the next six months.
Mr Nechayev has also put aside Rbs42bn to assist defence conversion and
another Rbs40bn for social protection of displaced workers in the military
sector (neither being very much, given the scale of the problems).
Pressures from the economy (and the budget) are more likely to undermine
monetary control than the widely discussed policy differences between the
government and the central bank.
Mr Gyorgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, for example,
insists he has no fundamental disagreement with government. Mr Nechayev says
that 'we don't fully believe in the top managers of the Central Bank, but if
they resign now, it won't necessarily be better than if they stay.'
Mr Gaidar himself now argues that the Russian economy needs to be
'remonetised'. Unfortunately, the monetary grease is to be provided by the
central bank.
The Central Bank of Russia is expecting an increase in the money supply of
between 50 and 120 per cent this year. Some of that will come from
monetisation of the budget deficit, expected by the government to be about 5
per cent of GDP.
A credit line to the Ministry of Finance of Rbs67bn has just been
established. Far more will come from the Rbs200bn promised to enterprises.
Applying the multiplier of 2-2.5 on central bank credit deemed normal in
Russia, the total credit expansion already agreed is Rbs700-850bn, or about
50 per cent of recent levels.
Russia's central bankers do, indeed, tend to see their job as providing
credit to the economy. The effect of the rate of interest on the willingness
to hold money, for example, is outside their customary way of thinking.
It was with reluctance, therefore, that the central bank was persuaded to
raise its discount rate to over 50 per cent in early April, even though
inflation was estimated at almost 20 per cent in March alone (an annual rate
of over 700 per cent). With huge energy price rises in prospect, inflation
is likely to continue at a torrid rate.
Programme ahead
The government's programme for the rest of the year and beyond covers:
Privatisation by auction of small-scale shops and enterprises (now started
in just a few cities) in 1992.
Private ownership of land; privatisation of food production and
distribution.
De-monopolisation of industry; commercialisation of larger enterprises and
their mass privatisation in 1993.
Creation of an adequate social safety net.
Further price liberalisation, including the raising of energy prices to
world levels.
Liberalisation of international trade.
And resident convertibility of the rouble on current account.
None of this will be easy. Some of it will be hugely difficult. Small scale
privatisation is feasible and desirable. Privatisation of large scale
enterprise will turn out to be far more difficult than the government
imagines.
If experience elsewhere is any guide, ministers will be driven to industrial
policy, but will fail to make a success of it. Meanwhile, any safety net
could be swiftly broken by a large increase in unemployment.
Energy prices must be raised if the economy is to be more efficient (not to
mention less polluting). The government has announced its intention to raise
the of oil from Rbs350 price per tonne to between Rbs1,800 and Rbs2,200 and
achieve parity with world energy prices by the end of 1993.
Domestic taxation of oil and gas is expected to amount to 4.7 per cent of
GDP and taxation of exports, largely of oil and gas, to 9.1 per cent of GDP
in the last nine months of 1992, according to the government's February
memorandum to the IMF.
These taxes - up from very little in the first quarter of 1992 - will be
paid by domestic consumers and, above all, by those in other members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. Offsetting subsidies or credits will be
necessary, at least for a transitional period, if output is not to collapse.
The planned convertible and fixed exchange rate will increase competition in
the economy as well as provide a degree of monetary stability. Equally, the
government is right to believe the present market exchange rate is highly
undervalued. To give only one indication, at recent exchange rates of
Rbs123-130 to the dollar, Russia's exports are almost as large as its GDP.
Should the nominal rate not appreciate before it is fixed, the result will
be real appreciation through domestic inflation. This is what has happened
since December 1991. The real value of the market exchange rate for the cash
ruble has appreciated more than six times, but only because of domestic
inflation.
Exchange convertibility demands monetary control and monetary control
demands curbs on emission in other republics of the CIS. But this Gordian
knot the government has decided to cut, by the simple expedient of making
the rouble Russian.
Key questions
Nothing is easier than raising questions about the likely performance - or,
indeed, survival - of the Russian government:
Can a legal culture supportive of private enterprise be established in
Russia's barren soil?
How high might unemployment go and how well will Russians cope with it?
Can Russia finance a politically and socially adequate safety net?
Will it be possible to create the minimum needed cooperation over trade and
payments among the main members of the CIS?
Can small enterprises and farming be privatised quickly?
Can large state enterprises be restructured and privatised and, if so, how
much time will it take?
How long will it be before economic growth resumes?
How far can one rely on the patience of the Russian people?
With IMF membership agreed, how soon will the West's Dollars 24bn be
available and how much difference might it make?
The questions come easily. So do criticisms. It is not true, for example,
that there are no alternatives to what the government is trying to do. There
are. But few offer anything other than disaster. This is at the least a
dynamic and convinced reforming government, if one starting on a long and
difficult road.
It will need much help from abroad and much patience at home. It will need
luck as well. But it offers a chance, inevitably no more, of what the world
wants: economic recovery and political stability in Russia.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (1): The pessimists have
so far been confounded - Russia's political and social fabric has borne
recent shocks with astonishing resilience
</HEADLINE>

A RUSSIA reforming is a vertiginous place. So many questions are open: so
many issues are not resolved, the resolution of so many of these seems
unattainable; so many movements and trends point to deepening chaos; and
yet, so many signs of hope and optimism now appear from beneath the
constitutional and institutional rubble of the collapsed Soviet imperium.
The best of times for chroniclers, it is the worst of times for forecasters:
who, either Russian or foreigner, could weigh with a hope of certainty, the
competing masses of threats and possibilities?
Say the Russian people must rise against the privations they are
experiencing, and you must counterpoise a history of stoic endurance of much
worse.
Say the shoots of enterprise are bursting out, and court instant
contradiction by a still powerful, enterprise-hating bureaucrat.
Say that the centre cannot make its writ run throughout the country now that
Party and state control has collapsed, and you must at the same time admit
that Washington DC had little purchase on many of the states of the Union at
the same time as the US was bounding ahead of the old world a century ago.
Pessimists and optimists both find themselves on shifting ground, confounded
by the last person they met. Such is the nature of the continuing Russian
revolution: the judgments made on its outcomes in more settled times will no
doubt trace lines of inevitability: they are not apparent now.
In times no more settled but more predictable, two years ago, the FT
published a large survey on what was still not the former Soviet Union. Its
motif was less of reform than of disintegration: of national and economic
struggles still constrained by a weight of a Party which sought to
monopolise political activity everywhere except, arguably, the Baltics: of
the maintenance of a Union which, for example, the Ukraine, still dourly
upheld.
Much of what has happened since that time was still held then, by Russians
and other Soviets and foreigners, as unthinkably dangerous. It is one of the
signs of hope that few of these dangers have (yet) come to pass.
The collapse of Union and Party authority since that time has been more or
less complete, though of course the effects will still course through
politics here and abroad for years to come.
The putsch in August of last year delivered a coup de grace to a political
process which was pretty far advanced - clearing the way for national
agendas which had been held in check by, among other things, fear of just
such a reaction. The fear, however, was of one rather better organised and
more ruthless than the real thing luckily turned out to be.
RUSSIA, with half-Russian inhabited Kazakhstan, clung on to the Union longer
than any other state: it signed the Union treaty which Mr Mikhail Gorbachev
(now a pensioner) had begged and wheedled all to acknowledge.
But months before Mr Gorbachev read his uncharacteristically brief statement
of resignation just before last Christmas, it was clear this was an empty
shell: and Russia, with the two other Slav states of Ukraine and Belorussia,
had become a founder member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, later
extended to all other former Soviet republics save the three Baltic
countries and Georgia - which, under the leadership of Mr Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, refused to accede on the grounds that it was a front for
Russian imperialism and now, under the leadership of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,
is not signing because the CIS has proved to be a front for nothing very
much at all.
It is still a little too early to write the obituary of the commonwealth:
later this week, the leaders of the commonwealth should meet in Tashkent, in
Uzbekistan, for what the most enthusiastic of the CIS presidents, Mr
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, has said must be a make-or-break
meeting.
None of the elements which must necessarily attend a successful co-operative
alliance state have been developed: there is no functioning autonomous
centre: no mechanism for confronting disputes except bilateral contacts
(which could function as well between states not linked in the CIS); less
and less of a common army, as Russia, the paymaster of the 'CIS forces' now
concentrates on building up its own military.
The only function it seems to have is that which Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
subtle Ukrainian president, has outlined for it: of seeking to conduct a
civilised divorce.
Even that, however, is not yet really being undertaken: there has been no
division of Union property, except on the rough justice principle of each
state taking what is on its territory - thus producing the absurdity of
little Belorussia being a 'nuclear power,' and of poor Kazakhstan having the
capacity, at Baikanur, to launch satellites.
This leaves Russia on its own: a nation shorn of its external Soviet (and
Tsarist) empire - though containing, in the numerous ethnic groups within
its borders, the traces of much earlier imperial expansion.
As Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, saw just about two years ago,
Russia was the prize which was most desirable to win as the Union faltered
and fell.
His political instincts gave him a better feeling for the movement of forces
than was apparently available to Mr Gorbachev, and has left him in command
as the former struggles to retain his visibility on the sidelines.
Yet Mr Yeltsin's inheritance is a daunting one, even for a spirit as
resilient as his has proved to be. Like the symbols of Soviet power which
remain everywhere visible throughout Russia, the economy, the society and
the institutions remain substantially unreformed and retain a large latent
power, if not to recover a former authority, then certainly to block change
and to force compromise.
At the Congress of Peoples' Deputies in April, it was apparent that the
majority of that particular unreformed body - whose deputies still owed
their election to the system under which seats were allocated to the Party
and its front organisations - was hostile to the government's economic
reforms, in revolt against the special presidential powers to select the
government and push through decrees and reluctant to even discuss new drafts
of a constitution.
Declaration of support
Under the pressure of the government's threatened resignation, the
parliament was led to agree a declaration of support for the economic
reforms: but Mr Yeltsin was put under notice to propose a new government,
including a replacement for himself as Prime Minister, within three months -
while the draft constitutions were not even brought to the floor of the
Congress.
In this case, the unreformed nature of the Congress suited Mr Yeltsin and
the government: for had it been democratically elected, with a clear mandate
from the people, its criticisms and decisions would have carried more
weight.
As it is, Mr Yeltsin is able to again go to the country with his own version
of a constitution crafted to give him, as President, full powers to appoint
governments and to issue decrees.
His supporters in the democratic parties are now setting about collecting
the necessary a million signatures to hold such a referendum: it will be
divisive, but he must now assume that his popularity, and the present lack
of an alternative figure to challenge his pre-eminence as a politician, will
see it through.
He can also profit by the disarray among the emerging political parties and
groups. The communists, now under various banners, showed, during the
Congress, that they had little force on their own: only when allied to the
nationalists could they be decisive.
However, that alliance is a distrustful and tense one, with each group
seeking to maximise its position and often enmired in ideological disputes
of little interest to the public.
The various democrats are similarly split and distrustful, but with various
degrees of reluctance are prepared to back the government programme, and the
president, for lack of an alternative.
The next few months are a critical period: the government, having won
support from the Group of Seven countries and the IMF to the tune of Dollars
24bn in backing for their economic programme, must now implement it: the
government must keep credit tight, attempt to move towards rouble
convertibility, put more effort behind privatisation of small businesses and
the transformation of the larger state companies into joint stock
enterprises.
If they succeed, they will force companies to adapt: that adaptation will,
in turn, cause bankruptcies and unemployment - the malign result of a
much-needed movement.
More shocks are yet to come. The political and social fabric has so far
borne such shocks with astonishing resilience, confounding the pessimists at
home and abroad.
Russia, today, is a much more open, much less threatening place, with
relatively free media and with a broad space given to the profession of
faith and opinion.
The potential for reaction and chaos is clear: yet the possibilities for its
full membership of and integration in world society has never been greater.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (4): All change on the misery line -
Fast trains will soon bring the area within 100 minutes of London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINS WILL leave King's Cross station in London this morning within three
minutes of each other. One, the 08.45, boasts air conditioning, comfort and
a full restaurant service. The other, the 08.48, has less style. It is
cramped and spartan, and the heating is erratic.
At 11.06 both trains should be pulling into stations. The first will have
raced more than 230 miles north to Darlington; the second will have rattled
less than 100 miles across the fens to King's Lynn.
While distant parts of Britain are served by modern high-speed trains, west
Norfolk is linked to London by an indirect and unreliable service. The
rolling stock is vintage: Eden was prime minister when it was new; and
railway enthusiasts regard the semaphore signals as memorabilia.
There are few railway enthusiasts among the passengers who travel regularly
across the dull flat landscape to King's Lynn. They have endured a shabby
service for years on this dead-end line, one of British Rail's more
neglected routes. But this is about to change.
BR is spending Pounds 20m on electrifying the line and Pounds 12m on new
signalling. In spite of several delays, the work should be completed by
August and fast trains will bring west Norfolk within 100 minutes of London.
Norfolk councillors claim that the credit for the improved rail link lies
not with BR or the Department of Transport but with local government
officials.
They saw their chance for electrification in 1986 when the 40-mile spur from
Cambridge to King's Lynn was included in Network SouthEast rather than the
diesel-minded Regional Railways.
Aware that Network SouthEast favoured electric services, council planners
lobbied hard for King's Lynn to be plugged into the grid. Costs could be
kept down, they argued, by using equipment left over from the
electrification of the east coast mainline which was stored at Peterborough.
BR was not convinced. They were persuaded to proceed only after King's Lynn
and West Norfolk borough council agreed to make good any losses on the
newly-electrified line. This revenue guarantee scheme could cost the council
Pounds 650,000 over the next five years, but Adrian Parker, the borough
planning officer, thinks it is a worthwhile investment.
'Electrification would not have happened without local authority
intervention. BR was relatively willing but the Department of Transport was
hostile, so we had to put together the revenue guarantee scheme,' he says.
As part of the rail improvements, several stations will be upgraded and
councillors hope there will be increasing use of the freight marshalling
yard at King's Lynn. The yard could be developed to serve the town's docks,
where freight traffic is carried on a twice-weekly service to Hamburg
operated by the German Washbay Line.
The port is dominated by coal shipments from Germany and Poland and exports
of grain and scrap. But the docks are under-used compared with their heyday
in the 1800s when they were run by 'old sixty-sixers' - dockers who worked
from 6am to 6pm to load and unload cargo.
Now councillors hope to stimulate a new boom by promoting services to
Hamburg as the best route to reach markets in eastern Europe.
Road hauliers, however, say the problem is not access to eastern Europe but
access to East Anglia. Too many trunk roads are handicapped by single-lane
traffic and routes where slow-moving farm machinery can cause long delays.
The Freight Transport Association says: 'It is a difficult region in terms
of roads. The east coast ports offer the best routes to the (European)
single market, so we are anxious to see the principal routes improved.'
The Department of Transport (DoT) denies trunk roads are being neglected. It
is funding improvements to three routes which pass through west Norfolk: the
A47 from Peterborough to Great Yarmouth; the A10 from King's Lynn to London;
and the A17 King's Lynn to Newark. More than Pounds 236m is being spent on
the A47; Pounds 32m on the A10 north of Cambridge; and Pounds 45m on the
A17.
Most of this expenditure involves widening single-lane roads or converting
them to dual-carriageway. The borough council, which wants all three trunk
roads converted to dual- carriageway, thinks the DoT has under-estimated
traffic flows.
'The growth in heavy traffic has been so rapid it is in danger of exceeding
the figures planned for the year 2000,' says Adrian Parker. 'We need
dual-carriageways but (improvements) have been under-funded. East Anglia as
a whole has been grossly under-funded.'
Better trunk routes should make King's Lynn the gateway from the east
Midlands to the coastal ports, but Mr Parker thinks the region needs 15
years of road improvements before the town can fully assume that status. In
the meantime, he hopes faster rail services and improvements to secondary
roads will attract developers and new residents.
The town is looking southwards for its future. It sees itself as an
overspill site for homebuyers and businesses which cannot be accommodated in
Cambridge. More than 150 hectares of the town's Hardwick industrial park
have been earmarked for expansion and electric rail services should make it
an attractive option for commuters to the university city.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (5): Anxiety over drought - Threat to
vegetable crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMING in West Norfolk is facing a potential crisis. Producers are warning
of deteriorating output and fear their livelihoods are at risk because they
can no longer rely on a basic natural resource - water.
A succession of hot summers and dry winters has led to one of the longest
droughts this century, and some farms in East Anglia - the so-called
'breadbasket of England' - may not survive without heavy and sustained
rainfall.
Farmers in the region have now endured 45 months of drought, forcing them to
revise production plans and install costly irrigation equipment. They are
now contemplating another difficult year following a winter in which average
rainfall has fallen by almost 30 per cent.
The main victims of this shortfall are not the farmers practising
prairie-style cereal production, although that too has been affected, but
the vegetable growers who depend on careful irrigation of their crops.
More than 16,000 hectares of West Norfolk are used for growing crops such as
potatoes, carrots and salad vegetables.
The farmers working this land warn that yields could be halved if water
supplies run dry, and they fear the quality of their produce may fail to
meet the rigorous standards set by their leading customers - the
supermarkets.
For many of these farmers the 'villain of the piece' is the National Rivers
Authority (NRA). It controls water supplies through irrigation licences and
can impose restrictions and a total ban in times of shortage.
Last summer the NRA banned crop irrigation is some areas and producers fear
a similar move this year could threaten their businesses.
Concern over water restrictions increased last month when the NRA announced
more than 40 areas of eastern England where farmers using spray irrigators
could face restrictions.
Mr Roger Hyde, the NRA's regional general manager, warns: 'We face a very
difficult year and we have already told more than 3,000 abstractors (farmers
who use surface and ground water reserves) of the need to conserve water.
'Despite recent rainfall, underground resources remain at low levels and it
is here that the risk factor has increased since last year.'
Anxious to avoid restrictions on irrigation, the larger vegetable producers
have invested heavily to install reservoirs enabling them to store water for
summer use.
John Shropshire &amp; Sons, one of East Anglia's largest vegetable producers,
has spent about Pounds 100,000 on reservoirs. A spokesman for the company,
which covers several farms including one at Southery near King's Lynn,
describes the reservoirs as an 'insurance policy' for the group's Pounds 32m
turnover.
Many smaller farms, however, cannot afford such an outlay and they could be
hit hard by NRA limits on water use - 'those who can't invest in reservoirs
may have to give up growing vegetables,' according to the John Shropshire
spokesman, who adds: 'There might be a switch of vegetable production out of
East Anglia to other areas where they have more water.'
The prospect of lasting water shortages has already encouraged some farmers
to diversify into non-production activities such as field sports - clay
pigeon shooting and fishing - and conversion of farm buildings for light
industrial and residential use.
Ironically, vegetable production could cease to be lucrative for all but the
richest producers just at the time when farmers in other sectors - cereals
and livestock - are considering it as an alternative source of income. Crops
such as potatoes and peas look an attractive option to some farmers because
they are not subject to quotas or levies imposed in Brussels. In the EC
there is already a free market in vegetables, so producers will not face the
upheaval expected in other sectors following the proposed withdrawal of
subsidies when the Common Agricultural Policy is reformed.
Existing vegetable producers, however, warn that newcomers could exhaust
limited water supplies and lead to cut-throat competition.
Other farmers, meanwhile, have diversified into livestock which can be
farmed extensively and at low cost. East Anglia is not an area well-known
for sheep but there are more than 28,000 in west Norfolk alone, and sales at
the livestock market in King's Lynn have grown fivefold in recent years.
'We are now selling about 1,000 sheep a week,' says Mr Barry Hawkins of Lynn
Market. Pig sales, he adds, have doubled in the past year.
Livestock farms, however, are relatively unimportant to the west Norfolk
economy compared with crop production. There are 46 farms relying on sheep,
cattle, pigs and poultry, compared with more than 450 holdings involved in
general cropping and vegetables, according to figures from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
It is these farmers who are facing serious problems caused by water
shortages. The National Farmers' Union, which represents about 2,000 members
in Norfolk, is anxious to reach an agreement with the NRA over irrigation
which will safeguard production. The union is proposing a deal in which the
region will be divided into designated areas where farmers agree to use only
half the water allowed to them under their irrigation licences. In return,
the NRA has been asked to guarantee no restrictions on that reduced supply.
Although one group of west Norfolk farmers has agreed such a deal in the
River Lark catchment area, NRA officials remain dubious about whether there
will be many other agreements.
If the drought continues, the NRA says it will have no alternative but to
impose restrictions on supplies, and officials warn: 'If farmers ignore
restrictions, they will be prosecuted.'
In the worst scenario, producers who cannot afford to install reservoirs and
then flout NRA limits in order to save their crops could face heavy fines
and may have to abandon the business altogether. That threat has already
encouraged some farms to amalgamate in a bid to cut overheads by sharing
equipment and resources.
The drought has left farmers facing increased costs and the likelihood of
produce which cannot command top prices. The future for those who are not
able to farm on an industrial scale may be bleak.
Mr John Biles, regional director for the NFU in East Anglia, says: 'We know
that we're going to be worse off. Farmers will have to accept further losses
or combine or sell.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (6): Versatility the key to success -
The port of King's Lynn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORT of King's Lynn has weathered the recession better than many. It has
just received the biggest single investment for 100 years and its diversity
and versatility have been the key to the port's ability to weather the
economic storm.
In April a new Pounds 3m quay was opened by Associated British Ports, owner
of the port, and by August a Pounds 1m Leibherr crane from Austria should be
in place. For Mr David George, manager, these are tangible signs of his
company's confidence in the port's future.
Port traffic totalled just over 1m tonnes in 1991 compared with 1.35m tonnes
in 1987.
'Even though there's a recession we've held our own. It was very nice to get
above the 1m mark in a very difficult year, and this year we've got off to a
good start,' Mr George says.
'The strength of the port is that we can handle anything and are blessed
with lots of equipment.'
The new Riverside Quay, built entirely with ABP money, was constructed on
schedule by May Gurney and Co of Norwich. ABP has firm belief in investing
for general infrastructure development - 'trade has grown steadily over the
last 40 years, the east coast is building traffic levels and we want to keep
our share.'
ABP also spent Pounds 500,000 on a new transit shed last year.
'Because the new berth is on the river, we can bring up ships which cannot
come through the lock which has a maximum beam of 13.8m. That's all right
for most short sea ships, but the dock can only accommodate a 3,000-tonne
cargo. On the river, beam will be no problem, ships can go to a better
length and we can go up to a 5,000 tonnes cargo, depending on the tides.
It's a big leap forward. Our strength is being well-placed in the Wash,
central for business - this is one of the reasons we have the confidence to
invest; we want our share of the next 10 to 20 years' growth.'
Unusually, ABP retained control of stevedoring at the port after the
abolition of the dock labour scheme in 1989, when it cut the number of
employees from 120 to 53: all are on personal contract, industrial relations
are good and productivity has improved.
The port exports almost exclusively grain and sugar beet pellets. Imports
are fertiliser and animal feed, which go largely to the agricultural areas
of West Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, timber and steel for the Midlands and,
crucially, 18,000 Skoda cars a year. The cars, and Zetor tractors, are
brought in by Washbay Line, a customer of the port for 40 years, and
conveyed to a Skoda factory one mile up the road where they are finished
before distribution to dealers. Washbay Line runs a twice weekly service to
Hamburg and its two adaptable vessels were purpose-built for King's Lynn's
docks.
The general trading areas for the port are the former Soviet Union and
various Baltic states, through Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, northern
France and Spain. Steel comes from Italy, fertiliser from Africa, timber
from Archangel in Russia, and the new quay is expected to expand this
business.
The versatility of the port, Mr George says, has proved vital to its growth
 -'the strength of the place is that we can handle anything - we're blessed
with lots of equipment and we are not dependent on heavy manufacturing, we
are a one voyage charter port.'
ABP owns 88 acres of land and would like a lot more, but it is constrained
by the geography of the port. There is only three acres spare at the end of
the dock, but any further letting would have to be to a port-related
activity.
Mr George sees ample room for improvement in the road transport links to
King's Lynn, particularly along the east-west corridor - 'the case is
proved, but investment in roads comes from the south and is not scheduled to
reach us until the year 2000.'
Diversity is the keyword for Mr John Latus who runs Anglia Shipping, which
he sold to Anglian Agricultural Merchants in 1987 and bought back in
November 1991. A shipping agent who handles chartering, haulage and
warehousing, he takes pride in the company's ability to do anything and
everything.
'Business has been good in the last three years because our diversity has
enabled us to swap from one thing to another without difficulty. The new
quay will open up business opportunities for us.'
Anglia Shipping also brings in timber from Scandinavia and Russia, a
seasonal trade which usually starts in March but which this year has been
delayed until May because of Russia's foreign currency shortage. Mr Latus is
confident that trade with the former Soviet Union will survive despite its
present problems.
A 70-strong Fisher Fleet operates out of the port, all shrimpers, mussel and
cockle dredgers, employing about 200 men in what has become a rapidly
changing industry as directives from the EC have forced through new working
practices.
Mr Chris Beach, deputy clerk of the Eastern Sea Fisheries Joint Committee,
with which all the boats are registered, has witnessed the change - 'fishing
practices had hardly changed from medieval times to about 10 years ago, but
now, with the advent of new shellfish hygiene rules from Brussels, the UK
has had to come up to date.
'Fishermen used to go shrimping twice a week, cook them at sea and negotiate
with the customer - now they're tied to a processing plant but it will take
all the shrimps he can get, so it has meant an end to boom or bust for the
fleet.'
The 12-mile channel into the Wash and the pilotage for ships coming into the
dock are controlled by the King's Lynn Conservancy Board, under the steady
hand of Mr Maurice Kiddle, general manger and clerk. The board also owns
South Quay, leased by King's Lynn Silos, which last year exported 100,000
tonnes of grain.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (3): A well-kept secret is about to
be revealed - Old Hanseatic links are being revived in a bid to attract more
visitors / Tourism has become one of the most important employers in the
area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AT THE north end of King's Lynn, the last fishermen's yard in the old
fishing quarter, next to the port, has been rescued from oblivion. Here, at
True's Yard, two tiny restored cottages stand testimony to the days of
fishing under sail and form a home for decades of maritime data.
Just around the corner there is a different sort of local colour - the
tattooist's shop window displaying an astonishing variety of designs.
Walk through a couple of twisty, narrow streets and you suddenly find
yourself in the Tuesday Market Place, a huge car park most of the week but
transformed on Tuesdays and Fridays into the market for which it was
designed in the twelfth century.
Around the marketplace stand the handsome merchants' houses dating from the
prosperous days when King's Lynn was one of just half a dozen English ports
allowed to join the Hanseatic League, a protective trading partnership of
north European merchants established in the fourteenth century.
Banks, hotels, pubs and other businesses may have come and gone in the
marketplace, but its character and beauty are undiminished. Go south along
the east side of town, avoiding the ugly, pedestrianised High Street, taking
in the Guildhall of St George, the oldest guildhall in England and home to
the annual King's Lynn Festival, the ornate Customs House built in 1683, and
arrive at Saturday Market, a focal point of the town since the early 1100s.
It, too, houses cars every day except, naturally, market day on Saturdays.
Here stands St Margaret's Church, begun in 1100 by the first Bishop of
Norwich, completed in the thirteenth century and largely rebuilt in the
eighteenth century.
At the front door are marked the flood tides which have reached it - the
last and worst was on January 11, 1978. Opposite, stand two buildings with
chequerboard flintwork: the Victorian Town Hall and the Guildhall of the
Holy Trinity, built in 1421 and home of King's Lynn's treasured regalia,
including the renowned King John Cup and Sword (both fourteenth century,
made at least 100 years after John's death).
The attractions of King's Lynn have been West Norfolk's best-kept secret,
according to Mr John Barrett, head of tourism and leisure for King's Lynn
and West Norfolk Council.
His department is going to change all that. They are about to start a
five-year marketing campaign for the town, drawing extensively on its links
with Germany through the Hanseatic League.
'There is a unanimity among people of the town that we have by no means
reached the full potential for visitors without spoiling the facilities,' he
says.
Tourism has become the second most important employer in the area after
agriculture since Anglia Canning closed down, but much of the employment is
seasonal.
Mr Barrett's aim is to extend the length of the season as far as possible,
and the promotion of the historic town as a tourism centre is central to
that aim.
In October, the council plans to spend Pounds 80,000 on improvements to the
already excellent tourist information centre (housed in the guildhall
heritage centre) and develop the gaols behind it as a visitor attraction.
Phase two will develop more of the town hall complex with a video to bring
the history of the town to life. Hopes are high for 40-50,000 tourists a
year.
Mr Barrett's brief is a huge one. West Norfolk is England's fifth largest
district council by area with a population of 130,000.
Its traditional catchment areas for tourists are Cambridgeshire,
Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, particularly
Peterborough.
There is also an increasing number of visitors from southern England, Dutch
and German tourists, via Harwich, and a significant number of French.
Although the council also promotes the pretty town of Downham Market and the
watery fens as tourist attractions, the main pull for visitors is the
stretch of coast along the Wash from King's Lynn, up past the royal parks of
Sandringham, the lavender farm at Heacham and on to the neat seaside resort
of Hunstanton. The town (resident population 5,000) receives a million
day-visitors a year and 100,000 staying-visitors (compared with Southend,
which takes in 2.5m day trippers and has a population of 130,000).
Hunstanton does not seem to have been affected by the recession, neither has
it suffered the decline of other British resorts over the last 10 years. The
council began investing in 1981, when it bought the resort's Princess
Theatre, continuing in 1984 with the construction of the seafront Oasis
Leisure Centre, complete with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, toddler
facilities, squash courts and indoor bowls hall.
'We have continued to upgrade and develop facilities,' Mr Barrett says. 'It
represents a huge investment in basic revenue terms in keeping the place
neat, tidy, clean and attractive to visitors, keeping the toilets clean, and
as a result we receive many unsolicited testimonials every year. It costs
us, but we were the only Norfolk resort to win the Blue Flag award (from the
Tidy Britain Group).'
Although Mr Barrett believes there is scope to improve the facilities of
Hunstanton, finding more car parking space would be a problem. The council
is trying to persuade British Rail to reinstate the now defunct King's Lynn
to Hunstanton line with a steam train - a move which proved remarkably
popular along the coast at Sheringham.
Next door to the Oasis centre is The Kingdom of the Sea, a private
development by Pleasureworld which they have since replicated in Great
Yarmouth. It is a hugely successful display of fish in natural settings and,
like the Oasis, provides excellent family entertainment, whatever the
weather outside. Attracting Pleasureworld to Hunstanton was a great success
for the council and they have taken careful note of the little things that
please their customers.
'This was the first development Pleasureworld made in eastern England,
purely because of the number of visitors to Hunstanton and the attention we
pay to our facilities,' says Mr Barrett.
'We lay great emphasis on getting the basics right: the dog warden
concentrates on visitor areas and Hunstanton has the highest proportion of
litter bins - it's what sets us apart.'
His department is also evangelical about their way of doing things and
anxious that everybody who comes into contact with tourists treats them with
care.
To this end, the council has established the West Norfolk Welcome, an
introduction to customer care for retailers which costs little but teaches
the benefits of good service.
'We have one of the most efficient relationships with the the private sector
in any local authority,' Mr Barrett claims with some pride.
'We're always invited to any meeting of any organisation involved with
tourism, and likewise representatives of those bodies attend our tourism sub
committees.'
For the sake of King's Lynn's best-kept secret, one must hope he is not too
successful.

FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (2): Financial service groups
targeted - Manufacturing and agriculture are leading regional employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE still accounts for seven per cent of total employment in West
Norkfolk, compared with a national average of two per cent. There are also
between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs in tourism.
But manufacturing is the main employment sector accounting for more than 40
per cent of jobs, although the largest single private sector employer - on a
year-round basis - is Foster Refrigerator, which employs employs 650 people.
Some of the food processing companies have seasonal workers - thus
Frigoscandia, for example, employs between 730 and 438 at various times of
the year. It has been established there for 26 years.
The manufacturing economy of West Norfolk today is shaped to a great extent
by the influx of companies in the l950s and l960s. They were attracted
either by government grants or the availability of quality raw materials -
namely vegetables and other agricultural products.
Amongst the larger companies there is an emphasis on food processing,
refrigeration and engineering. As in many rural areas, there are number of
small but specialised manufacturing concerns in sectors such furniture
making, crystal glass-blowing and in printing, stationery and artists'
materials supplies.
In the main sector of manufacturing and food processing, some of the
well-known names include Campbell's Soups, Master Foods, Plumrose, Del
Monte, British Sugar and Frigoscandia.
Many of them established factories in the area in the l960s. According to Mr
Nigel Payne,the manufacturing and logistics director of Campbell's Soups,
the location of King's Lynn was chosen in the early 1960s - not only because
government assistance was offered but because of the plentiful supply of
good quality produce such as tomatoes, mushrooms and other vegetables.
Mr Charles Abbs, Frigoscandia's general manager, says: 'We are a frozen food
processor, packer and storer. We pack around 75,000 tonnes a year - of that,
around 25,000 tonnes are either peas or potatoes in some form.'
The company, originally a cold storer, sees itself as service-provider - 'we
don't actually make anything - we package for 'own-label' customers, such as
Tesco and Safeway.'
But Foster Refrigator (UK), although sometimes identified with the
food-processing sector, is a leading manufacturer of refrigeration equipment
for the commercial, retail and hotel sectors. It arrived in King's Lynn in
l965.
Some larger companies were located in the region before government
assistance was available. For example, Dow Chemicals has been in King's Lynn
since the mid-l950s.
Mr Ed de Graaf, the UK manufacturing manager of Dow, says that the company
set up in the area because of its agricultural emphasis and the subsequent
market for insecticides.
Cooper Roller Bearings, which employs 330 in King's Lynn, and describes
itself as a manufacturer of split cylindrical bearings, has been in the area
since the late nineteenth century. It grew out of a company formed by an
inventor called Thomas Cooper who built, sold or rented steam tractors for
agriculture.
Porvair, one of the area's high technology companies, has established an
international reputation in microporous technology was originally part of
the Choride group with facilities in the area.
Sun Electric UK, which employs 250 people in King's Lynn is another high
technology company. It is a subsidiary of Sun Electric Corporation, a world
leader in the supply of vehicle diagnostic, exhaust emission-testing and
wheel service equipment to automotive industries.
The company originally set up a facility in West Norfolk in l967 to service
clients in what was then the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) trading
region of Scandanavia, but not because there were government grants
available.
While companies have found that while the old problem (now about to be
eased) of poor communications has added to transport costs, this difficulty
was more than offset by the relative cheapness of land and property and by
the right labour availability. Mr Ed de Graaf comments: 'King's Lynn is a
relatively low-cost area and we are successful here. We have no thought of
moving.'
There has, however, been one conspicuous casualty of the recession: Anglia
Canners was taken over and closed down with the loss of more than 250 jobs.
But most companies have grown and expanded. Sun Electric, for example, has
invested more than Pounds 1m in recent few years and expanded its factory
space from 55,000 sq feet to 67,000 sq feet.
Campbell's Soups has increased output in volume terms by 40 per cent in the
past 10 years, although with a reduced workforce.
Mr Abbs at Frigoscandia says: 'We have increased our output each year for
the past 10 years, even though there is a static market for frozen
vegetables.'
Although the manufacturing sector in the region is generally in good health,
the area has not attracted larger companies for some time. Given that food
processing is a 'mature' industry, with companies vying for bigger shares of
a stable markets, and given that communications to the region are about to
improve, the local authorities are keen to attract new investment to West
Norkfolk, particularly in the financial services and high technology fields.

FOR LONG a quiet town, somewhat off the present century's beaten tracks,
King's Lynn was not always so. The capital of western Norfolk, between
Norwich 40 miles away and the Fens, King's Lynn was in medieval times one of
England's premier towns, gaining the first of many charters as far back as
1204. It owes its early growth from the 11th century onwards, to its
position on the eastern bank of the Great Ouse estuary, and to the strength
of the East Anglian economy in those times.
The town grew prosperous as a centre for exporting the products of the local
wool trade and for importing the fashionable goods and necessities of the
day from other important centres across the North Sea, in particular the
cities of the Hansaeatic League.
It was after visiting Lynn in 1215 to feast with the burghers that King
John, in one of the best-remembered episodes in English history, lost his
jewels in the Wash, the bight into which the Great Ouse pours its waters.
The legacy of King's Lynn's long period as a great port remains in one of
the finest collections of medieval domestic buildings in England, in its two
market squares, in King Street and Queen Street, and in the lanes which lead
back from them to the town's old wharves.
It boasts two guildhalls, including the oldest in England, the Guildhall of
St George, dating back to the early 15th century, and the Guildhall of the
Holy Trinity from 1421. St. Margaret's church is even older, with parts
going back to the 12th century.
As late as the 18th century, King's Lynn remained a fashionable town, not
quite in the same league as Bath or Cheltenham, but still a desirable resort
in which to spend part of the year.
The most recent boost to the fortunes of the area came in the l960s when an
overspill agreement was signed with London. This has meant a virtual
doubling of the population of King's Lynn to what it is today, just over
40,000. West Norfolk as a whole, which also includes the market town of
Downham Market, as well as the royal estate at Sandringham, and the seaside
resort of Hunstanton, is home to around 135,000 people.
A number of companies, particularly in food-processing and
agriculture-related engineering, have been attracted to the area - partly
through government grants - to supply jobs for the enlarged population. The
region also remains one of the most prominent vegetable growing areas in the
country, although fewer and fewer people are employed in this sector because
of mechanisation.
Though there have been some job losses in the present recession, including
the closure of Anglia Canners at a cost of 200 redundancies, most of the
companies which arrived in l960s and l970s, such as Campbells Soups and Sun
Electric, have remained and many of them have expanded. Unemployment for the
area at just under nine per cent is high for East Anglia, but it is not out
of line with the Midlands or the national average.
The port's potential is limited because of the heavy tidal drop and the
distance from the open sea. But Associated British Ports, the owner,
recently made a Pounds 3m investment in a new dock - as a result, the port
can now accommodate vessels carrying 5,000 tonnes of cargo as opposed to
3,000 tonnes.
The local authority's aim now is to attract high technology or service
employment to capitalise on the area's advantages as a location - 'the
national economy has been changing. There are fewer blue collar or
industrial jobs, and more and more jobs in new white collar service
industries and high technology concerns.
'Frankly, we have not been getting our share of these new industries,'
comments Mr Richard High, the council's chief economic development officer.
The drive to attract new investment is timed to take advantage of British
Rail's decision to electrify the railway line from London to King's Lynn.
This will cut the journey time from well over two hours to 100 minutes.
The new service is due to start next month. To secure it, the King's Lynn
and West Norfolk Borough Council have had to promise a revenue guarantee to
British Rail of Pounds 650,000 over the next five years.
The council has also secured agreement from the Ministry of Transport that
the three routes which pass through West Norfolk, the A10 from King's Lynn
to London, the A17 from King's Lynn to Newark, and the A47 from Peterborough
to Great Yarmouth will all be dualled or upgraded in the next few years.
The rail link is seen as particularly important, as Mr Alan Pask, the chief
executive of the West Norkfolk District Council points out.
'The faster rail service is the key to attracting new investment. From next
month, King's Lynn will be up on the board at King's Cross in London as a
destination. We will be locked into Europe, and the idea that we are remote
and inaccessible will be gone.'
The shorter journey time is not expected to result in large numbers wanting
to commute to London (although Mr Pask points out that by rail King's Lynn
will be closer in journey time to London than Norwich and people do commute
from Norwich).
It will, however, become viable to relocate back office or administrative
functions in West Norfolk while maintaining a small headquarters in London.
Executives will easily be able to travel between the two bases.
It is companies willing to do this that West Norfolk, with the help of
agents in London, is targeting. 'We are targetting companies in the services
or high technology sectors that would employ up to 500 people. We could take
a company wanting to employ 1,000 but not too many of them,' says Mr High.
Apart from better communications, the area has other attractions. The 9 per
cent unemployment rate represents 4,500 mostly skilled male workers. There
is a very low female activity rate. There could be a further 4,000 women
looking for jobs if a bank or insurance company decided to established
itself.
Property and land are also modestly priced. Residential housing can be half
the cost of something similar in the south east. Industrial land costs
Pounds 100,000 an acre - cheap, even compared to Peterborough.
Office rents or rents for B1 office/light industrial properties can be as
low as Pounds 5 to Pounds 6 a sq ft which compares with Pounds 15 in
Cambridge.
One problem is that there is hardly any modern B1 property on the market as
low returns have meant there has been little speculative property
development. There is plenty of land scheduled but very little new B1 type
premises - the kind that high technology companies like to move into - has
been developed. Local authority officials are, however, convinced that this
problem will not be difficult to overcome.
Initially, too, companies which want to design and build their own
properties will be targeted.

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower on
arbitrage-related selling
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE Nikkei average turned lower on arbitrage-related selling,
sentiment remained positive on the strength of the yen and advances in
overseas markets, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 99.56 off at 18,508.53 after a day's high of
18,716.58 and low of 18,486.89. A rise in the futures market had moved
equities higher in the morning.
Volume totalled 400m shares, up from 394m. Dealers led the activity, with
investment trusts and foreigners staying on the buy side. The Topix index of
all first section stocks lost 2.40 to 1,385.81, but advances remained ahead
of declines at the close by 577 to 401, with 154 issues unchanged. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.08 firmer at 1,106.74.
Traders said most participants had become confident that 17,000 is now a
firm support level for the Nikkei. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said
domestic institutions were buying cautiously but not actively chasing the
rally. 'Some institutions expect another buying opportunity at 17,000,' he
added.
A total of 24 issues reached new highs for the year, while three, including
Sekisui Chemical, fell to new lows. Sekisui dropped Y36 to Y885 as
investors, discouraged by the company's losses on securities investment,
continued to sell the shares.
Speculative stocks, which had been bought by dealers, fell on profit-taking.
Meiji Milk Products receded Y29 to Y915 and Morinaga Milk Y8 to Y839.
However, Okamoto, the condom maker, added Y30 at Y1,420 on continued dealer
buying.
Blue chip electricals, which had gained ground on bargain hunting, eased on
light profit-taking by institutions. Sanyo Electric declined Y12 to Y481 and
Toshiba Y2 to Y660.
Housing-related issues rose on firm condominium sales figures for April,
Haseko gaining Y20 to Y635 and Daikyo Y30 to Y1,180.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone recovered Y8,000 to Y646,000. Investors were
encouraged by finance minister Mr Tsutomu Hata's comment that the government
would consider measures to support the stock. The statement follows calls by
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, a business leader, for official support of NTT's share
price.
Foreign investors bought machinery issues. Toshiba Machine climbed Y37 to
Y841 and Hitachi Seiki Y52 to Y600.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 72.67 higher at 21,286.41 in volume of
24.5m shares. Individuals sought low-priced laggards, and textile and
machinery shares advanced.
Roundup
FEATURING the Pacific Rim markets yesterday were Hong Kong and Australia,
the former attaining a new all-time peak and the latter recording its
highest close since last November. Manila was shut for the presidential
elections.
HONG KONG met profit-taking late in the session after gaining nearly 80
points in the first hour. The Hang Seng index ended 73.59 up at 5,705.93,
its first close above 5,700. Turnover was HKDollars 3.65bn.
Cheung Kong rose 40 cents to HKDollars 24.50. Hong Kong Telecom added 35
cents at HKDollars 10.10 after a strong overnight performance in the US,
while HSBC put on 25 cents to HKDollars 44.50.
AUSTRALIA saw strong interest in blue chips. The All Ordinaries index gained
14.7 to 1,676.8 in turnover of ADollars 227.5m.
BHP moved ahead 16 cents to ADollars 14.10 after saying that it planned to
develop an oil and gas field. News Corp added 42 cents at ADollars 21.72
ahead of reporting a rise in net profits for the nine months to March.
SEOUL's composite index closed 1.12 down at 586.40 in turnover of
Won241.2bn.
Hyundai group subsidiaries rose after Mr Chung Ju-yung, the company's
founder and a presidential candidate, pledged to dismantle big
conglomerates. Hyundai Motor gained Won200 to Won17,000 and Hyundai
Engineering &amp; Construction Won500 to Won11,500.
BOMBAY suffered another plunge as a trading scandal widened. The BSE Index
dropped 333.68, or 9.8 per cent, to 3,086.37.
TAIWAN gained ground on bargain hunting following Monday's sharp decline.
The weighted index put on 21.07 to 4,289.24 in TDollars 13.28bn turnover.
NEW ZEALAND's capital index advanced 22.61 to 1,494.95, supported by
overseas buying of Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge. CHH climbed 11
cents to NZDollars 2.58 and Fletcher appreciated 13 cents to NZDollars 3.67.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index eased 0.89 to 603.08 in turnover of MDollars
73.3m.

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Interest rates explain Turkish decline
/ Analysis both ends of the latest emerging markets performance chart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE

<TEXT>
Turkey and India languished at the bottom of the emerging markets
performance chart in April, while Pakistan comfortably secured the top slot.
According to the data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank, Turkish
equities dropped by 9.8 per cent in local currency terms, but by a bigger
14.5 per cent in terms of the dollar because of the lira's depreciation
against the US currency.
Mr Malcolm Cooper, who analyses Turkish stocks for London-based broker
Carnegie International, says the fall in the equity market this year can be
attributed partly to high interest rates, which have attracted domestic
savings to the country's highly developed public debt market. 'There are a
lot of short-term investors in Turkey, and this makes the equity market
volatile,' he adds.
The recent crop of good first-quarter results from the corporate sector have
so far been ignored by the stock market. But Mr Cooper believes they could
still spark a short-term upward correction over the next month. He also
notes that equity valuations have dropped back to levels seen in the mid to
late 1980s, when international investors first entered the market.
The government's commitment to raising the success rate of its privatisation
programme, while regarded as positive by analysts, is not expected to
improve the stock market's fortunes greatly.
India, which had jumped 35.3 per cent in dollar terms in March following a
government budget designed to open up the country's capital markets,
retreated 14.4 per cent last month as a brokers' strike and trading scandals
prompted panic selling.
Some foreign analysts are relieved that the speculative bubble has burst,
since Indian share prices had lost touch with fundamentals, such as slowing
industrial production and uncertainty about future corporate earnings. They
add that the Indian stock market will have to fall a lot further to attract
foreign investment. Its gain in the first four months is a hefty 74 per
cent.
By contrast, Pakistan rebounded by 13.8 per cent last month, reducing its
fall since the start of the year to 12.4 per cent, compared with a drop of
22.2 per cent at the end of March.
Investor sentiment had been harmed by investigations into speculative buying
on the stock market and, more broadly, by the power struggle in neighbouring
Afghanistan.
Latin America was generally firmer, with the exception of Mexico which
weakened 4.9 per cent on fears that there would not be enough demand for the
government's placement of more shares in Telmex this month. However, Mr Tony
Ewell of BZW says that response to the issue picked up just before the
pricing of the issue this week.

FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rights issues prospect weighs
on equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHTS ISSUES in the pipeline, or merely in prospect, added to strike fears
in Germany to take the edge off continental equities yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
MILAN sank to another 1992 low on fears that more companies would announce
capital increases to beat the privatisation programme expected from the
state holding company, Iri, in the second half of the year. Fiat lost L100
to L5,025 on rumours that it was planning a rights issue but then rebounded
L15 later. The Comit index fell 6.45 to 481.60 in turnover estimated at
L100bn after Monday's L86.6bn.
Burgo dropped L560 or 7.9 per cent to L6,570 as disconcerted traders
over-reacted to news of a 3 per cent drop in 1991 consolidated net earnings
and a dividend cut of L200 to L450.
The aeronautics group, Alenia, dropped L174 or 9.7 per cent to L1,620 on
reports that Germany wanted to scale down the Eurofighter programme.
PARIS fell back as traders got wind of a cash call from Pechiney
International, details of which emerged piecemeal after the close. Analysts
said that other companies were likely to take advantage of the market's
recent strength to make rights issues. Possible candidates were Accor and
Saint Gobain, they said. The CAC-40 index dropped 13.86 to 2,063.63 in heavy
turnover of FFr3.4bn.
Pechiney International fell FFr9 to FFr207 in anticipation of its funding
move. The state, which owns 60 per cent of Pechiney International via its
parent, Pechiney, is not going to exercise its warrants at the upcoming
striking date in June.
These warrants were taken on and exercised yesterday by a banking
consortium. Pechiney International said the new shares were being sold in a
private placement to investors in France and abroad.
Alcatel Alsthom, whose first quarter results were in line with expectations,
fell FFr18 to FFr661 on profit-taking.
Euro Disney dropped FFr5.70 or 4.4 per cent to FFr125.30 on a report that
attendance at the theme park was below target. Eurotunnel was another
casualty, dropping FFr1.35 or 5 per cent to FFr37.60 in 1.4m shares amid
talk that it would have a rights issue reserved for TML to resolve their
cost dispute.
FRANKFURT expressed concern about the prospect of a metalworkers' strike but
equities maintained their holding pattern. Following a 1.10 decline to
706.82 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed 1.87 lower at
1,751.16, market turnover easing from DM6.5bn to DM6.2bn.
Among carmakers, Daimler fell DM7 to DM782, dealers blaming reports that a
fighter jet which its Deutsche Aerospace unit had helped develop was
unlikely to be be built. Volkswagen fell DM4.30 to DM392, and this fall was
put down to profit-taking after its recent rally.
Dresdner Bank closed DM2.30 higher at DM359.80 for a two-day gain of DM6.80,
reflecting buying for Friday's dividend payment. Continental, the tyremaker,
recovered DM4.20 of Monday's DM11 loss to close at DM268.20, after the
downward revision of weekend rights issue expectations.
ZURICH broke its uptrend on general and specific grounds. Higher Swiss money
market rates weighed on the banking sector, within which SBC bearers dropped
SFr6 to SFr281.
After the close the US rating agency, Moody's, said that it had downgraded
SBC's senior debt to AA-1 from AAA, and SBC said that this would have no
material effect. The SMI index fell 12.9 to 1,950.8.
STOCKHOLM ran into profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden General index eased 8.1
to 1,006.4 in turnover of SKr576m after SKr677m.
Volvo fell back on disappointment that rumours of an early merger with
Renault had not been confirmed. Its B free shares fell SKr7 to SKr444.
Ericsson rose SKr1 to SKr135 on news of a SKr700m telephone system order in
Tokyo.
AMSTERDAM weakened slightly with the CBS Tendency index losing 0.2 to 130.2.
Buehrmann-Tetterode rose Fl 1.10 to Fl 49.40; it reported lower first
quarter profits, but forecast an improvement over the year. Ahold was 90
cents stronger at Fl 88 on better first quarter sales while
Internatio-Mueller put on Fl 2.30 or 3.5 per cent to Fl 67 ahead of
tomorrow's annual meeting.
MADRID lost ground on profit-taking. The general index fell 1.13 to 257.91
in turnover estimated at Pta14.5bn.

<TEXT>
Sentiment on the LME was dampened by the news that IG Metall, the German
metals and engineering union, will next Monday decide whether to call a
strike ballot. TIN initially maintained its recent advance, with three-month
metal rising to a new 18-month high of Dollars 6,100 a tonne before hitting
profit-taking. COPPER fell back after three-month metal hit resistance above
Dollars 2,240, and finished at Dollars 2,235 a tonne, still up Dollars 3.
ZINC drifted back, but remained underpinned by technical tightness -
three-month metal held above support around Dollars 1,255 a tonne. The
prospect of more origin selling is weighing on both the COFFEE and COCOA
markets, London dealers said. London coffee prices were helped by a firmer
start in New York, but dealers said the near July contract is still
vulnerable to a fall back to Dollars 670 a tonne. Talk that Costa Rica is
reducing its exports helped prices, some traders said. But the overall
picture remains bearish. London cocoa prices had regained most of the day's
earlier losses by the close as recent origin selling appeared to have
petered out, but dealers said the market was braced for fresh supplies.

ALCAN Aluminium will not resume construction on the CDollars 1bn Kemano
hydro-electric expansion project following last week's federal appeal court

Alcan won an appeal in the federal court which overruled native and

FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar organisation cuts
estimate of surplus output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Sugar Organistion's secretariat has cut its estimate of
the world sugar surplus in 1991-92 (October/September) to 510,000 tonnes,
raw value, from a previous projection of 1.4m tonnes, reports Reuter.
Production is seen totalling only 112.20m tonnes, compared with the previous
estimate of 112.84m tonnes while the consumption estimate has been lifted to
111.69m tonnes from 111.44m tonnes.
Estimates for Cuba, South Africa and Zimbabwe were all reduced sharply to
6.85m, 2.20m and 90,000 tonnes respectively, from 7.3m, 2.4m and 390,000
tonnes.
The ISO said the Cuban estimate reflected export indications and the
country's declared intention to harvest 'every last tonne of sugar'.
'Although this is higher than other analysts we feel it is too early to
reduce it further when the crop is still in progress,' the secretariat said.
Cuban figures received by the ISO showed exports between November and
January totalled 994,700 tonnes, up from 976,700 tonnes in the same period
the previous year.
Shipments to Japan rose to 159,900 tonnes from 64,600 while Portugal's rose
from nothing to received 66,400 tonnes. Cuban exports to the CIS fell to
286,200 tonnes from 464,200 tonnes.

'stripped' bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kreditinstitut fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), the state-owned bank, has
launched Germany's first issue of 'stripped' bonds.
The DM200m issue was arranged by Metallbank, a Frankfurt merchant bank. The
deal comprised of 8 per cent 20-year bonds which were issued at a price of
101.25 yesterday for a yield of 7.87 per cent.
However, the interest payments on the bonds have been 'stripped' and
repackaged into an issue of 20-year zero coupon bonds.
The financing technique originated in the US Treasury market. Investors can
choose whether to buy either the 20-year bonds in the normal way, buy the
zero coupon paper, or buy the underlying bond without any entitlement to
interest.
The structure is designed in part to appeal to private investors, who often
prefer to buy long-dated zero coupon bonds on tax grounds. There is no tax
to pay until these bonds are redeemed in 20 years time.
The deal was launched with the permission of the Bundesbank and the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Market sources suggested that the Bundesbank
itself, and larger German banks, would adopt this funding technique later
this year.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: IPMA urges EC to revise
proposals for new rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Eurobond firms yesterday struck out at proposed European Community
securities regulations, claiming that the new rules would drive securities
business from the EC.
The International Primary Markets Association, which represents new issue
underwriters, called for substantial amendments to two proposed directives -
the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) and Large Exposures Directive (LED).
These lay down rules governing the amount of capital which must be set aside
by firms against securities holdings, including underwriting positions.
IPMA commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy practice, to
study the effects of the proposed directives on Eurobond underwriting. The
study examined the underwriting business of seven firms over the course of
last year. It concluded that the proposed EC rules 'would require levels of
capital greatly in excess of amounts currently committed' by new issue
firms. This would increase the cost of new issue underwriting.
The report said that the proposed rules:
Do not allow a long enough 'window' in which new issues can be sold to
investors by underwriting firms before full capital adequacy requirements
start to bite.
A survey of seven leading underwriting firms found that in most Eurobond
issues 'a material balance' of securities remained unsold even 10 days after
the deal was launched. The CAD allows only a five-day underwriting window in
which concessionary capital rules apply.
Do not take account of hedging strategies which allow securities firms to
limit interest rate risk. For example, a firm can hedge a long position of
securities by taking an equal short position in the futures market. Such
hedging activity is not recognised by the draft CAD.
Are too harsh on firms which take a very large underwriting position, by
acting as sole underwriter in a 'block trade' of securities, for example.
The LED was drafted to control large loans made by banks and imposes a limit
on loans over 25 per cent of the institutions' capital backing.
The Coopers' study argued that securities positions are less risky than
loans exposure since the securities can usually be sold if the issuer runs
into trouble. Hence the 25 per cent 'hard limit' on securities exposures
should not apply.
The latest drafts of the two directives were circulated in April and are
currently under consideration by EC governments.
Meanwhile, Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, director general of the EC division
preparing the regulations, said that a significant breakthrough had been
made in negotiations in recent days over the capital adequacy directive.
Member states, which had pushed for strict limits on the underwriting risks
investment firms could take on, have indicated that they are prepared to
accepted less stringent rules, he said. This is considered one of the main
sticking points in the development of the directive, and is one of the main
concerns of the bond market.
Mr Fitchew added that the directive, under discussion for the past four
years, was entering a critical phase and could be agreed within the next six
weeks.

BARCLAYS Bank yesterday lost its last remaining triple-A credit rating when
Moody's Investors Service, the US agency, downgraded its long-term debt to
Aa1, writes Simon London.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the other big US agency, downgraded Barclays an
equivalent level last year. IBCA, the UK agency which has specialised in
rating financial institutions, followed suit in March.
Moody's said that the trends which have eroded Barclays' profitability
'could become steeper and more protracted than currently expected, if the
pace of UK economic growth does not pick up during this year'.
Yesterday, Moody's cut the long-term credit rating of Swiss Bank Corporation
from triple-A to AA1. On Monday, S&amp;P said that its was maintaining its top
rating of SBC debt.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Equity Issues: Enquirer/Star Group offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN OFFERING in the US market last week gave a fresh twist to the existing
equity-linked structure and could prove to be an attractive alternative to
straight equity issues and convertible debt.
Enquirer/Star Group, which publishes the National Enquirer and other US
publications, launched a Dollars 135m offer of zero coupon notes with
warrants to buy 4.86m shares of the company's common stock.
The structure, designed by Salomon Brothers, provides a similar pattern of
returns for investors as Low Yield Option Notes (Lyons).
Both structures have tax advantages for investors, but also offer cheaper
funding for issuers as the warrants are treated as paid-in capital and a
greater portion of the implied interest is tax-deductible. While the Lyons
structure typically includes a put option, allowing investors to demand
early redemption of principal after five years, the Enquirer/Star Group
notes have a five-year maturity.
The company is buying warrants from Boston Venture, a venture capital group
which owns an equity stake in the company, and then selling similar warrants
to investors at a slightly higher price. As a result, the venture capital
group is able to sell off its stake at a higher price.
The deal, which closes later this week, is two-and-a-half times
oversubscribed, according to Salomon Brothers.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Equity Issues: Brazilian paper group plans to
launch Dollars 150m offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first Brazilian issue in the international equity markets is due later
this month, the latest in a steady stream of Latin American company issues.
Aracruz Celulose, the pulp and paper group, plans to raise Dollars 150m. It
will be followed in the autumn by Telebras, the Brazilian telecom group.
Aracruz is expected to attract considerable interest from both the US and
Europe, in spite of Brazil's reputation for high inflation and record of
political instability, especially when compared with Mexico, the best
developed of the Latin American markets.
Its supporters believe Aracruz will be a success for two main reasons:
emerging market investors are hunting around for new Latin American stocks,
and analysts are forecasting a recovery early next year in the pulp and
paper sector.
The company, which has a leading international position in the production of
eucalyptus pulp, generates some 80 per cent of its revenues in hard
currencies.
The Aracruz initial public offering, consisting of 10m American Depositary
Shares, is being lead managed by Salomon Brothers. The international tranche
will consist of 3m ADSs, while 7m ADSs will be offered in the US and Canada.
The proceeds will be used to reduce short-term cruzeiro-denominated debt.
In a separate development, the international equity offering for Telmex, the
Mexican telephone monopoly, was priced yesterday at Dollars 56.125 per
American Depositary Share - the same as the last sale price in the US.
Although the Dollars 1.4bn offering was judged a success, demand from
European investors was not as strong as expected and the international
tranche had to be scaled back. Out of a total of 25m ADSs, only 8.65m of the
original 9.5m in the international tranche were sold and the remainder were
sold in the US and Mexico.
Investment bankers noted that international investors who had already bought
Telmex at Dollars 27.25 in last year's international equity offering saw
little reason to increase their stake at Dollars 56.125 per share.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Simint pins Wall Street hopes
on Armani / A look at the latest in a small group of Italian companies to
offer shares to US investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giorgio Armani, Italy's best-known clothes designer, needs little
introduction in the US, where fashion-conscious buyers tend to snap up his
creations.
Whether fund managers act the same way towards Simint, the Italian clothing
group in which Mr Armani has a 20 per cent stake, is another matter given
the lack of international interest in Italian equities.
Simint is the latest in a tiny group of Italian companies which have given
US investors the chance to buy their shares via American Depository Receipts
(ADRs). Issuing ADRs should make the stock more attractive by saving US
buyers the bother of going through the Italian market.
In spite of roadshows in Boston and New York last week, it is probably too
early to tell whether the operation has been a success. With the Milan
bourse hitting new lows, sentiment towards Italian shares is not at its
brightest.
Simint, run by Mr Luca Ramella and chaired by Mr Francesco Micheli, the
Milan financier whose Finarte group owns 20 per cent of its shares, has been
reinforcing its link with Mr Armani while pinning its hopes on the US.
Last September, Mr Armani announced the creation of a new chain of US shops,
called Armani Exchange, or A/X for short.
They aimed to concentrate on jeans and casual wear that were sold through
his second-line Emporio Armani chain, while developing new lines of
lower-priced Armani-badged products.
According to Mr Armani, the initiative was not so much a move downmarket as
an attempt to make his apparel accessible to a new range of buyers. 'We want
to build up a clientele which lasts for the future,' he said.
Simint is providing the means. The company produces jeans, knitwear and
childrens' clothes for the Armani group, as well as casual and childrens'
clothing for Moschino and Versace, two other top Italian designers.
The purchase in 1990 of Best Company and Marina Yachting, two Italian
clothing brands, substantially increased Simint's turnover, which should
rise by about 11 per cent to almost L370bn (Dollars 297.2m) for the year
ended April, 1992.
Net profits should be in line with the L17.2bn made in 1990-91. But Mr
Ramella points out this year's figure includes allowance for the heavy sums
ploughed into A/X in the US.
The new venture marks the first time Simint has invested directly in
retailing, rather than just manufacturing. Although the new stores will be
closely identified with the Armani group, which will be responsible for
design, layout and promotion, it is Simint which is providing the cash as
well as making the garments.
The first store opened in New York in December. A second is due to open in
Santa Monica shortly, and a further four should be operational by late
summer.
Meanwhile, 16 A/X 'shop in shops' have opened in big department stores, with
a further four to come soon with 10 by late summer.
Turnover had been very encouraging in spite of US consumers' reaction
against certain branded items, said Mr Ramella. Sales at the New York
showcase store exceeded Dollars 2.1m by the end of last month.
The target is to sell Dollars 60m of goods in the first year.
That should rise in 1993, when there will be additions to the US chain and
possibly some European openings too. The first A/X outlet in Europe is
scheduled to open next spring.
Stimulating the interest of foreign funds is part of Mr Ramella's efforts to
have the company's ordinary and prefered shares, which yesterday closed at
L4,660 and L2,803 respectively, re-evaluated.
'News of the A/X project didn't particularly help our share price. Italian
investors have a very negative view of such US ventures. It's seen as a big
risk, as many Italian companies have gone wrong in that market,' he said.
The ADRs, which are being issued by Citibank, could be a way of interesting
US investors and filling the gap left by Italian institutions.

FT  13 MAY 92 / FT Conference: Bank head urges market evolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SINGLE European stock market for wholesale investors should develop
through competition between national markets, not be imposed from Brussels,
Mr Pen Kent, an executive director of the Bank of England, said yesterday.
In the first detailed comments by a Bank director on EC investment
regulation, Mr Kent argued strongly that rules from Brussels should not be
allowed to inhibit the development of London's international share market.
'Imposing a solution could mean losing the benefits of diversity and
competition,' he said.
His comments were made at a conference in London, organised by the Financial
Times, on the international securities markets.
Mr Kent said that the question of stock market transparency - the extent to
which details of completed trades are published to the market  - was central
to the debate. He defended the lack of transparency in London's share
market, arguing that greater trade publication would discourage marketmakers
from supporting the market. 'Revealing more information, through
publication, will tend to help the less informed, but will also reduce the
appeal of the market place to informed traders.'
Also, marketmakers' quotes of the prices at which they were prepared to buy
or sell shares constituted a form of 'pre-trade publication' which was in
some ways preferable to publication of completed trades, he said.
It was better to have different publication rules in different EC states,
rather than to impose a single system. 'The conflict is between real
efficiency and the appearance of fairness,' Mr Kent said.
His comments had received support earlier from Mr Francois Bacot, director
general of Bacot-Allain, the French arm of SG Warburg and author of a report
last year on the development of wholesale share trading in Paris. 'The
permanent quotation of bid-offer spreads and volumes provides all the
necessary information' to keep investors informed, he said.
Mr Bacot said that the debate over EC regulation, which had pitted the UK
and French against each other in arguments over the ideal market system,
failed to recognise that different systems suited different types of
investor. 'Instead of asking us to choose one or the other, wouldn't it be
better to try and make them work together, since it is certainly in the
interest of the markets to offer their members a large variety of trading
systems,' he said.
Mr Brandon Becker, deputy director of the market regulation division of the
US Securities and Exchange Commission, launched a strong defence of
immediate trade publication. Transparency is essential for investor
protection, encourages investors to participate in a market and promotes
open competition, he said.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Olympics costs hit net at Turner
Broadcasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTS associated with coverage of the winter Olympics contributed to a sharp
decline in first-quarter net earnings at Turner Broadcasting System, the
media and entertainment group that controls the CNN cable network.
Although revenues were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 365.2m, the
first-quarter net profit was only Dollars 731,000, against Dollars 3.8m a
year ago. At the operating level, the profit dropped by 9 per cent to
Dollars 51.1m.
Revenues for the entertainment division of Mr Ted Turner's company rose by
20 per cent, to Dollars 170.5m, thanks to increases in subscription revenue
and advertising at the TNT cable network. However the entertainment unit's
operating profit fell to Dollars 16.1m from Dollars 27.9m in the first
quarter of last year.
Operating profits from the news division - which includes CNN - increased to
Dollars 42.4m from Dollars 31.1m on revenues that were 9 per cent higher at
Dollars 125.3m.
Losses on the sports division, which includes an equity stake in the Atlanta
Hawks basketball team, rose to nearly Dollars 4m from Dollars 2.1m a year
ago.
The New York Times, whose delivery drivers have been on strike since last
week, said the strike had cost millions of dollars. Mr Lance Primis,
president of the paper, said the losses consisted of plant and equipment
damage, lost sales and rebates to advertisers.
Mr Primis said he was unaware of distribution problems spreading beyond the
suburban areas of Westchester County and Long Island in New York, and in
Connecticut.
He said there had been bomb scares at the newspaper's Manhattan headquarters
and damage to some lorries in the loading bays of the newspaper.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED volumes, improved market share and higher exports allowed Nampak,
South Africa's largest packaging company, to record increased turnover and
earnings in the six months to the end of March.
Turnover at the Barlow Rand subsidiary was 13 per cent up at R2.21bn
(Dollars 770m), while operating profit was 16 per cent higher at R250.3m.
Improved margins were the result of 2.4 per cent volume growth, improved
productivity, plant rationalisation and tight cost controls.
Attributable profit rose 14 per cent to R123.4m. Earnings per share were 13
per cent higher at 258 cents, while the dividend was lifted 5 per cent to 79
cents per share.
Mr Brian Connellan, chairman, said most divisions in the packaging segment
had achieved real growth.
Looking ahead, Mr Connellan said although lower interest rates and improved
export prospects would help the economy, these benefits were outweighed by
the impact of continuing unrest, unemployment and the drought.
He said the level of increase in earnings for the full year was likely to be
below the first-half level.
Two other companies in the Barlow Rand group reported higher interim
profits. Attributable profits at Tiger Oats rose 13 per cent to R154.4m,
while earnings at Imperial Cold Storage (ICS) were 29 per cent higher at
R30.8m.
Mr Robbie Williams, chairman of Tiger Oats, said the higher profits,
achieved on a 4.4 per cent rise in turnover to R4.4bn, reflected the group's
diverse base, strong brands, and the benefits of upgrading plant and
technology.
ICS benefited from a restructuring programme introduced 18 months ago, with
the 29 per cent rise in earnings achieved on a turnover increase of 8 per
cent to R1.2bn.

<TEXT>
PANCONTINENTAL Mining, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a
one-for-three rights issue to raise ADollars 42m (USDollars 31.80). The
issue is intended to finance exploration and strengthen the company's
balance sheet by retiring debt.
Mr Lindsay MacAlister, managing director, said Pancontinental wanted to
strengthen its overall position before deciding whether to increase capacity
at its Kunwarara magnesite operation in Queensland.
The proposed expansion would increase capacity for deadburn magnesia to
150,000 tonnes a year from 100,000, and boost production of electrofused
magnesia to 25,000 tonnes from 15,000.
Mr MacAlister said Pancontinental would require ADollars 20m over three
years for increased exploration and evaluation of mineral prospects and a
further ADollars 20m to optimise capacity at the mines and associated
facilities.
Pancontinental said it would concentrate expenditure on the
Paddington/Kundana gold mines in Western Australia, the Thalanga base metals
operation in Queensland, and the tantalum mine at Wodgina in Western
Australia.
The company said about 55.52m shares would be issued with acceptances
closing on July 3.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Flat profits forecast at Citizen
Watch
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITIZEN Watch, the Japanese watch and information equipment maker, has
blamed slowdown in the domestic economy and a sharp drop in capital spending
for a 20.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, to Y16.89bn (Dollars 127m), for
the year to the end of March.
The decline is expected to be characteristic of Japanese companies' fiscal
1991 results, as is the company's forecast of flat sales and profits for the
present year.
For last year, Citizen reported a 4.7 per cent fall in sales, to Y236.2bn,
in spite of a 5.9 per cent increase in unit sales of wrist watches at
162.6m. The company said sluggish sales of luxury models were behind a bare
1 per cent rise in watch revenue.
Sales of industrial machinery and equipment fell 18.8 per cent, as Japanese
companies cut capital spending, while sales of floppy disk drives fell 24.3
per cent because of troubled computer markets in the US and Europe. However,
sales of notebook-style computers rose 5.3 per cent.
As with many Japanese companies over the past year, Citizen softened the
impact of economic slowdown and high interest rates by tapping its cash
reserves, which fell from Y73.17bn to Y54.76bn. Meanwhile, it reduced its
exposure in the stock market and sharply increased its holdings of bonds,
from Y54m to Y9.4bn.
Citizen said the the condition of the domestic economy was 'still critical',
while recovery in Europe and the US appears to have been delayed. For the
year, pre-tax profit is forecast to rise 0.6 per cent, to Y17bn, on a 1.6
per cent increase in sales to Y240bn.

financial aid

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YAMATANE Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, has requested emergency
financial support from Sakura Bank, a leading commercial bank. The request
reflects the severe conditions facing the Japanese broking industry.
Yamatane's move comes at a time when the company faces steep losses because
of the weak stock market, low dealing volume and compensation payments
arising from its involvement in stock manipulation disputes.
For the last fiscal year to March, the broker expects to have run up a
pre-tax loss of Y9bn (Dollars 67.66m) and an after-tax loss of Y24.2bn.
Although Yamatane is the first leading second-tier broker to make such a
move, there is speculation that others may follow suit.
Second-tier brokers, which have traditionally relied on broking commissions,
have been hard hit by the decline in market activity. The downturn has
forced the houses to rely more heavily on unrealised gains on stock
holdings, which have also been eroded by the sharp falls in share prices.
Nine of the 10 second-tier brokers are forecasting losses for last year,
while most are cutting costs by closing domestic branches and rationalising
international operations.
Sakura, which has traditionally enjoyed close ties with Yamatane, said it
was considering supplying the broker with low-interest rate loans and
sending officials to aid restructuring.
Yamatane also hopes to sell some of its long-term bank shareholdings, which
could affect already weak Japanese bank share prices.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Time Warner forced to cut
Dollars 1bn placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LACK of sufficient investor interest has forced Time Warner, the
debt-laden US media and entertainment group, to slash the size of a recent
private placement of long-term notes from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 850m.
The company, which plans to use the proceeds to replace bank loans as part
of its restructuring of more than Dollars 7bn of group debt, had previously
asked Merrill Lynch, lead agent on the transaction, to raise more than
Dollars 1bn by way of a private placing.
A banker involved in the placing said that Mr Ed Aboodi, financial adviser
to Mr Steve Ross, Time Warner chairman, had asked Merrill Lynch to raise the
Dollars 1bn by placing Dollars 750m of 10-year senior notes and Dollars 250m
of 20-year paper.
However institutional investors were not prepared to accept a full Dollars
1bn of Time Warner senior debt, according to an executive involved in the
transaction. Time Warner then agreed to reduce the placing to Dollars 500m
of 10-year notes paying 9 5/8 per cent and Dollars 250m of 20-year paper at
10.15 per cent. The 10-year tranche was eventually raised to Dollars 600m.
Investors were apparently hesitant due to uncertainty over Time Warner's
complicated debt restructuring, including a new Dollars 6.2bn bank loan and
the transfer of much of the debt to Time Warner Entertainment (TWE), an 87.5
per cent Time Warner subsidiary that will have both Japan's Toshiba and C.
Itoh as minority shareholders.
The company's ratings, meanwhile, remain below investment grade, although
these are expected to be upgraded after the debt rescheduling is completed.
After the size of the Time Warner placing was reduced, Merrill Lynch offered
the company an additional Dollars 250m as a bridge loan that would
eventually be converted into a new 10-year bond with a coupon 200 basis
points above the equivalent US Treasury maturity. The bond is expected to be
issued in the second half of 1992.
This transaction was described by Time Warner as a forward underwriting
commitment. By July it should allow the company to reduce its bank loan by
the same amount.
Time Warner's next step will be to raise a further Dollars 1bn to Dollars
1.5bn cash by seeking to bring US and European partners into its TWE venture
with Toshiba and C. Itoh. IBM, the computer company, is among the companies
that may be asked to invest up to Dollars 500m in TWE.

CYCLE and Carriage (CCL), the diversified Singapore-based vehicle group, is
nearing victory in its month-long battle to take over Malayan Credit, the
family-run property concern, Reuter reports from Singapore.
CCL, which is making the takeover bid in partnership with Hotel Properties,
said it had bought an additional 6.1m shares of Malayan. The partners now
own 48.88 per cent of Malayan Credit's total shares. CCL offered a price of
SDollars 2.25 a share when the bid opened on April 10.
CCL, a leading car distributor diversifying into property and food
businesses, said last month its takeover offer was conditional on it and
Hotel Properties acquiring a combined stake of more than 50 per cent. With a
50 per cent stake, CCL could wrest control of the property group from
Singapore's Teo family, which owns about 24 per cent of Malayan.
Malayan's land bank in Malaysia and its prime office and residential
properties in Singapore and Malaysia are expected to blend well with CCL's
property portfolio in Singapore and Malaysia.

<TEXT>
JC PENNEY, the big Dallas-based retailer, yesterday reported a sharp upturn
in profits during the first three months of the 1992 financial year.
However, its performance contrasted with that of The Limited, a once
high-flying specialist retailer, whose profits and earnings per share were
flat during the same period.
JC Penney announced it made Dollars 136m after tax in the three months to
April 25, compared with Dollars 80m a year earlier (excluding the effect of
an accounting change).
Its retail sales during the period increased from Dollars 3.43bn to Dollars
3.79bn - a rise of 10.5 per cent. Penney said unit sales had accelerated
'significantly' in four merchandise divisions. However, it also acknowledged
that gross margins slipped slightly.
Mr William Howell, chairman, said a turnround in the US economy, 'coupled
with the more recent uptick in consumer confidence, bodes well for retailing
generally'.
At The Limited, however, it was long faces and news of after-tax profits
only marginally higher at Dollars 51.5m, against Dollars 50.9m, in the 13
weeks to May 2. Moreover, the figure includes a Dollars 9m pre-tax gain as a
result of the flotation of United Retail Group, the 'large size' specialty
women's wear retailer in which The Limited holds a 20 per cent stake.
Sales increased by 10.2 per cent, to Dollars 1.42bn, and The Limited said
its Victoria's Secret stores had enjoyed a record first quarter.
Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman, said he was disappointed by the performance. 'In
addition to the external factors of sluggish mall traffic, a difficult
economic environment and unseasonably cold weather, we also created some of
our own merchandising problems,' he said.

NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based stores group and one of the stars of the US
retail sector in the late-1980s, has reported a 15.9 per cent fall in
first-quarter profits.
The fashion retailer, which has been hit by the west coast recession, said
it made Dollars 21.6m after tax in the three months to the end of April,
compared with Dollars 25.7m in the same period a year earlier.
Sales in the first quarter rose 8.7 per cent, to Dollars 663.8m. However,
Nordstrom's finance director, Mr John Goesling, said sales trends had not
'improved enough to offset the higher costs of doing business'.
Meanwhile, May Department Stores, which operates 319 department stores
across the US under names such as Lord &amp; Taylor and Kaufmann's, and 3,304
shoe stores, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 81m for the 13 weeks to
May 2.
The result compares with Dollars 76m in the same period a year earlier.
Total net retail sales in the period were up from Dollars 2.17bn to Dollars
2.3bn.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Citicorp moves to lift capital
ratios with swap offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP yesterday offered to swap two types of preferred stock for up to
21.1m common shares, in a move aimed at strengthening its common
equity-to-assets capital ratio.
The effect of the stock swap would be to strengthen Citicorp's common equity
base on paper by as much as Dollars 537m, increasing the common
equity-to-assets ratio from a 3.42 per cent to 3.67 per cent.
The proposal is part of the bank's drive to bolster capital ratios, which
are among the weakest of the big US commercial banks. The bank has been
raising cash by way of asset disposals and private and public offers of
debentures.
The last preferred stock issue was a Dollars 175m public offer in March,
which carried a 9 per cent coupon. Last year the bank placed Dollars 1.2bn
of preferred stock privately, half of it with a Saudi prince. The rates on
last year's two placings were 11 per cent and 10 3/4 per cent.
Ms Nancy Newcomb, Citicorp's senior executive in charge of funding, said the
stock swap proposal would offer investors a tax-free and commission-free
exchange of preferred stock into the more widely held and actively traded
common shares. The bank, in turn, would improve its equity base by issuing
common shares representing up to 5.7 per cent of total common stock
outstanding.
Mr Tom Hanley, senior banking analyst at First Boston, the investment bank,
praised the stock swap offer as 'a positive step aimed at getting capital
ratios up.'
The offer provides for 3.72 common shares to be exchanged for each of 3.9m
shares of second series preferred stock, and 4.40 common shares for each of
the bank's 1.5m shares of third series preferred stock.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Olivetti loss worse than
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the troubled Italian computers and office equipment group,
yesterday announced a bigger than expected consolidated loss of L459.8bn
(Dollars 372m) for 1991 and passed its dividend for the year. In 1990 it
made a profit of L60.4bn.
Most of the loss came from restructuring costs as the company tackled what
it said was the 'most difficult year experienced by the information
technology industry worldwide'.
Olivetti is undertaking a wide-ranging restructuring programme to halt
declining growth in demand for computer products and confront the fierce
price competition.
Adjusting to the tougher conditions overshadowed its 1991 accounts. Almost
L290bn of last year's loss stemmed from redundancy payments and associated
interest and extraordinary charges.
A further L170bn was set aside to cover 'extensive process and industrial
restructurings' linked to last November's decision to scrap its former
complex divisional structure and adopt a simplified model. Although only put
into operation in January, the full provision for restructuring was carried
on the 1991 accounts.
The benefits of cost-savings on labour were partially held back by delays in
government approval for last year's job cuts, meaning that most of the
redundancies only took effect at year-end. Nevertheless, Olivetti's
workforce shrunk by 7,200 in 1991, more than double the rate of the previous
year, and helping to reduce operating costs by 2.8 per cent.
At operating level, Olivetti reported a loss of L28.3bn, while sales fell by
4.8 per cent to L8,607bn. The operating figure was slightly worse than the
company's earlier predictions of breaking even.
Olivetti did not forecast sales or profits this year. However, Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, chairman, has said that it hoped to break even in 1992.
Instead, the group stressed its financial solidity, and the signing of
important new ventures this year. Net indebtedness fell by L172.6bn to
L571.9bn last year, while net operating working capital dropped by 18.7 per
cent to L2,549bn at the end of last year.
On the sales side, first quarter revenues fell by 4.4 per cent against the
same period last year, or by 3 per cent when adjusted for disposals.
Olivetti reached agreement with Canon in March on a joint venture to produce
computer printers and it has just announced an accord to supply personal
computers to the McDonald's restaurant chain in the US.
Meanwhile, the rate of cost reductions accelerated as expected as part of
the group's continuing efforts to bring down its break-even point.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pechiney cuts stake in packaging
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY, the French state-owned aluminium producer, cut its stake in its
packaging subsidiary, Pechiney International, to 67.9 per cent yesterday,
with the sale of FFr1.29bn (Dollars 230m) of its shares in a private
placement.
Its holding fell from 74.1 per cent and is likely to fall further to 66.7
per cent at the end of June when publicly held warrants on its shares fall
due to be exercised.
The private placement was conducted in France and internationally by Banque
Nationale de Paris, Credit Suisse First Boston and Lazard Freres. The three
banks bought 14.3m warrants in the subsidiary from Pechiney and immediately
exercised them, resulting in the issue of 7,146,068 new shares.
Yesterday's sale raised FFr1.29bn for Pechiney International. The total will
rise to FFr1.7bn should further publicly held warrants be exercised at the
end of June.
In addition, the company expects to raise FFr3.85bn shortly from the sale of
its aluminium and international trading businesses to its parent.
The money raised would 'strengthen Pechiney International's financial
position and enhance its ability to develop its principal line of business,
packaging', the company said.
Pechiney added that the private placement - which came after the market had
closed - was expected to be completed shortly. No particular block of shares
was earmarked for sale internationally, with all three banks selling shares
both in France and abroad.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Bobst benefits from full order
books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOBST, the Swiss paper and packaging machinery concern, posted an increase
in consolidated net earnings of 17.9 per cent to SFr71.1m (Dollars 46.70m)
in 1991, while turnover increased by 9.3 per cent to SFr1.13bn. Cash flow
rose 22 per cent to SFr140.3m.
Mr Bruno de Kalbermatten, company president, said Bobst had benefited last
year from fat order books accumulated in 1990. He expected slower growth in
1992 but more positive developments in 1993.
The Lausanne-based group, which employs 5,400 people worldwide, has adopted
EC accounting standards for its 1991 consolidated accounts. Besides
increasing transparency, the move has boosted the group's balance sheet
largely by increasing asset values. However, the parent company, Bobst SA,
continues to use traditional Swiss accounting methods.
Bobst SA reported a 9.6 per cent increase in net earnings to SFr31.9m. The
annual shareholders meeting on May 26 will be asked to approve an unchanged
dividend of SFr34 per registered share and participation certificate and
SFr68 per bearer share. The group boosted share capital by nearly 20 per
cent last year to SFr755m.
Mr Pierre-Andre Jolliet, finance director, said the company was considering
a simplification of its share structure but had yet to make a decision.
Increasing numbers of Swiss companies are moving to a single class of share,
abolishing the distinction between registered (voting) shares available only
to Swiss nationals and bearer shares which have no voting rights.
The group would continue to strengthen its position in the mid-range of the
market, as well as in high-quality products, a strategy that was paying off
in developing country markets which account for a quarter of Bobst's sales,
the company said.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Ahold turnover surges to Fl
6.7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer active in the US and the Netherlands, said
turnover surged by more than 20 per cent in the first four months of 1992,
boosted by last year's acquisition of a US supermarket chain as well as by
autonomous growth in existing stores.
The company said operating and net profit in the first quarter of 1992 were
also expected to be higher, confirming predictions of growth in full-year
earnings, but gave no details.
Turnover in the 16-week period rose by 22.1 per cent to Fl 6.7bn (Dollars
3.6bn), helped by last year's acquisition of the New York-based supermarket
chain Tops Markets.
If the chain, Ahold's fourth in the US, is excluded, group turnover was up
8.8 per cent in the period.
In the Netherlands, where Ahold generates just under half of total turnover,
sales rose 8.3 per cent to Fl 3.3bn. US sales increased by 34 per cent to
Dollars 1.9bn. Without Tops Markets, Ahold's US turnover would have risen by
5.1 per cent.
Besides the Netherlands and the US, Ahold is gradually building up a chain
of supermarkets in Czechoslovakia under the name MANA. The company already
has five MANA supermarkets in operation and hopes to add many more in 1992.
Mr Pierre Everaert, chairman, told the annual shareholders meeting in
Amsterdam that the process of establishing a chain of stores under
Czechoslovakia's privatisation programme was proving to be slow, but he said
Ahold was making progress.

<TEXT>
NCM Holding, the Dutch private-sector credit insurer which acquired
Britain's short-term export credit arm last year as part of a UK
privatisation programme, said that after-tax profits in 1991 totalled Fl
33.1m (Dollars 17.9m), just under the record Fl 33.6m posted in 1990.
The 1991 figures are almost entirely composed of NCM's Netherlands
operations because the company did not complete its purchase of the
short-term insurance arm of the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department
until December 1.
In 1992, the first full year of operations in the UK, NCM said it expects
insurance transactions worth Pounds 14bn (Dollars 24.78bn), while premium
income is expected to total Pounds 80m. NCM described the UK acquisition as
marking a new phase in its existence, leading to a doubling of its business
and opening up opportunities for growth in Europe.
Mr Harry Groen, chairman, said the British market's initial response to a
new package of products launched by NCM in April was encouraging. In the
first month, NCM Credit Insurance, Ltd, the new name of the privatised UK
insurance arm, had issued several hundred 'quotes' to potential customers
and had already closed some business transactions.
The 1992 figures will not include the technical results of NCM's British
subsidiary because of the normal three-year lag before these enter the
books. NCM Ltd will, however, contribute to NCM Holding's results through
its investment income.
NCM's results on direct underwriting in 1991 (which covers the 1987
underwriting year) rose to Fl 42.9m from Fl 32.2m a year earlier, when the
books on the 1986 underwriting year were closed. However, results for
indirect underwriting swung into a loss of Fl 3.9m from a profit of Fl
10.3m.

FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Esselte to divide in
restructuring move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of Esselte, the Swedish office products group, confirmed yesterday
that it proposes to divide the company into two independent groups as part
of its restructuring programme.
Esselte AB will be the company's international business arm concentrating on
the production and marketing of office products while there is to be small
Nordic business - Information Systems - dealing with the company's wholesale
and retail operations related to office electronics and office products.
The aim of Esselte's division is to streamline the business and create a
more clearly defined and efficient structure. Yesterday the group
acknowledged its present organisation was chaotic and hinders overall
development.
While Esselte's international manufacturing segment is 'currently in a more
expansive phase,' its Nordic operations are 'experiencing a phase of
consolidation and restructuring'. The group said yesterday this created
problems for the focus of its activities and resource allocation.
The shareholders will be asked to approve of Esselte's division at their
annual meeting on June 12 and the company said the share distribution would
take place no later than November 30.
Under the proposal the Swedish company Getinge Intressenter, owned by Mr
Rune Andersson, Esselte chairman, will become the largest shareholder in the
new Nordic group with 34.8 per cent of its equity and 47.7 per cent of its
voting rights after buying the shares in Esselte owned by the two large
Swedish banks Nordbanken and Gota.
Esselte has gone through a prolonged period of upheaval caused by
competitive cost pressures and falling demand for its products. Two years
ago it began to concentrate on a core business strategy.

INVESTOR, Sweden's leading investment company, has announced a strong
improvement in profits for the first three months of the year to SKr1.14bn
(Dollars 192m) from SKr258m for the same period of 1991.
The main reason for the strong growth was the sale of Investor's shares at
the beginning of the year in Skandia, Sweden's leading insurance company and
the engineering group Asea. At the end of March, Investor's strategic
portfolio on the Stockholm bourse was valued at SKr23.078bn.
Metra, the Finnish industrial company, is seeking the authorisation of its
shareholders on 8 June for a FM60m share issue over the next twelve months.
When and whether the company goes ahead will be decided by the board.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HARPENER, the German industrial group which made large losses because of its
entanglement with Mr Werner Rey, the Swiss financier, is likely to have a
new majority shareholder by the summer.
Mr Heinz Sippel, the company doctor who is Harpener's chairman, said
yesterday that the group was in the final stages of negotiations with a
number of potential buyers.
The majority of the group's shares are held by Swiss and French banks as
collateral for the debts of Omni, Mr Rey's former business empire which went
into liquidation last year.
Mr Sippel said that advisers to the sale Lazard, Burklin, Kuna &amp; Co, the
Frankfurt arm of the Lazards investment bank, and Lazard Brothers of London,
were likely to conclude a deal in time for Harpener shareholders' meeting on
July 29.
As expected, Harpener, which has interests in property, energy and
transport, yesterday reported a significant turnround in net profits before
extraordinary charges. It made net profits of DM66.3m (Dollars 40.1m) last
year compared with a loss of DM95m in 1990. Group indebtedness fell from
DM316.7m in the previous year to DM91m at the end of 1991.
Extraordinary expenses totalled DM93.7m, marginally down on the previous
year's DM95.6m charge. As in 1990, the bulk of the charge related to
obligations taken over as a result of the Omni affair.
After taking control of Harpener, Mr Rey's Omni used it to buy stakes in a a
number of loss-making companies. The largest, and most disastrous purchase
was of a large minority stake in International Leisure Group, the collapsed
UK leisure group. The total cost to Harpener had reached about DM350m, Mr
Sippel said.

The joint venture is valued at Dollars 13.7m of which Tatramat contributed
Dollars 10.7m in fixed assets and Whirlpool Dollars 3m in cash. A further
Dollars 3m was paid by Whirlpool for a second purchase of shares which
brought the group's stake to 43.8 per cent. The venture intends a further
Dollars 28m in capital expenditures over the next three or four years.
The venture will produce 400,000 washing machines by 1993 and export them to
Hungary, Poland and the former Soviet Union.
Tatramat, located in Slovakia, makes about 70 per cent of washing machines
in Czechoslovakia. Its only rival is a small Moravian company, Romo Fulnek.

recession hits hotel operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of 'continuing deep recession' in the hotel industry reduced
interim pre-tax profits at Vaux Group, the Sunderland-based brewer, by 19
per cent, from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 15.1m.
Trading profits of the group's Swallow hotels declined from Pounds 5.41m to
Pounds 4.87m during the 24 weeks ended March 14. Occupancies dipped from 56
per cent to 53 per cent and room rates were nearly 4 per cent lower.
Additional financing costs for two new hotels at Bristol and Bexleyheath
raised interest charges from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 5.07m; and the group
incurred a loss of Pounds 203,000 on its 50 per cent stake in a Bournemouth
hotel.
However, current trading offered a 'glimmer of recovery,' said Mr Paul
Nicholson, chairman. 'Although rates remain under severe competitive
pressure, our forward bookings are up 5.2 per cent on last year, giving us
hope that the worst may be behind us.'
Pre-tax profits were boosted by an exceptional item of Pounds 5.59m (Pounds
7.3m). Trading profits were ahead 7.5 per cent at Pounds 15.3m (Pounds
14.2m) with turnover on continuing businesses up from Pounds 93.2m to Pounds
99.1m.
Brewing profits rose 20 per cent, from Pounds 6.06m to Pounds 7.3m, as the
breweries, helped by a contract to supply Labatt, the Canadian brewer, with
40,000 barrels of low-alcohol lager, operated at 90 per cent capacity.
Total beer sales were marginally lower against a fall of about 4.2 per cent
for the industry in general.
Draught sales, with 104 additional pubs trading during the period, were 2.4
per cent up; but packaged sales in the home market were 5.1 per cent down,
mainly in low profit commodity beers.
The care homes achieved an overall occupancy of 89 per cent and lifted
trading profits from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.67m.
Earnings per share fell 11 per cent to 9.35p (10.51p) but the interim
dividend is raised to 3.25p (3.1p).

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Donelon defies the sector trend with Pounds
3.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DONELON TYSON yesterday became one of the few construction groups able to
boast even a small increase in profits and dividend for last year. The
announcement lifted the shares 3p to 44p.
Pre-tax profits moved up from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 3.06m, despite a 15 per
cent decline in turnover to Pounds 80.9m. A substantially reduced tax charge
led to an increase in earnings per share from 4.01p to 4.61p.
As a result the dividend is lifted 20 per cent to 1.2p (1p), when many
construction companies have been struggling simply to maintain payments.
Mr Sean Donelon, chairman, said the group had performed well in difficult
markets. He expected to maintain modest progress in the current year.
The group steered clear of speculative residential and commercial property
developments, and had not been required to make costly write downs on land
bought in the late 1980s.
One of its strengths is its tunnelling business which sells almost entirely
to British water companies
About a third of contracting turnover - down from Pounds 59m to Pounds 55m -
was generated from tunnelling.
Contracting profits, however, slipped to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 5m) on lower
turnover from general construction. Contracting margins held up against the
current market trend.
Property development profits fell to Pounds 450,000 (Pounds 720,000) and
merchanting profits to Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 572,000).
On the other hand losses from the industrial insulation business, which is
being discontinued, were cut to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.8m).
Net debt of Pounds 14m at the year-end represented gearing of 90 per cent on
shareholders funds of Pounds 15.5m. But borrowings were expected to be
reduced by more than Pounds 3m with negotiations at an advanced stage for
the sale of the Skelmersdale Estate industrial property development. This
would cut gearing to about two thirds of shareholders' funds.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland in NZDollars 53m bid -
Surprise move follows Countrywide's downgraded forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BANK of Scotland yesterday announced it was making a full bid for the
Countrywide Bank at a cost of NZDollars 53m (Pounds 15.8m).
The surprise move followed a downgrade in Countrywide's forecast profits
this year and difficulties in raising equity capital from minority
shareholders.
Under last month's agreement, Bank of Scotland was to take a 60 per cent
stake in the enlarged Countrywide, following the latter's purchase, for
NZDollars 182.5m, of the United Bank from the troubled State Bank of South
Australia.
As part of that deal, Bank of Scotland announced it was buying a 20 per cent
holding in Countrywide from General Accident, the UK insurer.
It would underwrite Countrywide during its expansion and capital raising,
which would make it the sixth largest retail bank in New Zealand.
However, a statement from Countrywide yesterday linked Bank of Scotland's
decision to make the full bid to Countrywide's demand for capital following
the United takeover.
It said equity of about NZDollars 180m, compared with Countrywide's current
capital of NZDollars 133m, would be needed to replace short-term funding
needed to buy United.
The statement to the New Zealand stock exchange said Countrywide's profit
for the year to June 30 would be 'disappointing'.
Normal trading profits after tax would fall to about NZDollars 9m (NZDollars
17.9m) as a result of continuing pressures on interest margins and bad debt
positioning.
Combined with the extra costs that would be involved in taking over United,
that had led directors to re-evaluate prospects of raising the extra capital
required in the present market through the planned cash issue.
Countrywide directors said that a 'closer examination of the problems
involved' had led to the conclusion that Bank of Scotland should accept full
responsibility for the long term capital needs of United.
A significant reduction in minority holdings would have occurred had
Countrywide gone ahead with the cash issue, they said.
All directors, including three independents, supported Bank of Scotland's
bid of Dollars NZ2.05 a share, the same as paid to General Accident for its
holding. Before the takeover, Countrywide shares were trading at NZDollars
1.90.
Bank of Scotland explained yesterday that it had decided to purchase the
outstanding 40 per cent stake in Countrywide when it became clear that
raising extra capital through a rights issue would have been expensive for
minority shareholders.
It would have had to underwrite the rights issue and would probably have
ended up increasing its stake in Countrywide in any case.
It was therefore better, the bank said, to make an outright offer for the
remaining stake.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips 9p from UB share
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in United Biscuits fell 9p to 419p yesterday after Mr Robert Clarke,
chairman, warned the annual meeting that there would be 'some overall
decline' in the group's first-half profits.
He blamed this on 'a disappointing first quarter performance and a slower
than anticipated uplift in the second quarter' at Keebler, the US biscuits
subsidiary.
Last March, Mr Clarke said there had been no sign of an upturn in UB's main
markets in either the UK or the US.
He told yesterday's meeting that the position had 'not fundamentally
changed'.
There were now some small signs of recovery in the UK, but US consumers were
continuing to trade down to lower value products, thereby impacting on
Keebler's branded products.
Mr Clarke expected the rest of UB's business to at least match the previous
year's outcome.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Evode sells part of shoe business to cut
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EVODE, the adhesives, sealants and coatings company, moved to strengthen its
balance sheet with the announcement yesterday that it is selling, for Pounds
11.9m, the shoe components business acquired as part of its protracted bid
battle for Chamberlain Phipps in 1989.
Mr Andrew Simon, chairman, said the proceeds would be put towards the
group's debt which was Pounds 46m at the end of September. On a pro forma
basis, Evode would have gearing of about 61 per cent after the sale, he
said, compared with 78 per cent in September.
The decision to sell was due to the sharp slowdown in footwear sales and the
aim to focus on adhesives and coatings. The division represented about 30
per cent of the original Chamberlain business with sales of Pounds 48m and
profits of Pounds 1.7m for the year to September 28.
The business has been sold to Mr Dan Sullivan, a US investor, and Legal &amp;
General Ventures. Some Pounds 9.7m will be paid in cash.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong chief says 'no material'
redundancies - The Battle For Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG AND Shanghai Banking Corporation intends making 'no material'
compulsory redundancies should it succeed in taking over Midland Bank,
according to Mr William Purves, chairman.
In a private letter to Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's corporate and City
affairs spokeswoman, Mr Purves also said that Midland management would be
'very much as it is today' albeit with the addition of 'a number of
executives who know the HSBC group well.'
These additional managers would 'help to ensure that synergy benefits are
quickly achieved.' Midland's 'highly selective' rationalisation of its
branch network would 'continue under its own management.'
Lloyds Bank, Hongkong's rival for Midland, has also said that it plans no
compulsory redundancies while admitting that 20,000 job cuts might be
necessary.
Bifu, the banking union, has claimed that a Lloyds takeover would jeopardise
at least 30,000 jobs as the bank brought its combined staffing level down to
that of their remaining competitors.
Mr Purves, who is due today to meet with Conservative backbenchers, was
complimentary about Midland's management in a number of areas, saying he had
been 'personally impressed' by their record of innovation.
He sought to emphasise how four years of co-operation had resulted in
Hongkong Bank and Midland becoming quite familiar with each other's
operations.
'The banks know each other very well. We have been working together for four
years now with cross secondments of senior people between both banks.'

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection improves restructuring
terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security company, yesterday said it had improved
the terms of a restructuring agreement with its lenders and expects to
announce a crucial Dollars 37m (Pounds 21m) share issue next month.
The company, which does most of its business in the US but has a London
quotation, first agreed a restructuring in February with seven North
American institutions which are owed Dollars 70.5m on loans now in default.
New management, under the chairmanship of Sir Ian MacGregor, former chairman
of British Steel, still has to raise at least Dollars 27m through the share
sale in order to remain a going concern.
The new deal involves the lenders swapping their debt into a minimum of 19
per cent of the equity in return for Dollars 28m raised in the share sale.
The earlier agreement envisaged lenders taking 15 per cent in return for a
payment of Dollars 33.5m.
The new structure will give Holmes an additional Dollars 5m of working
capital and was good for shareholders, said Mr Eric Kohn, chief executive.
The seven lending institutions have also agreed to subscribe up to Dollars
10m of the Dollars 37m share issue if necessary, which would leave them with
a 40 per cent stake in Holmes.
Under the new deal, lenders will also hold unquoted warrants equivalent to 5
per cent of the enlarged capital. These can be exercised at the issue price
after 12 months.
Smith Barney Harris Upham, the US securities house, is acting as agent for
the US private placement; Peel Hunt is acting as the company's stockbroker;
and Brown Shipley, the London Merchant bank, is sponsoring the deal which
still requires shareholder approval.

FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GA cuts first quarter loss to Pounds 29m -
Chink of light but shares marked down 9p after profit taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a chink of light for the UK's beleaguered general insurance sector
yesterday when General Accident, the third biggest of the UK's composite
companies, showed a reduced pre-tax loss for the first quarter.
Losses for the three months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 29.2m, slightly
ahead of expectations and an improvement of Pounds 45.5m compared with the
same period of 1991.
This was 'a move in the right direction by anybody's standards,' said Mr
Nelson Robertson, chief general manager.
GA's satisfaction was marred, however, by the response from the market which
marked the shares down 9p to 489p, a fall which largely reflected profit
taking by traders after a strong performance by the shares over the last
month.
First quarter losses per share were cut to 5.4p (13.6p).
Underwriting losses were down 20 per cent to Pounds 129.6m (Pounds 162.2m),
with losses in the UK down by nearly a third to Pounds 65.2m (Pounds 92.8m).
The underwriting improvement reflected a series of premium increases over
the past 15 months and comparatively light weather-related losses.
A decline in subsidence claims and the impact of premium increases reduced
losses in the UK homeowners' sector to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 20.9m).
Commercial property losses also fell to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 21.7m), although
the London bombs of April 10 and 11 will cost a further Pounds 6m in the
second quarter.
Rising claims costs in motor business are holding back improvement in the UK
motor sector, where underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 26.5m compared
with Pounds 32m a year earlier, despite heavy premium increases during the
past 12 months.
Investment income was up to Pounds 110.4m (Pounds 102.7m) and, adjusted to
take into account interest paid, to Pounds 97.1m (Pounds 84.5m).
Estate agency losses were down to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 5.2m) and profits from
life businesses emerged slightly lower at Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 8m).
The group's financial position has also improved marginally over the first
quarter. Net assets per share amounted to 317p (as of May 8), up 1p on the
316p recorded at the end of 1991. The solvency margin (the yardstick
measuring net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) was down
marginally at 42 per cent (42.6 per cent).
COMMENT
After over a year in the doldrums, the last few weeks have seen the
composites outperform the market by 15 per cent, a performance bettered only
by the more obviously politically sensitive water stocks. Although there is
some concern that the shares are now trading at too high a premium to net
asset value, most analysts were inclined to attribute yesterday's fall
simply to profit taking. The results indicate that the general insurance
sector may be entering a recovery phase in its traditional cycle with recent
premium increases feeding through into improved underwriting results. GA,
which has only a minimum exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity business,
is - barring major accidents - well placed to benefit. It appears bound to
significantly reduce - and possibly eliminate - its pre-tax losses this
year. The figures are also encouraging on the dividend front.
