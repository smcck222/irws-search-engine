FT  08 MAY 92 / New car sales in UK rise by 9.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in the UK rose by 9.1 per cent in April, the first
year-on-year increase in 30 months and the first sign that the most severe
recession in the market since the second world war may have ended.
The motor industry warned, however, that the April figures should be treated
'with a degree of caution'.
New car sales a year ago were already low because of the recession and were
further depressed by the impact of the increase in value added tax on April
1 1991. This means that the size of the increase last month could be
misleading.
Optimism yesterday was also damped by the continuing decline in new
commercial vehicle registrations, which fell in April by 11.3 per cent from
the same month a year ago.
New commercial vehicle sales have suffered a year-on-year fall for 31 months
in succession.
Some carmakers insisted that consumer confidence was showing signs of
improvement.
Mr Ian Coomber, Vauxhall's sales director, said the April figures reflected
what had been happening at the company's dealers. 'Consumer confidence has
clearly returned after both the Budget and the election and customers are
now coming in to buy rather than just to window-shop.'
Mr Michael Hollingsworth, chief economist of the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, said the figures were 'clearly encouraging' as
the first tangible sign of improvement for 29 months.
New car sales in April rose to 138,106 from 126,588 in the same month a year
ago, according to the figures released by the society yesterday. In the
first four months, sales were 6.7 per cent lower at 544,317 compared with
583,318 in the corresponding period a year ago.
New car sales last year suffered the steepest year-on-year decline since
1974, and at 1.59m were 31 per cent lower than the 2.3m achieved in 1989.
Vauxhall said sales for the whole of 1992 could rise by 6 per cent to 1.69m,
but this implies an accelerating rate of recovery in the second half of the
year following the 11.1 per cent year-on-year decline in the first quarter.
Ford, the UK new car market leader, welcomed the April figures with
'cautious optimism'. It warned that it was already taking significant orders
for the key August sales month, however, which could restrain the rate of
recovery in the three months from May to July.
August, which traditionally accounts for more than a fifth of annual car
sales because of the change in the registration prefix, will be the crucial
factor in determining the level for the rest of the year.
Imported cars took a 55.4 per cent share of UK new car sales in April
compared with 56.3 per cent a year ago, while the import share in the first
four months was slightly higher than a year ago at 54.9 per cent.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Stores to fight credit card rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's five largest supermarket chains have set up a joint committee to
fight increased charges on credit and debit card transactions imposed by the
'Big Four' high street banks.
The retailers  - Asda, Gateway, Safeway, J. Sainsbury and Tesco  - said
yesterday they had already made a formal complaint to the Office of Fair
Trading about what they claim are unfair trading practices by the banks.
The chief executives of all four banks were sent letters on Wednesday,
telling them of the retailers' desire for an urgent meeting of the banks,
either together or separately, with the new joint committee in the next 30
days to reach an amicable solution.
Mr Derek Henson, Sainsbury's finance director and chairman of the committee,
said yesterday that the retailers were particularly upset by the doubling of
the charges they pay on Switch, the electronic debit card system set up in
1988 by National Westminster, Midland and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Although the exact charges each retailer pays are confidential, Mr Henson
said these appeared to have doubled to between 8p and 10p per transaction,
because of the introduction of a 4p fee paid by the retailer's bank to the
cardholder's bank.
'We don't mind paying what we consider to be reasonable processing charges,
but we are hoping to learn from the banks at the meeting what these new
charges are for,' Mr Henson said.
He said that if the new charges were for the costs of fraud, they should be
absorbed by the banks and not passed on to retailers.
'We really believe that the banks work together and are in concert,' Mr
Henson said, adding that the retailers expect this fact would be uncovered
by the OFT if it launched an investigation.
The OFT said last night it had been aware of the retailers' complaints for
some time and was engaged in routine preliminary investigation procedures.
An official said the OFT would have to decide whether or not the retailers'
decision to set up a joint committee to talk to the banks counted as a
restrictive practice, which needed to be registered.
'It is difficult to see how a meeting with a small group of powerful
retailers would be in the interests of consumers,' said Mr Richard
Reay-Smith, the chief executive of Barclaycard.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Serb/Croat plan for division of Bosnia defies UN and EC
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERB and Croat leaders from war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina have formulated
detailed plans to carve up the republic in a move which defies the peace
efforts of the European Community and the United Nations.
The division of the newly independent republic, which would leave the
Moslems without a homeland, is being tacitly encouraged by the governments
of both Serbia and Croatia.
Secret negotiations this week, held in the Austrian city of Graz, run
counter to official statements by Croatia and Serbia that they recognise the
current borders of Bosnia whose independence was recognised by the
international community last month.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, said on his return from Graz:
'We do not need war. We can negotiate the division under the auspices of the
European Community.'
Speaking in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, Mr Karadzic  - who has close
contacts with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic  - said the Serbs 'will
fight if the Croats do not agree to population exchanges, although any
nationality is welcome to stay in the Serb regions'.
Moslems make up 44 per cent of the 4.3m population, Serbs 30 per cent, and
Croats 17 per cent.
The Croat-Serb talks coincided with fresh appeals from Bosnia's Moslem
leaders for the deployment of UN peacekeepers and foreign military
intervention. The Graz talks were also attended by Mr Mate Boban and Mr
Franjo Boras, the nationalist leaders of Bosnia's Croats, who held further
consultations in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. Mr Boban is a close ally of
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman.
Last year, the Serbian and Croatian presidents had met secretly to discuss
how the ethnically mixed republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina would be divided.
Mr Branko Salaj, Croatia's minister of information, denied he knew about the
Graz talks, but said: 'We do not want the Croats in Bosnia to be engulfed in
a Bosnia which is part of a greater Serbia.' He also denied that Croatia was
seeking to annex parts of Bosnia.
However, he said: 'When you start dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina into two, it
is not a very hard choice for the Moslems . . . it is widely believed here
that many Moslems were originally Croats.' Serbia alleges that the Moslems
were originally Serbs, forced to convert under the Turkish occupation from
the 14th century.
Mr Karadzic explained that the talks concentrated on 'the future borders of
the Serb and Croat constituent states'.
He said Croatia could gain the four-fifths of Mostar, southern Bosnia.
Mostar is set on the banks of the River Neretva. The Serbian leader insisted
that Serbia would retain control over the eastern bank of the Neretva, where
federal army munitions factories are concentrated.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Painful and protracted birth of a nation: Uzbekistan is
attempting the difficult task of reviving its economy and establishing a
secular government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After just four months' training in the US, Mr Rustam Azimov, 33, is the
most experienced banker in the newly independent republic of Uzbekistan.
Although an able chairman of the National Bank for Foreign Economic
Activity, Mr Azimov is looking forward to the return of colleagues from
abroad to help him handle the republic's international banking operations.
'Before, we never had to deal with such matters,' he explains. 'Now we are
counting on our young people to quickly absorb everything we need to know.'
Just a short drive across Tashkent, in the old part of the Uzbek capital,
but a world apart in how they see their future, dozens of teenage girls in
white headscarves are studying the Koran at religious instruction classes.
Their veiled teacher, a retired construction engineer who 10 years ago would
never have covered her face, wants an 'Islamic state' in which women would
no longer be allowed to work in factories, on farms, or building sites.
These two faces of Uzbekistan  - on one hand a shortage of business skills
and on the other the appeal of long-suppressed religious and ethnic values
 -pose a dilemma for this Central Asian republic as it seeks simultaneously
to build an independent state and switch to a market economy.
While Islam remains a largely dormant force  - Uzbeks consider themselves
Moslems though few know what this entails  - a failure to deal with
structural economic challenges could open the way for a state governed by
religious laws.
The difficult transition from the one-party state to a more pluralist
political system is being closely watched by the American government, and by
neighbouring countries  - particularly Turkey and Iran. All are seeking to
fill the vacuum left by the collapse of communist rule in Uzbekistan, as
well as Turkmenia, Tajikistan and Kirghizia, the other three former Soviet
Central republics.
The US, anxious to guard against Islamic fundamentalism, earlier this year
became the first foreign country to establish an embassy in Tashkent.
Turkey, a Nato ally which enjoys unrivalled prestige in Uzbekistan because
of ethnic links with Central Asia and because of its economic success, is
being held up by President Islam Karimov as a model of development. By this,
he means a secular state which respects the country's Moslem identity but
keeps religion separate from government.
Despite the competition for regional influence there are also moves for
co-operation. This weekend, presidents of the Central Asian republics will
meet in the Turkmen capital Ashkhabad with leaders of Iran, Turkey and
Pakistan to consolidate new economic ties.
Economic development is a high priority for Uzbekistan's 20m inhabitants.
But they face daunting problems. The discovery of oil in the republic on
March 2  - the day that it joined the United Nations  - was seen as a gift
of God. But it will take more than oil to build a market economy.
The republic is a net importer of consumer goods, food and, until now,
energy. It has also traditionally relied on funds from Moscow for up to 30
per cent of its budget expenditures.
Traditionally a supplier of raw materials first to the Russian empire and
then to the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan is now trying, with varying degrees of
success, to sell its commodities on international markets, without going
through Moscow.
With this aim, Mr Azimov's bank was founded last October by the state-owned
enterprises that account for the bulk of the republic's wealth. Uzbekistan
has one main advantage over many other former Soviet republics: its vast
natural resources. Apart from the newly discovered oil fields, it is the
world's third-largest cotton grower and seventh-biggest gold producer.
'We were a colony and we remain a colony,' argues Mr Azimov, who complains
that Uzbekistan develops only 8 per cent to 10 per cent of its raw materials
internally. The rest is exported to plants in Russia or abroad  - with a
Russian cotton shirt selling for 30 times the price of the Uzbek raw cotton
which went into making it. Uzbekistan is now seeking foreign investment to
help it process more of its wealth.
As well as trying to increase profits from natural resources, the ruling
National Democratic party (the former Communist party) is taking hesitant
steps towards introducing a market economy. But, as in other former Soviet
republics, the measures have met resistance. Price liberalisation in January
provoked student riots that were brutally put down.
Speeding up the distribution of wealth is seen as crucial in maintaining
social stability, given the demographic legacy of decades of lopsided
development. The decision by Soviet economic planners that Central Asia
should focus on agriculture deprived Uzbekistan of an industrial base and  -
given the tradition of big families in rural areas  - fuelled population
growth. The population of Central Asia is growing by 1m people a year,
600,000 of them in Uzbekistan.
This in turn generates an ever-growing demand for land and water resources.
The depletion of the Aral Sea is a result  - one of the great ecological
disasters of the 20th century.

FT  08 MAY 92 / America's poor are very different: Michael Prowse on
competing visions of how to transform welfare policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rioting in Los Angeles last week was some of the worst in US history.
Pessimists will assume that little has changed since the late 1960s: the
inner cities are as poverty stricken as ever while blacks and other
minorities still endure racial discrimination.
Yet this may convey too bleak a picture. By most indicators, overt racism in
the US has declined in the past quarter-century; the reaction to the
acquittal of the white policemen in the Rodney King case was so violent
partly because the decision seemed so out of line with contemporary
standards of racial justice. At the same time, a relatively prosperous black
middle class has emerged: income and wealth differentials are now much
greater within than between different racial groups.
Residual discrimination remains a fact of life, but the main problem is that
a rising economic tide has not lifted all boats. In real terms, living
standards have risen by about 80 per cent since President Lyndon Johnson
launched his War on Poverty in the early 1960s. Yet the growing affluence of
the suburbs has not spilled over into the inner-city ghettos.
Faced with these realities, many conservatives now argue that the US took a
wrong turning in the 1960s. Although well-intentioned, the wave of publicly
financed programmes for the poor  - collectively known as the 'Great
Society'  - contributed to the problems they were intended to solve by
helping foster 'a culture of dependency'.
Such critics would add that, although the Reagan and Bush administrations
gradually withdrew support from some Great Society programmes, they failed
to throw their weight fully behind alternative reform agendas. The result is
a lack of effective policies for tackling inner-city decay.
There are at least two competing visions of how to reform traditional
welfare policies. The first are a set of Thatcherite doctrines proposed by
the free-market right; until Los Angeles these were only weakly supported by
President George Bush. The most eloquent exponent of such ideas within the
Bush cabinet is Mr Jack Kemp, the secretary for housing and urban
development.
The US, he says, 'must discard the failed bureaucratic model for fighting
poverty and instead empower individuals to control their lives through the
power of property ownership and entrepreneurship'. His agenda for urban
renewal includes items such as:
The creation of 'enterprise zones' by abolishing capital gains taxes for
those who work, save and invest in inner cities;
Measures to allow public housing tenants to manage and ultimately own their
own homes;
The abolition of welfare rules that encourage family break-up supported by
incentives for families that stay together.
Mr Kemp's ideas are attracting considerable support across the political
spectrum. Many mayors like the sound of 'enterprise zones', although few
believe with Mr Kemp that the abolition of capital gains taxes 'would flood
the inner cities with capital'. Relaxations on welfare recipients' ability
to earn and save are also popular, although the high cost of raising these
ceilings may not be appreciated.
The notion that government must do more to help families is the idea that
resonates most powerfully. The very sharp rise in the proportion of families
headed by single women, widely seen as one of the core reasons for
dysfunctional behaviour in the inner cities. The figures for blacks are
particularly striking: more than half of families have female heads
indicating a serious lack of male role models.
While sympathising with much of the Kemp agenda, other conservatives
question the premises behind some of the policies. Free marketeers tend to
assume that barriers are somehow preventing the poor from responding to the
same economic signals as everybody else. Misquoting F Scott Fitzgerald, an
alternative view is that the poor are different, not because they have less
cash but because they have a different psychology. This school  - known as
the 'new paternalists'  - believes that welfare policies must be explicitly
designed to mould behaviour.
Mr Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University and author of
The New Politics of Poverty, just published by Basic Books, is at the
forefront of the movement. He argues that US society already offers big
economic rewards for those willing to compete in labour markets. The main
cause of poverty today, he suggests, is not lack of job opportunities,
childcare or skills but the reluctance of increasing numbers of the poor to
work.
In 1989, fewer than half of the heads of poor families had any earnings at
all, a drop of a fifth in 30 years. At the height of the economic boom of
the 1980s, he says, only 23 per cent of 16-19-year-olds in New York City
were in the labour force  - less than half the national rate.
Mr Mead sees the poor mainly as 'dutiful but defeated'. He believes they
mostly share the same values as the rest of society but are simply less in
control of their lives. There is also a defeatist mentality at work that
'refuses to believe that opportunity exists, even when it does'. Economic
incentives are not enough because the poor lack the competence to take
advantage of them. Mr Mead believes the solution lies in more authoritarian
policies: he supports workfare and other mandatory programmes because they
'get people involved and overcome their pessimism'. Authority thus operates
as 'the midwife, not the antithesis, of freedom'.
The 1988 Family Support Act did introduce elements of workfare. But the new
paternalists want its provisions to be toughened and extended to cover a
bigger fraction of the welfare population.
How do left-leaning liberals respond to the onslaught from conservatives?
They start by emphasising that President Johnson's War on Poverty was hardly
a failure. It reduced the poverty rate from 19 per cent in 1964 to 11 per
cent in 1973. (The rate has since risen to 13.5 per cent.)
The Great Society also made big advances in healthcare, education  -
including the universally praised Head Start programme for pre-schoolers  -
and pensions, where more generous payments have largely eliminated poverty
among the elderly.
Perhaps the most serious criticism is that too much cash was siphoned off by
programmes that primarily benefited the middle classes. Targeted benefits
for the poor, by contrast, have steadily declined. Since the early 1970s,
for example, the real value of Aid for Families with Dependent Children (the
main welfare programme for single mothers) has dropped 27 per cent.
During the Reagan-Bush years federal government has also savagely cut
support for cities, where the deadly cocktail of drugs, crime, broken
families, unemployment and poverty does the greatest harm. According to the
National League of Cities, direct federal aid has declined by more than 60
per cent since 1981.
Many on the left of centre also reject the conservative analysis of the
causes of family breakdown and poverty. The idea that welfare policies have
undermined families, for example, seems, at best, an exaggeration: big
variations in state welfare benefits are not closely linked with marriage
rates or the frequency of teenage pregnancies.
Mr William Julius Wilson, a black sociologist at the University of Chicago,
sees the urban underclass as primarily the product of structural economic
change, reinforced by greater social mobility. The plight of inner cities
reflects:
Global economic forces that have reduced the demand for and wages of US
blue-collar workers. Young unskilled blacks do not form stable families
because they cannot find jobs that will support wives and children or,
indeed, themselves;
Improved race relations which, ironically, have allowed professional blacks
to emulate middle-class whites and migrate out of cities. The communities
left behind lack both financial resources and role models; the vacuum has
been filled by crime and drug dealing.
On this view, the priority ought to be intensive skills training to make the
urban poor more employable.
Mr Ronald Mincy, an economist at the Urban Institute in Washington, shares
the view that 'irreversible economic changes' have put a greater premium on
scarce job skills. But, while not sympathising with the authoritarian
approach of the new paternalists, he puts considerable stress on behavioural
factors. As a black he argues that attitudes within the black community must
change.
He points out that of a list of 100 prominent blacks compiled by Ebony
magazine only five or six had achieved recognition through entrepreneurship.
Other ethnic groups, such as Asians and Koreans, did a great deal to create
employment opportunities for their own people: blacks should do the same.
He also worries that extraordinarily high unemployment rates among young
blacks reflect their contempt for menial jobs (which immigrants are willing
to take) and their less than compliant behaviour. But the refusal to accept
pay rates commensurate with their skill levels is exacting a heavy toll  -
evident in soaring crime and incarceration rates. 'We are willing
collaborators in our own destruction,' he says, adding that this is a
message that only a black could deliver.
On the positive side, many self-help black groups are working to change
attitudes among young blacks. In Oakland, California, for example, Mr Derek
Wilson is project co-ordinator for the Hawk Federation, a manhood
development project serving 60-80 blacks aged seven to 16. The programme
aims to raise 'competence, confidence and consciousness' by instilling moral
values, encouraging pride in African culture, yet also cultivating the
entrepreneurial skills needed for success in the free market.
The most encouraging sign in the US is the plethora of ideas about how
inner-city problems might be tackled  - as well as the apparent success of
some small-scale programmes. The biggest obstacle to progress in recent
years has been White House indifference to the urban underclass. After Los
Angeles, the prospects for a more constructive attitude must surely have
brightened.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Merger control
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission's decision in principle to vet the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) bid for Midland, while leaving UK
authorities free to deal with Lloyds Bank's rival offer, breaks new ground
in merger regulation by splitting jurisdiction over the outcome of an
important takeover battle.
The immediate casualty looks like Lloyds, which has said its bid may lapse
unless its offer and that of HSBC are examined in the UK. For that to
happen, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may now need
to persuade Brussels that compelling national interest requires the HSBC
offer to be reviewed in London. Since the Bank of England has already ruled
that the bid does not raise problems of prudential security, there is no
apparent case for ministerial intervention.
At this stage, Brussels has taken on the task of determining whether the
HSBC bid raises competition issues. In the relatively unlikely event that it
determined this to be the case, it would be desirable for these questions to
be explored by a single regulatory authority or at the very least by the two
authorities acting in close co-operation. If no competition problem is
judged to exist, the Hongkong bid can and should be allowed to proceed.
Meanwhile, it is sensible that the Lloyds' bid, which bears entirely on the
UK market, be dealt with in London.
Dividing lines
All of this, however, has exposed again the risk of jurisdictional conflicts
and 'double jeopardy' which has existed since the EC first sought expanded
control over mergers. The risk has grown as more European countries have
introduced merger controls of their own. Neater dividing lines between EC
and national competence would be desirable  - but hard to achieve in
practice. Alternatively, Brussels' merger 'thresholds' could be lowered to
catch more deals. That, however, could simply create further jurisdictional
problems, since even after 1992 many deals will raise purely national
competition issues.
The sensible solution is closer co-operation and convergence between EC and
national merger authorities. The time limits for completing merger
investigations should be harmonised, since variations create damaging
uncertainties and distortions. But harmonisation is most crucial in the
criteria used to assess mergers, since it is here that divergence will
create the biggest problems. The case for basing judgments exclusively on
competition issues is overwhelming. While regulators can invoke vague
'public interest' criteria at will, predictability, consistency and fairness
across the EC will suffer.
Less impartial
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, has adhered unswervingly
to that principle. However, he has to argue each case before 16 colleagues,
many of whom have proved less impartial in their views. Sir Leon's
successors may not be so strong-minded or persuasive. The best safeguard
against political meddling is to establish an independent EC cartel office,
answerable to the courts, and to ensure that commissioners could reverse its
rulings only in exceptional circumstances.
Mr Heseltine, meanwhile, is thought to favour loosening the 1984 Tebbit
doctrine on mergers to give more weight to 'national interest' factors. At
the very least, any relaxation should not change the MMC's current criteria,
but should provide simply for the rare and limited exercise of ministerial
discretion, preferably with specific accountability to parliament.
Even with such restrictions, there would be a risk of arbitrary and
unpredictable judgments, favouring special interest groups with the most
powerful Whitehall lobbyists. If Mr Heseltine really wants to create a
stable environment in which the whole of industry can flourish, and not just
pander to those sections best placed to bend his ear, he should resist the
temptation to tinker with merger rules. He should also avoid setting any
precedents in the Midland affair which could damage the long-term interests
of British business.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strange thing about David Leveaux's staging of 'Tis Pity for the Royal
Shakespeare Company is that the central brother and sister are played as the
least polished people in this Italian society. Even the ninny Bergetto has a
certain public-school edge to him. But not so Giovanni and Annabella.
Jonathan Cullen, first seen in a coat whose sleeves are too long for him,
underplays Giovanni's academic flair and gives him, unlike anybody else, a
Yorkshire accent. He (especially) and Saskia Reeves's Annabella have the
worst posture onstage.
But all of this adds up to a kind of artlessness in them. Their hot incest
(the axis of the plot) becomes not the depths of privileged decadence but a
helpless continuation of nursery delights, a retreat from the demands of the
sophisticated adult world. I cannot say that this is the correct reading of
the play, but it is here propounded with considerable urgency. Since Leveaux
and his original designer, Kenny Miller, have transposed the play, with
minimal glamour, into the mid-twentieth century, it also gains new
immediacy.
Which is heightened by the production's transfer from the Swan in Stratford
to the Pit. Much is lost, since the Pit has not the Swan's recesses or
over-stage balconies, of which this production made excellent use. But Rick
Fisher's lighting gives certain scenes fresh force, and the production
builds powerfully to the final horrid banquet. Not since the 1988-89 Deborah
Warner Titus Andronicus has the Pit audience so shuddered.
The staging has several gems of playing  - above all, Jonathan Hyde's grave
and impressive Vasques. Richard Bonneville plays the fool Bergetto with
model simplicity, and Guy Henry is memorable  - dry, loyal and finally
anguished  - as his servant Poggio. Sheila Reid wittily makes Annabella's
duenna Putana a salacious townmouse. Tim McInnerny, whom I find a wildly
variable actor, is here at his best as Annabella's husband Soranzo, his
nobility and passion wracking and then kindling him. The great scene between
him, his new wife and Vasques is the highlight of the performance.
Saskia Reeves is as natural an Annabella as we are likely to see; almost an
Annabella-next-door. The plain sincerity of her playing becomes more and
more touching. As Giovanni, Cullen is an odd amalgam. He can seem a forlorn
wimp, and then be lusty and intense. His voice wilts or whines and then
finds a sterling firmness that drives all before it. I prefer my Jacobean
tragedy to be in the high grand manner. But this account sticks in the mind.

Which of our current drama series does it seem likely broadcasters will want
to repeat in the year 2024? The question is prompted by today's repeat of
The Twilight Zone, a series of splendid fantasy and science fiction stories
which began transmission in the US in 1959. Today's episode, 'The Chaser',
was first broadcast in today's form in May 1960, though it was previously
performed live in 'The Billy Rose Television Theatre' in 1951. Roger is
madly in love with Leila, but she scarcely notices he exists. So he buys a
love potion which is only too astonishingly effective.
This is not one of the best episodes, but the whole series stands up
remarkably well. Unhappily Channel 4 will not be screening it until 1.35 in
the morning; a job for the VCR perhaps. Earlier the same channel begins a
new quiz which sounds as though it might make up for the loss of 'My Music':
The Music Game (8.30). Tony Slattery is in the chair but the panel does not
look as though it was chosen solely for musical expertise. Happily the best
impressionist of his generation makes a welcome return to BBC2 in a new
series: Rory Bremner (9.00).

FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: Joan of Arc at the Stake - Brighton Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honegger's dramatic oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake was the idea of Ida
Rubinstein, the mime, dancer and actress. She wanted Claudel to write the
poem. His reaction was 'Another Joan of Arc? No, I won't'. But she received
the text shortly afterwards. Honegger set to work, apparently greatly
stimulated. Rubinstein intended Joan as part of a double bill with the
scenic cantata La Sagesse, commissioned by her from Milhaud, and to perform
them at the Paris Opera. That institution, as so often, had cold feet. So
Joan was first done in concert form, with Rubinstein, in German, at Basle in
1938. La Sagesse was not given until after the war. Since the centenaries of
both Honegger and Milhaud fall this year a performance, at last, of the
double bill would have been a bright feather in Brighton's cap.
Or perhaps not. Generous rehearsal time would be needed and there did not
appear to have been enough of that for Sunday's concert performance of Joan
in the Dome. The BBC Symphony Orchestra came to join the Festival Chorus.
Since large forces are needed and the Dome platform is circumscribed, the
chorus was split in two and placed at the opposite ends of the balcony. I
was near the half with the men and the Christ's Hospital Junior Girls' Choir
(very good).
It cannot have been easy for the conductor David Robertson to keep the two
halves together. Maybe for those sitting dead centre (and for listeners to
Radio 3) things may have sounded better. It was not only the choral ensemble
that was rough. The picturesque touches with which Claudel larded his text
made slight impact. For much of the time the orchestra leathered away
between mezzoforte and fortissimo without light or shade.
There was a half-hearted attempt at semi-staging. A Cross was placed behind
the trombones and fitfully illuminated. The women soloists were dressed in
bright colours. Joan, barefoot, wore a simple dark dress. Fiona Shaw,
Brighton's successor to Ida Rubinstein, Vera Zorina, Ingrid Bergman and
other stars, has striking features almost as Gothic as Edith Sitwell and a
voice admirable for conveying suffering and hope, capable of holding its own
with the BBC SO. Miss Shaw remained obediently at the conductor's side but
looked as if she wanted to roam. Hence perhaps signs of physical tension.
Among the small parts tenor Neil Jenkins as Porcus and actor John Woodvine
as Brother Dominic stood out. In general Mr Robertson showed too little
regard for his soloists.
Joan of Arc at the Stake continues to win a popular success only rivalled
among works of this hybrid form by Orff's Carmina burana. It was given in
Dennis Arundell's English translation in which one is not too conscious of
that kind of French rhetoric which implies that if you intone names like
France, Burgundy, Rheims or Domremy often enough you have made a statement.
Many find the emotional impact strong: for others what remains is little
more than hot air and stale incense. Honegger was an able, attractive
composer. The tapestry is skilfully woven: the build-up of the last scene
and ending is impressive. Yet the final impression is of musical footnotes.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology: Holograms in a new light
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somewhere in Britain a man has removed the security hologram from his credit
card and replaced it with a three-dimensional image of Bugs Bunny. In the
two years since he made the exchange, retailers and shop assistants have
chortled, but none has ever questioned the validity of the holographic
rabbit.
The exercise, to demonstrate how ineffective holograms are as a security
measure, also shows how widely they have become accepted by consumers.
Holograms are made of light-sensitive plastic film that reflects and
transmits light in different ways. They appear on bonds, currency and
drivers' licences, as well as on video recordings and pharmaceutical
packaging. But some applications offer greater benefits for industry.
At a recent seminar on advances in the manufacture of holographic materials
at Loughborough University, a British Gas researcher expressed interest in
capturing transient events, such as laboratory explosions, on holograms.
Unlike the wire-frame models of car bodies commonly modelled on computers,
explosions and shocks to the flow of gas through a pipeline cannot be
captured in this way. Holograms will allow them to be reproduced, analysed
and measured in controlled conditions.
Holograms can also be made like semi-silvered mirrors, reflecting images and
data from a hidden instrument panel, but remaining transparent. Japanese car
manufacturers are among many investigating the possibility of using a pop-up
holographic screen in front of the driver to highlight dashboard data such
as speed and petrol consumption. Other research is aimed at projecting the
data or maps on the inside of the curved windscreen.
A similar technique could be used to provide instrument panels in aircraft.
British Aerospace, GEC Avionics and Crosfield Electronics have all expressed
interest in the use of holograms for instrumentation such as altimeters, for
example.
The most significant step forward in holographic research, however, will
come when moving holograms can be displayed; television screens offer
potentially the most demanding application. Sharp Electronics and
Loughborough University are among many organisations working on
three-dimensional television.
One idea is to create an array of tiny holographic lenses in the
photosensitive screen. These, using two television projectors behind the
screen, will give the illusion of depth by creating a moving stereoscopic
image. Initially, however, special glasses will need to be worn by the
viewer.
True three-dimensional television, or holograms in real time and not just in
instrumental panels, are still years away, says Jeremy Coupland,
co-ordinator for the Institute of Optical Engineering at Loughborough
University of Technology. For the immediate future, it seems the only
practical use for holograms is likely to be on credit cards. Keep an eye out
for Bugs Bunny.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Management: Social engineer who doesn't mind mugs - Lucy
Kellaway meets the dapper Gavin Laird in Peckham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Victorian facade can be seen from a long way down the Peckham Road,
incongruous among south London's council estates and video shops. The
Amalgamated Engineering Union's purpose-built headquarters is now restored
to its former red brick splendour, with a bright green lawn and flower beds
leading up to its front door.
Yet Gavin Laird, the no-nonsense general secretary, has shunned the grand
old Victorian rooms. His office is an undistinguished L-shaped space in a
new block at the back.
From the room itself, and from his account of what he does there, you would
not guess you were visiting a trade union chief. Rather, you might think the
dapper and direct Scot was the boss of a medium-sized company  - one
committed to efficiency and to cost-cutting. Indeed, this sparring partner
of British engineering companies is modernising his organisation in exactly
the same way that they are struggling to update theirs.
The aim is to make his unwieldy machine with its 1,400 branches and 19th
century ethos operate more smoothly. Since he became general secretary, he
has cut the headquarters staff from more than 300 to less than 100. 'In 1982
there was not a single word processor in the building. Now there is not a
single typewriter,' says Laird.
If every time he said 'members' you heard 'shareholders', you would be
impressed at how accountable this boss feels. 'Mine must be an office that
the members can feel proud of,' he says. 'After all, it is their property.'
The room is more than respectable, but with its mass produced furniture and
functional lights, members need not feel their money has been spent too
freely.
When the building was refurbished five years ago, Laird insisted that his
office was done last. 'I was ashamed that a trade union had its staff
working in such Dickensian conditions. You should have seen the toilets]'
These days he positively recommends a visit to the ladies'  - which turn out
to be tiled, with basins and cubicles: so unremarkable that you wonder what
they must have been like before.
In his own room, Laird has let the builders have free run with the decor,
but seems happy with the institutional result, and the little signs telling
smokers to empty their ashtrays after them. 'I'm not fussed', he says.
However, there are a few things in the room he is fussed about.
The first are his pictures. Facing his desk is a Lowry-esque painting of a
Glasgow tenement, which reminds him of the place he was born. There is the
picture of a grim-faced worker with his tools, painted by a joiner at the
Swan Hunter shipyard, and a whole collection of sentimental pastels that he
bought from a street artist in Jerusalem.
Another prized item is his desk, which Laird uses as further evidence of how
he supports his members. The clumping, metal-framed bit of furniture was
made by the men at Vickers  - at a competitive price, he adds hastily.
Above all, there is his music. In the cabinet behind his desk is a sleek CD
player  - 'Bang and Olufsen' he announces proudly. 'Listen', he says,
putting on a piece of Mozart, leaning back in his chair and sighing.
This is a ritual he goes through every morning at 7am, when he starts his
day. Laird works hard and is happy to let you know he is in the office for
some 12 hours a day and takes work home in the evenings and at weekends.
Outside sit his secretary and PA, of whom he is both complimentary and
demanding. A tray of coffee is brought in, but Laird objects: 'I'm getting a
cup] I never have a cup, I'd have preferred a mug'. Evidently this is no
joke. A few minutes later his PA returns bearing a mug of coffee.
When not making coffee, the secretary and PA spend their time sorting
through the several hundred letters Laird receives every day, bringing in
the bundles that need his attention. 'Let's look' he says, turning to one of
the seven plastic trays on his desk.
'This is a letter of complaint from a district where we are closing an
office and they don't like it . . . A consultant wants to give us something
for nothing  - which would cost us a fortune . . . A trade union wants to
see me about redundancies . . . Leicester Business School would like to know
our views on industrial relations . . .'
He skims through the pile efficiently. Despite his insistence on bringing
the old organisation up to date, Laird himself relies on more old fashioned
methods. He used to have a computer in his room but says he was 'too stupid
to be able to use it'.
Much of his time is spent a long way from his office. Seven weeks a year he
is at conferences, and at least once a month he visits a factory, the
further from London the better. But his primary job is back in Peckham where
he is struggling with the curious target of making himself redundant. 'My
aim is to make this organisation systematic, so that the day I get knocked
down by a bus, it does not matter.'

FT  08 MAY 92 / Management: Time comes to mind corporate Ps and Qs - Andrew
Jack explains why ethical codes are increasing in popularity among British
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of ethics in business might raise wry smiles from sceptics, but a
growing number of companies is embracing the idea  - at least on paper.
A survey* of 164 leading British companies published earlier this week
showed that 29 per cent had a written ethical code last year, compared with
18 per cent in 1987.
The codes tend to cover areas such as obligations to employees, customers
and shareholders, and responsibilities to suppliers and the community.
The Co-operative Bank courted publicity with its announcement this month
that it would not do business with organisations involved in a series of
activities.
Many companies have been quietly developing policies over a number of years,
including Esso, sponsor of the report, which has had an ethical code since
1977. In the US, by contrast, one study last year suggested that 84 per cent
of companies have written codes.
Stanley Kiaer, director of the Institute of Business Ethics, a corporate
think-tank which produced the British survey, argues there are at least
three reasons why ethical codes are becoming more widespread in Britain.
Companies are recognising the need to be seen by their shareholders to be
ethical; they are responding to pressure from graduate recruits who are
eager to discover a prospective employer's attitudes; and also to peer
pressure from competitors, as a growing number embrace ethical policies. 'I
think good practice always advances by a mixture of altruism and
self-interest,' Kiaer says. 'But if it results in a more ethical stance, the
motive doesn't matter.'
What is of more concern, however, is how seriously companies really take
these issues. Without a deep-seated commitment beyond self-interest, what is
the likelihood that they will abandon the ethical bandwagon as a new fad
emerges?
Unless the policies are spelt out in some depth, with a clear strategy for
ensuring they are implemented and enforced, they may be all but useless.
John Drummond, director of Integrity Works, part of Communication Works, a
London-based consultancy, argues that the 'de-layering' of modern
organisations and the greater delegation of decision-making means that many
more employees are being confronted by ethical choices than ever before.
Yet the survey found that only about two-thirds of the British companies
with a code went into sufficient detail on policies, examples and action to
be taken to make them achievable. Only a very small number demonstrated any
means of evaluating how effective their policies were in practice.
Lord Laing, president of the Institute, launched a code as chairman of
United Biscuits in 1987. He made it a requirement that the company's
auditors informed the board if they detected anything which infringed the
ethical policy. But that is a rare exception.
British subsidiaries of North American companies tend to take the subject
most seriously. Unisys, for example, has a full-time corporate ethics
officer with a small staff, responsible for monitoring and enforcement, and
a widespread training programme.
Each year, all managers and staff involved in buying or selling are asked to
sign a pledge that they have honoured the ethical code, and to disclose any
breaches. There is also an ethical hotline for all employees.
Even with these precautions, Chris Cherkas, director of human resources for
Unisys in the UK, concedes: 'It's very difficult to say what an ethical code
of practice has prevented. But its existence may have stopped things
happening.'
Ronald Berenbeim of the Conference Board, a New York-based business research
service, who has researched business ethics in the US over a number of
years, says there are at least three steps to developing an effective
corporate ethical policy.
The drafting of the code should be participatory, including all levels of
employees in discussions to gain an understanding of the corporate culture
and values.
Everyone should receive a copy of the code and be involved in discussions on
its meaning and implementation.
Any breaches in the code should be reported and discussed internally, so
that staff are aware that it is, as he says, 'a living document'.
Given that organisations and values constantly change, Berenbeim then adds a
fourth point.
'When all that is done,' he says, 'after about three years, companies should
probably start the process all over again'.

FT  08 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Docklands get that sinking feeling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks ago, the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone in London's Docklands came
of age. But its 10th anniversary, which brought the area's tax holidays to
an end, provided little cause for celebration.
The towering Canary Wharf development, which has come to symbolise
Docklands, is teetering on the brink. The failure of Olympia &amp; York, the
Canadian developer which created the project, would seal Dockland's
reputation as a developers' graveyard.
The area has been visited by the extremes of both success and failure. When,
in 1981, Mr Michael Heseltine, the then environment secretary, set up the
London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to oversee the regeneration
of 20 square miles of derelict land, he described the region in damning
terms.
'The area displays more acutely and extensively than any other area in
England the physical deterioration of the inner city and the need for urban
regeneration,' he said.
Six years later, it was dubbed an economic miracle. 'It is seen as the most
exceptional development location in the UK and, perhaps, the most dynamic in
Europe,' said Mr Reg Ward, chief executive of the LDDC in 1987. At the time,
land values had doubled over the previous year, yields had dropped to 5 per
cent and the ratio of private investment to public money was 7:1.
But five years on, the miracle has turned sour. Docklands is seen as the
most costly disaster in the history of UK property development, following a
collapse in property values and a glut of vacant property.
It is also seen as a planning and architectural disaster. 'London's
Docklands contains one of the worst collections of late 20th century
buildings to be seen anywhere in the world,' says the Architecture, Design
and Technology press, an architectural guide.
Around the world, Docklands is seen as an example of how not to regenerate
urban areas. It was intended to be a model of what could happen without
government interference. But in practice, the government has heavily
subsidised the area through tax breaks and infrastructure investment: Pounds
5bn is due to be ploughed into east London's infrastructure by 1995.
Moreover, the government may end up bailing out Canary Wharf by building the
Jubilee Line railway extension, transferring civil servants to the area and
developing the East Thames Corridor.
The government's avowed goal was to cut red tape and give private enterprise
its head. Yet even the government was surprised by the way matters turned
out. The philosophy behind the enterprise zones was to attract industrial
development to the area. Instead, the LDDC decided to attract commercial
users.
'We used the enterprise zone in a somewhat maverick way by bringing together
our totally optimistic aspirations to make the Isle of Dogs an office and
commercial location rather than confirming it as a industrial one,' said the
LDDC's Mr Ward.
Under Mr Ward, a visionary, exuberant and headstrong character, Docklands
built up a powerful momentum. Tax breaks, advertising, the light railway,
the London City airport and the British Telecom satellite station helped
transform the character of the area.
The turning point for Docklands  - and with hindsight, its biggest mistake
 -was the decision to raise its sights and compete with the City and West
End.
The potential seemed obvious, however, following the arrival of O&amp;Y, the
world's largest property developer, which decided to invest Pounds 3bn in
Europe's biggest office scheme.
O&amp;Y recognised that London had the most expensive and old fashioned office
stock in Europe, which fell a long way short of the aspirations of potential
tenants. Tenants wanted large, cheap and high technology offices; the
Docklands provided an abundance of cheap, empty land, just 15 minutes away
from the City. The logic seemed impeccable.
It did not work out as planned. O&amp;Y had to offer generous incentives to
tenants; yet 40 per cent of the buildings within Canary Wharf which are
complete are still unlet. In part, this reflects the severity of the
property recession in London. But to a greater extent, it is a result of
London's haphazard approach to its own development.
This lack of an overall planning strategy allowed the City of London and
surrounding boroughs to relax their own planning controls, creating a glut
of space that undermined demand for offices in Docklands. The sheer enormity
of the Canary Wharf development put far too much strain on existing
infrastructure and improvements, such as better transportation, came far too
late. As a result, the image of the area was tarnished and Canary Wharf
failed to attract any big UK companies.
The Docklands experiment failed in other ways, too. It was launched in the
teeth of hostility from neighbouring local authorities, and it inspired
intense opposition from the local community. This was highlighted by a
Pounds 100m law suit from local residents against O&amp;Y and the LDDC because
of the noise, dust, dirt and disruption from the construction works.
To its critics, Docklands demonstrates the flaw in the Conservative party's
philosophy of urban regeneration. 'It is a fundamentally flawed approach,'
says Mr Bob Colenutt of the Docklands Consultative Committee (DCC), a local
authority association. The benefits of developments in Docklands have yet to
trickle down to the local community, he adds.
Three quarters of the jobs in the enterprise zone have simply involved
relocation of jobs from other parts of London; in total the enterprise zone
has resulted in the creation of just 2,733 jobs, says the DCC. Assuming the
cost of tax breaks and infrastructure totals Pounds 2.9bn - according to the
LDDC  - the DCC calculates that the government will have spent more than
Pounds 1m for every new job in the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone.
The LDDC, however, says that the costs of the enterprise zone have been
exaggerated and, furthermore, it is proud of its employment record: between
1981 and 1992 unemployment within the development area increased by 33 per
cent; in Greater London as a whole unemployment has increased by 47 per cent
over the same period.
Opinions differ on the future of Docklands. A substantial, albeit biased,
section of the property industry thinks it should scale back its ambitions
and settle for being a cheap location for clerks and computer installations.
'It should be like Croydon or Hammersmith,' says one consultant. The
problems of O&amp;Y, which may well result in the cancellation of the Jubilee
Line extension and the end of more development at Canary Wharf, make this
outcome likely.
The DCC thinks Docklands should concentrate on more modest development
including the allocation of half the Royal Docks for social housing. 'The
fantastic visions of the 1980s have to be reassessed,' says Mr Colenutt.
But the LDDC refuses to amend its plans, arguing that the DCC's ideas would
merely accelerate the spiral of decline. The LDDC sees the recession as a
chance to catch up on the development of infrastructure, which should
finally be in place when the UK economy picks up.
'London needs Docklands to enable it to remain one of the world's top three
cities,' says Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of the LDDC. 'Why should we not
be able to compete with the City of London and the City of Westminster?'
asks Mr Eric Sorensen, chief executive of the LDDC.
'Docklands will have important advantages in its communications,' he adds,
citing the following important additions: a broad highway running from the
City to the Royal Docks will be completed by the summer of 1993, coinciding
with the expansion and upgrading of the Docklands light railway.
The government's belief was that it could not justify building roads and
tube lines across wasteland. Its policy of no subsidies and no
infrastructure gradually turned into one of subsidies and infrastructure.
The message of the Docklands enterprise zone simply underlines what the
property industry always knew: infrastructure is the key to development.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Essex man reflects anti-Labour mood - Council Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR lost ground across southern England last night, surrendering seats to
the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
Essex man delivered the most spectacular rebuff to Labour: the Tories won
all 15 seats up for grabs in Basildon (one third of the council), and took
control. Large swings also occurred in Milton Keynes, Welwyn Hatfield and
Brighton, where Labour lost eight seats to the Tories but narrowly held
control. Labour also lost control of Cambridge, where it won the Commons
seat in the general election.
Mr Bryan Gould, MP for Dagenham and a Labour leadership candidate, put a
brave face on the party's poor showing, blaming 'voter fatigue',
particularly among Labour supporters. No elections were held in London
yesterday, but a BBC projection of the results across the whole region put
Labour third behind the Liberal Democrats in share of the vote  - with only
21 per cent.
However, Labour retained control of far more councils than the Liberal
Democrats, and held areas such as Crawley, Harlow, Reading, Slough and
Watford, all of which returned Tories in the general election last month.
Liberal Democrats took comfort from gains in Bath, Portsmouth and Eastbourne
 - which they lost in the general election. The Tories went some way to
healing one self-inflicted wound by defeating rebel Tories in West
Oxfordshire whose defection two years ago presaged the downfall of the poll
tax  - and, indeed, its authoress.
Earlier in the day, the Tories hailed the defection of a Labour councillor
in Berkshire, saying it had been the second such defection since last
month's general election.
Mr Cliff Rayner, formerly a Labour member of Berkshire county council,
joined the Conservative group, giving it exactly half the 76 county council
seats, and increasing the prospect that the party can win back the council.
Labour's attempts in Liverpool to shake off its problems with Militant
backfired as its vote was split and the Liberal Democrats made 10 gains out
of 34 seats contested, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The Broad Left, fielding 22 candidates against official Labour ones, won
only one seat. The Liberal Democrats, who were defending eight seats, ended
the night with 18.
Labour remains the largest party on the council but the numbers of seats are
finely balanced. Labour has 40 seats, Liberal Democrats 37 and the Broad
Left 18.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Limited Scottish gains for Tories - Council Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives made gains in Scotland at the expense of Labour, but
neither they nor the Scottish National party did as well as they had hoped
in elections for all the country's 53 district councils.
The Tories, who had high hopes after their relative success in the general
election, failed to become the largest party in Edinburgh or take control of
the city council, although Labour lost overall control.
But they won Kyle and Carrick district council, which is centred on Ayr, and
took Perth and Kinross. However, they reached a dead heat with Labour in
Stirling  - as they did in 1988  - and lost control of Bearsden and
Milngavie, outside Glasgow, making a net gain of one council.
The SNP became the largest party in West Lothian and in Falkirk at the
expense of Labour, but failed to win Cumbernauld and Kilsyth from Labour. It
ended the night with no extra councils but more councillors.
In a generally low turnout, Labour  - which won 27 councils in 1988  - lost
control of five districts but kept control of Aberdeen.
The Liberal Democrats lost wards in some districts but strengthened control
of North East Fife and took control in Annandale and Eskdale in south-west
Scotland from independents.

FT  08 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Post-petition diesel fuel payments are valid
in winding-up
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENNEY v JOHN HUDSON &amp; CO LTD
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Fox, Lord Justice Russell and Lord Justice
Staughton): April 9 1992
PAYMENTS MADE in good faith by a company in the ordinary course of business
after commencement of a compulsory winding-up in respect of supplies
delivered before presentation of the winding-up petition, may be validated
by the court if there is a possibility that they benefit the company and its
unsecured creditors in that they ensure that further deliveries will be made
by the supplier thus enabling the company to continue its business.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr L K Denney,
liquidator of the company SA &amp; D Wright Ltd, from the decision of Judge
Davidson QC that payments made by the company to suppliers of diesel, John
Hudson &amp; Co Ltd, after presentation of a creditor's winding up-petition,
were not void.
Section 522 of the Companies Act 1985 (re-enacted in section 127 of the
Insolvency Act 1986) provides: 'In a winding-up by the court, any
disposition of the company's property . . . made after the commencement of
the winding-up, unless the court otherwise orders, is void.'
LORD JUSTICE FOX said the company carried on business as a haulier. Hudsons
was a supplier of fuel oils.
In early spring 1984, Hudsons became concerned about the company's payment
record. In May of that year, it put the company on terms that it must pay
for previous deliveries before delivery of new supplies. That was applied in
practice thereafter.
On June 27 1986, a petition for the compulsory winding-up of the company was
presented by a creditor. At that time, the company owed Hudsons Pounds
17,132 under three invoices, numbers 437706, 437927 and 438233, dated June
2, 11 and 24 respectively.
On July 7, the company paid Hudsons Pounds 12,859, which settled invoices
437706 and 437927.
On July 10 the petition came to the notice of a director of the company, but
it continued to trade.
On July 17, the company paid Hudsons Pounds 4,214 in settlement of invoice
438233.
On July 24, the petition was advertised in the Gazette.
Between July 27 and October 2, various invoices were delivered by Hudsons
and sums paid by the company for fuel oil supplied.
On October 15, an order for the compulsory winding-up of the company was
made. On December 17, the liquidator was appointed.
On May 19 1989, the liquidator applied for a declaration that the payments
of Pounds 12,859 and Pounds 4,214 made on July 7 and 17, constituted
'dispositions of the company's property' which were void under section 522
of the Companies Act 1985.
Judge Davidson QC made an order that the two payments be not avoided. The
liquidator now appealed.
In Re Grays Inn Construction (1980) 1 WLR 711 the following propositions
were approved:
(1) The court's discretion under section 522 was entirely at large, subject
to the general principles which applied to any kind of discretion and also
to the limitation that it be exercised in the context of the statute's
liquidation provisions.
(2) The basic principle of law governing liquidation of insolvent estates
was that assets would be distributed pari passu (in equal proportion) among
unsecured creditors as at date of bankruptcy.
(3) There were occasions, however, when it might be beneficial not only for
the company but also for unsecured creditors, that it should be able to
dispose of some of its property after the petition had been presented, but
before the winding-up order was made. Thus, it might sometimes be beneficial
to company and creditors that it should be able to continue business in its
ordinary course.
(4) In considering whether to make a validating order, the court must always
do its best to ensure that the interest of unsecured creditors would not be
prejudiced.
(5) The desirability of the company's being enabled to carry on its business
was often speculative. In each case, the court must carry out a balancing
exercise.
(6) The court should not validate any transaction which might result in
pre-liquidation creditors being paid in full at the expense of other
creditors, in the absence of special circumstances. If, for example, it were
in the interests of the creditors generally that the business should be
carried on and that could only be achieved by paying for goods supplied to
the company when the petition was presented but not yet paid for, the court
might exercise its discretion to validate payment for those goods.
(7) A disposition carried out in good faith in the ordinary course of
business at a time when the parties were unaware that a petition had been
presented would usually be validated unless there was ground for thinking
the transaction might involve an attempt to prefer the disponee.
(8) Despite the strength of the principle of securing pari passu
distribution, it had no application to post-liquidation creditors  - for
example, the sale of an asset at full market value after presentation of the
petition. That was because such a transaction involved no dissipation of the
company's assets for it did not reduce the value of its assets.
There was no reason to doubt that Hudsons was acting in good faith and in
the ordinary course of business established between it and the company as to
payments for and supply of fuel oils. Nor was there any reason to suppose
that the company was seeking to prefer Hudsons over the other creditors when
it made the payments in question.
Hudson's knew nothing of the petition until after the winding-up order. A
director of the company did become aware of it on July 10, but the company
simply continued to trade. There seemed to be nothing to suggest that the
company or its directors were consciously acting in bad faith towards the
other unsecured creditors or any of them.
The court accepted that the parties acted in good faith.
The essential questions were whether the parties were acting in the ordinary
course of business; and whether the relevant transactions were likely to be
for the benefit of the creditors generally.
The parties were acting in accordance with their normal and established
course of business.
As to whether the transactions were likely to benefit the general body of
creditors, although the two payments were in respect of pre-liquidation
debts, they were not payments for which the company got no quid pro quo.
Under the standing arrangement introduced in 1984, the company received the
further benefit that it could then order a further supply of fuel oil  -
payment being deferred until the next supply was required.
Thus it was not a situation in which one pre-liquidation creditor was
preferred to the others. The oil purchased seemed to have been of much the
same value as the amount paid.
The effect of the payments was that the company ordered a supply of diesel.
Without the diesel, the company could not continue in business. It was
possible that continuance of the business was not a benefit to the company.
But there was no evidence of that.
The reality was that the parties acted in good faith in the ordinary course
of their established business relations and the company obtained a benefit
from the payment, namely the capacity to give a further order which would
enable it to continue its business.
The benefit in the present case was not the supply of goods purchased
pre-liquidation. It was the fact that the payment for those goods would
enable the company to order further supplies at once and pay later.
The supplies would enable the business to be carried on and earn revenue.
What the payments secured were further supplies. The company was continuing
to trade and one could only assume that it would necessarily require such
supplies for the business. There was no evidence to the contrary. In a
situation like the present one, one could reasonably assume that what was
for the benefit of the company would be for the benefit of the general body
of creditors. The judge was exercising a discretion. It was a wide one.
There was no basis for interfering with his decision.
The appeal was dismissed.
Their Lordships concurred.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Finance Bill covers tax rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCE Bill will clarify tax rules for building societies and introduce
more quickly a proposed Budget measure on gift aid, the Treasury announced
yesterday.
The bill is to be published on 20 May and is expected to be through the
Commons by the end of June.
The measure will first be debated by MPs straight after the Whitsun recess,
but the Budget resolutions on which it is based are likely to be debated
next Thursday.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, said that the Finance Bill
would confirm the composite rate tax (CRT) charge on interest paid to
investors for the years 1986-87 to 1989-90 set out in the relevant Treasury
orders.
The validity of the composite rates within that period was questioned by the
Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth-largest building society, which last summer
sought judicial review of the rate of CRT from 1986-87.
Mr Dorrell said the government was moving to legislate because it was not
'acceptable for the Exchequer's claim to the amounts involved to be in
doubt, possibly for a number of years'.
Sir John Cope, a Treasury minister, said that the reduction from Pounds 600
to Pounds 400 for the minimum limit on donations qualifying for tax relief
under gift aid would be brought forward to apply from yesterday instead of 1
July.
The bill will be substantial, comprising some 70 clauses and several
schedules.
It will include some important aspects of the Budget, such as changes to
inheritance tax, extra help for the film industry and abolition of the
Business Expansion Scheme. Much, however, will be technical measures on the
European single market.

THE government yesterday published the short bill that will implement the
Maastricht agreement on economic and political union, Philip Stephens
writes.
The bill makes clear that a separate decision by parliament would be
required before sterling could be absorbed into a single European currency.
It also signalled its determination to press ahead quickly with preparations
to put in place its privatisation programme with the publication of the bill
to pave the way for eventual sell-off of British Coal and British Rail.
The British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill empowers the two
corporations to take whatever steps are necessary to prepare for
privatisation. It will be followed, probably in the autumn, with separate
bills providing for the implementation of plans for the sale of British Coal
and for private operation of train services.
A third bill tabled yesterday will implement the changes to the Uniform
Business Rate announced in the Budget.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Portillo pledges 'firm grip': Chief secretary to the
Treasury's first Commons speech on public expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING ministers were warned to expect hard bargaining when negotiating
their budgets for 1993-94 by Mr Michael Portillo in his first speech in the
Commons yesterday as chief secretary to the Treasury.
With Treasury officials expected to begin bilateral discussions next week,
he promised to keep the 'firmest grip' over the total of public expenditure
when MPs resumed the debate on the Queen's Speech.
Mr Portillo, who was frequently reminded of his Thatcherite credentials,
said that the government's determination to control public spending and to
conduct its business prudently did not simply arise from a desire for
efficiency and sound economic policy.
To Conservative cheers, the chief secretary stressed: 'Unlike the Labour
party, we do not believe in the inexorable growth of reach and size of the
state. Nor do we believe that the state can and should try to solve all our
problems.'
He angered the opposition benches by taunting Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow
chief secretary, who hopes to become Labour's deputy leader, over her role
in steering the party to its fourth successive election defeat by framing a
shadow budget requiring a Pounds 7bn tax increase.
Responding to a challenge from Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover), the chief
secretary said he had 'no reason to change' forecasts that the public-sector
borrowing requirement for the current financial year would total Pounds
28bn.
Mr Portillo said the government had been returned to power because it had
gained the voters' trust by showing that it could reduce public borrowing,
end the inexorable rise in public expenditure's share of national income,
and bring about a massive reduction in personal taxation.
Lower tax and a smaller role for the state fostered an environment in which
business could flourish, industry prosper and the economy grow.
Mr Portillo looked to resumed economic growth to 'enable the government to
increase public expenditure on key areas, cut direct taxes and reduce public
borrowing'.
He underlined the government's commitment to reducing the share of the
national income which was taken by the state and to balancing the budget
over the medium term.
Mr Portillo said medium-term policy would be designed to ensure that the
convergence criteria agreed at the Maastricht summit were met.
Taxes would be reduced 'when it is prudent to do so'.
Mrs Beckett recalled that Mr Portillo had championed the poll tax and said
he had 'absolutely no conscience' to preside over a steady stream of cuts
affecting the poorest members of society.
She renewed Labour's election charge that the government had caused a 'home
grown' recession, and contended that the size of the public-sector borrowing
requirement  - 'Pounds 28bn and rising'  - and the deficit on the balance of
payments reflected the underlying weakness of the economy.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Fowler to be Tory chairman
</HEADLINE>

   By RALPH ATKINS

<TEXT>
SIR Norman Fowler, former cabinet minister and political ally of the prime
minister, is to become Conservative party chairman.
His appointment from Monday, expected to be announced at the weekend, came
as Mr Cranley Onslow appeared to have retained his chairmanship of the 1922
committee of backbench Tory MPs by promising to stand down after another
year in the job.
Sir Marcus Fox, Conservative MP for Shipley, had planned to stand in next
Thursday's election but, after Mr Onslow's announcement, was reconsidering
whether to force a contest.
The post of Conservative party chairman fell vacant after the appointment of
Mr Chris Patten as governor of Hong Kong. Sir Norman's acted as an adviser
to Mr John Major's during the election.
His biggest challenge will be to restore party finances, which were in
deficit even before the general election.
Sir Norman, who resigned from the government in 1990, will stand down as
chairman of the Conservative backbench Europe committee.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Labour chief whip faces challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK FOSTER, Labour's chief whip, looks likely to face a formidable
challenge for his post as the party's Commons business manager in an
election that may be brought forward to as soon as next month.
Mr John Evans, at present Labour party chairman and MP for St Helens North,
is canvassing support for the job that takes on a new significance as the
Conservative majority has dropped from more than 100 to 21.
Speculation is also mounting over the shadow cabinet elections amid reports
that Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, and Ms Jo Richardson,
voice on women's issues, may have decided not to put forward their names for
nomination. If they do step down  - taken with the resignations of Mr Neil
Kinnock and Mr Roy Hattersley  - it will create four vacancies.
Critics of Mr Foster say he has been unduly lenient with absentee MPs. His
defenders reply that Labour's strategy in the last parliament was to
concentrate on building support in the country by encouraging MPs to
participate in regional campaigning.
That will now come to an end as the Labour whips' office concentrates its
efforts on devising ambushes and harrying tactics in Westminster aimed at
wearing down the government and forcing compromises on legislation.
Last year Mr Foster comfortably saw off a challenge by some 80 votes from Mr
Peter Snape, the West Bromwich East MP.
Mr Evans, who sits on Labour's national executive as the socialist
organisations' representative, is said to have won a substantial body of
support already.
The timing of elections for the posts of chief whip and chairman of the
parliamentary Labour party, at present Mr Stan Orme, is likely to be
discussed at next Wednesday's shadow cabinet meeting.
While normal practice requires an election shortly after a Queen's Speech,
the contest for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership has left the
party in limbo, with the shadow cabinet elections also postponed until the
outcome on July 18.
Mr Foster and Mr Orme, who may also face a challenge, are expected to
propose to the shadow cabinet that the contest for their posts should go
ahead now to allow for tactical planning of parliamentary business.
Such a move would happen only if the candidates in the leadership race, Mr
John Smith and Mr Bryan Gould, gave their blessing.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, suffered a further sharp
fall in UK sales of new cars in April in sharp contrast to the overall
increase in UK new car demand, Kevin Done writes.
Rover's sales volume last month fell year-on-year by 9.6 per cent to 15,854
compared with a 9.1 per cent jump in the overall market.
Its market share last month plunged to only 11.5 per cent from 13.9 per cent
a year ago.
For the first four months, it remained narrowly in fourth place in the UK
new car sales league behind Ford; Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General
Motors of the US; and the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen.
In the first four months Rover's sales, at 64,420, were 27.7 per cent lower
than a year before.
Its market share in the first few months plunged to only 11.8 per cent from
15.3 per cent in the same period a year ago.
Ford, the UK new car market leader, again achieved a late surge in
registrations in the final days of the month.
It logged 38.2 per cent of its total April registrations in the last five
days of the month.
In the first four months this year the carmakers that gained most ground
were Renault, Peugeot and BMW.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Dewhurst butchers chain faces shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEWHURST, which runs the UK's biggest chain of butchers shops, will today
disclose details of a substantial rationalisation of its 1,006 shops.
Nevertheless the company, part of the privately owned Vestey business
empire, yesterday refused to comment on the widespread reports that it
planned to close up to 600 shops with the loss of 1,000 jobs.
The company said it first had to inform its 4,234 staff of its decisions at
regional meetings. There was disquiet, though, about possible closures at
Dewhurst outlets yesterday.
Dewhurst's plight may partly reflect the financial strains of the Vestey
parent company, which was recently forced to make substantial provisions on
its property portfolio.
It also highlights the intense pressure that traditional butchers have
experienced as a result of changing shopping habits and the growth of
supermarket chains.
According to estimates from Verdict, the retail research company, the big
grocery chains now account for more than half of all carcase meat sold in
the UK and about 92 per cent of bacon, ham, poultry and other meat products.
Mr Richard Hyman, Verdict's director, said: 'I do not think it is too
fanciful to suggest that this is at least partly due to the changing nature
of society.
'Mothers do not pass on knowledge about cuts of meat to their children. It
is pretty innocuous to go into a supermarket and choose a recognisable chunk
of meat, whereas in a serviced butcher's shop you have to know what you are
asking for.'
Mr John Fuller of the National Federation of Meat Traders, which represents
independent butchers, said butchers were trying to raise knowledge through
educational programmes at schools.
He added that, although butchers had undoubtedly suffered from supermarket
competition, there were grounds for believing that smaller, family-owned
butchers were experiencing a comeback, partly at the expense of the bigger
chains  - such as Dewhurst.
'Elements like the weather do have an impact on whether people buy stewing
steak or barbecue meats,' he said. 'The private butcher is an entrepreneur
and can respond a lot more quickly than the larger managed groups.'
Nevertheless, the latest government figures showed that the number of
registered butchers firms fell by 540 to 13,641 in the year ending April
1991. Thirty years ago there were more than 33,000 butchers shops on
Britain's high streets.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Gas challenge date advanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to introduce more competition into the gas market earlier
than expected, it announced yesterday.
Mr Tim Eggar, minister for energy, indicated that he would consider opening
the household gas market to rival suppliers in May next year  - three years
sooner than expected. The government had previously said that domestic
consumers would be offered a choice of supplier after 1996.
Mr Eggar's comments followed the first meeting he has had with Mr Robert
Evans, the chairman of British Gas, since taking up his appointment after
the election. The meeting came after a fierce exchange on Wednesday between
the company and Sir James McKinnon, the industry regulator, when Sir James
threatened British Gas with legal action if it failed to cut its domestic
prices immediately.
Mr Eggar told Mr Evans he was surprised at the way in which British Gas had
reacted and over its reluctance to cut household gas prices. He emphasised
nevertheless that the issue should be decided between the regulator and the
company.
Mr Eggar said he would ask parliament to open up a greater segment of the
industrial gas market for competitors to British Gas next month. That would
allow 200,000 smaller commercial and industrial customers to negotiate gas
supplies with competitors to British Gas in time for the new contract year,
which begins in October.
Mr Eggar's first step will be to lower the threshold for gas consumption
under which rival suppliers will be allowed into the market. At present,
customers must use 25,000 therms of gas a year before being allowed to
choose a supplier. That will be reduced to 2,500 therms this year and
possibly further next year.

<TEXT>
AN ABSTRACT painting by Cy Twombly, 'Untitled', loosely inspired by Leonardo
da Vinci, sold for Dollars 1.65m (Pounds 917,839) at Sotheby's auction of
contemporary art in New York on Wednesday. It was sent for sale by Charles
Saatchi. Although it went for below its estimate, the fact that it found a
buyer  - the New York dealer Larry Gagosian  - will help to restore
confidence in what has been one of the weakest sectors of the art market.
The auction totalled Dollars 12.32m with 24 per cent unsold. Charles Saatchi
is selling many important pictures from his collection to release money to
make purchases of younger artists, and most of the works he consigned to
Sotheby's found buyers.
They included 'Vermeer, Portrait Of The Artist In His Studio', a pastiche of
an Old Master by the British artist Malcolm Morley, which sold for Dollars
627,000, an auction record for Morley. 'Bob's World', a 'plate' painting by
the controversial Julian Schnabel, sold within forecast at Dollars 319,000.
However, one important Saatchi picture, 'Night Interior' by Lucian Freud,
failed to get anywhere near its Dollars 500,000 estimate.
Other successes in the auction were Dollars 632,000 paid for a diptych by
Brice Marden entitled 'The Dylan Karina Painting' and Dollars 577,000 for
Andy Warhol's 'Most wanted man: No 11'.
Christie's in south Kensington held a sale of rock memorabilia. The main
lot, a rare video of Jimi Hendrix in concert, was unsold at Pounds 15,000,
less than half its estimate, probably because of concerns about copyright;
but Hard Rock International bought one of Hendrix's black felt hats for
Pounds 4,950.
A stage outfit worn by Prince on his Purple Rain tour sold for Pounds 9,020
and the instruments used by the band in the film The Commitments went for
Pounds 3,300.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EVIL-looking hook is dangling from a piece of frayed rope. The
contraption is supporting a plastic dustbin full of building materials which
is being hauled by workmen up and down the outside of a three-storey
building in north London.
A short distance down the road, Mr Tim Small, Her Majesty's Inspector of
Factories, is observing the scene from his car. 'This is a fairly typical
set-up,' he says. 'It's cheaper to use old dustbins but they're not designed
to be loaded like that. The work is close to the pavement - if the dustbin
gives way, a member of the public could be seriously injured. We'd better
take a look.'
The work in progress is a re-roofing job, involving the addition of an extra
storey to the building. Such work is among the most dangerous: one in five
of all deaths in construction occurs during roof work. About three workers a
month are killed falling off roofs and numerous passers-by are hit,
sometimes fatally, by falling materials. Those figures are for the UK alone.
Europe-wide, construction provides just 8 per cent of total employment but
accounts for 16 per cent of serious accidents. Fatal accidents in
construction occur at three to five times the rate of industry generally.
EC directives aimed at tightening up site safety are on the way and this
year has been declared the year of safety, hygiene and health protection at
work by the European Commission. As part of the initiative, the Health and
Safety Executive is 'blitzing' building sites involving roof work in an
inspection campaign across the country. The campaign will not mean any more
inspectors on the streets, but Mr Small and his colleagues will be
concentrating their efforts on roofs during the next four months, the
busiest period in the roof work industry.
Outside the north London building, closer examination of the hook supporting
the dustbin shows it to be an improvised job, fashioned out of a bent
reinforcing rod. 'We'll have to put a stop to them using that straight
away,' says Mr Small, leaping up a couple of ladders and some scaffolding in
search of the workmen.
At the top of the building he looks down for evidence of 'bombing'  - debris
thrown into the garden. This practice is strictly verboten, says Mr Small,
except on sealed-off demolition sites. Thankfully, no bombing seems to have
taken place.
Back at ground level, a labourer grumbles that it is not his day: 'First the
van's wheelclamped, now you lot. I've never even seen a factory inspector
before.' Yes, they would have preferred to have used a proper chute instead
of the dustbin, but the boss didn't want to spend the money and they were
cutting corners all round on this job. No, they didn't have any hard hats
but, as it happened, the boss would be around with some later.
The boss arrives (no hard hats) to find out what is going on. Mr Small
delivers a lecture on the dangers of improvised hoisting gear. He is told of
a fatal case involving a falling bucket of boiling bitumen and a member of
the public. A legal notice is served forbidding the further use of the
dustbin-and-hook arrangement. The boss's attention is caught by the phrase
'fine of up to Pounds 20,000' if the legal notice is ignored.
Mr Small promises to send a safety information pack. 'I don't expect he'll
read it, but if there's an accident in future at least it'll be on file that
he's had it. If there's a prosecution, we could bring that to the court's
attention.'
It is the sixth time in the week that he has served a legal notice at a
construction site. He says it is good to keep the batting average up  -
everyone is impressed if you can point to an increased number of notices
served and more prosecutions than in the previous year. But he has
reservations about the time consumed in bringing cases to court and the
paltry fines that often follow.
'It's not always the best use of time,' he says. 'There might be a Pounds
150 fine for not wearing a hard hat and the magistrate asks why you're
picking on the guy. When you're in the office preparing paperwork for a
case, you're not out there where you should be, stopping the things that are
dangerous.'

FT  08 MAY 92 / Heseltine order on drugs deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AAH HOLDINGS, the UK pharmaceuticals wholesaler, is to be asked to divest
part of its acquisition of the UK business of Medicopharma NV, the Dutch
pharmaceuticals wholesaler, on the ground that competition has been stifled.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday instructed Sir
Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, to seek appropriate
divestment undertakings from AAH after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report that concluded that the merger was likely to operate against the
public interest.
The commission found that the acquisition made by AAH in November last year
led to a reduction in competition in the Grampian and Highland regions of
Scotland that was significantly greater than would have occurred if
Medicopharma's UK subsidiaries had been placed in receivership.
The commission did not consider that competition would be significantly
affected at national level or in areas served by the other two depots of
Medicopharma UK acquired by AAH  - at Weedon, Northamptonshire, and Romford,
Essex  - or in the supply to hospitals, where AAH is by far the largest
wholesaler.
The commission recommended that AAH should be required to divest a business
approximating as closely as possible to the business carried on by
Medicopharma UK from its Aberdeen depot immediately before the acquisition.
AAH and UniChem are the two largest UK wholesalers of pharmaceutical
products, accounting for slightly more than 60 per cent of sales in 1990.
AAH had 30 per cent of the market, valued at Pounds 2.84bn. Medicopharma UK
was the third-largest wholesaler in 1990, accounting for 8 per cent of the
market.
AAH accounted for more than 70 per cent of sales of ethical drugs to
hospitals by wholesalers in 1990 and about 33 per cent of total sales to
hospitals, including direct sales. Medicopharma UK accounted for about 3 per
cent of sales of ethicals to hospitals in 1990.
Medicopharma entered the UK wholesale market in 1990 through the acquisition
of two existing wholesalers, Butler, and the wholesale business of Macarthy.
AAH said yesterday it was disappointed that the acquisition had been
referred to the MMC but welcomed the commission's finding that there was no
material effect on competition at a national level or in most of the UK.
Mr Andrew Wallis, finance director, said the inquiry had delayed the
integration of the Romford and Weedon warehouses into AAH's distribution
network, but that could now proceed.
AAH foresaw no difficulty in complying with the commission's recommendation
in respect of the Aberdeen warehouse, Mr Wallis added.
Mr Heseltine is making an order under the 1973 Fair Trading Act as a
protective measure to guard against AAH's taking any action intended to
frustrate the divestment.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Campaign for safer roof work launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEALTH and Safety Executive warned the construction industry yesterday
that it was mounting a safety drive on construction involving roof work,
Diane Summers writes.
Inspectors will order building sites to halt work and will take legal action
in serious cases where safety rules are being breached, the HSE said.
Dr Paul Davis, head of the HSE's construction group, said at the launch of
its campaign: 'Cowboy roofers, like their namesakes . . . often die young.'
Almost every roof work death could be prevented by simple precautions and
the use of proper equipment.
Roofers' deaths in building accidents make them the largest single
occupational group for fatalities. Construction itself is the most dangerous
of all industry sectors. Most roof work is done by about 7,000 contractors
who provide work for 30,000 roofers. The sector is difficult to regulate
because three quarters of the workers are self-employed and working for
companies of three people or fewer.

<TEXT>
LONDON Underground may suffer industrial action after a vote in favour of a
strike by members of RMT, the transport union.
The threatened action is over the loss of 5,000 jobs from the the 21,000
workforce. Changes in grading structures and working practices are also
planned. London Underground said that the job losses will be phased over
three years and there will be no compulsory redundancies.
No date will be set for the action until the union has had a response from
management, RMT said yesterday. One-day stoppages are more likely than an
indefinite strike. The 11,000 RMT members at London Underground voted two to
one in favour of a strike in a 65 per cent ballot turnout.
London Underground said its message for the union was to 'stop posturing and
start negotiating'. The restructuring would go ahead regardless, it added.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Surplus cash: whose money is it anyway?: Norma Cohen looks
at the vexed issue of excess investment assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a pension fund has more money than it needs to pay benefits to members,
just whose money is it? Is a surplus the property of pensioners, employees,
former employees or the employer?
Until now, the courts have taken the view that the owner of a pension fund's
deficit also owns its surplus. Because employers have a nominal obligation
to make good shortfalls, there have been no legal barriers to their use of
surpluses for their own benefit.
But in the aftermath of the Maxwell pension-fund scandal, in which more than
Pounds 400m went missing from funds controlled by Robert Maxwell, that view
looks increasingly unfair, or indeed, less sensible.
The 100 Group of Finance Directors, representing Britain's largest
companies, has just completed a review of pension issues, thus providing the
first glimpse of the industry's response to some of the proposals to reform
pensions law. Not surprisingly, the group opposes any attempt to yield
pension-fund surpluses to members, saying that attempts to do so will only
encourage employers to cut contributions and margins of cover available to
meet pension liabilities.
According to Caps, the pension-fund performance measurement service, more
than two thirds of companies were taking pensions holidays last year  -
enjoying the use of surpluses built up in prior years and making no
contributions towards their workers' retirement. The pensions fund industry
had a net cash outflow of Pounds 2.5bn because investment income, rather
than company contributions, was used to cover payments to beneficiaries last
year.
Two recent events have raised the temperature of the debate over who owns a
pension fund's surplus. The first was a ruling by the European Court in May
1990 that, in establishing the need to set equal retirement ages for men and
women, said that a pension was in effect deferred pay  - and by extension,
the property of employees.
The second was the Maxwell saga itself. In the course of hearings conducted
by the Commons social security committee, it emerged that Robert Maxwell was
legally able to strip out millions of pounds of pension-fund surplus from
companies he acquired  - more in fact, than he paid to acquire them,
according to evidence.
The committee called for a royal commission to study the subject as part of
a wider review of pensions law. Mr Frank Field, the committee's Labour
chairman, said: 'My own view is that pensions are deferred pay. But that
then raises serious questions about how they should be taxed.' Pension
contributions of companies and workers are exempt from taxation, as are the
income and capital gains of pension fund investments.
Pensions industry professionals remain sceptical of industry threats to
suspend or reduce benefits to workers if companies are forbidden to use
surpluses themselves. Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at Noble Lowndes,
an actuarial and pension fund consultancy, dismisses such threats as
'propaganda'.
Mr Jenkinson believes there is little political support for allowing either
employers or employees to secure the benefit solely for their own purposes.
There is general agreement that surpluses should be shared, he said.
Employers have argued their right to secure the surplus for their exclusive
use on grounds that the surplus arose because they had contributed too
generously in early years. Actuaries take issue with that, pointing out that
surpluses arise for several reasons, including better-than-expected
investment returns or failure to grant departing workers their fair share of
pension assets. Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions manager at Scottish Equitable,
says: 'For many schemes, surpluses have arisen because the scheme has not
kept pace with inflation. They have been relatively stingy with benefits
while investment returns have soared.'
Employers also argue that because they have ultimate obligation to make good
a scheme's shortfall, they should also own the surplus. That view, too, is
disputed. The Institute for Public Policy Studies, the leftwing think tank,
has argued that employers can too easily evade their obligation to make up a
shortfall by simply winding up a scheme.
Mr Jenkinson says that has happened in relatively few cases. However, the
plight of more than 4,000 Maxwell retired employees whose pensions
disappeared overnight has heightened public concern about the strength of
employers' promises to make good shortfalls.
THE COURTS and politicians are increasingly challenging companies' rights to
appropriate pension-fund surpluses for their own benefit, a leading pensions
lawyer said yesterday.
Mr John Cunliffe, a partner at McKenna and Company, called for clearer laws
to end ambiguities over the ownership of surpluses at the conference. He
said that until the question of surplus ownership was settled it would be
impossible to draft legislation to safeguard pension-fund assets.
Mr Cunliffe said politicians appeared increasingly to hold the view that
pension-fund surpluses belonged to members, not the company. The courts, he
said, had recently ruled that while members had no right to participate
directly in a surplus, they had the right to be considered in relation to
its use. 'All this comes pretty near to saying that surplus belongs to
members,' he said.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Funds told to be tougher against fraud: Call from Bank to
pensions industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION FUNDS must take a more active stand to prevent further Maxwell-style
frauds, a Bank of England official told the annual conference of the
National Association of Pension Funds in Glasgow.
Mr Pen Kent, Bank of England director for finance and industry, said the
association's members 'are not standing up to be counted'. Shareholders too
often failed to exercise their right to vote and bore some responsibility
for failing to insist on proper curbs on Robert Maxwell.
Shareholders had not contributed enough to the debate over what companies
should disclose in their corporate accounts, he added. 'We need to hear more
from users of accounts about what is currently provided.'
Mr Kent said that although there is 'no such thing as a risk-free society',
there is a need to tighten regulation of the investment industry.
Mr Brian McMahon, association chairman, outlined its support for pension
reform. 'The days are gone, indeed if they ever existed, when this
association could say that everything is fine, nothing wrong with the way we
run our schemes, and especially nothing wrong with the way I run mine,' Mr
McMahon said. 'Maxwell has cast a giant shadow over us.'
The association is studying a compensation arrangement for pension scheme
members similar to that available to private investors. Other reforms backed
by the association include requiring boards of trustees to offer equal
representation to employers and members. The association also says pension
schemes should be required to pay for trustees to obtain training.

<TEXT>
BRITTANY Ferries, the French cross-Channel ferry operator, has taken
possession of the largest vessel yet to ply between the UK and France - the
Normandie, weighing in at 27,000 gross tonnes (above), Richard Tomkins
writes.
The Pounds 80m vessel, which will make its maiden voyage on the
Portsmouth-Caen route on May 18, can carry a total of 2,200 passengers and
630 cars.
Built by the Kvaerner Masa shipbuilding company at its Turku yard in
Finland, the ferry incorporates restaurants, bars, a children's playroom,
two cinemas and a fully equipped hospital.
The vessel forms part of a Pounds 350m investment programme being undertaken
by Brittany Ferries on its fast-growing western Channel routes, which are
less vulnerable to the threat of the Channel tunnel than the shorter routes
to the east.
Last month the company took possession of the 20,500 grt Barfleur, which has
just gone into service between Poole and Cherbourg.
This will shortly be followed by the introduction of the 31,400 grt Nils
Holgersson  - one of the world's 20 largest ferries  - to the routes between
Plymouth and Roscoff in Brittany and Plymouth to Santander in Spain.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Societies pressed on rescue pledges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES were told yesterday that the government expects them to
keep pledges made before Christmas to rescue mortgage customers facing
possible eviction.
Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary to the Treasury, congratulated the
Building Societies Association at its annual conference in Bournemouth for
achieving a reduction in the likely number of mortgage evictions.
'We look to you, the lenders, to identify workable solutions to the problems
which have emerged with these schemes, so that you will be able to deliver
the commitments you made last December,' Mr Nelson said.
Later Sir George Young, the housing minister, said mortgage-rescue measures
should be a permanent fixture of the industry. First-time buyers considering
a mortgage should be able to feel they would not be left 'stranded' if the
economy and housing market moved against them.
After talks with the government, the societies pledged more than Pounds 800m
for mortgage-rescue schemes, intended to save at least 16,000 borrowers from
eviction.
Nearly six months later only a handful of borrowers have been saved directly
by the schemes, although most societies have achieved a dramatic reduction
in the number of evictions by improved debt counselling and similar
services.
Mr John Wriglesworth, a housing finance specialist at securities house UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'I estimate that these techniques may be successful
in cutting repossessions from 280,000 to around 80,000 this year.'
Abbey National, Britain's second-largest mortgage lender, yesterday cut
mortgage interest rates immediately for new borrowers and from July 1 for
existing customers.
Rates on mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 go down from 10.9 per cent to 10.7
per cent; Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 loans from 10.55 per cent to 10.2
per cent; and mortgages above that from 10.4 per cent to 9.99 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to abolish the statutory audit requirement for small companies should
be strongly resisted, the outgoing president of the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants said yesterday.
Mr Ken Anderson attacked both the idea and its supporters at the
association's annual meeting in London.
The Department of Trade and Industry is considering abolishing the mandatory
audit requirement for very small companies. Under the proposals,
requirements could be eased for all companies below the Pounds 36,600 value
added tax threshold.
Mr Anderson accused the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales  - which has supported the idea  - of 'orchestrating' a campaign for
abolition. 'In the current climate, with the audit side of the profession
under such focus . . . it is surely not the time to seek to reduce the role
of the audit,' he said.
He argued that limited liability status imposed responsibilities on
companies.

FT  08 MAY 92 / MPs to meet SIB chief over Lloyd's inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF London will come under political pressure again next week when a
party of MPs visits Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board, to discuss his inquiry into alleged malpractices.
The authorities at the insurance market faced intense scrutiny earlier this
year when MPs said Names working in the market were benefiting at the
expense of Names outside. Names are the individuals whose assets support
underwriting.
The MPs will seek assurances that Sir David is gaining access to all the
information he needs for his inquiries. The party is expected to include Mr
Paul Marland, the Conservative MP for Gloucestershire West, who is also a
Lloyd's Name.
The credibility of the inquiry is critical to Lloyd's as it seeks to rebuild
confidence in the face of its difficulties. Losses in 1989 are expected to
amount to more than Pounds 1.35bn, with some recent estimates putting the
figure as high as Pounds 2bn.
At the time of Sir David's appointment in February, Mr David Coleridge,
chairman of Lloyd's, commented: 'I needed a man who was so white that
snow-white looked dirty.'
Mr Marland is also expected to be at the forefront of calls for a fully
fledged Commons debate on Lloyd's. He is understood to have written to Mr
Neil Hamilton, a junior trade and industry minister, to request a meeting
with him and other interested parties.
In a separate development, Lloyd's has received a legal opinion from Mr
Jonathan Sumption QC that it can admit corporate members without any
alteration of the Lloyd's Act, which provides for the market's
self-regulation.
The opinion potentially clears the way for more rapid implementation of the
proposals made by the Rowland report in January to bring corporate capital
to the market.
It had been assumed that changes in the act would be needed. However,
Lloyd's will still need to talk to various regulatory bodies, including the
US Securities and Exchange Commission, about the reforms.
Potential investors may be encouraged by the findings of Mr Chris Hitchings,
an insurance analyst with Hoare Govett, the securities house.
Lloyd's has consistently outperformed both UK composite insurers and US
insurers in terms of both its profit margins and the strength of its
solvency margins, says Mr Hitchings in a report that analyses financial data
from Lloyd's and the UK and US insurance industries on a like-for-like
basis.
Between 1950 and 1989, Lloyd's reported average annual profits (as a
percentage of net written premiums) of 6 per cent, compared with 3.9 per
cent for UK companies and 2.9 per cent for US insurers.
Lloyd's losses for 1989  - which the market reports next month  - are likely
to be much worse than those experienced by the UK companies, partly because
of its heavy exposure to natural catastrophes.
However, had UK companies accounted on the same basis as Lloyd's, their
results for 1989 would have been worse, says Mr Hitchings in his report.
Many of the companies' 1990 and 1991 losses occurred because of the need to
make provisions for claims made on policies underwritten in earlier years.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Acas reports slow growth in derecognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERECOGNITION of unions, especially for supervisory, technical and
professional jobs, is being considered by a 'slowly growing number of
employers', according to the annual report of Acas, the conciliation
service.
Nevertheless, the report also points to a greater readiness on the part of
individuals and unions to use the law against employers by taking unfair
dismissal and discrimination cases to industrial tribunals.
Acas, which has a statutory duty to conciliate between employee and employer
before a case goes to a tribunal, saw a large increase in its workload in
individual and collective cases last year. In the first quarter of this
year, individual conciliation cases have increased by 40 per cent over the
same period last year.
Of the 60,605 individual conciliation cases last year, a 16 per cent rise
over 1990, only 32 per cent went to tribunals.
Sex discrimination cases rose by 119 per cent to 3,500. That was because of
a wave of cases influenced by the European Court's Barber judgment, which
extended the definition of equal pay to include pensions.
Sir Douglas Smith, Acas chairman, also pointed to cultural changes that had
led to a greater readiness by women to go to court. Unions, too, had changed
their attitudes and 'are much more ready to ensure that members are aware of
their statutory rights'.
Although that is a sign of unions having less leverage through collective
bargaining on matters such as election for redundancy, Sir Douglas said he
did not believe unions were terminally weakened. He said national union
leaders were more pragmatic than they used to be, but union strength often
remained considerable at local level.
Sir Douglas said he did not believe that employers wanted to scrap the
Bridlington rules, through which the Trades Union Congress regulates
disputes between unions.
He also expects much more work involving the public sector  - hitherto four
fifths of Acas's work has been in the private sector  - as new, more
devolved industrial relations are introduced into many public services.
The Acas report said it had already intervened in National Health Service
trusts where 'there often remains a lack of expertise and experience (in
industrial relations) among local managers and trade union reps alike'.
The report also warns public-sector managers not to embrace uncritically
performance-related pay at a time when the private sector's experience is
becoming 'more mixed' and some employers are re-examining the advantages and
disadvantages.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Settlement hope in council swaps case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SETTLEMENT of Chemical Bank's Pounds 2.94m claim against the Hammersmith and
Fulham council in London  - part of the interest rate swaps litigation  -
appeared to be imminent last night.
It will be the fifth of the six lead cases to have been resolved without the
High Court having an opportunity to give guidance for the remaining disputes
between banks and local authorities.
The litigation stems from the House of Lords ruling in January last year
that all swaps deals entered into by local authorities were void because
they were outside councils' legal powers.
Chemical Bank's case was opened on Wednesday. Its lawyers returned to court
yesterday but went away without the hearing being resumed.
Their places in court were taken by the lawyers for NationsBank of North
Carolina  - formerly NCNB National Bank of North Carolina  - which is suing
Hammersmith for Pounds 306,000, plus interest and costs, in the last lead
case.
Mr Robert Englehart QC, for NationsBank, told Mr Justice Hirst that,
although a large US bank, it had been 'a veritable minnow' as far as the UK
swaps market had been concerned.
Its only swaps deals with local authorities had been two interest rate
'caps' transactions with Hammersmith, in which it had been intermediary
between the council and Midland Bank and Salomon Brothers International.
Mr Englehart explained that a 'cap' buyer paid a lump sum premium to the
seller. In return, the seller agreed to make payments to the buyer if a
variable interest rate such as Libor exceeded the fixed rate in the
contract.
It had been 'a most unfortunate dabbling' in the local-authority swaps
market for NationsBank. It had received no payments from Hammersmith but had
to honour back-to-back transactions in which it had sold the 'caps' to
Midland and Salomon Brothers.
The result had been that NationsBank had lost more than Pounds 1.75m instead
of making an Pounds 81,000 profit.
The hearing will continue on Tuesday.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Regalian proposes sale by tender
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE depressed London property investment market has prompted Regalian, a
property developer, to adopt the unusual tactic of selling an office block
by tender.
It hopes to choose four potential buyers to bid for Red Lion Court, an
office building in Southwark near the City of London. The 128,500 sq ft
building, which is let to Lloyds Bank, has a reserve price of Pounds 45m. In
1989 Regalian tried to sell the property for Pounds 65m.
The reserve price of Pounds 45m would give a net yield of 9.3 per cent,
slightly higher than that on long-dated gilts.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Mercury increases pay bill by 5.7%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Communications has increased its salary bill by 5.7 per cent,
putting pay rises at the telecommunications group at the top end of current
awards, Hugo Dixon and David Goodhart write.
Mercury, BT's main rival in the telecommunications market, has also improved
benefits, including paternity leave and a helpline for staff.
Individual rises will vary because Mercury operates a performance-related
pay scheme. The scheme takes account of market rates and the company's
financial position as well as the performance of individual employees.
Mercury, which does not recognise unions, prides itself on being at the
forefront of industry in setting pay and conditions.
The National Communications Union, the main BT union, claims that the
generosity of the deal is in part a response to its present recruiting
efforts.
Mr Alan Harley, NCU national organiser, said Mercury responded 'in a
friendly manner' before the general election. But since then 'it has stopped
replying to our letters'.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Theory on workforces is challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 10 per cent of employers view their workforce as composed of a core of
highly skilled, permanently employed workers and a periphery of less
skilled, less secure ones, according to a Department of Employment survey.
Such a view of workforces  - known as the 'core-periphery' model  - has been
popular with labour market theorists since the early 1980s. But the survey,
published in the government's Employment Gazette, suggests that far fewer
employers hold that perception of their workforces than had been thought.
The survey found only a third of employers guided by any strategic thinking
in their deployment of non-standard or peripheral labour.
Direct costs were not significant in distinguishing between full-time and
other forms of labour. The hourly rates for full-timers, part-timers and
temporary workers doing similar jobs were the same for nearly 90 per cent of
employees.
Coverage of the most important non-pay benefits  - sick pay and pensions  -
was, however, significantly lower for part-timers compared with full-timers,
and for temporary workers relative to part-timers.
Working days lost through strikes last year, at 800,000, were the fewest
since records began 100 years ago, according to another Employment Gazette
study. There were 369 stoppages last year, compared with 630 in 1990. An
initiative to train disabled people in information technology so that they
can find employment by working from home was launched yesterday by Leeds
Training and Enterprise Council.
Housebound trainees will learn computer literacy, spreadsheet modelling,
word processing, desktop publishing and databases during a six-month course.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Pigging out at the Cafe Royal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cafe Royal in London became a pig pen yesterday. It was the venue for
the National Pig Development Company to show off its new Anglo-Chinese
hybrid, the Manor Meishan.
Lord Plumb, Conservative MEP for The Cotswolds and former president of the
National Farmers' Union, described the hybrid as a 'quantum leap in pig
breeding'. It combines the astonishing reproductive performance of the
Meishan  - each sow has 16 piglets a litter and produces two or three
litters a year  - with the lean meat characteristic of the British Large
White and Landrace breeds.
China sold 32 of its fat, wrinkly Meishan pigs in 1987 to a consortium of
British pig breeding companies for use in a research programme co-ordinated
by the Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research in Edinburgh.
The Manor Meishan is the first commercial result. It looks smooth and sleek,
without the heavy folds of skin characteristic of its Chinese ancestors.
Like them, it has 16 teats  - and sometimes even 18  - to accommodate its
large litters (a typical European pig has 12).
National Pig Development, a private company based at Driffield, Humberside,
will supply Manor Meishans 'exclusively to the UK market for the foreseeable
future'. The company expects to deliver 2,000 pigs in the next year.
Lord Plumb welcomed the 'cost-cutting' hybrid as a development that would
help British farmers compete.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Protesters give Bush hostile reception in battered Los
Angeles
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANY Los Angeles residents gave President George Bush a hostile reception
yesterday as he saw for himself the destruction wrought by riots last week.
Walking through black, Hispanic and Korean areas of the city's downtown
area, Mr Bush expressed his 'horror and dismay' at the results of the
'wanton lawlessness'.
But the president also said he wanted to tackle the roots of the urban and
social problems that had provided fuel for the rioting, which was triggered
by the acquittal on charges of assault of four policemen who were videotaped
savagely beating a motorist, Mr Rodney King.
'There must be no return to the status quo,' Mr Bush said as he arrived in
the city late on Wednesday night. 'You have to get at the cause. You've got
to do that,' he added yesterday.
However, the president faced protests from those Angelenos who felt he
should have come sooner to visit their battered city, as well as from those
who felt that, by coming now, he was merely placing an unnecessary extra
burden on the police and soldiers who are keeping the peace.
He also met protests from the Korean-American community, which was in many
instances singled out last week as the target of violence.
Korean-American shopkeepers gathered outside Mr Bush's hotel, chanting: 'We
want justice.' Banners proclaimed: 'We need money now' and 'Mr President  -
if you won't help, Clinton will.'
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive Democratic presidential
candidate, who had visited the riot-torn areas of Los Angeles on Monday, has
criticised Mr Bush for blaming the problems of the inner cities on the Great
Society welfare programmes introduced by President Lyndon Johnson in the
1960s. He has been cautious in his criticism of Mr Bush's response to the
crisis in Los Angeles, however.
Other demonstrators yesterday protested at the response of the police to the
outbreak of violence last week.
Mr Daryl Gates, the controversial chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department, has come under renewed attack for having been inadequately
prepared for an outbreak of unrest in response to the acquittal of his four
officers.
The department has been accused of having pulled its officers out of the
area where violence first broke out, thus giving a green light to rioters.
Many shopkeepers have also complained that police did not answer their calls
for help and stood by as their stores were pillaged.
Mr Gates has agreed under pressure to retire in June, after 14 years in his
job, but local politicians yesterday called for him to leave immediately.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Climate treaty sets no emission limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE UN, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DRAFT treaty on climatic change, to be signed by world leaders next month,
would commit rich countries to fight global warming by restricting
greenhouse-gas pollution, but would stop well short of setting limits,
Reuter reports from the United Nations in New York.
According to a new text of the treaty, circulated yesterday, developed
countries would agree to limit emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide and
to protect 'sinks', such as forests, that absorb such emissions.
The text, or a slightly amended version of it, was expected to be handed to
UN negotiators today for approval by tomorrow. The treaty is to be a
centrepiece of the UN's Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro next month.
By way of victory for the US, which has opposed the requirement of specific
emission targets, the draft treaty contains only loose goals. One section
recognises that reduction of emissions 'to earlier levels' by the end of the
decade would contribute to fighting climatic change; another says countries
should aim to return emissions to 1990 levels.
Critics charged the draft could allow signatories to comply whatever they
did. Mr Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the UN
negotiations had produced 'a toothless global warming treaty, totally
inadequate to the threat posed by the continued build-up of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere.'
The language of the text was vaguer than an earlier European Community
proposal to require stabilisation of carbon-dioxide emissions at 1990 levels
by 2000, and was a far cry from the sharp cuts environmental activists say
are necessary.

THE BRAZILIAN government admitted yesterday it had failed to meet at least
one of the five targets for the first quarter of its programme with the
International Monetary Fund, and so would not request the second tranche of
IMF funding due this month, reports Christina Lamb in Sao Paulo.
Rather than ask for a waiver of the IMF conditions, so as to enable it to
receive the Dollars 250m payment, Brazil has asked the fund for a rephasing
of their agreement signed in January.
The country's progress is now to be reassessed in August. Brazil's economic
team believes targets will have been met by then.

A MILITANT environmental group, the Rainbow Warriors, has claimed it is
holding Mr Sidney Reso, head of Exxon's international division, according to
a New York press report yesterday.
There was no official confirmation of the report but US law enforcement
officers are investigating claims that a series of ransom messages has been
received about Mr Reso, who disappeared on the morning of April 29 while
going to work in New Jersey. His car was found at the end of his driveway,
with the engine running and the door ajar.
Mr Michael Murphy, the New Jersey prosecutor working with the FBI on the
case, last night said it would be 'inappropriate' to discuss the report of
an unverified communication from alleged kidnappers. He said that, without a
photograph or voice recording, he could not conclude that Mr Reso was held
by any group.
A spokesman for Exxon, said it had 'no new information.'
The company is seen as a prime enemy of militant environmentalists, who
accuse the company of arrogance over the oil spill disaster caused by the
Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska in 1989.
Rainbow Warrior was a protest ship owned by the Greenpeace environmental
group. It was sunk by French secret service saboteurs in 1985.

THE Global Environmental Facility, the fund administered by the UN and the
World Bank to help developing countries protect the environment, is to be
restructured so as to give it a wider role, writes David Lascelles,
Resources Editor.
The facility, set up as a three-year experiment in 1990, is to be given a
more enduring status, after decisions at the World Bank meeting in
Washington last week.
It is to be altered in two main ways. Governance of the GEF is to be made
more democratic by opening it to universal membership.
At present, its policies are dominated by the wealthy countries which
provide most of the money, and by its World Bank administrators.
A new Participants' Assembly would be created.
The facility will also be offered as a channel to fund projects under two
conventions being negotiated for the Earth Summit next month in Rio de
Janeiro.

FT  08 MAY 92 / A fragile peace turns to dust on Beirut's blasted streets:
Hopes of a new beginning are evaporating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR was supposed to be over; the barriers were bulldozed by the Lebanese
army last summer. Peace was supposed to mean freedom of passage  - an end to
barricades of burning cars and tyres. The Lebanese thought they had
exorcised the bad memories of 1975, when the civil war started with riots
similar to those that wracked the country this week.
How quickly Lebanon's impoverished peace reverted to anarchy; how unnerving
to see pistol-toting militiamen striding purposefully down Hamra Street
again, among the small boys wielding sticks festooned with devalued Lebanese
pound notes. They delighted in the sound of shattering windows, in the
shouted obscenities against the government.
When the riots which toppled Prime Minister Omar Karami's government were
over, only the glass merchants would benefit from the orgy of breakage.
There hadn't been such demand for new window panes since the artillery
bombardments of 1990.
Was it premature then, the refurbishing of shops and restaurants? Had
Beirutis been too quickly seduced by an elusive peace? In the Unesco
quarter, just 100 metres from the home of the speaker of parliament, the
elegant, newly-erected facade of the Bank of Kuwait and the Arab World was
devastated. Chunks of white marble, chipped off by the rioters' crowbars,
lay in the street, alongside felled pink granite columns.
The Middle East insurance executives who convened in Beirut this week will
not forget their lunch at the seafront, marred by a crowd throwing empty
bottles. 'Why should you eat when we have no food?' the people shouted. And
 -shades of Marie-Antoinette - President Elias Hrawi is sure to remember the
housewives and children who marched to his home in Zahle in the Bekaa Valley
crying, 'Give us bread, we are hungry.'
Until this week, it was easy to forget those dispossessed by peace, the
ragged thousands who took to the streets to the cheers of their better-off
compatriots. Since the beginning of May, the street lamps were lit on the
Mediterranean Corniche for the first time in nine years.
On balmy evenings, families walked along the promenade, buying coffee from
the sidewalk vendors while Arabic music blared from pushcarts offering
audio-cassettes, the sesame-studded bread known as ka'ak, peanuts, sunflower
seeds and pistachios. There was a profusion of florists and stalls offering
exotic fruit.
Smith's grocery store had revamped its facade with bright red awnings. For a
price that few Lebanese could afford, there was duck liver pate, imported
crab meat and champagne. In Hamra Street, the shopowners who yesterday
assessed the damage had stocked the latest 'roulette' five-disc CD players,
French designer clothes and copies of the same clothes from Turkey.
But housewives bemoaned the price of tomatoes; from LPounds 600 per kilo in
January to LPounds 2,000 this week. And Filipino maids were hard hit by
government corruption.
As the rioters began burning tyres on Tuesday night, the most wealthy member
of an old Beirut Moslem family told his dinner guests that he had been
offered Dollars 55m for his 19th century mansion and grounds, but wouldn't
consider selling. The owners of a grand Ottoman house on the heights above
Raouche were asking Dollars 12m  - but of course the house would be torn
down to make way for a high-rise building immediately after the sale.
Like many of their fellow Lebanese, the dinner guests betrayed their
nostalgia for the exiled Lebanese General Michel Aoun. 'There has never been
any problem between the Lebanese  - Moslems and Christians want to live
together, if only the foreigners would leave us alone,' went the old,
unconvincing refrain.
The Syrians have launched a timid public relations campaign, prompting their
clients in the Shia Moslem Amal militia to cover walls with posters showing
clean-cut, smiling Syrian soldiers handing out toys to Lebanese children.
'The sons of (Syrian President Hafez) Al-Assad are here to protect the
future of Lebanon,' the posters proclaim.
But the Syrian soldiers melted away before the mobs who swarmed through
Beirut on Wednesday. Former Prime Minister Karami's government said it
wanted them to stay in Beirut beyond the September 1992 deadline set by the
Taif peace accords.
No one knows what the next government will say. No one knows whether the
first parliamentary elections in 20 years will take place this summer.
Once again, the Lebanese are mustering their famed skills of survival. The
economic crisis has denied them simple pleasures that even the war never
touched. Yet again, the promise of a new beginning lies in streets strewn
with broken glass and burning rubbish.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Chamlong Srimuang, the opposition politician on the fourth day of a
hunger strike to demand the resignation of Thailand's unelected premier, is
a moralistic former general dubbed 'Mr Clean' by his supporters, Reuter
reports from Bangkok.
His uncompromising piety and idealism have made him hugely popular among
Bangkok citizens grown tired of rampant corruption and influence-peddling in
high office.
They voted for his Palang Dharma or 'Moral Force' party in droves during the
March 22 general elections and it swept 32 of the 35 seats contested in the
city. Gen Chamlong's vow to fast to the death unless Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon
resigns the premiership brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets
in support of his protest.
A devout Buddhist, Gen Chamlong won his spurs politically in two terms as
Bangkok's governor where his efforts to fight corruption, clean up the
city's streets and free them from annual floods won him a strong support
base.
He spurns the expensive suits, flashy cars and gold watches favoured by many
other politicians. He wears the simple denim garb of a peasant and sandals
cut from old tyres. His image as a politician untainted by corruption
contrasts strongly with that of the new Thai cabinet, which includes
ministers Gen Suchinda himself accused of corruption after staging a coup
against the last elected prime minister in February 1991.
Gen Chamlong has survived attacks by rivals who criticised him for failing
to solve Bangkok's worsening traffic and air pollution problems and who
tried to discredit him for associating with a renegade Buddhist sect deemed
heretical by the religion's mainstream authorities.
In a city known for its massive sex industry, Gen Chamlong abstains from
sexual contact with his wife. He wakes before dawn and eats just one meal a
day. 'Eat less, spend less, work harder' has become his catchphrase.
Thais prefix his name with the title Maha  - denoting a venerated Buddhist
 -because of his monkish habits.
Gen Chamlong was born into a poor ethnic Chinese family, which his widowed
mother struggled to support as a street vendor.
Top grades in school took him into the army where he saw action in Vietnam
and Laos and eventually rose to the rank of major-general.
He left the military in the early 1980s to stand for the Bangkok
governorship.
Because of his steely character his vow to fast until death has been taken
seriously. He has ordered his supporters to stand guard in shifts to prevent
any attempts to force him to eat or take him to hospital.
He vowed not to speak during his fast and instead communicated through
signs.

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Zealand government, struggling with high external debt, yesterday
signalled that four state-owned enterprises, including the railways and the
former ministry of works, will be sold by the middle of next year. They have
a collective value of around USDollars 600m (Pounds 339m).
State owned enterprises minister Mr Maurice McTigue said the government was
looking into New Zealand Rail, the Works Corporation, Landcorp and the
Government Computer Service to see whether privatisation was the best
option.
Mr McTigue stopped short of saying the sales were inevitable. But he said it
was clearly the intention of the government to sell, providing there were no
impediments. There are difficulties with a big Maori land claim under the
1840 Treaty of Waitangi, and privacy issues surrounding the computer company
which manages the national register of all police, court and traffic
offences. Parliament may need to pass urgent privacy legislation to permit a
sale.
Mr McTigue refused to give a breakdown of how much each of the businesses
were expected to fetch. He said the sales would be used to retire external
debt. Decisions to sell would be based on the likelihood of greater
efficiency and financial gain for the businesses and a reduction of
financial risk to the government and the taxpayer.
He said that New Zealand Rail, which owns the ferries which link the North
and South Islands, and the national network of tracks, trains and bridges,
but not the land over which the trains run, is committed to a Dollars NZ350m
(Pounds 106m) modernisation programme over the next three years. Mr McTigue
said the government did not wish to pay for this.
The other companies earmarked for sale include Workscorp, which operates
large engineering, roading and construction companies, and Landcorp which
owns 180 farms. The sale of the farms would be handled in such a way as not
to depress the value of other farm properties, the minister said.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Banda faces threat to grip on power: Two days of unrest
leave 38 dead
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hastings Kamuzu Banda of Malawi was last night facing his most
serious crisis since independence in 1964 after 38 people were reported
killed as industrial unrest and looting continued for a second day.
Earlier reports of a coup attempt against Dr Banda, who is in his 90s, seem
unfounded, but the violence is a symptom of political tensions and a
deteriorating economy.
The combination of mounting opposition to his autocratic regime, led by the
church and trade union movement, and external pressure from donors which are
making aid conditional on human rights reforms, make it unlikely that Dr
Banda can weather the storm.
The unrest began in the commercial centre of Blantyre, say western diplomats
in the country's capital, Lilongwe, when 3,000 workers on strike at a
factory took to the streets on Wednesday.
Looting broke out as the workers, demanding a pay rise, were joined by
thousands of anti-government protesters, and para-military police opened
fire. Demonstrations and looting continued yesterday, said diplomats and
local residents, and the Blantyre offices of the ruling Malawi Congress
party, the country's only legal political party, were reportedly ransacked.
Earlier this year Catholic church leaders took the unprecedented step of
criticising the government's human rights record in a pastoral letter read
to congregations across the country.
Last month a leading trade unionist, Mr Chakufwa Chihana, was arrested on
his return to Malawi after calling for multi-party elections when addressing
a meeting of Malawian dissidents in neighbouring Zambia. Mr Chihana was due
to in court in Lilongwe yesterday, but failed to appear.
Donors preparing for next week's meeting in Paris of the World Bank-chaired
aid conference on Malawi have already warned the government that further
help will be linked to political as well as economic reforms.
Dr Banda has exercised a near-feudal control of Malawi since independence in
1964, ruthless in his treatment of opposition either real or suspected. In
one notorious incident in May 1983, three cabinet ministers and a member of
parliament died in what was officially described as a car crash. They were
widely believed to have been assassinated.
For several years the power behind the throne has been Mr John Tembo,
minister in the president's office and uncle of Miss Cecilia Kadzamira, a
long serving and influential figure with the formal title of official
hostess.

<TEXT>
MR Ahmad Shah Masood, Afghanistan's defence minister, yesterday rejected
demands by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, his rebel rival, to eject former
government militiamen from the capital, praising them for having helped to
depose the previous regime.
Mr Masood, denouncing Mr Hekmatyar in his first news conference since he
precipitated the collapse of the Soviet-supported government, also vowed to
prevent the radical mujahideen leader making further attacks on Kabul in the
latter's bid for ultimate power in the country.
Some diplomats, however, predicted that the ceasefire would collapse,
particularly given Mr Masood's uncompromising posture. 'Watch the rockets
start falling Saturday morning,' one senior European diplomat said.
'Perhaps, for a short time, Mr Hekmatyar will be able to use his rockets and
kill more innocent people,' Mr Masood said. 'But I assure you that soon we
will push him so far back that his rockets won't reach the capital.'
Mr Masood also claimed that, in addition to removal of the former
government's militia, Mr Hekmatyar was demanding the removal of President
Sibghutullah Mojaddedi.
While confirming that negotiations were going on with Mr Hekmatyar, as part
of a three-day truce that began on Wednesday, Mr Masood made no attempt at
conciliation. He said that political leaders would decide what role Mr
Hekmatyar could play in the government, but made no effort to hide his
contempt for his long-time enemy.
Mr Hekmatyar's refusal to join the government is a big reason why the
mujahideen administration lacks stability.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Iran removes limit on foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IRANIAN government is removing the limit on foreign investment in
business and companies, according to Abrar, a Tehran daily newspaper. It
reported yesterday that the Supreme Council for Investment had decided on
Tuesday to drop the limit which restricts foreigners to a 49 per cent stake
in Iranian ventures.
It commented said decision was designed to attract funds from the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund for industrial projects and that these
institutions had advised Iran to abolish limits on foreign ownership.
Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh, minister of economy and finance, and Mr Mohammed Adeli,
governor of the central bank, returned this week from Washington, where they
attended the spring session of the World Bank and IMF.
Iran is seeking foreign investment in the fields of gas, energy,
agriculture, transport and communications. The government of President
Hashemi Rafsanjani has signalled that it is serious about trying to rebuild
the country after its eight-year war against Iraq.
The country, with a population of over 58m, remains an attractive market for
trade but foreign companies have been less enthusiastic about investing in
the country. Iranian delegations have been sent around the world, making
presentations aimed at projecting an image of Iran as a friendly and stable
country with which to do business.

<TEXT>
THAILAND'S most serious political unrest in more than 15 years deepened
yesterday as more than 100,000 people defied military orders to end protests
calling for the resignation of the new prime minister, former army commander
General Suchinda Kraprayoon.
After a day of high tension, confusion and apparent miscalculation by the
military, the protesters moved from a narrow street in front of parliament
to a much larger square in the centre of Bangkok.
One reason for the move was to give more room for Major General Chamlong
Srimuang, former governor of Bangkok, who has now completed three sweltering
days of his hunger strike and was clearly suffering when the crowd at the
round-the-clock vigil peaked each evening.
Gen Chamlong, the simple-living former soldier known as the Mr Clean of
Thailand has vowed to fast until he dies or forces the resignation of Gen
Suchinda, who engineered a military coup 15 months ago and took over as
prime minister last month.
Mr Suriyant Oonnarkka, a member of Gen Chamlong's party, said the
demonstrators would stay all night in defiance of the military.
His aides said the four main opposition parties had written to King Bhumibol
Adulyadej asking him to intervene.
Students, workers, young professionals and old folk joined the protest, the
largest since a student uprising toppled a military dictatorship in 1973.
They are accusing the military of manipulating the electoral process to
perpetuate its domination of Thai politics.
An attempt by the prime minister to discredit Gen Chamlong clearly misfired,
at least as far as public opinion in the capital was concerned.
Gen Suchinda spoke briefly to parliament less than an hour into the second
day of a debate on his new government's policy statement. He accused Gen
Chamlong of being a religious deviant and implied that another opposition
leader, Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, wanted to impose a communistic
leadership.
The crowd outside parliament booed angrily when they heard what Gen Suchinda
had said about Gen Chamlong, and speculators, watching the debate on
television, dumped their shares. In the 10 minutes that he spoke the stock
market index lost 30 points although it later recovered to close only 6.9
points down, the lowest level this year.
The opposition booed the prime minister inside the parliament too and the
debate was abruptly closed.
Later in the day the military replayed tapes of the speech on television,
editing out the booing. They also showed clips of some of the more
aggressive gestures of the largely peaceful crowd before they started
issuing orders for the demonstrators to disperse. They claimed the
protesters were out to overthrow the legal government and to stir up unrest.
All this has apparently only increased the numbers willing to join the
demonstration. A sympathy rally was held in the northern city of Chiang Mai.
Late last night more petitions were submitted to the king asking him to
persuade Gen Suchinda to dissolve parliament and call another election.
At least one member of one of the five coalition parties backing Gen
Suchinda was reported last night to be defecting. Protest organisers predict
more will follow.

AN Irish government white paper on the Maastricht Treaty was approved by

The opposition supported the bill, but criticised the government's wish to
postpone legislation on the controversial abortion issue until after the
referendum. A special Maastricht protocol preserves Ireland's ban on
abortion. The opposition says legislation is needed to clear up confusion
over women's right to travel abroad for abortion.

FT  08 MAY 92 / EC threatens UK over border checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is threatening Britain with legal action if the UK
does not remove border checks on travellers entering from other Community
states by next January.
The threat is contained in the Commission's latest report on the state of
progress towards abolition of all controls on goods, services, capital and
people crossing internal EC frontiers.
The EC executive says, in its report issued this week, that it is
'resolutely determined to use all the legal and political means at its
disposal' to ensure fulfilment of Article 8a of the 1986 Single European Act
(SEA), which defines the internal market as 'an area without internal
frontiers'.
The Commission's maximalist interpretation of Article 8a has been known for
some time, and its threat of legal action is by no means solely directed at
the UK. Eight of the Community's continental members have already committed
themselves to a free travel zone, through the 1990 Schengen Convention, and
Greece has associated itself to the Schengen group as an observer. But
Denmark and Ireland are also dragging their feet on plans to abolish border
checks on intra-EC travellers - the former because of its passport union
with Nordic countries, and the latter because of its passport union with the
UK.
Nonetheless, the chief target of the report - which the Commission delayed
publishing during the recent UK election campaign - is Britain.
The UK has always argued that the SEA's commitment to free movement of
people applies only to EC citizens, and that controlling non-EC citizens
coming into the UK inevitably requires checking the credentials of EC
passport holders too.
In addition, the UK government argues that the SEA's commitment to free
movement is qualified by the treaty's explicit permission for member states
to take action against crime, drugs and terrorism. 'Many other EC states
agree that we need to keep controls' for these purposes, a senior UK
official said yesterday.
Increasing pressure from the Commission may embarrass the UK during its
presidency of the EC Council. If the Commission takes the UK before the
European Court it appears confident of winning.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Milan scandal deals a heavy blow to Craxi: 26 people have
been arrested on corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a nation long inured to businessmen and politicians lining their
pockets, the corruption scandal in Milan marks a watershed in the morality
of Italy's public life.
Milan magistrates are exposing, with fresh ramifications daily, a network of
pay-offs on rigged public works contracts with the funds being channelled to
the political parties.
In the past two months 26 businessmen, municipal officials and politicians,
including five over the past two days, have been arrested on corruption
charges. Many more are under investigation including Mr Carlo Tognoli, a
former Socialist mayor of Milan and outgoing minister of tourism, and Mr
Paolo Pillittieri, also a former mayor of Milan, newly elected deputy and
brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader.
Previous scandals in Italy have involved larger sums of money  - like the
collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano  - or more prominent public figures, as in
the unmasking of the masonic lodge, P-2. But the investigations were always
obstructed by powerful vested interests and the truth was obscured.
The Milan scandal is different. The large nationwide protest vote in the
April general elections has weakened the traditional parties of power, the
Christian Democrats and Socialists, obliging them to seek new partners in a
yet unformed government. In Milan the emergent populist Lombard League
became the second largest party, committed to clean out corruption.
These two elements make it more difficult for the course of justice to be
obstructed and indeed the post-electoral political climate in Italy is
unprecedentedly favourable to a clean up of public life and the
investigation has acquired a seemingly unstoppable momentum.
Magistrates, egged on by the media immediately judging every accused to be
guilty, have uncovered the following. On February 17, Mr Mario Chiesa, the
head of the city's oldest charitable hospital, the Pio Albergo Trivulzio,
was arrested allegedly in the act of taking a L7m (Pounds 3,160) bribe
relating to work at the Pio Albergo. Enquiries by magistrates led to
allegations that he possessed L12bn in cash and bank accounts. According to
magistrates' charges, Mr Chiesa was the central figure in an elaborate
system of rigged contracts, pay-offs and secret funding of political parties
since the mid 1980s.
Under investigation are some of the major public works contracts in Milan
such as the enlargement of the metro, refurbishment of the San Sirio
stadium, the rebuilding of Linate and Malpensa airports, and the new
'Piccolo' theatre.
Officials of companies involved in these contracts are alleged to have
handed over money to prominent members of the local Socialist and Christian
Democrat parties as well as the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The
Socialists and the Christian Democrats have set up special commissions to
examine the affairs of Milan.
Milan has long been run by a Socialist controlled administration and has
been the power-base of Mr Craxi - his son, Bobo, is the local secretary.
This city, the symbol and centre of modern Italy's wealth, has long prided
itself on its efficient 'clean government'. The damage to Mr Craxi's
reputation, the involvement of the 'uncorruptable' PDS and the undermining
of the Milanese sense of propriety have given an added edge to the affair.
Mr Craxi's once-fancied chances of heading the next government have been
dealt a serious blow and the formation of a new government is expected to be
further complicated by the divisions within, and among, the parties
exacerbated by the effects of the scandal.
In the case of the socialists, there are calls by anti-Craxi figures for a
special congress to discuss thorough reform of the party. The Christian
Democrats are split over what action to take, afraid that being too tough
over Milan would oblige a further cleansing of the party apparatus elsewhere
in Italy. The PDS leadership is distancing itself from its members under
investigation in Milan.
The revelations also coincide with Italy's economic recession and growing
public demands for sweeping reforms of the political system.
On the one hand, hard pressed businesses have begun to discover they can no
longer pay 10-15 per cent 'commissions' on contracts. On the other, the
Lombard League has put morality onto the agenda.
Systematic rigging of public works contracts, political pay-offs and illegal
funding of the parties are national phenomena in Italy. They are products of
a political system which has encouraged a vast army of people - at least 1m
according to rough estimates - to live off inflated party bureaucracies
which need in turn ever more funds to survive. The Lombard League is calling
for a complete revision of, and total transparency in, party funding.
Five more prominent Milan businessmen and politicians have been arrested in
connection with the scandal, writes Robert Graham.
They are Mr Sergio Radaelli, a Socialist board member of SAE, which runs
Milan's airports' and an associate of Mr Paolo Pillittieri; Mr Maurizio
Prada, head of the municipal transport company and a Christian Democrat
national executive member; Mr Gianstefano Frigerio, CD regional secretary;
Mr Augusto Rezzonico, a former CD senator; and Mr Enzo Papi, managing
director of Cogefar Impresit, a leading construction company. All but Mr
Radaelli were detained after being charged with corruption.

FT  08 MAY 92 / French bank base rates cut to 9.85%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN, JAMES BLITZ and PETER MARSH

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday followed the UK and engineered a cut in
interest rates in a move which raised further questions about the anchor
role of the D-Mark in the European Monetary System.
The cut from 10.35 per cent to 9.85 per cent in the main French banks' base
rates came just two days after Britain shaved borrowing rates by half a
point.
Both actions test the received wisdom that most EMS member countries have to
keep interest rates substantially above those in Germany because of Bonn's
good record on inflation.
The theory that Germany's economic problems have weakened its pivotal role
in the EMS was further bolstered by a strong performance by the French franc
and the pound on currency markets, in spite of the cuts in borrowing rates.
The D-Mark closed last night in London against the franc little changed at
FFr3.3669, while the pound gained 1 1/2 pfennig to close at DM2.94.
Both currencies were helped by the expected decision by the Bundesbank
council to hold its emergency Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent. The pound also
benefited from a decision by a big UK company to buy a large volume of
sterling for dollars.
France's base rate reduction came after the Bank of France announced a
reduction in its reserve requirements  - the sums the banks are obliged to
lodge with it  - while leaving its official intervention rates intact.
The reserve requirement on current accounts have been cut from 4.1 to 1 per
cent and on passbook savings accounts from 2 to 1 per cent. This should save
the banks an estimated FFr31bn (Dollars 5.55bn) a month.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said the reduction was intended to help
small businesses by making it easier for them to obtain credit.
Mr Sapin said it had been facilitated by 'moderate growth in demand for
money' and low inflation. The reduction in French borrowing costs comes on
the eve of an informal meeting of EC finance ministers in Oporto, Portugal,
where the impact of interest rates on growth will be high on the agenda.
The meeting has special importance for the French, having been initiated by
Mr Pierre Beregovoy because of his concern about the EC's sluggish growth.
Mr Beregovoy, previously finance minister, became prime minister last month.
The relatively high level of interest rates is one of France's main economic
problems.
The government reduced its official intervention rate last autumn, only to
be forced to raise it when the franc came under pressure.
The consensus among economists is that France will not risk reducing the
intervention rate again, despite the low level of inflation at 3 per cent,
until the Germans do so.

The Baltic republic of Latvia yesterday introduced a parallel currency to

writes Leyla Boulton.
Mr Einars Repshe, chairman of the Latvian central bank, said he hoped
Russia, which is giving republics a choice of staying in a rouble zone or
setting up their own currencies, would not take retaliatory action.
The so-called Latvian rouble, which has been printed in Latvia, would
co-exist with the Soviet rouble, which Russia is now calling its own. Mr
Repshe said that to avoid swelling the money supply, Soviet roubles would be
frozen in bank accounts and exchanged for new Latvian banknotes.

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa is today expected to outline his views on how to
resolve the crisis which led to the resignation of the Polish finance
minister earlier this week.
International Monetary Fund officials meanwhile continued their talks on
Poland's economic future in a meeting with Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime
minister.
The continuing talks are partly aimed at demonstrating that a new IMF
agreement is still possible, despite Wednesday's parliamentary vote for
higher government spending, which led to the resignation of Mr Andrzej
Olechowski, the finance minister.
Mr Michel Deppler, the deputy head of the IMF's European Department, said
that the Fund team will stay in Warsaw until its scheduled departure date of
May 12. Mr Mark Allen, the IMF representative in Warsaw, added that the
talks were based on 'the understanding that the Polish Government's
objective is to contain the fiscal deficit this year to 5 per cent of GDP
and to reduce it in subsequent years'. He added that an agreement would be
possible once it was clear that this aim could be achieved.
Agreement with the Fund is essential if Poland is to be able to draw on a
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 900m) extended facility granted last year. This was
later suspended when the government allowed the budget deficit to overshoot
its agreed target.
President Walesa is expected to address parliament today when he could
formally propose that he be granted greater constitutional powers to
nominate and dismiss the cabinet. The government at present is appointed by
parliament. But he has said that he will stop short of demanding Mr Jan
Olszewski's resignation, appealing for 'more dynamic government' instead.
Mr Walesa meanwhile signalled continuing confidence in Mr Olechowski, whom
he has mentioned as one of the possible candidates for the post of prime
minister.
Parliament yesterday opened a debate on a series of draft laws which provide
for cuts in welfare payments, pensions and unemployment benefits originally
designed to keep the budget deficit within limits acceptable to the IMF.

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN industry's resolve to keep wage settlements low this year is unlikely
to be weakened by the terms of last night's public sector pay deal, judging
by comments from employers.
IG Metall, the engineering union, yesterday continued demonstrations aimed
at countering the employers' offer of 3.3 per cent and upholding its 9.5 per
cent demand.
Mr Klaus Murmann, head of the German employers' association, said the public
sector pay award should not be taken as a guideline for industry. High
private-sector settlements could increase unemployment and inflation.
He said that private industry would do its utmost to see that pay deals were
lower than in the public sector. He was speaking as last night's settlement
with the public sector union was becoming clear.
In recent weeks, employers have warned of the consequences of high wage
settlements at a time when the domestic boom, sparked by unification, is
slowing down, foreign markets have yet to recover fully from recession, and
competition is increasing from lower-cost countries.
In the car and components sector especially, companies have stressed the
need to cut costs and improve efficiency. Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW,
and Opel (part of General Motors of the US) have all said they intend to
reduce their workforces in coming years, though avoiding redundancies where
possible.
Some companies have also been locating more investment overseas. 'Unions
don't consider the psychological impact on companies' investment thinking of
wage claims of around 10 per cent,' said Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, head of
Metallgesellschaft, the mining, metal and engineering group.
Its car-parts subsidiary intends to raise output in Brazil and France to
help offset high domestic costs. Kugelfischer, a bearings company, has been
reducing staff to combat the effect of high costs at a time of slack
worldwide demand.
'What we need is a couple of years with no wage increases,' said Mr Wolfgang
Masuch, Kugelfischer's commercial director.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Competitiveness of exports bears up under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPETITIVENESS of Germany's exporters has been dented by rising wage
inflation since unification, but it will take a few more high pay
settlements before the gains of recent years are whittled away.
German unit labour costs  - the wage cost per unit of output produced - are
now rising faster than those of its main European competitors and, with
exchange rates fixed in the European exchange rate mechanism, this growth
feeds directly to lost export competitiveness. However, the rise in the unit
labour costs of German manufacturing industry since 1987 is still lower than
for manufacturers in France, Italy and the UK, as the right-hand chart
shows.
German wage earnings have grown faster than those in France since 1987, the
year of the last important realignments within the ERM. But Germans'
superior productivity growth record has meant that its unit labour costs
have risen by less than those of French industry. The UK and Italy have seen
larger increases in both earnings and unit labour costs than in Germany.
In part, the rise in German wage inflation results from the economic
consequences of unification and the demand boom sparked off by a rise in
consumer spending by east Germans  - funded largely by hand-outs from the
western government.
However, it is also a product of pre-unification tensions. The latter half
of the 1980s was a period of unusual wage restraint. In return for a drop in
working hours, the unions agreed to moderate their wage demands.
With hindsight, the unions overestimated the cost to employers of the fall
in working hours. As a result the share of national income distributed to
labour fell to levels not seen since the early 1970s. The strikes are partly
the result of union attempts to claw back labour's share.
The Bundesbank has responded to rising inflationary pressures by pushing up
interest rates across Europe; while the government, faced with a ballooning
fiscal deficit, has pushing up income taxes. The recent crop of wage demands
is the direct manifestation of the refusal of west German workers to accept
a fall in their after-tax incomes.
Despite Germany's boom, and slow or zero growth elsewhere in Europe, UK and
Italian wage inflation remains higher than in Germany.

IMPORTANT changes must be made in the German constitution before the
Maastricht treaty on European union can be ratified by the two houses of the
German parliament.
That is the formal position of both the opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD), and of a majority of the German Lander (states) ruled by SPD
governments, which yesterday proposed a series of changes to be made.
Their move throws a new spanner into the works of the increasingly confused
and stormy German debate over the European Community although it is a move
which is ostensibly dedicated to ever greater European integration.
The constitutional changes now demanded include a precise definition of
future European union, or a United States of Europe, which would be subject
to strong democratic control  - such as more powers for the European
Parliament  - federalism, the rule of law, and the German concept of a
'social state.'
The SPD says any future transfer of sovereignty to the EC must be approved
by a two-thirds majority in both the Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament, and the Bundesrat, the upper house representing the states.
The party and SPD states also insist that both houses of parliament be given
the right to 'evaluate and approve' the final move of European monetary
union from stage two to stage three, the creation of a single currency and
central bank.
That would appear to amount to almost the same as the 'opt out' clause
negotiated by the British government in the Maastricht treaty.
They also want it written into the constitution that both houses of
parliament must be fully involved in the drafting of future government
policy towards the EC, wherever that might affect the federal powers of the
German states.
An early move in that direction is likely to be an insistence that they help
formulate the government position on the Delors-2 plan for additional EC
finances later this year.
The move was condemned yesterday by Mrs Renate Hellwig, the Christian
Democrat (CDU) chairman of the EC committee of the Bundestag, as 'absolute
madness'.
'We are making ourselves incapable of legal functioning,' she said. 'And we
are giving a terrible example to the rest of the Community.'
The SPD demands  - although specifically described as 'not preconditions'  -
were presented yesterday by Mrs Heidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul, EC spokesman for
the SPD in the Bundestag, as a formal and joint decision of the SPD national
executive, the parliamentary group, and the governments of the SPD states.
They have been tabled just a week before Chancellor Helmut Kohl has a
meeting with the premiers of all 16 German states, in an attempt to agree on
an acceptable constitutional underpinning for the ratification of
Maastricht.
Approval both by the states, and the SPD, is necessary before ratification,
because the Maastricht treaty already requires minor constitutional
amendments to allow voting rights for all EC citizens in local elections,
and to allow the introduction of a European central bank.
They therefore have the power to block the whole process.
In addition to the demand for greater parliamentary and federal control over
future transfers of sovereignty to the EC, the SPD wants to widen the voting
right in local elections to include all foreigners resident for an extended
period in Germany  - a move certain to be resisted by the CDU and its sister
party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
Mr Gunter Verheugen, the SPD representative on the parliament's
constitutional committee, said the proposals 'create a completely new
political situation in relation to the ratification of Maastricht. We want
to make it impossible that the German constitution will be negated by
actions at the European level.'
Mrs Wieczoreck-Zeul said that meant an insistence on 'democracy, federalism,
the rule of law and the social state'  - existing German constitutional
principles which might be over-ruled if other EC member states were prepared
to created a 'centralised, bureaucratic Europe.'
The whole aim was to ensure the transfer of adequate democratic powers to
the European Parliament, and to prevent the dilution of true federalism.
The SPD initiative has left Mr Kohl's CDU in some embarrassment, because
there are still clear divisions within the party on how far it should also
insist on moves to strengthen European political as well as monetary union.
Officials now fear that the chances of a ratification bill being approved at
the end of next week's talks are extremely slim, making it unlikely that
such a bill could be pushed through the cabinet by the end of May, or
presented to parliament before the end of June, when the summer recess
begins.
Thus the entire ratification process could be put off to the autumn, in
spite of the stated commitment of all political parties to complete it as
swiftly as possible.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COALITION of Islamic and democratic opposition forces consolidated their
control of the Tajik capital Dushanbe yesterday, after their apparent
overthrow of the ex-Communist government.
The situation last night remained very tense with both sides allegedly still
holding hostages. Sporadic outbursts of gunfire continued throughout the
city and former Soviet army tanks were patrolling the streets near their
garrison.
A protocol agreement, aimed at ending the bitter dispute between the
opposition and the former communist government was yesterday signed by
representatives from both sides after 24 hours of negotiations and fighting
which left at least 20 people dead.
Under the agreement, the Communist government has been replaced by a
Revolutionary Coalition Council until parliamentary elections are held later
this year.
The democratically elected president, Mr Rahmon Nabiyev is to be retained as
nominal head of state. However, Mr Nazrullo Dustov, the powerful hardline
vice-president, and other key government figures have been removed.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Banks offered 20% of O&amp;Y in loan deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled property developer, yesterday asked its bankers
for a five-year freeze on repaying almost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn) of
debt and a suspension of cash interest payments on Dollars 4bn of this.
In return the banks were offered a 20 per cent stake in the company in an
effort to prevent its collapse. Bankers suggested last night that agreement
on the world's biggest restructuring plan would be difficult to reach.
The rescue plan put forward by the world's largest property developer
involved asking its 15 biggest bank creditors to defer principal payments
for five years on its worldwide debt.
O&amp;Y also wants Pounds 300m to complete the existing phases of Canary Wharf,
Europe's biggest new office development,
The O&amp;Y negotiating team, led by the company's founder, Mr Paul Reichmann,
told the banks that work on later phases of Canary Wharf, in east London,
was likely to be delayed for at least five years.
Mr Jerry Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, admitted agreement from the banks would
not come quickly or easily.
Nonetheless, O&amp;Y's founders, the secretive Reichmann brothers, believe they
are making a big sacrifice by offering outsiders a stake in their business
for the first time in its 35-year history.
At meetings yesterday there were 70 people from the 15 largest bank
creditors, including representatives of O&amp;Y's three biggest lenders,
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, Citicorp of the US, and Canadian
Imperial Banking Corporation. Other banks represented were Barclays of the
UK, Credit Lyonnais of France, Commerzbank of Germany and Royal Bank of
Canada.
The initial session of the bank meeting, held in the boardroom at the top of
the Canary Wharf tower, the UK's tallest building, lasted from 3pm to 5.30pm
and then continued into the evening. Mr Steve Miller, O&amp;Y's chief bank
negotiator and a partner in James D. Wolfensohn Inc, presented a five-year
business plan. The key elements were:
The principal on most of O&amp;Y's Dollars 12bn of debt will not be paid for at
least five years, to allow for recovery in property values. It will then be
paid off over the following five years.
The company hopes to be able to pay cash interest on around Dollars 8bn of
debt.
On Dollars 4bn lent to or guaranteed by the parent company, cash interest is
unlikely to be paid. Instead, banks will receive non-voting equity shares of
O&amp;Y up to a maximum value of 20 per cent of the company.
O&amp;Y is seeking Pounds 300m of additional bank finance to complete existing
phases of Canary Wharf.
O&amp;Y is also asking permission of its Canadian banks to draw Dollars 130m of
a Dollars 240m facility, which is in default.
O&amp;Y is still waiting to hear from the 11 existing lenders to the Canary
Wharf project whether they are prepared to provide a Pounds 30m loan to keep
the project going for the next month, while the talks on the long-term
restructuring continue.
As an incentive to Canary Wharf lenders to participate in the long-term
restructuring, the 11 providers of the core Pounds 500m Canary Wharf loan
are being offered an equity stake of up to 30 per cent in the initial phases
of the Docklands development.
Mr Miller said: 'We have tried to achieve fairness for all lenders.' He said
the Reichmanns would have the right to buy back the O&amp;Y shares over the next
seven years. But after that the banks would keep the shares and could insist
that the company obtains a public listing.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Bonn yields to union pay demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Germany's 3m public sector workers were ordered back to work last
night after the government gave in to union pay demands and political and
public pressure for an end to the most disruptive national strike since the
war.
Despite the initial relief, however, the employers made concessions which
will undermine private sector companies' attempts to rein in wage costs and
damage the already divided coalition government's own anti-inflation drive.
The deal, which incorporates a 5.4 per cent basic pay increase and extra
payments to bolster incomes among the lower paid, came at the end of two
days of tense, secret negotiations led by Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president
of the oTV union, and Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister.
Officials of the GdEP rail and the DAG white-collar union called off their
action immediately, closely followed by oTV. An estimated 435,000 workers
had joined the strike on what was to be its last day.
Ms Wulf-Mathies claimed to be content to have won 5.4 per cent for all,
matching an arbitration proposal earlier rejected by the government. Mr
Seiters, however, said the overall value of the award was 5.12 per cent and
would cost an extra DM16.11bn a year.
According to his reckoning, his earlier 4.8 per cent 'final offer' would
have cost DM15bn a year.
The 12-month agreement, which expires at the end of December, includes DM200
extra holiday pay all round and a one-off DM750 payment for the lower paid,
DM600 for the middle ranks, and nothing for the top tier.
The basic 5.4 per cent rise is to be back-dated for low-earners to May 1,
and the higher-paid will get their increase a month later.
Gesamtmetall, the association of engineering companies currently at
loggerheads in their pay round, said its employees did not have the general
public as paymaster. 'They must earn their pay against hard international
competition,' it said last night.
Apparently anticipating government concessions, Mr Klaus Murmann, president
of the BDA, Germany's biggest employers' group, said earlier in the day that
the private sector was absolutely united in its resolve to relate this
year's awards to productivity.
'I declare here and now that the result of the negotiations in the public
sector can and will have no function as a model for private business,' he
said in Bonn.
However, the 5.4 per cent headline figure is bound to be seen by private
sector unions as the starting point for the next stage of their
negotiations. Last year's wave of increases of up to 7 per cent followed a 6
per cent deal in the public sector.
IG Metall, the country's biggest union, which represents 4m employees in the
engineering industry, yesterday continued a week of warning strikes
involving more than 100,000 members.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Labour loses heavily in polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party suffered heavy losses in yesterday's local elections in
England, deepening the party's post-general election gloom.
The Conservative share of the vote, projected across Great Britain, was
estimated by the BBC at about 45 per cent  - the Tories' strongest local
election showing since Mrs Thatcher first took power in 1979.
Basildon again exemplified Labour's trauma in southern England. The Essex
town unexpectedly returned a Tory MP last month: yesterday all the 15 seats
up for grabs on its council fell to the Tories, who took control.
The ghost of Militant also refused to die: the Liberal Democrats gained 10
seats in Liverpool, seven from Militant and three from Labour, while in
Glasgow Labour's five losses were all to hard-left rebels.
Labour's performance was little better in the Midlands: it lost control of
Walsall and Wolverhampton and fell back sharply in Birmingham and Coventry.
Its only comfort was the Tories' failure to regain Derby.
The number of councils lost by Labour was limited, however, because only
one-third of seats, in a minority of councils, were being contested. There
were no elections in London, Leicester, Nottingham and Plymouth.
Scotland continued to buck the English trend, showing only a modest Tory
advance. Labour added Aberdeen to its council strongholds north of the
border while the Tories failed to win Edinburgh  - though Labour lost its
overall majority in the city.
Labour lost control of 16 councils in total, including Bury (Greater
Manchester), Cambridge, Dudley, Milton Keynes, Rochdale, Walsall, Welwyn
Hatfield, and Wyre Forest. The party also suffered notable losses in
Brighton, Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Peterborough.
Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, hailed the results as 'terrific - a
strong confirmation
of last month's general election result'.
For Labour, Mr John Cunningham conceded 'disappointment'. 'The general
election defeat means that we are losing hundreds of seats in safe Labour
areas.'
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Simon Hughes predicted the party would end the
night with its largest number of councillors ever  - although its share of
the vote was barely up on 1988, the last time the seats fought for yesterday
were contested.
With 3,652 of the 3,910 results declared, Labour had suffered a net loss of
362 seats, with the Conservatives gaining 303 seats and the Liberal
Democrats 65. Most Tory gains were at the expense of Labour, with the
Liberal Democrats gaining from both sides.
The turnout was low across Britain  - as little as 20 per cent in some
inner-city wards.
Despite making a net gain of 31 seats, the Scottish National Party failed to
add much momentum to its campaign for Scottish independence.
Only four councils in Wales voted yesterday, with none changing control.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Lloyds bid for Midland hit by Brittan decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN, ROBERT PESTON and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK said yesterday it was determined to proceed with its proposal to
buy Midland Bank despite a severe blow to its hopes from Sir Leon Brittan,
the EC competition commissioner.
Sir Leon said he believed a bid for Midland from Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation fell within Brussels' jurisdiction while Lloyds' rival
proposal would not.
Lloyds was confident Sir Leon's announcement was an interim statement and
did not mean the Hongkong bid would definitely fall outside UK jurisdiction.
Lloyds wants both bids to be investigated by Britain's Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The Financial Times reported yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading was
planning to recommend that Lloyds' proposed bid  - but not the HSBC offer  -
be referred to the MMC.
Separately, Lloyds challenged Midland's refusal of commercial information
needed for a formal bid. Midland has already supplied the information to
Hongkong Bank.
Midland said its directors believed it would be wrong to release
confidential information when it was still unclear whether Lloyds would be
able to bid for it. Lloyds said it expected a ruling from the Takeover Panel
in due course.
This is the first time that Sir Leon, the EC competition commissioner, has
intervened during the Commission's routine one-month inspection of important
takeovers and mergers to make such an announcement purely about
jurisdiction.
An EC official said Sir Leon had done this to clear up mounting speculation
about how scrutiny might be divided between Brussels and London. However,
the official said that in the unlikely event the Commission was given
further relevant information, Sir Leon could change his mind about who has
jurisdiction.
The Commission said it was simply a matter of geography and arithmetic that
brought the HSBC bid within  - and the Lloyds proposal outside  - the remit
of the EC's 1990 merger regulation. In the case of Midland and HSBC, 'enough
of their business together is done outside the UK to bring the vetting of
such a merger to us', the EC official said. 'The competition implications of
the HSBC bid are therefore being considered in the normal way during the
remainder of the one-month inquiry period', Sir Leon said in his statement.
The Commission has until late May to decide whether to clear the bid or to
launch a full-scale four-month inquiry.
The UK has only two grounds on which to ask to deal with the bid itself. It
could invoke the merger regulation's Article 21, which deals with
non-competition aspects, to argue that prudential concerns require the bid
to be vetted in the UK. The Bank of England has already let it be known it
sees no threat posed by the HSBC bid to Midland's depositors. The UK's
second option is to claim, under Article 9, that the HSBC bid poses special
competition problems within the UK.
But this argument may be hard to sustain, given HSBC's geographical base.
The Commission has already sbown itself extremely unwilling to entertain
member states' pleas on these grounds. In any case, the UK has little time
to decide whether to use this latter option.
According to the regulation, a member state must request a referral within
three weeks of getting a copy from Brussels of the merger notification.

FT  08 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poor BP figures disappoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-QUARTER profits from British Petroleum were expected to be bad, but
the extent of the slide still managed to surprise the market. An early rise
for the shares was reversed, leaving a decline of 2 1/2 on the day at 259
1/2 p. Volume reached almost 20m.
Analysts had begun to wonder whether BP was not finally beginning to be
oversold, but yesterday's presentation reinforced the gloom. Mr Nick Clayton
of Smith New Court cut his full-year historic cost forecast by Pounds 50m to
Pounds 600m. He said: 'There was nothing in the statement to give any cause
for optimism.'
Traditionally pessimistic Strauss Turnbull cut back its historic cost
forecast by Pounds 106m to Pounds 400m. The house repeated its belief that
the dividend would be reduced in the third quarter and said the shares were
worth 220p at best.
Queens Moat active
A big placing of 41m Queens Moat Houses shares yesterday saw 86m traded in
the market, with insurance concern Prudential reported to have sold its 4.5
per cent stake in the hotel group. Coincidentally, the sale came the day on
which Queens Moat's annual report landed on fund managers' desks.
Agency broker James Capel was thought to have done the business, with the
block bought at 85 1/2 p and placed at 86 1/2 p. The shares slipped 3 1/2 to
88 1/2 p in a weak hotel sector.
Sears tumbles
Retailer Sears saw its heaviest turnover for more than five years as the
group announced a sharp fall in full-year profits and raised doubts about
the next dividend. The shares fell 6 1/2 to 97p, the biggest percentage drop
among the FT-SE Index of 100 leading companies.
However, buyers were attracted ahead of the stock going ex the dividend on
Monday, and the two-way pull ensured that more than 28m shares were dealt by
the close. Kleinwort Benson lowered its full-year forecast by Pounds 10m to
Pounds 100m but advised holding the shares at least until securing the
dividend.
BT benefited from heavy buying across the utilities sectors, 19.5m shares
being traded in the fully-paid, and a further 15m in the partly-paid. The
former rose a penny to 347 1/2 p and the latter  3/4 to 127 1/2 p.
Strong subscriber figures for April lifted Vodafone Group, as Kleinwort
Benson underlined its buy recommendation. The shares rose 7 to 364p.
Enthusiasm ahead of a presentation today by Reuters Holdings to analysts in
Geneva left the shares 14 up at 1227p.
A profits warning from the eponymous chairman depressed Bernard Matthews
shares, which lost 6 to 64p.
Unilever rose 12 to 930p as it returned to favour. The market range for
first-quarter profits due on May 15 is between Pounds 360m and Pounds 400m.
BET strengthened 12 to 154p on reports that SG Warburg, which has been
negative on the stock for the last three years, had turned buyer. The word
is that Warburg cited changes in the management at BET for its move and is
said to believe that a dividend cut is now discounted in the share price.
Turnover reached 6.2m.
Confirmation that a consortium led by Trafalgar House is to be the lead
contractor to build a suspension bridge in Hong Kong sent the company's
shares climbing 5 to 152p in heavy turnover of 7.6m.
Lloyds Bank fell 7 to 410p amid worries that its proposed hostile bid for
Midland Bank (off a penny at 389p) may be referred to the UK Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Electricity utilities were strong, with Scottish Hydro-Electric, up 10 at
198p, and Northern Electricity, ahead 13 at 336p, the star performers.
A block of 3.5m British Land shares came into the market as one institution
decided to switch out of the property group. The stock slipped 4 to 195p as
the Seaq ticker reported 8.1m shares traded. SG Warburg was said to have
bought the stock for 190 1/2 p and placed 2.9m at 192p. Hammerson 'A' was
busy and 2 lighter at 371p after 2.4m dealt.
US credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded Taylor Woodrow's
rating, blaming the continued depressed state of the UK property and
building market. The shares, however, closed 6 firmer at 140p.
An upbeat statement at the T &amp; N annual meeting helped the shares climb 11
1/2 to 154 1/2 p. Trading was also boosted by broker recommendations.
Nomura and Smith New Court produced substantive documents on Granada Group,
with both houses recommending the stock. The shares rose 6 to 280p.
Mr Chris Page at Goldman Sachs reiterated his overvalued stance on Ladbroke
shares, which tumbled 10 to 254p in turnover of 5.4m.
Publisher Euromoney received a boost on the back of good interim profits and
a raised dividend. SG Warburg Securities highlighted the stock in a big
review of media stocks published yesterday. The shares, which stood at 400p
in November, jumped 102p yesterday to close at 785p.
Troubled WPP fell again as concern about the group's refinancing continued.
The shares lost 12 1/2 to 45 1/2 p.
Eurotunnel gave up 8 to 390p after a Magazine survey revealed passenger
fears about using the Channel tunnel when it opens.
Light selling was seen in BAA, the shares easing 2 to 629p. There were
suggestions in the market that the company would announce its plans for a
fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport next Tuesday. The group reports
full-year figures on June 8. Charterhouse Tilney predicts profits of Pounds
176m.
Closer inspection of Wednesday's traffic figures, which revealed premier
passenger numbers to be around the levels of two years ago, sent British
Airways down 8 1/2 to 284p on turnover of 6.1m.
Smith New Court was reported to have turned cautious on the figures. In
addition, there were suggestions in the market that BA may soon strike a
deal to purchase TWA's European assets.

FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: The right formula for a chemical
reaction - Paul Abrahams on how cyclical and geographical factors make the
sector hard to predict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals companies have proved to be the ultimate cyclical stocks. Burdened
with large capital-intensive plants, they have had a tendency to do
exceptionally well when times are good and particularly poorly when times
are bad.
With such stocks timing is crucial: the trick is to switch out of defensive
companies into the cyclical ones as demand picks up.
However, not all European chemical issues are straightforward recovery
plays, according to Ms Wendy Anderson, European chemicals analyst at County
NatWest in London. The timing of recovery for the groups will depend upon
their differing exposures to cyclical businesses and geographical areas.
One of the key determinants will be exposure to the US market, which is
likely to recover before Europe. All European chemical companies have been
reporting an upturn in demand in the US.
The question is whether that upturn is sustainable. Hoechst, Bayer and
Henkel in Germany, as well as Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland, have reported
increasing demand in different product areas - a development that lends
weight to the possibility of a sustained recovery, according to Ms Jackie
Ashurst, European chemicals analyst at James Capel.
One British industrialist believes chemical companies are under-reporting
the recovery in the US for fear of being caught out as they were last year,
when a brief upturn fizzled out.
Those with the greatest exposure to a US-led recovery are Hoechst and Bayer
in Germany, and Akzo in the Netherlands. Du Pont, of the US, has recently
reported much improved results at its fibres operations, and Hoechst, which
has a fibres business in the US, may well benefit too.
The high level of dollar earnings at Rhone-Poulenc, the French group, is
mostly because of its recent acquisition of a controlling stake in Rorer,
the US pharmaceuticals group. Since people are ill no matter what their
financial status, the company is less highly geared to a US recovery than
might at first be apparent.
In terms of exposure to particular markets, analysts believe it is important
to avoid stocks heavily involved in the plastics and petrochemicals
industries.
The main difficulty in petrochemicals is overcapacity. Supply already
outstrips demand, and the position is likely to deteriorate. Demand is
expected to rise by only 4.5 per cent over the next two years, while supply
is due to increase by 9 per cent this year, and 6 per cent in 1993.
Ms Anderson at County NatWest reckons there are likely to be few plant
closures because the least efficient European plants are state-owned, and
governments are unwilling to take on the political implications of
significant job losses.
'Any recovery in petrochemicals is likely to be slow and painful. It is
possible that the sort of margins seen in the late 1980s will only return at
the end of this decade,' she warns. Those companies most heavily implicated
are Solvay, DSM and BASF.
A further consideration in picking recovery chemical stocks is the
effectiveness of the widespread cost-cutting measures. Few Continental
companies have been able to implement the sort of radical restructuring
carried out by Imperial Chemical Industries, of the UK. However, both Akzo
and DSM have pushed through impressive programmes that have started to show
in their results.
In terms of timing, chemical shares are likely to underperform over the next
couple of months, according to Ms Ashurst. Historically, the chemical
industry goes quiet during the summer and most have recently paid their
dividends. There remain concerns, too, about the state of the German
economy.
Ms Ashurst, however, expects stocks with US exposure and without a heavy
reliance on petrochemicals to outperform the market during the second half
of the year.

FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 3.1 per
cent to recapture 18,000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
A STRONGER yen and firmer bond prices encouraged buying by foreigners and
investment trust funds, and the Nikkei average rose 3.1 per cent, regaining
the 18,000 level for the first time since April 6, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 532.22 higher at the day's best of 18,410.88.
The index started the session on a weaker tone, slipping to a low for the
day of 17,653.75 on profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling.
Volume expanded to 400m shares from 280m as foreigners and investment trusts
sought blue chip issues. Late afternoon index-related buying by dealers also
boosted activity.
Advances overwhelmed declines by 928 to 101, with 104 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks moved ahead 35.27, or 2.6 per cent,
to 1,374.70, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 4.14 to 1,106.61.
Traders said the rise reflected a brighter short-term outlook. However, many
market participants remain cautious ahead of the corporate earnings
reporting season for the business year to March. Mr Chris Appleton at Baring
Securities said: 'The worst previews for the year to March 1992 seem to have
been factored in by the recent selling, and people will focus on forecasts
for the year to March 1993.'
Many institutional investors remained inactive in spite of the rally. 'We
have already bought at lower levels,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life.
Blue chip high-technology issues gained on foreign buying. Sanyo Electric,
the most active issue of the day, advanced Y47 to Y498 on bargain hunting.
Domestic investors were also encouraged by reports that the company will
enter the solar cell market. Foreigners also sought Bridgestone, the tyre
maker, which appreciated Y40 to Y1,220.
Speculative issues rose on continued buying by short-term traders. Okamoto
Industries, the condom maker, put on Y40 to Y1,280 and Meiji Milk Products
Y19 to Y865.
Teac, the electronics maker, which has been recently traded actively on the
'US recovery' theme, lost ground. The issue fell Y40 to Y1,050 after Japan
Securities Finance, the sole lender of margin stocks to brokers, warned it
would restrict loans of Teac shares for margin selling.
Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone rose Y13,000 to Y646,000 on reports that
financial authorities were studying measures to support the issue.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended Lec, the kitchen and bathroom-ware maker,
amid reports that it had filed for court protection under the bankruptcy
law.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 479.13 to 20,754.82 in volume of 25.5m
shares. The index rose on late dealer buying and index-related activity.
Roundup
THE worsening political crisis left Bangkok closing at its lowest level this
year, while the overall picture in Pacific Rim markets was mixed.
BANGKOK fell further after the prime minister attacked the opposition for
mounting protests against his government. The SET index dropped 6.90 to
710.72 in turnover of Bt5.05bn.
HONG KONG gained ground on bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index rose 48.38
to 5,629.58 in turnover of HKDollars 3.7bn.
HSBC Holdings advanced HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 45, but Henderson Land
declined 20 cents to HKDollars 18.40.
SEOUL weakened on fears of debt repayment problems affecting smaller
companies. The composite index fell 8.51 to 603.34 in Won356.2bn turnover.
Daewoo Heavy, Korea Air and Samsung Aerospace were all stronger after their
consortium won the bid to launch South Korea's first satellites.
TAIWAN lost ground as turnover fell to its lowest level since last October.
The weighted index shed 0.96 to 4,481.29 in turnover of TDollars 10.8bn,
down from TDollars 17.6bn.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower in dull trade. The All Ordinaries index dipped 3.0
to 1,665.9 in turnover of ADollars 365.6m.
Foster's Brewing retreated 7 cents to ADollars 1.77 with 4.2m shares traded.
The Australian Stock Exchange has asked the company to explain the recent
fall in its share price.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index ended 2.59 ahead at 1,470.12. Fletcher Challenge
eased 2 cents to NZDollars 3.50 while Telecom gained 3 cents to NZDollars
1.98.
MANILA's composite index advanced 21.71 to 1,231.45 in combined turnover of
289m pesos, up from 240m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR was easier in the absence of institutional investors. The
composite index lost 0.90 to 603.56. Declines led rises by 162 to 63.

FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris makes late spurt as
interest rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of easier money lifted Paris ahead of the long weekend, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS made a late spurt on the Bank of France's disguised interest rate cut.
The CAC 40 index closed just below the day's highs at 2,063.40, up 16.25, in
turnover just short of FFr3bn. The markets is closed today for a national
holiday.
Financials, which had anticipated lower interest rates, strengthened
further. Paribas gained FFr11.90 to FFr446.90 and Suez added FFr3 to FFr346,
while Bancaire surged FFr32 or 6.6 per cent to FFr517.
Michelin gained FFr2.9 to FFr214.9 in heavy trading of 1.2m shares, bloated
by a big put-through.
FRANKFURT traded in a narrow range as talks continued between the government
and unions to end the strike. The DAX index closed up 7.31 at 1,750.81 after
opening at 1,750.40. The FAZ index was 2.1 firmer at 706.80, while turnover
rose to DM6.5bn from DM6.3bn.
Daimler-Benz advanced DM4.50 to DM791.50 after positive comments from Mr
Edzard Reuter, the chairman, in which he forecast good earnings growth in
1992.
Volkswagen continued to gain on Wednesday's strong results, up DM2.80 at
DM388.80, but Porsche slid DM30 or 5.6 per cent to the year's low of DM500
in the absence of news.
Preussag advanced DM9.10 to DM412.10 on reports that it had sold its 3.5 per
cent stake in Australian mining group MIM. Mannesmann gained DM1 to DM284.50
before reporting a 43 per cent fall in 1991 group net profit after the
close.
Better-than-expected first quarter figures lifted Hochtief shares DM25 to
DM1,265.
MILAN continued to recover, but prices ended off the session's highs on
worries that the Milan corruption scandal could widen to Rome. The Comit
index rose 1.66 to 497.41 in turnover estimated at around Wednesday's
L114bn.
Cogefar, one of the construction companies which has been tainted by the
scandal, closed L165 down at L3,555.
Shares in the insurer RAS were suspended, a move which disconcerted the
market, ahead of the announcement of a one-for-four rights issue with
warrants. Its parent Allianz said it would take up its quota of the L531bn
cash call. The insurer also reported a steep rise in 1991 parent company net
profit, which dealers said was due to extraordinary items to sweeten the
capital increase.
Fiat rose L91 to L5,150 on program buying from London. The release of
favourable April car industry data after the close pushed Fiat higher on
London's Seaq.
ZURICH lost ground after its record-breaking run earlier this week. The SMI
index shed 0.5 to 1,936.8.
Most blue chip stocks were weaker with Nestle bearers easing SFr10 to
SFr9,990 and Brown Boveri bearers losing SFr50 to SFr4,250.
However, banks and insurers managed to retain some early gains: UBS bearers
advanced SFr10 to SFr3,840 and Zurich bearers put on SFr20 to SFr4,440.
STOCKHOLM continued to focus on Volvo as the company made a presentation to
fund managers in London. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 3.6 to 1,007.9
in heavy turnover of SKr787m from SKr768m.
Volvo B unrestricted shares added SKr6 to SKr436 on optimism for a 1992
earnings recovery and an early merger with Renault. The stock has also been
recommended by James Capel as a 'buy'.
Ericsson eased SKr3 to SKr132 ahead of reporting a worse-than-expected first
quarter pre-tax loss of SKr363m. The company forecast a 'very weak' first
half and a 'low' full-year profit.
AMSTERDAM was weaker with the CBS Tendency index shedding 0.2 to 129.9 in
turnover of Fl 896.4m.
Philips lost another 90 cents at Fl 37.10 on Wednesday's disappointing first
quarter figures, while Polygram gained 60 cents to Fl 51 on a US buy note.
There was active options-related trading in Nedlloyd, and its shares
advanced Fl 1.40 or 2.3 per cent to Fl 61.50, but off the day's high of Fl
62.90.
KLM gained 70 cents to Fl 39.80 after plans to strengthen its air cargo
business, while Daf, which launched two new trucks, lost 30 cents to Fl 24.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IEA confirms upturn in oil
consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS OF a pick-up in oil consumption were confirmed yesterday by the
International Energy Agency, the west's oil industry monitoring body, which,
in its April market report, highlighted a 2 per cent increase in first
quarter oil demand in members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development.
Renewed confidence amongst oil traders that world demand is beginning to
rise has supported the market in the past two weeks. But North Sea Brent
crude oil for June delivery eased 10 cents yesterday to Dollars 19.50 a
barrel.
The IEA revised North American demand upwards for the first quarter to 18.7m
barrels a day, an increase of 3 per cent over the same period last year amid
signs that the US economy is emerging from recession.
The IEA expects OECD oil demand to average 37m b/d in the second quarter, a
rise of 0.5 per cent from the same quarter in 1991.
A report by Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, forecasts a resumption
of robust growth in oil consumption in the next couple of years with world
demand up by 0.8 per cent or 500,000 b/d this year. It predicts an increase
in demand of 1.8 per cent next year and 2.4 per cent in 1994.
The IEA expects OECD oil demand to average 38.4m b/d over the year - an
increase of about 1 per cent from last year. However, growth in North
American oil demand is being offset by a slowdown in consumption in the
Pacific region as economic activity remains sluggish.
Oil production by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries remained steady in April at 23.5m b/d according to the IEA. Opec
reiterated its current production ceiling of just under 23m b/d at its last
meeting on April 24, stressing a commitment to ensure that all members cut
output to achieve that level.
The IEA pointed out that Iran's output dipped slightly in April to 3.3m b/d
from 3.4m b/d.
The decline in oil production in the CIS slowed in March, the IEA reported,
to 9.5m b/d from a level of 9.6m b/d in January and February. The agency
said that production for the whole of the first quarter was estimated to
have dropped 12 per cent against the same period last year to 9.55m b/d.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese to join Oman gas
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Japanese companies have announced that they will join a Dollars 9bn
project to develop a liquefied natural gas industry in Oman, completing the
ownership structure for the commercial exploitation of the Sultanate's gas
reserves.
Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui &amp; Company and C. Itoh &amp; Company will together
take a joint 7 per cent stake in a state-controlled company to develop the
downstream exploitation of Oman's gas reserves. Proven reserves in 1991 were
9.8 trillion (million million) cubic feet, but some estimates put potential
reserves nearer at 17 trillion cu ft.
The Sultanate will hold 51 per cent of the downstream venture, which will
oversee gas liquefaction, shipping and marketing. Shell will hold 34 per
cent of the downstream company, Total 6 per cent and Partex 2 per cent,
following agreement on the venture in February.
These companies hold comparable shares in Petroleum Development Oman, the
state-owned oil group, which will control gas production and condensate
development.
Shell International Gas has already completed an early feasibility study for
the launch of Oman's gas industry which suggests the Sultanate could viably
produce 5m tonnes a year. Further studies and development could take another
eight years and first LNG shipments are expected in mid-1999.
Reserves are reported to allow for 20 years of exports and up to 50 years of
domestic consumption.
Commercial exploitation of its gas reserves will be a welcome addition to
Oman's trading position given the Sultanate's modest position among Gulf oil
producers. Output is set to rise by 50,000 barrels a day to 750,000 b/d this

FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African farmers to get Pounds
740m relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KRAAI van Niekerk, the South African agriculture minister, yesterday
announced a R3.8bn rand (Pounds 740m) drought aid package, which he called
the most significant rescue bid ever for the country's farmers.
'These measures are being established in order to relieve the effects of the
most serious drought yet experienced in South Africa this century,' he said.
The four-year package includes R1bn already announced for drought relief in
the national budget in March.
'Without intervention by the state, serious disruption of the South African
economy can take place,' Mr van Niekerk said.
The economy is gripped by its longest recession since the second world war,
sapped by years of sanctions and labouring under weak world prices for the
country's main export, gold.
Because of widespread crop failure, South Africa, normally a leading
exporter of maize, is seeking to import 5m tonnes.

London COCOA prices continued along the downward path, nearby July closing
above an earlier 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 561 a tonne. Dealers said any
rally in cocoa prices is likely to run into heavy origin sales. There were
indications of some selling by both the Ivory Coast and possibly Ghana
yesterday. Psychological support is seen emerging around Pounds 550 for
July. Robusta COFFEE prices failed to rise significantly despite gains in
New York linked to continued speculation about what steps key producers such
as Colombia and Brazil might take to stem the recent steep decline. New York
analysts said that technical indicators showed the arabica market to be very
oversold. Trade sources said the market remains awash in supply and origin
sales are seen keeping any upswing from running away. ZINC prices eased on
the LME, and the premium for cash metal over three-month narrowed in spite
of nervousness over technical tightness of supplies. The decline followed
Wednesday's fall below Dollars 1,280 a tonne for three-month metal. TIN
renewed its advance during late trading and closed at fresh 13-month highs,
while COPPER moved out of its recent dull range to end at four-week highs.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexico to ease way for mining
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has submitted new mining laws to congress that will
lighten the administrative burden of investing in the country's mining
sector, and provide greater legal security for the investor.
The new laws, which are certain to be passed by congress, will scrap all
restrictions for Mexicans on investing in concessions in the mineral sector,
except in hydrocarbons and uranium. Previously domestic investors in
strategic minerals, such as rock phosphate, sulphur and potassium, wishing
to have full ownership rights over a concession were forced to enter into a
limited partnership with the government, to whom they would have to pay
royalties and surrender a percentage of profits. Private investment in coal
was prohibited.
The government will also ease restrictions on foreign investment in
concessions for gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper mining. In the past
foreign investors in these sectors had to be minority partners or set up
cumbersome trusts that allowed them to circumvent the law. Now foreign
investors can purchase 100 per cent of the full voting shares of a mining
company.
Mexico's constitution reserves to the state mineral ownership, but allows
the government to sell off concessions. The new legislation increases the
period of concession for prospecting from three to six years and for
exploitation from 25 to 50 years, both periods being renewable.
Mexico, whose economy under Spanish colonial rule was built on the
exploitation of its huge mineral deposits, is still the world's largest
producer of silver, and among the top producers of sodium, graphite, copper,
sulphur and zinc. The government has also reduced by half taxes on mining
concessions in the past two years to 3.5 per cent, and plans to eliminate
them altogether in another two years, in the hope of attracting more
investment.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Droughts send world tea prices
higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DROUGHT IN Africa, southern India and Sri Lanka has curbed world tea
production, sending London auction prices steadily higher since the
beginning of the year.
Quality tea this week fetched 180p a kilogram, compared with 150p in early
January. Over the same period good medium quality tea has risen from 115p to
135p a kilogram.
'It has changed from a buyers' to a sellers' market,' said one trader
yesterday.
The drought in Africa has hit production in Malawi, Zimbabwe and Kenya,
where problems are thought to have been exacerbated by tribal unrest.
In Sri Lanka and southern India, which had record crops last year in
conditions generally considered ideal, drought also led to output cuts.
At the same time stocks in consuming countries are low. In the UK, still the
biggest tea importer, basic stocks are down to just over 30.6m kg from last
year's 34.4m kg, itself considered to be a low level. The destocking was
prompted by high interest rates, a weak market and improvements in
efficiency, observers believe.
Further complicating the picture has been the reappearance of buying by the
Russians, who had been staying away because of their lack of hard currency.
'If the Russians stay in, the outlook is quite favourable,' one trader said
yesterday.
Mr Illtyd Lewis, executive director of the Tea Council, said most tea
offered at the London auction had been taken up recently. Buyers were taking
fully into account the climatic conditions, the Russians and low stock
levels.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects black tea production this year to
fall by 20,000 tonnes to 1.69m tonnes. It estimates consumption at 1.73m
tonnes. The best hope for an improvement in prices is the continuation of
the decline in world export availability, the EIU says in its latest World
Commodity Forecasts.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana plan 'a Pandora's box'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras yesterday said the European
Commission would be opening 'a Pandora's box' by imposing a new European
Community-wide quota on Latin American bananas of 1.4m tonnes.
This would cut the Latin Americans' current market share by 1m tonnes and
cost the struggling democracies in the region thousands of comparatively
well paid jobs.
The commission's proposal, intended to benefit banana exporting countries in
the former European colonies, would require a waiver from the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the president said on a visit to Washington
yesterday. That would set a precedent for a barrage of waivers from
countries wanting to protect sensitive farm sectors, particularly in the
event of farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round.
President Callejas said he had requested President Bush's support yesterday
for denial of the Gatt waiver to the Community. Mr Bush's response was an
enigmatic promise to 'be supportive of all decisions within the framework of
Gatt'.
The Hondurans argue that the proposed regime, like the existing regime, is
inconsistent with the Gatt because it contravenes international commitments
calling for the most complete liberalisation possible of trade in tropical
products. It would undermine, rather than support, the economies of the
developing countries at a time when their other agriculture products were
facing severe market conditions.
'Coffee is at the lowest price in years,' President Callejas said. 'Our
terms of trade are going against us.'
Eventually, he said, the EC would have to change its policy. The inefficient
countries, which had continued to produce bananas because of special
treatment by the community, would have failed to develop alternative exports
for which they were more suited; the Latin American countries would have
suffered environmental damage by switching to inappropriate crops like
maize.
President Callejas expressed his determination to pursue free trade
policies. On May 12, the first steps will be taken towards establishing a
Central American free trade zone, initially including Guatemala, Salvador
and Honduras, and later Costa Rica and Nicaragua.
Honduras is hoping to join the Gatt in May. In 1996, it is planning to agree
on a free trade zone with Mexico and in the same year it will pursue a free
trade agreement with the US.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Bonds: BAe storms back to market with record
Dollars 400m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE second day running, Eurobond investors rushed to snap up a large,
generously-priced dollar bond issue as British Aerospace launched the
largest Eurodollar deal yet by a British company.
The five-year, Dollars 400m deal - increased from Dollars 300m due to demand
 -marked a storming return by a borrower which had studiously avoided the
public markets since its disastrous rights issue last summer and subsequent
management upheaval.
With its credit ratings recently reaffirmed at A2/A+, and with a new
boardroom line-up finally completed, the yield on offer yesterday - 111
basis points over US treasuries - was seen as attractive.
Other similar credits, such as Reed and Ericsson, currently trade at a yield
spread of around 90 basis points.
In later trading, the BAe spread tightened to some 106 basis points.
'My philosophy is not to squeeze the last basis point or two out of the
Euromarket - it will only come back to haunt you,' said Mr Tony Rice, BAe
treasurer.
The company had originally planned to raise between Dollars 200 and Dollars
250m, but was happy to take more. 'Liquidity in the bilateral and syndicated
London banking market is very low at the moment,' said Mr Rice. 'This gives
us a very strong negotiating position with our banks.'
The proceeds were not swapped, though; had they been, the cost to the
borrower would have been around 60 basis points over Libor - roughly in line
with what the group's banks would expect to earn, said Mr Rice.
Meanwhile, yesterday's Dollars 500m sell-out issue for Compagnie Bancaire
was priced as expected to yield 75 basis points over Treasuries, and
tightened later to a spread of under 72 basis points.
Yesterday also saw a continuing flow of Ecu transactions, although none
achieved the success of the Ecu150 deal from Johnson &amp; Johnson the day
before.
The most difficult deal to sell was reported to be a Ecu110m issue from
Nederlandse Gasunie.
The five-year bonds from the AAA-rated borrower came to the market offering
a yield of 8.8 per cent - just below the yield on the benchmark Credit Local
issue, and some nine basis points lower than the level at which the Johnson
&amp; Johnson issue had settled.
'It's expensive - it's no gift,' said one banker involved in the
transaction.
More favourably received was a Ecu150m, five-year issue from Philip Morris -
a single-A rated borrower - offering a yield of 9.3 per cent.
The deal was said to be selling well to Swiss and other continental European
investors, although, as with the NedGas issue, the syndicate was not broken
yesterday. Both issues were brought by Paribas, which also launched the
first Ecu issue for the Republic of Turkey.
The Ecu150m, three-year deal, with a yield of 11.55 per cent, was priced to
offer a spread of 200 basis points over the three-year swap rate. At that
level, it offers a significant pick up over the three-year floating-rate
issue from Greece, which yesterday was trading at a spread of under 100
basis points over Libor.
The issue had been marketed in advance to high-yield funds and other
investors, and was said to have been well taken up, with the bulk of the
issue going to such investors rather than to banks.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Contract trading on Eurotrack
forced to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES and options contracts on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 Index of the top
100 continental European companies will stop trading next month due to lack
of demand, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(Liffe) said yesterday.
Liffe said the derivative products would be suspended indefinitely following
the expiry of the June 1992 contracts on June 17. 'Clearly we are
disappointed by the current lack of demand for these products, but we
recognised prior to the launch that they may be ahead of their time,' said
Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe.
The suspension of futures and options based on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 Index
follows a decision by Soffex, the Swiss Options and Financial Futures
Exchange, to halt trading in futures and options based on the Eurotop 100
stock index due to poor demand.
Volumes for pan-European index derivative products have proved
disappointing; for example, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 Index futures contract,
which was launched in June 1991, had a daily average volume of 13 contracts
and has traded a total of 2,802 contracts. By comparison, the FT-SE 100
index future contract, based on the top 100 UK companies, had an average
daily volume of 9,200 contracts in April.
The London Stock Exchange has signed agreements with US exchanges -
including NYSE, CBOT and CBOE - allowing them to create derivative products
based on the Eurotrack 100 Index, but so far none of the US exchanges has
done so.
Mr Jenkins said Liffe would 'continue to monitor the need for pan-European
stock index derivative contracts, with a view to launching suitable products
once demand is judged sufficient to ensure a reasonable level of liquidity'.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Warrants issued on Argentine
bank debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the New York-based banking group, has launched Dollars 100m of
call warrants on Argentine bank debt. The deal marks the first time warrants
have been issued on the sovereign bank debt of an emerging market borrower.
The warrants give investors the option of buying debt within the next year.
Argentina is restructuring its debt, and is expected to convert its bank
loans into bonds, by the end of this year or early 1993.
Each warrant can be exercised into Dollars 250,000 of Argentine General
Restructuring Agreement (GRA) debt without interest. The exercise price is
41.5 per cent of the par value.
Argentina is undergoing a Brady-style debt restructuring, whereby its debt
will be converted from loans into bonds. Provided the restructuring goes
ahead, investors will be able to exercise their warrants on the bonds.
Bankers familiar with the Latin American markets said the warrants were
likely to appeal to institutions and high net worth individuals, and would
probably attract Latin American flight capital. 'The warrants give a high
leverage, which appeals to a lot of Argentine speculators,' said one UK
banker.
The warrant issue has coincided with a general strengthening of Argentine
assets recently, and may have contributed to a rise in the price of
Argentina's debt, from 41 1/2 per cent of face value to 43 5/8 per cent,
since Wednesday.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Managed futures industry get its
first break - US regulators have proposed a rule to ease constraints on
commodity pool money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The managed futures industry is about to get its first big regulatory break
in America.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has proposed a rule - known
as 4.7 because of its place among the agency's regulations - that will allow
commodity pool operators to offer unit shares to institutional investors
without the complicated disclosure, reporting and record keeping entailed
when such products are offered to the ordinary investing public.
The managed futures industry, which has mushroomed from an estimated Dollars
250m business in 1980 to one with over Dollars 21bn under management, has
been pressing for this and other regulatory changes for several years. It
argues that US regulation has begun to stunt growth, particularly with
regard to institutional customers, which represent the greater part of
business.
Institutional customers and wealthy individuals are those most interested in
privately placed pools, but until now American regulatory constraints have
put US pools at a disadvantage. Consequently, commodity pool money has moved
increasingly offshore.
For example, Chase Manhattan, the only bank that offers commodity pools,
says that 75 per cent of the Dollars 200m it has in pools is offshore. Mr
Charles Minnaar, chief of Chase's managed funds group, says that offshore
pools have been preferred because under US regulation 'it takes an
incredibly long time to bring a product to market'. A private placement
offshore is also less expensive.
An offshore fund can be put together quickly at costs of about Dollars
10,000-Dollars 20,000, while a US private placement of a commodity pool can
easily take six months and run to over Dollars 50,000.
All of this would be expedited and made less costly by Rule 4.7. It would
exempt private offerings from the usual requirements of disclosure and
record-keeping for what the CFTC calls 'qualified eligible participants' -
such as banks, pensions funds, insurance companies and high net worth
individuals.
Those who qualify under the CFTC's guidelines, are assumed to be
sufficiently knowledgeable of the risks of futures trading.
The CFTC says its proposal is intended to harmonise its rules with those of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry
regulator. The SEC has had an 'accredited investor' rule for 10 years. This
exempts securities products for sophisticated investors from the usual
disclosure and reporting requirements. The harmonisation of rules is
particularly relevant to managed futures funds because, while using the
futures markets, they are packaged as securities and must be registered with
the SEC as well.
While harmonisation makes sense from the regulatory point of view, industry
leaders say that the proposed rule 4.7 does not go far enough toward that
goal.
Mr Robert Easton, president of Commodities Corp, which has about Dollars 1bn
under management, says the proposed rule 'is an important first step'. But,
like others in the industry, he contends that the CFTC's standards for
determining who is a 'qualified eligible participant,' or QEP, are too high.
For example, instead of using the SEC's assets tests of accredited
investors, the CFTC has doubled or quintupled the standards. For
institutional clients, the CFTC has proposed they must have Dollars 10m in
assets, twice the Dollars 5m SEC standard. In the case of individuals, the
CFTC has set the assets test at a net worth of Dollars 5m, or Dollars 1m in
margin deposits or option premiums for commodities trading. The SEC only
requires an individual net worth of Dollars 1m.
Mr David Yeres, a commodities attorney with Baer, Marks &amp; Upham in New York,
said: 'We have long experience with the securities scheme and it has worked.
It seems counter-productive to arbitrarily move the goal-posts.'
The industry is happy that at least some relief is on the way. Some pool
operators have been given temporary exemptions under the terms of the
proposed version of 4.7, pending final approval of the rule.
The industry is pleased overall with the CFTC's recent efforts at regulatory
reform. For example, the commission has proposed an increase in speculative
position limits for an array of commodities, including some agricultural
contracts. It has developed a new two-part disclosure document to simplify
the process for pool operators.
An 18-page summary has been culled from some 200 pages of the document and
this is followed by a longer, more detailed portion for optional reading.
In recent months, it has allowed exchanges to use average pricing for big
orders that have been executed at multiple prices, a helpful step for
managed futures funds.
While in line with the Bush administration's new anti-regulatory strategy,
the CFTC's moves have been prompted as well by the steady slide of world
market share for US futures markets and the tide of money that has rolled
into offshore managed futures funds.
The CFTC hopes that streamlining its regulatory scheme can help the US
futures industry to regain some lost ground.

LEGO, the Danish toy construction kit group, increased group sales in 1991
by 14 per cent to DKr4.47bn (Dollars 703m) and pre-tax profits by 15.6 per
cent to DKr517m.
The family-owned group expressed disappointment at the result saying that
sales rose rather less than expected. Sales to retailers rose faster than
sales by retailers to customers, resulting in some build-up of retailers'
stocks.
The published figures cover only 14 of the 36 companies and 4,100 of the
7,550 employees in the worldwide Lego organisation, which has four parent
companies, two in Denmark and two in Switzerland.
Group equity capital increased to DKr1.95bn from DKr1.62bn and assets to
DKr3.58bn from DKr3.21bn.

listing rule
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange of Hong Kong has approved changes to its secondary
listing regulations, enabling the Jardine Matheson group to proceed with
proposals to take up a primary listing in London while retaining a secondary
listing in Hong Kong.
Under the new secondary listing rules, Hong Kong companies will be permitted
to be regulated by a recognised stock exchange, while retaining listing
status in Hong Kong. So far, only London has been recognised.
Mr Nigel Rich, Jardine Matheson managing director, welcomed the changes. The
proposals will be put before Jardine shareholders at the company's annual
general meeting next month and could be implemented three months later.
Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land, Jardine Strategic and Mandarin Oriental, members
of the group, will follow suit.
The move is conditional on the signing of a written agreement between the
London and Hong Kong exchanges governing their respective roles. However,
the regulations are broadly similar and an understanding has been reached.
The new rules require companies to have 'an adequate nexus' with the primary
market; this is broadly defined by having more than 10 per cent of its
worldwide share turnover in the proposed primary market during the year
prior to application for secondary listing.
Following the rule change in Hong Kong, companies will be able to withdraw
their secondary listings after a 90-day notice period, assuming 20 per cent
of worldwide trading volume took place in the primary market during the
previous year. If less, the notice period is extended to 180 days.

<TEXT>
FOKUS Bank, Norway's third biggest bank, yesterday reported a reduction in
first quarter pre-tax losses to NKr137.6m (Dollars 21.4m) from NKr441.7m,
helped by lower operating costs, a fall in credit losses and a steady level
of earnings.
'The first-quarter result shows clear positive signs. I will specially focus
on the point that the bank has been able to maintain earnings in spite of
the large, planned reduction in loans which has taken place,' said Mr Leif
Klevan, managing director.
Net interest income fell by NKr76.6m to NKr286.1m as other operating income
rose to NKr150.9m from Nkr149.4m. Fokus cut operating costs by NKr67m to
NKr329.4m, helped by a reduction of 317 employees since the end of 1991.
Most significant is a reduction in first-quarter credit losses to NKr246.9m
from NKr451.2m in last year's comparative period.
Fokus said the influx of non-performing loans had also been stemmed.
The bank stressed that finding a permanent solution to its equity problem
remained a high priority.
At the end of last month, the guarantee fund of the commercial banks
injected NKr1.83bn in preference capital into the bank to help cover last
year's swollen losses.
Last year, Fokus was de-listed from the Oslo bourse and taken over by the
state in a NKr2.150bn rescue package after its share capital was wiped out
by large losses.

ARCHER DANIELS Midland, the US agri-business group, has taken another step
towards integration of North America's food processing industry by agreeing
to buy Canada's biggest flour miller.
ADM, which has made several acquisitions in Canada over the past year, will
pay an undisclosed sum for Ogilvie Mills of Montreal. The seller is John
Labatt, the Canadian food processing group.
Ogilvie has annual revenues of about CDollars 275m (USDollars 231m) with
mills in Quebec, Alberta and Ontario. The company is also one of the world's
largest producers of wheat starch and gluten.
Canada's bureau for competition policy turned down a proposal last year to
merge Ogilvie with the milling interests of Maple Leaf Foods, controlled by
Hillsdown Holdings of the UK. The two Canadian companies had argued that the
merger was necessary to compete against the big US millers. But the
government was concerned about the stranglehold which the combined company
would have on the domestic market.
Maple Leaf subsequently turned to a leading US miller to protect its
flour-milling business. It recently formed a joint milling venture with
ConAgra of Nebraska.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Refitted Bond flagship nears
relaunch - Kevin Brown examines the new-look, slimmed-down, renamed Southern
Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond Corporation Holdings, Mr Alan Bond's quoted flagship, is likely to be
relaunched later this year following approval from the Australian Securities
Commission (ASC) for a change of name to Southern Equities.
The company's impending re-emergence contrasts starkly with the fate of Mr
Bond, the best known of Australia's 1980s entrepreneurs, who was declared
bankrupt last month after losing a year-long court battle.
Mr Peter Lucas, chairman of Bond Corp from September 1990 until last month,
says Southern Equities will bear little resemblance to Mr Bond's company.
'We have sold many of the assets to repay debts, and the group is obviously
much smaller than it was, but the really important thing is that despite all
the things that happened, we are still here,' he says.
'Sure, it is with the good grace of our creditors, but nevertheless we were
able to convince them that this was the best way forward. That is very
different to what happened to some of the other entrepreneurial groups.'
Mr Lucas, a Sydney lawyer, resigned last month after steering the group
through the traumatic 18 months since Mr Bond quit under pressure from
shareholders and creditors.
Mr Lucas's resignation clears the way for a new management team to take over
after the completion of a financial reconstruction which will transfer 90
per cent of the company's equity to creditors and bondholders.
The distribution of shares is expected to take place as soon as the
administrators of the company's scheme of arrangement finish investigating
claims from creditors, probably by the end of June.
The principal shareholder is expected to be Australian Consolidated
Investments (Acil), formerly Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources,
which will emerge with 11 per cent of the expanded equity. Mr Bond's
shareholding will fall from 52 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
Shortly after the redistribution, the company will be renamed and its
ADollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.43bn) debt burden will be written off in return
for a payment of ADollars 190m to creditors - an effective payout of 10
cents in the dollar.
Mr Lucas, who remains a consultant to Bond Corp and a member of the
management committee which has run the company for the last year, says
completion of the reconstruction will be the trigger for a fresh start,
following the disposal of much of the group's former ADollars 10bn in
assets.
The disposals included Bond Media, the group's television and radio arm
which was sold to Mr Kerry Packer, and Bond Brewing, once Australia's
biggest brewer, which is now controlled by Lion Nathan of New Zealand.
The value of the group's remaining assets will remain unclear until the
1991/92 accounts are published, probably in the second half of the year. But
its main assets are:
A 1.5 per cent shareholding in BSkyB, the UK satellite television business,
and convertible loan stock worth Pounds 350m (USDollars 619m). The
shareholding is mortgaged, but Bond Corp says it hopes for some return as
BSkyB moves into profit.
A 5.3 per cent stake in G. Heileman, the US brewery once owned by Bond Corp,
which was placed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being unable
to service its debts.
About ADollars 25m in cash, mostly held by Bond Corp subsidiaries, which the
group is unable to access until the redistribution of shares has taken
place.
Land in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, some of which
could be sub-divided for property development. The group also retains small
investments in a handful of public companies.
Potential tax losses of several hundred millions of dollars as a result of
its ADollars 2.2bn loss in 1990, although it is unclear how the losses will
be treated by the taxation office.
A ADollars 500m claim for damages against the Western Australian government
and two local politicians over a failed attempt to establish a petrochemical
industry in the state.
Mr Lucas says Bond Corp remains interested in the petrochemical project,
which collapsed in September 1989 when the state government withdrew its
support following local criticism of the deal.
Bond Corp, which paid ADollars 400m to buy Petrochemical Industries (Picl)
from the Western Australian entrepreneurs Mr Laurie Connell and Mr Dallas
Dempster, claims the government acted in bad faith.
However, Mr Lucas says the group believes the project remains viable, and
wants to help the state tap the strong demand expected to develop in Asia
for the caustic soda, ethylene di-chloride and PVC the plant would produce.
'I believe Australia has got a window of opportunity in the next five years
to get this thing up and away. Sooner or later, industrial expansion in
China, Korea and Indonesia will create a huge demand for these products,' Mr
Lucas says.
'Whether Bond Corporation Holdings could be involved would depend on the
Western Australian government and the other joint venture partners. But our
discussions with potential investors indicate it could be viable.'
Mr Lucas says Bond Corp has substantial expertise which could be made
available to the Western Australian government, together with 'the capacity
to influence the potential participants'.
The state government is also believed to be considering a revival of the
project, but is unlikely to want Bond Corp to play any part unless an
out-of-court settlement of the damages claim can be reached.
Both sides deny suggestions a settlement is being prepared. Mr Lucas says
Bond Corp is 'open to compromise, but will not retire without proper
compensation'.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics to sell
missiles unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the second largest Pentagon contractor, aims to sell off
businesses which contribute about one quarter of its revenues - including
its large missiles operation - in a radical plan to cope with the shrinking
defence market.
It is in the final phase of negotiating the sale of the missiles business,
and could announce a deal soon, Mr William Anders, the chairman, said.
Mr Anders, who has been sharply reducing the size of the company since he
took over as chairman in 1991, told the annual meeting that General Dynamics
would adapt to the 'new realities' of the defence market by concentrating on
four core areas: tactical aircraft, nuclear submarines, armoured vehicles
and space launch systems.
It recently sold its Cessna business aircraft subsidiary to Textron, and has
adopted a 'plan of contraction' which involves selling other non-core
businesses accounting for some Dollars 2.3bn of the group's Dollars 8.7bn of
annual revenues.
The list is headed by the missiles operation, which had sales last year of
Dollars 1.3bn and consists of an air defence systems division, which makes
tactical products such as the Stinger and Standard missiles; and a section
of the group's Convair subsidiary, which makes Tomahawk sea-launched cruise
missiles, used during the Gulf war.
Mr Anders said that the missiles business had been seriously considered as a
potential core business. However, it could not become the leader in a field
which included nearly a dozen firms in the US alone.
Other parts of the group up for sale include the remainder of Convair, which
makes fuselages for the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 commercial aircraft; the
electronics division, which is a leading producer of avionics test
equipment; and a materials division which produces aggregates, concrete,
lime and coal.
Mr Anders' strategy is radically different from that of most defence
contractors, which have reacted to the shrinking Pentagon budget by trying
to diversify into non-defence areas. He said the benefits of diversification
were 'largely illusory'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOMENTUM Life, South Africa's fifth largest life insurance company, and Rand
Merchant Bank (RMB), one of the three main merchant banks, have joined
forces to create an independent financial services group.
The deal will create a group with assets of over R10bn (Dollars 3.57bn) and
a market value of about R750m. It will be independent of all the main large
life offices and conglomerates which dominate the South African financial
services sector.
Ultimate control will rest with the directors and management of the RMB
group who control RMB Holdings, parent company of RMB.
The deal brings together a relatively young life office - Momentum is 25
years old - that has grown mainly by acquisition, and a merchant bank
renowned for its aggression in the market.
The tie-up arises out of the recent merger between the two banks Absa and
Bankorp, announced in January. One of the consequences of the deal was that
Sankorp, the industrial arm of the Sanlam insurance group, was to buy
control of Momentum from Absa and Rembrandt, the tobacco group, who between
them held 59 per cent of the shares.
Momentum management, however, was given the option of choosing an
alternative partner, outside the life assurance industry, and they chose
RMB.
The deal is in two parts. RMBH will pay R180m - 41m Momentum ordinary shares
at R4.40 per share - to acquire the 58.7 per cent of Momentum held by Absa
and Rembrandt. Momentum will then pay R385.6m to buy RMB, satisfied by the
payment of R154.2m cash and R52.6m Momentum ordinary shares.
RMBH will hold 76.4 per cent of Momentum which will hold 100 per cent of
RMB. Momentum will remain a listed company and RMBH will be listed in the
later in the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAAB Automobile, the car company jointly owned by General Motors and the
Swedish group Saab-Scania, yesterday announced losses of SKr293m (Dollars
49.8m) for the first quarter of the year. This was a 69 per cent improvement
on the SKr953m deficit in the first three months of 1991, but it was a
larger loss than the SKr134m sustained in the fourth quarter of last year.
Sales revenue rose to SKr3.902bn, compared with a figure of SKr3.365bn for
the same period of last year.
The company said that the results reflected the 'significant restructuring'
which had taken place in Saab's automotive operations over the past two
years, but it offered no forecast for the year.
Under the direction of Mr David Herman, the company's American chief
executive, Saab has gone through a tough period of rationalisation, which is
expected to cut the company's payroll by a third over three years.
With the help of a SKr5.5bn cash injection from its joint owners, the
company will be launching new models starting next year with a replacement
for the Saab 900.
Saab's volume sales in Europe have actually risen by 10 per cent to 8,500
during the first quarter of the year, with a doubling in sales to Italy.
However, there was a decline in sales in the US to 5,626 cars, from 6,581 a
year earlier.
'The situation in most of our markets is promising, and we are definitely
getting on to the shopping list of more and more prospects who are in the
market for premium brand cars,' said Mr Hans Halbach, executive
vice-president.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH start-up costs for Mannesmann's new venture in mobile telephones and
weak demand for its traditional plant and engineering products reduced the
German engineering and technology group's operating profits by more than a
third last year.
The expected downturn was confirmed yesterday at a supervisory board meeting
in Dusseldorf, which also agreed to recommend payment of an unchanged DM9
dividend at the annual meeting on July 3.
While sales rose 1 per cent to DM24.3bn (Dollars 14.9bn), operating profits
slumped from DM1bn to DM625m, and the group's surplus fell 43 per cent from
DM464m to DM263m.
The group, which has been largely restructured from an old-style steel and
engineering specialist, has diversified extensively, particularly into motor
components.
This division, which has grown rapidly to become the group's second biggest
core business after plant and engineering, has been especially hard-hit by
falling demand in the domestic market and persistent weakness in overseas
orders for new cars.
While the group's new D2 cellular telephones business is due for launch in
the summer, there is some uncertainty over its initial prospects because of
economic stagnation in Germany.
In spite of the continuing problems of recession abroad and stagnation at
home, Mr Werner Dieter, chairman, said recently that he was 'not
pessimistic' about prospects for this year. He expected sales on a
like-for-like basis to match those in 1991, and that new purchases,
including VDO and Boge in components, would bring in an additional DM4bn
turnover.
In the first two months of the year order intake was about 36 per cent up on
the same period in 1991. Turnover had been 29 per cent higher, at DM3.8bn,
Mr Dieter said.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Vienna airport in Sch1.8bn
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIENNA International Airport (VIA) will join the British Airports Authority
and become the second airport group to seek a public flotation when it
launches an issue early next month.
The timing of the issue coincides with the rapid expansion of traffic at
Vienna airport following the collapse of the Berlin wall in 1989, the
opening-up of eastern Europe and the completion of a new terminal in 1991.
Since 1987, passenger volume has increased more than 10 per cent each year,
with the exception of 1991, when the Gulf war and the civil war in
neighbouring Yugoslavia slowed growth. VIA is now handling about 6m
passengers a year. The two runways have an annual capacity for 20m
passengers.
The offering of between 5.3m and 5.5m shares - representing about 28 per
cent of VIA's enlarged capital - is part of a long-term strategy aimed at
making the airport a key transit point for passengers and freight between
eastern and western Europe.
VIA is owned by three shareholders: the republic of Austria (50 per cent),
the province of Lower Austria (25 per cent) and the city of Vienna (25 per
cent). It ranks 24th in Europe in overall passenger numbers.
The issue is expected to raise Sch1.8bn (Pounds 90m). The bearer shares will
have a nominal value of Sch100 each, and are expected to be priced between
Sch320 and Sch360. They will be traded on the Vienna stock exchange after
the subscription period closes on June 5. The aggregate nominal value will
total between Sch530m and Sch550m.
A third of the shares will be placed on the international market, and
two-thirds of the shares will be earmarked for the domestic market, of which
about 10 per cent will be sold to VIA's employees at a discount.
Bank Austria and SG Warburg Securities are leading the issue.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, said yesterday that it was optimistic
about the long-term prospects of consumer electronics, its single biggest
activity, in spite of the set-backs suffered in the sector in 1991 and early
1992.
Mr Jan Timmer, president, said the company intended to continue pursuing its
strategy of gradually increasing its role in the 'software' side of consumer
electronics - music, films, video rentals and other forms of entertainment -
to complement its presence in the world market for televisions, compact disc
players and video-cassette recorders.
He also said that Philips currently had no plans for a share issue to
finance future investments. Instead, it would continue to seek ways to run
its businesses at a lower cost level.
Speaking at the Philips shareholders' meeting, Mr Timmer acknowledged that
serious problems in consumer electronics had masked the overall progress
which the company had made in returning to lasting profitability. He said
that the difficulties in consumer electronics would eventually come to an
end, enabling Philips to reap the full benefits of the restructuring and
cost-cutting programmes launched in 1990. However he was unable to say when
the market would begin to recover.
'The only big set-back (in 1991) was in consumer electronics, and the first
quarter (of 1992) did not show an improvement,' he said.
Mr Timmer conceded rescue operations at Super Club, Philips' loss-making, 51
per cent-owned, Belgian-based video-rental chain, had brought unforeseen
problems for the group. He said Philips would press ahead with attempts to
restructure Super Club's finances and to buy out minority shareholders.
Talks with minority shareholders, bankers and bondholders had entered a
'decisive' stage, he added.
Earlier this week, Philips reported a 29 per cent increase in first-quarter
net profit in spite of the fact that its consumer electronics business
slipped into the red, due to fierce competition on the global consumer
market. In 1991, Philips returned to a full-year net profit of Fl 1.2bn
(Dollars 650m) from a record loss of Fl 4.24bn the year before, when the
company took restructuring provisions of Fl 4.6bn.

THE FRENCH government will go ahead with a FFr2bn (Dollars 350m) injection
of fresh capital for Bull, the loss-making state-owned computer maker,
despite the fact the European Commission has not given its agreement.
Paris announced yesterday that Bull would as expected proceed with its
equity increase, which comes on top of a FFr2bn injection of fresh capital
from the government last year, also being scrutinised by the Commission.
A Bull spokesman said the Commission's inquiry did not legally stop it from
going ahead. The French government has complained of the slowness of the
Commission's inquiry, which opened last July.
Just over three quarters of the money will come directly from the
government, in proportion to its 75.8 per cent ownership of Bull. The new
shares will also be subscribed by France Telecom, owner of 17 per cent, and
NEC, the Japanese electronics company which holds 4.5 per cent.
Last month, Bull announced a FFr3.3bn loss for 1991, following a record
FFr6.8bn deficit in the previous year.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Meissen thrives in new Germany -
The world-famous porcelain company has made a smooth adjustment to the free
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Meissen, the world famous porcelain company, is experiencing what most other
east German companies can only dream of in the economic turmoil caused by
reunification - a new lease of life.
Based in the pretty but dilapidated Saxon town of the same name, its sales
have risen sharply; it has been able to make its high-priced products even
more expensive; and it has absorbed the steep rise in wages to levels near
those in west Germany without a crisis or the need for subsidies.
Along with other east German companies, Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur
Meissen - to give the company its full and imposing name - has had to make
some important adjustments to life in the free market. 'Everything has
happened in such a short time,' says Mr Hannes Walter, managing director.
However, compared with most companies in the five new east German states,
Meissen started from a position of relative strength. For one thing, its
products have always been in demand in the west. Its biggest foreign market
is Japan, accounting for 10 per cent of turnover. For another, it had a
certain amount of freedom within the rigid East German system as a valuable
earner of foreign exchange.
There is no doubt that Mr Walter, 48, greatly prefers doing business without
the old constraints. In spite of its status as a showcase company under the
old regime, the company had to remit most of its profits to the East German
government, a policy that deprived the company of investment funds and kept
the historic town of Meissen short of local tax revenues.
Today, the town is being smartened up, though patchily. The company is also
refurbishing its impressive headquarters, not least to cater to the hordes
of tourists who visit. In Easter week, as many as 12,000 people visited the
company to see the impressive museum, housing porcelain objects and
tableware covering the 282 years of its history.
Deep wallets are needed to buy Meissen products, and Mr Walter forecasts
that people will need to dig even deeper. Since 1989, prices have risen by
around 30 per cent and Meissen intends to keep raising them by 10 per cent
or more a year. 'We think we are still good value at these price levels,' he
says.
Demand for Meissen figures, tableware and other items shows no signs of
abating. This year, Mr Walter expects turnover to exceed DM90m (Dollars 55m)
after DM75m last year and DM50m in 1990. Prices of a Meissen coffee service
start at DM3,000 and go up to DM60,000 or more for those with elaborate
patterns.
For this year's 175th anniversary of its vine-leaf design, it is producing
the same number of special coffee services at a price of around DM9,000. It
expects to have no trouble selling these, just as the 150 traditional
figures of a wandering map-seller, sold to commemorate Saxony's re-creation
as a separate state, were quickly snapped up at DM5,000 each.
Saxony, whose capital is in nearby Dresden, is the sole owner of Meissen as
it was before the formation of East Germany. To Mr Walter, the return to the
Saxon fold is the most important thing that has happened to the company
since unification. 'We have to earn our own keep as well as helping to
continue the state's cultural heritage'.
Meissen was established in 1710 under the rule of Augustus the Strong and
has played an important role in Saxony's cultural and commercial life. It is
also an important employer. Today, its workforce, including 170 apprentices,
totals 1,680 people compared with around 1,800 two years ago. Of these, 700
are artists with the years of training and experience needed to produce the
delicate Meissen patterns.
Before the coming of the D-Mark and German unity, a painter earned only
around 1,200 east marks a month, though top artists could earn up to 2,000
marks. The average wage is now nearly DM3,000; this is well over double the
old level with the one-for-one exchange rate used for wage conversions under
currency union, but much more if based on the east mark's previous low
market rate.
Since labour makes up nearly 80 per cent of Meissen's costs, such a steep
climb in wages is undoubtedly a burden. It means profits are minimal after
investments of around DM8m a year to make long-neglected repairs and to
improve kilns and other facilities - since most work is done by hand, the
scope for modernisation is limited. Mr Walter declines to forecast when
profits will reach acceptable levels or state what these might be. He is
aware that Meissen's wages must reach west German levels if it is to keep
its best employees; they are now at 70 per cent and parity will be reached
in two years' time.
He is also encouraged by the fact that orders stretch two years ahead.
Exports, representing about a quarter of sales, rose by 25 per cent in 1991.
'That,' says Mr Walter proudly, 'puts us almost alone among east German
companies'.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cold turkey as Bernard Matthews warns on
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERNARD Matthews, the Norfolk-based meat processor, yesterday warned that
profits for the first half of 1992 would be significantly below the same
period of last year.
The shares fell 6p to close at 64p.
'The market for meat and poultry continues to be depressed,' Mr Bernard
Matthews, the chairman who holds 40 per cent of the company's shares, said
at yesterday's annual meeting.
Mr Matthews would not make himself available for comment.
In a statement he said he had nothing more to add to his comments in the
annual report, published on April 2, in which he said the 1991 results 'must
be considered satisfactory after taking into account the economic recession
and the very depressed market for meat and poultry.'
At the preliminary reporting stage Mr Matthews said that the whole bird and
oven ready turkey market had been hit last year by low chicken prices.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 13.2m but the
final dividend of 2.5p and the total distribution of 4.5p for the year were
both maintained.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Administrators appointed at Ward Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARD GROUP, the structural steel and building components combine, yesterday
became the latest company to fall foul of the recession in the construction
industry.
Directors applied to the High Court for an administration order stating that
this would ensure a more advantageous realisation of assets than winding up
the business.
Mr Michael Moore and Mr David Waterhouse of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte have
been appointed as joint administrators.
Ward shares were suspended at 63p on Tuesday. A year ago they were trading
at more than 200p.
In 1990 the company employed more than 2,300 full time workers of which
1,200 were in the UK. That year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.72m on
turnover of Pounds 172.8m.
The group went into the red during the first six months of last year when it
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.48m.
Mr Nigel Forsyth, chief executive, said then that trading conditions in the
UK were the worst in the company's 45 year history.
According to the most recent accounts, for the 1990 year, bank overdraft and
loans totalled Pounds 19.5m compared with shareholders funds of Pounds
28.3m.

<TEXT>
MTM, the troubled speciality chemicals group, is expected to publish its
delayed final year results in the middle of next week. A date will be
finalised today or Monday, writes Paul Abrahams.
The company is also planning to announce the appointment of new merchant
bankers and brokers, following the resignation of Robert Flemings last
month. Four candidates have recently been interviewed for the role of
broker. Smith New Court is understood to have turned down the position
because it already represents Hickson. Mr Ken Schofield, the new chief
executive, is understood to want to split the role of broker and merchant
banker.
The group is also in final stages of negotiation with a candidate for the
role of chairman. Analysts believe the most likely candidate is Dr David
Swallow, who recently resigned as deputy chairman from Hickson. He was
formerly managing director of RTZ chemicals and worked closely with Mr
Schofield when he was Hickson's chief executive.
Analysts fear that when MTM's results are announced its debts may be as high
as Pounds 100m rather than the figure of Pounds 70m previously estimated.

However, it had risen to 43.1p by April 30 reflecting higher equity values

Higher interest charges left Continuous Stationery, the printer of business
forms and stationery, with a 9 per cent profits decline in the year to April
3.
After interest payable up from Pounds 155,000 to Pounds 293,000, pre-tax
profits fell from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.14m.
Directors said that in the light of the announcement in February of a
possible management buy-out, the results had been published at the earliest
opportunity.
The management team was still in discussions with potential financiers with
a view to making an offer, the company said, but the committee of
independent directors had yet to receive a definitive proposal.
The Prontaprint division showed a marginal advance from Pounds 1.18m to
Pounds 1.2m, but profits from the business forms division slipped by Pounds
213,000 to Pounds 537,000.
Bank debt grew to Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 1.92m) and the group has access to a
Pounds 2.5m term loan, of which Pounds 2.25m was drawn at the year-end, as
well as additional working facilities.
Earnings per share declined from 5.13p to 4.18p; the final dividend is cut
to 1.6p (2.8p) making a total of 2.4p (4p).

PRE-TAX LOSSES at Proteus International, the USM-quoted specialist in
computer-aided molecular modelling and rational drug design, almost doubled
from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 2.41m in the year to March 31.
The company also announced a rights issue to raise Pounds 12.2m net 'to
undertake a number of specific, budgeted product development plans'.
Mr Kevin Gilmore, chairman, said that the year had seen a continuation of
the expansion into molecular modelling design facilities and considerable
costs were incurred on business development work. The potential Aids/HIV
prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine was being given further trials with
results still encouraging.
While striving to maintain ownership interest in the core proprietary
products, the formation of joint ventures is being pursued - the first was
with Genelabs Technologies of the US in relation to potential DNA-binding
compounds.
Turnover was reduced to Pounds 3,000 (Pounds 7,000) and losses per share
were 11.05p (5.92p).
The rights, underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities, is on a 1-for-5
basis at 280p per share.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec advances 10% to Pounds 9.06m -
Environmental fashion in US gives a leg-up to sports shoe group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENVIRONMENTAL look helped propel Hi-Tec Sports, the designer and
distributor of sports shoes and leisure wear, to pre-tax profits of Pounds
9.06m, a rise of 10 per cent, for the year to February 2.
Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, said the trend in US sports shoes was
benefiting the group, which supplies a leading range of street hiking boots.
'They are walking around looking very green, as if they had just come off
the nature trail,' he said. 'That has served us very well in the US.'
Trading in the UK remained difficult, he said, citing the performance of
Sears, one of the group's main customers. However, the group was optimistic
and had 'budgeted for a healthy second half'.
Mr van Wezel said the programme of widening the geographical spread had
borne fruit, with turnover 7 per cent higher at Pounds 127.8m. 'The bad news
from the UK was very much compensated by good news from North America,' he
said.
Operating profits in North America rose 53 per cent to Pounds 1.9m, while
sales advanced 42 per cent to Pounds 22.6m.
Trading in the UK suffered as Reebok and Nike dumped excess stock at lower
prices. 'But we weathered the storm,' he said, 'and they cannot go on like
that forever.' Sales in the UK fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 60.6m, while
profits dropped almost 12 per cent to Pounds 6.9m. Mr Derek Watson, finance
director, said that operational margins had been held at about 11 per cent.
Bad Boys, the group's leisurewear division in continental Europe, and the
newly acquired Labels business performed satisfactorily. Bad Boys increased
profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.9m on sales up 35 per cent at Pounds
19.1m.
The Pounds 10.3m rights issue in January brought debt down to Pounds 9.9m,
reducing gearing from 79 per cent to 28 per cent.
The final dividend is raised to 3.85p, for a total of 5.5p (5p). Earnings
per share rose from 14.75p to 16.07p.
COMMENT
Hi-Tec carved itself a neat little niche in the middle-price sports shoe
market, just in time to perform rather well through recession. Although it
is tough in the UK at the moment, the effects of dumping by the big boys are
expected to have been overcome by the second half. Assuming that sportswear
remains fashionable, and that one believes research showing a global sports
shoe market worth Pounds 9bn by 1995, then Hi-Tec looks well placed. The
rights issue has left the group poised to expand in the fragmented
continental market, and its brand name is about to get a pan-European boost
from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. An acquisition is possible in the medium-term as it
aims to get the clothing side up to about 35 per cent of turnover. Forecasts
are for Pounds 11.2m pre-tax. The prospective p/e of about 11 leaves the
shares looking good value.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: CRS sees little sign of any significant
high street recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CO-OPERATIVE Retail Services, the largest retailing society in Europe,
lifted sales last year but warned there was no evidence of recovery on the
high street.
Mr Harry Moore, chief executive, said: 'We have seen no sign of any
significant improvement since the election and believe the climb out of
recession will be very gentle indeed.'
CRS reported a surplus before distribution of Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 30.6m) in
the year to January 25. Turnover increased 9.2 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn. Net
sales, which take account of VAT, were 8.2 per cent higher at Pounds 1.39bn.
Mr Moore said the results were due to higher margins and contained costs.
Trading margins improved from 3.5 per cent to 3.7 per cent helped by an
improved mix of foods sold, but are still well below those achieved by
retailing rivals.
Food sales, which include the Leo's, Stop &amp; Shop and Pioneer chains,
increased 9.8 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn. Non-food sales, covering the Living
department stores, funeral and dairy services, rose 5.1 per cent to Pounds
200m.
Interest costs increased to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 14.3m) on net borrowings of
Pounds 164m (Pounds 130.4m) taken out to finance expansion and new retailing
technology. Gearing rose to 58 per cent (51 per cent) but will fall to 34
per cent after the sale of the dairy division to MD Foods, expected to be
completed 'within weeks'.
There was an operating surplus of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 19.9m). Net
exceptional charges of Pounds 638,000 (exceptional profit Pounds 6.22m)
included Pounds 5.61m in redundancy and re-organisation costs from bringing
distribution into three central warehouses.
The exceptionals meant a reduced surplus before tax of Pounds 21.6m (Pounds
26.1m). The retained surplus was Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 22.6m).

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 14m acquisition planned to revive
Venture Plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENTURE Plant Group, the USM-quoted plant hire company that fell into losses
in 1990, is being resuscitated via the Pounds 13.7m acquisition of National
Plant and Transport's materials handling division.
To fund the acquisition and relieve debt, Pounds 15.5m is being raised in a
placing and 1-for-1 rights issue, priced at 100p. The existing shares,
suspended at 8 1/2 p on April 21, will first be consolidated on a 10-for-1
basis.
Venture Plant will be renamed Barcom, as suggested by a secretary called
Barbara, and will move to the main market.
It will have 18.6m shares and the Meeks family, vendors of the NPT business,
will control 10 per cent.
Mr Dick Cameron, joint chief executive, explained that he and his partner Mr
Brian Thompson had left Blackwood Hodge, the international construction
equipment distributor, early last year, a few months after it was taken over
by BM Group.
In September, institutional investors at Venture Plant invited them to turn
the company round. As a management buy-out from Tilbury in 1987, Venture
Plant had increased pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.58m in the year to September
1989; it was floated in December 1988.
But it lost more than Pounds 1.1m in 1989-90 and last year the pre-tax
deficit grew to Pounds 5.1m. This included more than Pounds 2m provisions as
the new management closed eight of the 11 depots and cut the workforce from
165 to 52.
Mr Cameron said borrowings had been reduced from Pounds 8m early last year
to Pounds 2m last month. After the NPT purchase, the group's pro forma net
assets would be Pounds 18.5m and there would be no net debt.
Mr Thompson said NPT supplied and operated the plant for handling coal at 26
collieries in Nottinghamshire and South Wales. British Coal accounted for 88
per cent of the business. Although privatisation should increase
opportunities, the coal business was expected to be less than 50 per cent in
three to five years' time.
Other customers for the group's plant management services included
electricity and construction companies.
The fleet comprised 600 pieces of equipment, many of which were leased
rather than owned, and the utilisation rate was 98 per cent.
In the year to March 1991, the NPT division made Pounds 2.56m operating
profit on turnover of Pounds 20m. Venture Plant's annualised turnover was
about Pounds 3m, with profit of Pounds 250,000.
Mr David Meeks, managing director of the NPT business, is joining the Barcom
board. Mr John Pinckard, who is also on the boards of Bimec Industries, Avon
Rubber and Hadleigh Industries, will become non-executive chairman.
The share issue is underwritten by Rea Brothers and Panmure Gordon is the
broker.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman deal with German competitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, one of the UK's three publicly-quoted machine tool
builders, has become the sole UK agent for a wide range of grinding machines
made by Overbeck, a German competitor.
An agreement signed this week at the Mach '92 machine tool exhibition in
Birmingham opens the way to potential future collaboration on development
work in grinding machines, the two companies said.
J&amp;S said many customers in manufacturing were already users of machines from
both companies and the agreement provides a single source supplier for most
grinding requirements. Overbeck's internal grinding machine range will
complement J&amp;S' own range of cylindrical and surface grinders.
Cross-border selling deals are becoming increasingly common in the European
machine tool industry but it is rare for companies to bury old rivalries and
work together on machine development.
J&amp;S and Overbeck see the agreement as a first step which could lead to
eventual co-operation on projects such as the complex control systems needed
for modern grinding. The companies plan, in any case, frequent exchanges of
technical information.
Mr Len Weaver, J&amp;S chairman, said the deal had taken only two months to
negotiate. The two companies were very similar in their commitment to
quality and product development.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON

<TEXT>
FOR A company whose latest balance sheet shows negative net worth of Dollars
27m (Pounds 15.2m) and which has abandoned the main purpose for which it was
founded, the recent annual meeting of Rodime was a surprisingly cheerful
affair.
Rodime was a disk drive manufacturer which was once regarded as a rare
example of a successful UK high technology start-up company. Founded by some
Scots and an American who spun out of a US multinational in Scotland in
1980, it produced the world's first 3 1/2 -inch hard disk drive, now
standard equipment on most personal computers, from a plant in Glenrothes,
Fife.
Last August, however, it finally gave up the struggle to continue
manufacturing and commenced what Mr Peter Bailey, the English-born but
US-based electronics industry specialist who came in to rescue Rodime in
1989, calls 'an orderly build-down' of the company.
The crunch came after the last-minute failure to conclude a manufacturing
joint venture with a Taiwanese company, which was unable to come up with the
necessary Dollars 90m to finance the project. By that time a series of
disasters had exhausted Rodime's working capital. Its shares, once a star of
the US over-the-counter market, were suspended on the London Stock Exchange
at 4p.
Yet the AGM, held in a Glasgow solicitor's office, was far from gloomy
because the directors believe there is a good chance that Rodime will
eventually return to solvency as it pursues companies which have infringed
its patents, and as it issues new licences. It has already recovered
virtually all its recoverable assets, apart from the sale (at a likely loss)
of a building in Boca Raton, Florida.
In the year to September 30 Rodime lost Dollars 24.3m on turnover that had
shrunk to only Dollars 12.4m, taking account of provisions and interest. In
the balance sheet the company had net liabilities of Dollars 26.9m. That
included Dollars 37.8m owed to Bank of Scotland (which also owns 18.4 per
cent of almost worthless equity of the company), and Dollars 7.9m owed to
other creditors. Debtors, including amounts recoverable from subsidiaries,
totalled Dollars 18.8m.
Since then Rodime has sold its manufacturing operations in Singapore, which
it had put into receivership, to Myrica, a Taiwanese company, which also
acquired Rodime's engineering development team in Glenrothes. Rodime sold
its disk drive repair company in Scotland to Memec, the electronic servicing
company.
When Mr Bailey came to Rodime he believed it could have been made into a
company with Dollars 1bn turnover (in reality its turnover in its entire
history never exceeded Dollars 120m, yet it operated in Scotland, the US and
Singapore). But even when banks, creditors and investors agreed a rescue
package worth Dollars 68m in 1989, Rodime never had the financial resources
to produce the innovative products its engineers designed.
He admits that if he had carried out more due diligence Rodime would have
taken a restructuring charge twice the size of the Dollars 12m it actually
allowed. But he also acknowledges that if the true value of the inherited
inventory had been known, the rescue might not have gone ahead at all.
However, one decision he took then is paying off. 'We were spending a
fortune on legal fees pursuing International Business Machines for patent
infringement. I decided to continue that action'. This was based on a
favourable 1988 ruling of the US Patent Office.
The pay-off came in late 1990 when IBM paid Rodime Dollars 13m in an
out-of-court settlement. Rodime then went on to pursue other companies,
beginning with Conner Peripherals, the big US disk drive maker, from which
it received a 'material' payment in settlement last May.
'It is very difficult to produce a multi-disk 3 1/2 -inch disk drive without
infringing one or more of our patents,' says Mr Bailey. The patents do not
expire until 2004, and although companies are now moving to smaller disk
drives, Mr Bailey believes the 3 1/2 -inch will be coming out in large
volumes until about 1997.
Since last spring Rodime has reached licensing agreements with companies
including Alps Electric, Fujitsu, Matsushita Electric, Hitachi and Teac of
Japan, and Hewlett-Packard of the US. Rodime is now targeting about 25 other
companies which it claims are infringing its patents, including NEC, Sony
and Toshiba of Japan, and Seagate and Quantum of the US.
Although Rodime is a litigious company it is not currently in litigation
with any company as it pursues amicable settlements. Speed is not
necessarily of the essence any more. 'The longer a company takes to settle,
the longer it will have been infringing our patents and the more it may have
to pay,' says Mr Bailey.
What Rodime, which now employs only five people, will not reveal is how the
balance sheet looks now, but Mr Bailey says that although cash flow is
positive, it is not yet in the black. 'However, I'm confident that the value
of our patents exceeds the level of our debt.'
Although Mr Malcolm McIver, the Glasgow solicitor who became chairman of a
slimmed board earlier this year, warns that the company's new strategy is
'by no means assured of success', Rodime believes it may accumulate positive
net worth next year. This could eventually mean a pay-out to shareholders.
'Our patents were supposed to be the icing on the cake - we never meant to
live off them,' says Mr Bailey. But he is not apologetic about the somewhat
uncreative role that this former pioneer has now adopted. In fact he sees
further possibilities for it.
'There are not many small companies that have beaten IBM,' he says. 'Several
companies have already approached us for advice on how to protect their
intellectual property. There may be business to be done in advising them.'

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Euromoney advances 42% to Pounds 4.62m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROMONEY Publications topped a buoyant set of first-half results with a 23
per cent rise in the interim dividend from 6.5p to 8p.
The magazines publisher recorded advances of 71 per cent in operating
profits to Pounds 3.71m (Pounds 2.17m) and 42 per cent in pre-tax profit to
Pounds 4.62m (Pounds 3.26m). Growth was achieved in all but one activity.
The favourable comparison was aided by the depressing effect of the Gulf war
on the previous first half. The company does not expect this growth rate to
continue in the second half, but does foresee a satisfactory outcome for the
year.
Highlights in the period under review included international financial
publishing, which raised its contribution by 76 per cent from Pounds 1.59m
to Pounds 2.8m, aided by the modest recovery in some financial markets.
Energy publishing jumped to Pounds 375,000 (Pounds 121,000) and event
businesses put in Pounds 710,000 (Pounds 373,000).
The only disappointing area was aviation and leasing publishing which
declined to Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 531,000).
Earnings per share improved from 10.39p to 14.9p.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: PWS shows decline to Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP contraction in the aviation excess of loss market and a fall in US
interest rates were blamed by PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's insurance and
reinsurance broker, for a 33 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.1m
over the six months to March 31.
The decline, from last time's Pounds 3.11m, was struck on the back of net
retained brokerage income of Pounds 8m (Pounds 8.77m) and other operating
income of Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 1.87m).
The contraction on the aviation side led to problems at Fryer Cheasley Light
and it was decided that these operations should cease trading. An
extraordinary item of Pounds 683,000 was carried in association with
incurred and anticipated costs connected to this decision.
Mr Malcolm Pearson, chairman, said that PWS International, which accounts
for more than half group income, had so far experienced a good year in a
volatile market. It was expected that this would continue in the second
half.
He added that the group's reduced reliance on aviation would change its
trading pattern so that it made a small profit rather than a small loss in
the second half.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p on earnings per share of 6.8p
(10.1p).

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BM spins off ten subsidiaries in Pounds 40m
deal with offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Building and Engineering Appliances, which is 75 per cent controlled
by BM Group, is buying 10 building-related subsidiaries from BM for Pounds
40m in shares.
BM, the construction equipment and engineering concern, increased its stake
in BB&amp;EA in March at 355p a share.
It said it would introduce into it first senior managers from its building
products division and then a series of subsidiaries.
The list of companies being sold to BB&amp;EA includes three under the Kass
name, Simplex Piling, Birchwood Concrete Products and Boddis (Old Hill).
One of the areas identified for expansion is the hiring out of small pieces
of plant.
BM is placing a quarter of the 10m BB&amp;EA shares it will receive at 400p each
to bring its holding down to 75 per cent.
Dealings in BB&amp;EA's shares were suspended at 475p.
The near-Pounds 10m realised will be used to reduce debt.
BM's gearing was nearly 45 per cent after the January acquisition of Thomas
Robinson and an accompanying Pounds 60m rights issue.
The building products companies involved in the BB&amp;EA deal made a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 6.38m on turnover of Pounds 45.4m in the year to June 30
1991.
In the six months to December, the corresponding figures were Pounds 2.56m
and Pounds 17.9m, and net assets stood at Pounds 20.5m at the end of the
period.
BM as a whole made an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.3m, up 28 per
cent, on turnover of Pounds 229.3m.
The spinning off of the building products businesses has been likened to the
formative years of BM.
The building group Beazer - now part of Hanson - lent its backing to Mr
Roger Shute, BM's chairman, in the early 1980s.
It introduced him along with its plant sales and engineering activities into
Braham Millar, an ailing listed company, and then gradually reduced its
interest.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: United Uniform ahead at Pounds 3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of tough trading in its fourth quarter, United Uniform Services,
the manufacturer and distributor of uniforms throughout the US, increased
pre-tax profits for 1991 by 28 per cent.
The advance from Pounds 2.66m to Pounds 3.4m was achieved from sales 80 per
cent higher at Pounds 53.7m.
The comparable figures included only a seven months contribution from Horace
Small, one of the largest manufacturers of tailored uniforms in the US.
Following the acquisition in October of Loev Brothers, a supplier of
uniforms in eastern Philadelphia, profits are expected to benefit as Horace
Small increases its share of supplies to Loev from 10 per cent to 35 per
cent.
The total dividend is doubled to 3p via a final of 2p.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: EC reluctant to 'refer back' Hongkong Bank
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is reluctant to refer any big takeovers such as
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's bid for Midland back to national competition
authorities to vet, for fear of undermining its 1990 merger powers for which
it fought so long.
Yesterday's announcement by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Competition
Commissioner, that the Hongkong bid for Midland falls within his
jurisdiction is the result of an arithmetic formula in the EC regulation.
This is far more complicated to calculate for banks than manufacturing
companies.
Essentially, a bank merger must answer three criteria to be vetted by
Brussels:
Ten per cent of joint global assets must total Ecus 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) or
more. The above figure has to be multiplied by the share of each bank's EC
loans and advances as a proportion of global loans and advances. The
resulting figure must amount to Ecus 250m for each bank. This is to show
that the banks do substantial business in the Community.
The 10 per cent of joint global assets has to multiplied by the share of
each bank's home country loans and advances as a proportion of its EC loans
and advances. The resulting figure must show that banks do no more than
two-thirds of their business within one EC state; if they do, the merger is
not considered to be of EC interest.
It is small wonder, therefore, that while the Hongkong bid for Midland was
notified to Brussels on April 23, Sir Leon's officials took until yesterday
to calculate that the bid fell within their jurisdiction. They have, though,
had some practice with banks - having already ruled on, and cleared, three
bank mergers involving two US, two Japanese and two EC banks in a joint
venture in eastern Europe.
At the insistence of Germany, the EC state with the most highly developed
anti-trust law, the 1990 merger regulation allows for a national competition
authority to have a case referred back from Brussels, provided that it would
clearly create or reinforce a dominant position,and that the dominant
position would be entirely within that one state.
Germany has asked for two cases - the links between Varta Bosch, and between
Alcatel and AEG-Kabel - to be returned to it. Brussels has refused both
times.
However, in February Sir Leon did refer back to the UK the Steetley-Tarmac
merger. The rival bid of Redland for Steetley did not come within the EC
remit, and Sir Leon said at the time that in general 'it is much better for
related cases to be dealt with by one regulatory authority if at all
possible.'
The key to the Steetley-Tarmac referral was the Commission's judgment that
the bid would have created a high concentration, but that the market for the
product in question - bricks - was essentially local, even inside the UK. It
seems most unlikely, to EC officials, that such a line of argument can be
made for referring back the Hongkong bid for Midland.

<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE, the second largest building society, yesterday denied that it
was about to sever a two and a half year old agreement to sell Guardian
Royal Exchange life assurance policies because of the poor performance of
GRE with-profits endowment policies.
The tie is not due to end until late 1994. 'There is no change in prospect,'
the society said yesterday.
'We are not conducting any urgent review of our tie with GRE, though like
any other business we do keep a general watch our business relationships,'
Nationwide said.
He declined to comment on reports that top level management changes may be
on the way soon at the society. Nationwide's results for 1991-92 are due to
be announced early next month.
Analysts are forecasting a sharp drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 285m
last year, though sources close to the society say that its performance may
turn out to be better than generally expected.

FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brown presses Heseltine on takeover policy
 -Labour questions whether the MMC's 'competition' approach will be changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heseltine to spell out his policies on mergers and acquisitions increased at
Westminster yesterday, following the announcement that the proposed takeover
of Midland Bank by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank appears to fall within
Brussels' jurisdiction.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on the
president of the board of trade to explain 'exactly what his policies are
for takeovers'. Mr Heseltine 'must tell us what he now believes on takeover
policy and what action he proposes to take with these bids'.
Mr Brown's challenge follows the tabling by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour
frontbench spokeswoman on City and corporate affairs, of four written
questions relating to the battle for Midland and Mr Heseltine's thinking on
takeovers in general.
The questions include whether Mr Heseltine proposes changes to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's present approach in which 'the
implication for competition is the sole criterion taken into consideration'.
Interviewed by the Financial Times earlier this week, Mr Heseltine insisted
that any change in the so-called Tebbit doctrine would require a collective
decision by the cabinet. 'I have inherited a set of (merger) policies; until
and unless any announcements are made, those policies prevail.'
Brussels' indication that the Hongkong Bank bid was likely to fall within
its jurisdiction was meanwhile welcomed by one prominent Conservative
backbencher who described it as 'the right approach'.
Mr Tim Smith, who served as vice-chairman of the Tory backbench finance
committee in the last parliament, said that, since the Hongkong bid did not
involve domestic competition issues, it was a matter for the EC to deal
with.
'As far as the UK market is concerned, Hongkong have made it clear that they
do not propose to make many changes to Midland so there wouldn't be any
impact on competition in the high street,' he said, speaking on BBC Radio 4.
Mr Smith called for the possible Lloyds bid for Midland to be investigated
by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, however.
'We have only got four major clearing banks and I think if you are talking
about one taking the other over and then taking it out completely, you are
definitely reducing competition,' he said.
Mr Smith is understood to have played a leading role in offering Hongkong
and Lloyds an opportunity to meet Conservative backbenchers next week.
Other Tory backbenchers are privately expressing misgivings about the
competitive and employment implications of a marriage between Midland and
Lloyds.
One said yesterday that he found it 'difficult to imagine' that reducing the
number of main clearers to three would improve already inadequate
competition in the domestic corporate banking sector.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Bellway buoyant as sales pick up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELLWAY, the Tyneside-based builder, offered hope to a depressed housing
sector yesterday with the news that its sales had picked up in the few weeks
after the general election.
Mr Alan Robson, Bellway's finance director, said the upturn was apparent
across all of the group's trading regions, although the south of England was
still difficult. 'The present indications are that it is holding and perhaps
even improving slightly,' he said.
Sales were running more than 16 per cent ahead of the same time last year,
he said.
However, the north-east provided the backbone of Bellway's success in the
first half of this year. The group has bucked the trend of UK housebuilders'
results with a 28 per cent rise in trading profits to Pounds 4.1m for the
six months to January 31.
Interest gains of Pounds 1.4m, compared with Pounds 162,000 last time,
helped boost pre-tax profits by 63 per cent to Pounds 5.5m.
In spite of the encouraging results, Bellway maintained the dividend at 4p.
Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said if the latest signs of recovery proved not
to be a false dawn, the dividend would be increased 'at least in line with
inflation'. Earnings per share rose from 4.7p to 7.3p.
Bellway sold 698 homes during the first half, compared with 600 in the same
period last time. Of those sold this year, some 490 were in the north.
Turnover rose from Pounds 44.9m to Pounds 52.4m, which helped margins
advance 10 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
Mr Robson said the proceeds of the Pounds 25m rights issue last year had
been reinvested in land. During the first half Bellway spent about Pounds
20m, throughout the country and a further Pounds 20m in land purchases was
planned.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Sears wary on strength of consumer recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the speciality retailer which embraces Selfridges and a large slice
of the UK's shoe shops, was cautious about the strength of the UK consumer
recovery as it yesterday reported a 45 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 81.2m.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said consumer confidence had plummeted
last year creating the most difficult trading conditions for several
decades. And he warned the past three months had 'not brought any
substantive upturn in consumer spending'.
The company also issued a 'health warning' about levels of future dividends
although it held last year's total - uncovered - dividend at 5.355p.
'This was a year in which we could sensibly pay such a dividend. But looking
forward one has got to remind shareholders that dividends depend on the
profitability and prospects when you come to declare,' Mr Maitland Smith
said.
In the year to January 31, sales slipped 8 per cent to Pounds 1.98bn but
margins were cut by higher costs and discounting by competitors. Profits
slipped from Pounds 121.3m to Pounds 96.3m but were further deflated by an
exceptional charge of Pounds 15.1m. This resulted from a Pounds 30.1m charge
for rationalisation costs which was partly offset by Pounds 17.4m income
from property disposals.
The company's footwear and men's wear businesses were particularly badly
hit. Mr Liam Strong, who took over as chief executive earlier this year,
said it would take a further few years to turn around British Shoe
Corporation but greater efficiencies could be obtained from segmenting its
markets more effectively and buying more aggressively.
Borrowings were cut from Pounds 199m to Pounds 153m.
Sears' footwear division saw trading profits fall from Pounds 22.2m to
Pounds 9.3m. Speciality retailing's contribution slid from Pounds 21.4m to
Pounds 16.2m and Selfridges department store chipped in Pounds 16.2m, down
from Pounds 19.5m.
Profits from Freemans Home Shopping were hit by high investments and fell
from Pounds 32m to Pounds 29.9m.
The property division yielded Pounds 13.6m in rental income and Pounds 6m
from development.
Earnings per share slid from 7.6p to 4.2p although the final dividend was
maintained at 3.83p.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Ericsson falls into SKr363m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ERICSSON, Sweden's leading telecommunications group, announced yesterday
that it suffered a pre-tax loss of SKr363m (Pounds 34.3m) for the first
three months of the year, compared with a profit of SKr1.009bn for the same
period of 1991.
Consolidated net sales fell 11 per cent to SKr9.462bn from SKr10.649bn while
income per share was SKr2.44 compared with SKr2.98 for the first three
months of last year. The company said the main reason for the deterioration
in its financial performance so far this year was the fall in demand in its
main overseas markets combined with its determination to stick to its
long-term technical development programme.
Ericsson forecast that income for 1992 would 'continue to be low' and said
its business outlook for the first half of the year was 'very weak'. The
full impact of the company's cost savings exercise, which cut 1,810 jobs
from its 70,000-strong labour force, will not bring positive results until
the second half of the year, said Ericsson.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, president, said the 22 per cent improvement in order
bookings for the first three months was evidence of the success of the
company's research and development strategy. The value of orders rose to
SKr13.057bn compared with SKr10.729bn for the same period of 1991.
'The sharp increase that has occurred during the two most recent quarters in
orders is the result of specific orders for new systems and products rather
than any change in the business climate,' he said.
Mr Ramqvist told the annual shareholders' meeting that Ericsson's future as
a leading international supplier of telecommunications systems during the
1990s depended on generating earnings so the company could pursue a high
level of development activity and capital expenditure, and ensure a positive
cash flow and dividend payments.
Ericsson reported a sharp fall in net sales revenue from its public
telecommunications area in the first quarter to SKr4.163bn from SKr5.262bn
but it also reported a marked increase in its order bookings.
In its radio communications business, the company reported a substantial
rise in orders for pocket telephones and digital systems in the US and
Europe.

FT  08 MAY 92 / BP dividend uncovered after fall of 80% in first quarter:
Investors relieved as 4.2p payout maintained - Shares down 2p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM disappointed the stock market yesterday with an 80 per
cent decline in its first-quarter profit which is not sufficient to cover
the company's dividend payment.
However, the board decided to keep the dividend unchanged at 4.2p a share,
much to the relief of investors who were concerned that BP might be forced
to cut its payout.
The company reported a drop in its replacement cost profit, which strips out
the effects of stock gains and losses, to Pounds 95m from Pounds 521m in the
same period last year.
Stockholding losses of Pounds 156m led to the company's first ever reported
quarterly loss of Pounds 61m compared with a profit of Pounds 10m in the
1991 quarter.
'Clearly the situation is not a rosy one,' Mr David Simon, deputy chairman
said. 'We are encouraged by a stronger crude price and steady demand, but
there has been no obvious firming in margins.' For this reason, he said the
financial outlook remains 'muted'.
Initially, the stock market marked BP's shares 10p higher in relief that the
company had not trimmed its dividend, but later shares slipped off to close
2p down on the day at 260p.
Industry analysts expressed surprise at the Pounds 544m cash drain during
the period which compared with a cash outflow of Pounds 116m in the same
quarter last year.
Mr Simon pointed out that the company had cut capital expenditure by 15 per
cent this year to trim costs and reduce debt. He said BP had signalled to
its operating divisions that they must make a similar cut in budgets for
next year.
In spite of efforts to keep the debt under control, the company's
debt-to-equity ratio rose to 85 per cent during the quarter from a previous
level of 78 per cent. It is expected to remain at this level for most of the
year.
'We have made a judgment that we are at the turning point in the
recessionary cycle and any change to our dividend policy would be
premature,' Mr Simon said.
BP's exploration and production division reported a slight drop in profits
to Pounds 426m from Pounds 483m which was better than expected given the
fall in crude prices and exploration cutbacks.
But the weak refining market led to a sharp downturn in profits from this
division to Pounds 79m from Pounds 385m.
The profit level was boosted by divestment profits from the disposal of
assets in west Africa and Ireland.
Chemicals were also hard hit by the recession and showed a loss of Pounds
25m compared with a profit of Pounds 54m in the same period last year.
The group reported a loss per share of 1.1 pence compared with a profit of
0.2p last year. Oil production remained steady at 1.5m barrels a day
although Mr Simon said this will drop in the second quarter when North Sea
fields are closed for maintenance.

FT  08 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just 10 years since Sears' annual profits went through Pounds 100m.
They have now done it again in the opposite direction. The cycle aside, the
company has lost its way. The proposition is that its culture and strategy
can now be transformed by the new chief executive, Mr Liam Strong. It would
not do to count on it. The company's problem is not merely the huge waste of
resources tied up in its shoe shops. Selfridges and Freemans, which made up
almost two thirds of last year's profits, are not growing either. If these
problems prove intractable, Mr Strong promises more radical action. But he
gives himself several years.
Meanwhile, the valuation of the shares - down 7 per cent yesterday to 97p -
rests purely on yield and asset backing. It is vulnerable on both counts.
The net asset value per share of 83p is based on property valuations dating
back to 1988. The company now reckons its property values are down 8 per
cent, the retail part down 15 per cent. As for the dividend, the company's
explicit caution about the future is understandable given that the held
payment is less than four fifths covered.
Last year, Sears spent Pounds 66m on fixed assets. It is now paying out
Pounds 81m in dividends. If the directors believe that shareholders' money
is better deployed outside the business, it seems sensible for shareholders
to take the hint.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Its first quarterly net loss aside, BP's results were depressing
confirmation that the group appears bent on maintaining its dividend at the
expense of shrinking itself. The quarterly payout accounted for 40 per cent
of a Pounds 544m net cash outflow before financing. The result was that
gearing rose to 85 per cent and may rise again this quarter.
BP may have been influenced by the big US oil companies, all of which held
their dividends despite a dismal first quarter. Its peculiar problem is that
it entered the downturn with a relatively weak balance sheet which has gone
on deteriorating. A cost-cutting programme should make the group more able
to compete with its peers. But capital spending will fall this year and
next, whole divisions are marked for sale and management is praying for a
recovery in the oil price. Even if that unlikely event occurs, margins will
be slow to respond.
Shareholders are already being offered a payout which is falling in real
terms, so it is scarcely surprising that BP shares have underperformed the
market by a fifth this year. A nominal cut in the dividend would doubtless
hit the shares harder again. But arguably investors would be better served
in the long run by a reduction in the payout to a level which BP's cash flow
can bear. Whether BP can bring itself to bite the bullet is another matter.

FT  08 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK car sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is surely stretching the evidence to conclude that the level of new car
sales in April is concrete evidence of economic recovery. Nevertheless,
combined with an upbeat statement from the motor component manufacturer T&amp;N,
the 9.1 per cent year-on-year increase in vehicle registrations last month
provoked new stirrings among the leading component stocks yesterday.
The fact that the April number was positive after 29 months of dismal
decline is certainly not to be sniffed at. But the caveats are real all the
same. The comparable figure last year was depressed by the introduction of a
higher rate of value added tax, while this time the budget reduction in car
tax and the election result will have provided an immediate boost. Out in
the showrooms, moreover, the general mood remains one of extreme caution as
dealers await the reality of the upturn rather than the promise. There is
hope that the recent half point interest rate cut may help tempt the still
elusive private buyer, though that is tempered by fear that many may now
hang on for the change in registration number prefix in August.
As for T&amp;N, whose shares jumped 8 per cent yesterday, the chairman's
prediction that the recovery should be well established by the end of this
year is fighting talk. The company's achievements in lowering costs and
taking advantage of German competitors' misfortunes to gain market share are
indeed impressive. But it is worth remembering that T&amp;N desperately needs
bigger volumes to justify its appetite for capital spending.

FT  08 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Midland's twin tribunal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The advantage in the battle for Midland seems to have switched to the
Hongkong Bank. It is now almost certain that its bid will come under the
jurisdiction of Brussels, while any bid from Lloyds will be referred to the
UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. With luck, HSBC's bid could run its
full course before a Lloyds offer was even cleared.
Lloyds would thus be free to withdraw on the grounds that its preconditions
had not been met. But it would surely be tempted to stand its ground as a
spoiling tactic, whether or not it believed in its ability to convince the
MMC. Midland's shareholders would then be in a quandary. The Lloyds bid is
not only worth more than HSBC's, it also makes better strategic sense for
both banks. But the final competition policy decision could go either way.
Though Lloyds will be able to muster a strong lobby, the discreet support of
other clearing banks worried about the introduction of fresh capital to an
overcrowded market could be more of a hindrance than a help. It would amount
to a collective plea by the industry to limit competition, which the MMC
would surely find hard to swallow.
Meanwhile HSBC would have a firm offer on the table, worth 30p more than
Midland's share price yesterday thanks to a strong Hong Kong market. At this
level it would be hard for the HSBC to justify an increase to its own
shareholders, who have mistrusted the plan from the start. HSBC has
underperformed its quoted Hang Seng Bank subsidiary by over 20 per cent
since bid talks were revealed in March. It is scarcely likely that Midland
holders could get out for cash at the current bid value if the deal went
through. That explains why Midland's price is languishing at 389p. The time
may be coming for holders to consider selling in the market.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Letter: MP is critical of EC deciding fate of bids for
Midland Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH HAMPSON MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your front page story on May 5 claimed that 'Lloyds Bank had been
taking advice from Keith Hampson. . .in its battle with Hongkong Bank for
control of Midland'. This allegation has since been repeated in several
newspapers. Let me make it clear that at no stage have I been an adviser to
Lloyds Bank, nor had any discussions with it about its proposed offer for
Midland. Nor have I been retained by GJW Government Relations, Lloyds'
political advisers, since last summer.
I have no financial interest in the outcome of the rival bids, but as a
member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Trade and Industry, I
take an interest in the issues raised by them. The likely turn of events
should cause concern. In particular there is the disturbing prospect that we
shall be obliged to operate procedures which give foreign bidders an
advantage over bids by British companies.
Should the European Commission decide that consideration of the Hongkong bid
is a proper matter for it and, as is currently the case, it considers only
the effects on competition, then the Hongkong bid will almost certainly be
cleared. Some competition issues do, however, arise over the proposed Lloyds
bid; but should that bid be referred to our Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, it virtually leaves the way open for Hongkong Bank.
The future of the major high street banks surely raises public interest
issues other than those of competition alone. All bids should be considered
on the same playing field. The Select Committee's recent report on takeovers
and mergers recommended that mergers which fall over EC thresholds but may
materially affect UK interests, should be considered by the UK authorities.
The only course of action that I can see which would prevent the Hongkong
Bank from having a clear run, would be for the British government to claim
that there are specific 'legitimate' non-competition UK interests which
warrant examination by our MMC.
The Commission would have to decide whether such a claim was compatible with
Community law, but the government could bring any adverse ruling before the
European court so as to clarify the scope of legitimate national interests.
I suggest that, meanwhile, it would be a nonsense to allow the bid to go
ahead and there would presumably be scope for the secretary of state to seek
an injunction. This might at least ensure that the British bidder was less
disadvantaged.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLAUDE ROESSIGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's reflections in 'Nations in glass houses' (May 6) are
correct insofar as they admonish Europeans to refrain from smugness
regarding their own race relations, as compared to those in the US, but dead
wrong in seeking the roots of the evil.
A simple explanation of social and economic data will confirm that what had
been a transient economic underclass - that is, a class of people both poor
and uneducated but from which it was possible to rise - became a permanent
underclass as a direct consequence of the social assistance programmes of
Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, programmes which made it economically
rewarding to do nothing about one's own circumstances. Nor ought this to be
a revelation, for Europe's social democracies are achieving the identical
result, the creation of a permanent underclass through social assistance.
The blacks in this underclass in the US today are held far more firmly in
bondage, a cruel bondage of good intentions, that they ever were in steel
chains, which only required physical escape.
The new Simon Legrees are the social welfare architects who have pandered to
generation after generation of American blacks, destroying the family,
pardoning any behaviour with excuses, and destroying any incentive for
self-improvement. If black rage were properly directed, it would be at the
hand which pretends to help.

   From Mr EDWARD LISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Wandsworth Council is not seeking City Challenge cash to fund new City
Technology Colleges in Battersea ('Doubt over council's schools plan', April
25). The East Battersea Challenge sets out to give a competitive advantage
to the whole community - and focuses in particular on developing a wide
range of educational and training initiatives for people of all ages.
We have this year set up the new Battersea Technology College in the heart
of the area. Our bid addresses the critical issue of how we can ensure that
local youngsters make the most of the exciting opportunities offered by the
new school.
City Challenge funding would be used to provide the local primary schools
with new technology facilities and allow the introduction of modern language
teaching. These and other related initiatives such as after-hours homework
clubs and summer schools are additions to our mainstream responsibilities.
All, we have been assured by the responsible government officials, are
entirely consistent with the City Challenge criteria.
At the same time, we are developing a parallel proposal to establish a
'prep' school within Battersea Technology College. This is designed to
complement the approach in the existing primary schools. It forms no part of
our bid for City Challenge funds.
The City Challenge assessors will be examining many imaginative and
innovative ideas in the weeks ahead. But for many of the councils concerned
it will be their first - and probably last - brush with radicalism. We have
a record of making things happen in Wandsworth. This is the context in which
our bid will eventually be judged.

A report from the Health Education Council due out on Sunday is likely to
suggest that despite the UK government's implementation of an EC directive
banning all TV tobacco advertising, the BBC is still providing lots of
lovely free space for tobacco producers to splash themselves across.
Just why is it that tobacco companies relish the chance to spend millions on
sports sponsorship? Is it entirely unrelated to the fact that BBC cameras
can hardly avoid spotlighting brand names placarded behind the snooker
table, round the formula-one race's chicanes, and above the cricket umpire's
elbow?
The report will be featured on Sunday's Bite Back programme - in which BBC
executives are put on the spot by reporters and members of the public. A
golden opportunity, no less, for powers-that-Beeb to put their view across.
But Jonathan Martin, BBC TV's head of sport, has declined. It will be
entertaining to see who - if anyone - fills the seat; and how many
teethmarks are incurred.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Observer's sympathies go out to Hernan Puentes, the lMF's head PR flunky. He
has been given the thankless task of trying to convince ordinary Russians
that the IMF really does have their interests at heart rather than those of
the west's ruthless capitalists.
Hosting his first press conference in Moscow since Russia joined the west's
most powerful financial institution, Puentes seemed a bit short of
ammunition. Handing out a glossy new booklet about the IMF, which translates
its name into Russian as the 'International Hard Currency Fund', is not
enough to win over the hearts and minds of the proletariat.
President Boris Yeltsin has already said Russia will not take orders from
the Fund, and Puentes stressed that his employer never dictates policy to
any country.
However, if the IMF's experience in Poland is any guide, Puentes and his
chums are going to have an uphill struggle convincing ordinary Russians that
they have not simply exchanged the tyranny of the central plan for an
equally oppressive economic regime.

Teenage aspirations to be a missionary seemed to be sunk for Stephan
Schmidheiny when his industrialist father press-ganged him into heading the
family asbestos company at the age of 27. But besides making himself a
billionaire over the 17 years since, the shy Swiss entrepreneur has emerged
as a powerful missionary for environmental causes among his fellow business
leaders.
For instance, his was the hand that drafted yesterday's report to go before
the 'Earth Summit' to be staged in Rio next month by the Business Council
for Sustainable Development - a pressure group of 48 big-company chief
executives which Schmidheiny has supported with Dollars 10m of his own cash.
His green concerns were already budding when he began the job in asbestos.
Deciding there was no future in it, he defied paternal advice and pulled
out. Over the intervening years he has built up a diversified international
business empire spanning companies such as Landis &amp; Gyr (air conditioning)
and Leica (optical and scientific instruments), as well as sizeable minority
stakes in SMH (watches, including Swatch) and ABB (power engineering).
Although scarcely a hot gospeller - he has the scholarly appearance to go
with his reputation as a business strategist and philosopher - he has an
incisive speaking style. And he has used it tirelessly in preaching to the
world's business communities his own conviction which forms the message of
the report: that greenery and profits both can and should go hand in hand.
True, it is not a message which always pleases the more fervent brand of
environmentalists - Greenpeace has described his report as 'greenwash'. But
Schmidheiny was prepared for a brickbat or two.
So long as next month's summit brings recognition that private enterprise
has a key role in the cause, he says, that will be an encouraging start.

door to the South Bank Arts Centre and, with Mr Mellor in residence, might
well attract the headquarters of other arts and heritage organisations.
Any remaining space could no doubt be filled by overspill from its close
neighbour, the Department of Education, as it takes over tens of thousands
of schools opting out of local-authority control. All of which will
perfectly symbolise the trend towards central control of what were once
locally provided services. Second best maybe, but most of us would prefer a
public service future for London's County Hall rather than the proposed

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The truth about Britain's spies is duller than you could possibly imagine.
That is why it is so startling. Bear with me a moment, and I'll explain.
First it is necessary to establish that we are talking mainly about the
Secret Intelligence Service, commonly referred to as MI6, and a little about
the security service, or MI5. The former spies on foreigners, the latter on
the domestic population.
Until 1987, the government hardly admitted the existence of either
department. In 1989, a bill put through the house by Mr Douglas Hurd, then
the home secretary, bestowed the dignity of a statutory existence upon MI5.
It also provided what I believe are inadequate safeguards against abuse,
which may occur when operatives are authorised to bug telephones or enter
properties to steal documents. An independent judicial tribunal does hear
complaints, but that is a wholly internal affair. It would be more
reassuring to have some means whereby bell-ringers can be heard outside the
charmed circle, such as by a parliamentary committee, or a panel of privy
councillors.
A similar bill to be put through this year or next by Mr Hurd, now foreign
secretary, will legalise MI6. The question of safeguards is yet to be
publicly debated. The argument in favour of an external port of call for
complainers is less compelling in this instance than with the domestic
service. On top of that, a natural preference for consistency will doubtless
weigh with Mr Hurd as a reason for copying large chunks of text from his
earlier Secret Service act.
Against that, the political climate has changed. The 1988 bill was produced
under the watchful eye of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. She did let slip in autumn
1987 that the SIS existed, and she did appoint Sir Philip Woodhead as an
internal ombudsman to the two services, but her general approach was
gung-ho: spies were something you did not mention. Mr John Major's
administration is less childish. The appointment of Mrs Stella Rimington as
the new head of MI5 was publicly announced well in advance of her arrival in
her new office in February. On Wednesday, Mr Major told the world what only
the uninterested did not already know: that Sir Colin McColl is head of MI6,
with direct access to him on demand.
This announcement should be the deciding factor. If government is to be more
open, as Mr Major has to his credit said it will be, there ought to be the
maximum possible parliamentary scrutiny of every branch of the
administration, including the secret services. For it is here that the
startling truth about our spies comes in. At bottom they are civil servants,
operating within Whitehall as part of the everyday process of government.
When I visited MI5 some years ago, I was struck by how like any clutch of
well-mannered civil servants the senior officers were. Their troubles were
those of most departments: recruitment, promotions, a career ladder
recognisably like any other within the government.
It turns out that the same is true of MI6. Their higher officers - those who
work in their 'intelligence branch' - have to blend in with the foreign
office, so they tend to be upper-class or at the very least Oxbridge types,
some recruited from the defence forces, some from the older universities.
The domestic service, which has to be invisible within the general
population, draws on a wider range of recruits. At the sharp end, most of
MI6's work consists of managing people. They solicit information by being
friendly and confidential or, in extremis, they buy it.
The joint intelligence committee (JIC) of the cabinet sets out what is
required; the product, which is in the form of raw information, goes to the
interested ministries (defence, the foreign office, the Treasury, the
department of trade and industry and others according to need). It also goes
to the cabinet office where an assessment staff sifts it, adds in
publicly-known or other information, and produces judgments on the
significance of what has come in. Most Whitehall officials are accustomed to
appending the SIS to circulation lists at the top of their documents.
Ministers may instruct their officials to find out 'more about that'. The
private secretary will mumble assent, then ask the SIS or MI5 contact within
that department to make the right telephone call to the right intelligence
officer.
This is much less of a free-ranging system than pertains in the US, where
the CIA and the State Department spies make their own assessments of the
basic data. One result was a set of competing proposals on Nicaragua. In
Britain, Whitehall rules constitute a restraint: when an MI6 informant told
of the Iraqi supergun being made in English factories, the service could
only pass the news along. It has no standing on domestic issues.
There was some concern about the future of the SIS when the Cold War ended,
but the JIC has given it plenty of work to do. An entrepreneurial moment has
arrived: it advises east European countries on how to set up a democracy's
secret service and keep it honest; the unfortunate Hungarians, Czechoslovaks
and others have little to thank their communist spy services for. That is,
however, a small task. More regularly, MI6 watches nuclear proliferation,
tracks ex-Soviet weaponry and scientists, provides reports on the politics
of certain countries, offers up a small amount of economic information and
ad hoc bits and pieces of commercial news, and, increasingly, tracks
international terrorists and drug dealers.
The latter is its only really dangerous work; most MI6 officers had a rather
cosy relationship with their opposite numbers in the KGB, when it was the
enemy. They knew each other: they met at cocktail parties. They competed,
but by and large did not kill one another, as John le Carre would have us
believe. Real life intelligence work is more mundane. There is little
violence and, I am assured, no assassinations.
Mr Hurd knows all this. He is prone to tease those of us who think his
previous bill, and its accompanying sharply-focused official secrets act,
was flawed. As he points out, no editors have gone to jail since its
passage. Yet he will understand the case for harmonising his new bill with
the promise of more open government made by Mr Major. There should be only
the slightest of differences between the law as applied to run-of-the-mill
civil servants and their run-of-the-mill colleagues in MI5 and MI6.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Ukraine's role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURRENT visit to the US of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president,
is an attempt to gain international respect. Up to now, Ukrainians feel they
have been treated like little brothers to the Russians, patronised and told
off when they annoy the adults. There is some justice in the grievance.
Ukraine is a state the size of France with a population close to that of
Britain. It has considerable agricultural potential and its industrial base
is huge. Most urgently, it has large nuclear and conventional forces.
In the short term the international community will judge the Ukraine by the
degree of responsibility it shows in dismantling this arsenal. In his talks
in Washington Mr Kravchuk promised to remove most strategic weapons and to
move tactical nuclear weapons to Russia for destruction. But his pledge to
implement the Start agreement still leaves 46 strategic nuclear weapons in
Ukraine and Mr Kravchuk wants to trade these for a US security guarantee. At
a time when Russo-Ukrainian relations are worsening over a host of issues
from the Black Sea fleet to Crimea, Russia would inevitably interpret this
as a hostile act.
Ukraine originally offered to give up all its strategic weapons. That is
what it should still do. If it wishes its legitimate security concerns to be
shared with the west, it must develop a serious dialogue, not proclaim its
intention to be nuclear-free one day and appear to change its mind the next.
But both Russia and the west should then make clear in tangible ways their
recognition of Ukraine's good sense and maturity. More broadly, Russia and
Ukraine - as closely tied as the US and Canada - need to cast away the idea
that future relations should be shadowed by a nuclear threat.
Ukraine is far too important, and the issues surrounding it too dangerous,
to be any longer patronised and downgraded. It deserves the respect it
wishes - so long as that respect is mutual.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A breakdown of consensus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S PAY deal for German public sector workers will succeed in
putting the western half of the country back to work after 11 days of strike
action. But it is bad news for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, bad news for Germany
and bad news for Europe.
At a time when Germany needs to tighten belts to cope with the immense
unsolved challenges of unification, the public sector is leading the way
towards wage rises which the country cannot afford. Mr Kohl belatedly pushed
through tax increases last year to keep down sharply rising budget deficits.
These are now effectively being offset by increases in the public sector
wage bill.
After yesterday's agreement for a 5.4 per cent pay rise, plus individual
one-off payments, the well-organised and well-financed oTV public sector
union is congratulating itself on a notable victory. It is likely to be
pyrrhic. By hardening the Bundesbank's determination to force down inflation
from its present level of 4.5 per cent, yesterday's outcome is likely to
maintain German interest rates at their current high levels for many months.
The central bank failed to take action at its council meeting yesterday. But
a further increase in its official lending rates now looks a possibility.
This would bring fresh pain not only to the German economy, but to the rest
of Europe. In spite of an unseasonal growth spurt at the beginning of the
year, signs of sluggishness in the German economy are increasing. Further
tightening by the Bundesbank would turn a slowdown into recession.
For Mr Kohl, the political effects may be still more sobering. For the
second year in succession, the government has failed to persuade German
workers to accept lower wage rises in the interest of their country's
longer-term financial health. The government is allowing through a deal
which is barely distinguishable from the arbitration proposal it rejected
last month as being unacceptably high. The cuts in spending and subsidies
outlined on Tuesday by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, are now more
urgent than ever. Mr Kohl seems unlikely to summon the necessary authority
to push these measures through. West Germany's system of consensus between
wage-earners and employers was a pivotal factor behind the stability and
prosperity which made unification possible 19 months ago. Just when Germany
needs it most, the system looks to be breaking down. Germany has very few
options to replace it with anything better, and time to find solutions is
running out.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: The Coronation of Poppaea - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monteverdi's last opera, when performed as superbly as it is in the new
Opera Factory production, becomes one of the most complex and disturbing of
all artistic experiences. Its main themes are sexual infatuation and the
abuse of state power, and the terrible links that can be forged between
them. Poppaea is like Mozart's Figaro in the way it presents a complete
spectrum of characters shaded by love and lust; but it is unlike that folle
journee in that the good end unhappily and the bad happily - and that, in
the view of the composer and his librettist Busenello, seems to be what Life
means.
This pitiless tale of moral and emotional ambiguities told in a score of
utmost grave beauty would seem to be native territory for David Freeman and
his Factory hands. So it proves. The Queen Elizabeth Hall stage, designed by
David Roger as an airy, marbled-tinted stepped arena with two small
instrumental bands disposed on either side, offers an acting space of ideal
intimacy - with different areas colonised at different times, the total made
grander than the sum of its parts.
The format of scenes, at once freely developing and strict in structural
control, is permitted to build up its awesome intensity without any of the
barriers normally placed between characters and audience in larger Poppaea
theatres. The text is uncut, and faster-moving than most nipped and tucked
ones; Anne Ridler's fine translation, uttered with unaffected clarity by the
entire cast, provides the motor power of the staging - as in this opera the
words always should but so often do not.
And Freeman's encouragement of all the ensemble virtues (which include
performers in more than one role) promotes a cross-cutting between the
opera's shared destinies that grapples the audience to their unfolding with
iron hooks. The treatment of one scene seems questionable: the Nero-Lucan
duet, here a dressing-up scene with the emperor in semi-drag and minions
throwing up into fruit-bowls. Historically suggestive, no doubt, but the
piercing irony of text would perhaps be better served by plainer means.
For the rest, though, the combination of fluidity, athletic movement and
unfettered characterisation makes this a sharper-pointed, more multi-faceted
Poppaea than any I have previously encountered. The tension pulled between
the three female leads is alarmingly taut: Marie Angel in the title role,
horribly well-judged in her calculated sensuality, the fast-vibrato-laden
tone-colour applied with pinpoint skill; Janis Kelly as Octavia,
magnificently aristocratic in bearing and declamation; and the attractively
bright-toned Sally Ann Shepherdson as Drusilla, who rises to her test of
loyalty (violently staged by Freeman) with fierce youthful passion.
The male-soprano leads are taken by male performers, and sung an octave
below pitch: common 20th-century practice, which normally fogs up the vocal
lines a great deal more than it does here - a tribute to the controlled
spontaneity and fleetness of the singing and its accompaniment under Peter
Robinson's direction. Nigel Robson's tenor Nero, pig-tailed, sexually
ambiguous and quick to violence, is another horribly well-judged portrayal;
Geoffrey Dolton's baritone Otho, the great romantic of the opera, pours out
his agonies in ever more eloquent style.
The Seneca of Michael Neill, in spite of odd vowel-sounds, touches all the
right depths. Howard Milner's high-tenor Nurse is both raucously funny and
genuinely tender, though in the lullaby - how revealing that the opera's
lyrical peak-point should be a hymn to sweet oblivion] - he inevitably
misses an alto's full rich tonal flow. No Poppaea has everything; this one
lacks the 'animal' lustre that great voices finely used can shed on the
drama. The qualities it does possess - dramatic conviction, musical
directness, wholeness of viewpoint - are more than sufficient compensation.
Queen Elizabeth Hall: performances until May 12, then five more in June

<TEXT>
The Royal Ballet is staging Tales of Beatrix Potter at Covent Garden next
December. This is the first time that the work, choreographed by Frederick
Ashton for a movie in 1971, has been performed live. Anthony Dowell,
director of the Royal Ballet, has undertaken the adaptation which should
prove a success for the company.
The other major ballets in the 1992-93 season are the British premiere of
Baryshnikov's Don Quixote and a new one act ballet by David Bintley designed
by Jasper Conran. The Royal Ballet will dance Glen Tetley's La Ronde for the
first time and there will be a new production of Balanchine's Ballet
Imperial.
General director Jeremy Isaacs confirmed yesterday that Covent Garden will
close in 1997 for large scale renovation work. It hopes to be a beneficiary
of the Government's Millennium Fund and open its refurbished building in
grand style to welcome the 21st century.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: Bounty in contemporary spaces - Paris Galleries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance Renn Espace looks like any contemporary art gallery off
Boulevard St Germain in Paris, with all the requisite accessories:
minimalist foyer, white walls and sunlight shafting through a glazed roof.
Renn Espace is different. Unlike other contemporary art spaces in the city,
it is neither commercial nor a state-supported institution. Instead it holds
a series of exhibitions sponsored by Claude Berri, the film producer behind
Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources and, for the past five years, one of
Europe's most enthusiastic modern art collectors.
The Berri collection is composed of established 20th century artists like Cy
Twombly, Yves Klein, Jean Dubuffet and Lucio Fontana. Claude Berri has
leased an old print shop, next to his own Paris home on Rue de Lille, to
stage shows based on the work of artists within his collection. The first of
these is devoted to the American minimalist painter, Robert Ryman.
The show includes 50 of Ryman's 'white paintings' and covers his career from
the late 1950s when Ryman, who started out as a jazz musician, was first
making his name in the New York art scene, to last year. Some of the
paintings come from Berri's collection, although the giant Ryman abstract
for which he paid a record - and very controversial - Dollars 2m three years
ago is still hidden away in his own home.
The logistics of Renn Espace with its wide spaces and shafting sunlight, are
ideally suited to Ryman's work. The 'white paintings', a series of austere
white oils with intricate surface detail and barely discernible flecks of
different colours, require very delicate display - and lots of natural light
 -to show off the subtlety of Ryman's treatment of surfaces and his colour
contrasts. They also benefit from being shown en masse which makes it easier
to appreciate the differences from canvas to canvas.
That said, it seems a shame that Claude Berri should have given over his
gallery to so well-established an artist as Robert Ryman, who would have no
difficulty in finding more conventional outlets. Indeed the Museum of Modern
Art in New York and the Tate Gallery in London are already collaborating on
a retrospective of his work. Renn Espace could use its special status to be
more experimental in its choice of artists as the Saatchi Gallery in London.
Across the Seine is the new Ashley Bickerton show at Yvon Lambert in the
Marais. This exhibition, part of the body of work first shown at Sonnabend
in New York last autumn, is Bickerton's first one man show in Europe and
marks his attempt to distance himself from the commodity art cliche that has
haunted him since he first surfaced in the Manhattan art world, alongside
Jeff Koons and Meyer Vaisman, in the mid-1980s.
When Bickerton first moved away from his early interest in consumption - the
matt black sculptures emblazoned with fashion labels and art logos - he
ventured into the newly fashionable field of the environment. At the time it
looked suspiciously as though he had swapped one hip obsession for another.
His new work seems much stronger in that it combines the two themes by
exploring escapist fantasies of the tropics with images of the sort of
desert islands which would not look out of place in 1970s' Bounty
commercials, exotic liquor and equally exotic women.
Bickerton, who now spends part of each year in Indonesia, says the show is
all about 'sex, booze and escape, the things people look for in the Eden
they will never find.' In his sculptures he has mixed images of the
indigenous tropics - native photographs, old fishing net, coconuts and
bottles of local liquor - with the totems of tourism - high tech sub-aquatic
kit, reels of film, a cowboy suit and symbols of the sex industry. The
indigenous images are often imprisoned within the tourist paraphernalia so
the show looks like a visual game of double-bluff illustrating how one man's
fantasy can crush another's.
If Ashley Bickerton's work is about longing , however hopelessly, for
escape, Suzanne Lafont's photographs at the Jeu de Paume act as an abrupt
reminder of the angst-ridden reality his Bounty island-bound tourists want
to escape from. The Jeu de Paume , the old Impressionist museum in the
Tuileries Gardens, has already made its mark on the Paris arts scene since
reopening last summer as the lynchpin of the ministry of culture's
initiative to create more space for modern art in the city. The Lafont show
is composed of four series of photographs - all anonymous portraits blown up
into cinematic proportions in the style of stills from the films of the
directors like Roberto Rossellini, Robert Bresson and Jean Luc Godard, who
have influenced the artist.
Lafont's subjects appear to be acting out their own modern horror stories.
The victims of Le Bruit (The Noise) shrink visibly with terror, covering
their eyes or ears in a futile attempt to hide. Les Souffleurs (The Blowers)
are reduced to ridicule as they puff out their cheeks in a pathetic attempt
to ward off whatever threatens them. The sheer size of the portraits forces
the eye to focus on the subject's vulnerability , even on their tell-tale
physical flaws, the frightened eyes and the weary wrinkles, in painful
detail.
Robert Ryman at Renn Espace, 7 rue de Lille, 75007 Paris, until June 30.
Ashley Bickerton at Yvon Lambert, 108 rue Vielle du Temple, 75003 Paris
until May 12. Suzanne Lafont at Jeu de Paume, 20 rue Royale, 75008 Paris
until May 24.

FT  08 MAY 92 / People: McMahon joins DC Gardner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DC GARDNER GROUP, the training and outplacement company, yesterday completed
a fundamental restructuring of its businesses and senior management with the
appointment of Tim Inglefield as group finance director and Sir Kit McMahon
(above) as a non-executive director.
Sir Kit, currently a director of Taylor Woodrow and Pentos, is the former
chairman of Midland Bank and a former director of Eurotunnel and Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corporation. He has long taken an interest in financial
training.
Inglefield, a former director of Lloyds merchant bank, joins the company
from Genus Training, an information technology and software training
consultancy.
The appointments come after months of work by Barry Topple, group chief
executive appointed last year, which have led to the departure of all but
one of the previous executive directors of the company.
At one stage last year DC Gardner had ten directors. Its current chairman is
Stephen Johnson, and its other non-executive directors are David Rosebery
and Peter Walker, the former secretary of state. Professor Edward Gardener
has resigned.
'It is not particularly helpful to go back over our historical position,' he
says. 'We now have a new management team in place and a sound financial
base, with gearing reduced from 200 per cent to 40 per cent.' There was a
Pounds 1.9m restructuring provision and a Pounds 1.5m property write-down in
last year's accounts to reflect the costs of these changes.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology: Pick of the designer crop - Victoria Griffith
explains why genetically altered food will taste better than the real thing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US biotechnology industry is moving closer to overcoming the regulatory
barriers that keep its products off supermarket shelves.
The Department of Agriculture has said it should be ready to publish over
the next few weeks a new set of guidelines for genetically engineered food,
one of the biggest areas of biotech research.
Designer food - which is created by altering the genetic structure of fruits
and vegetables - has long been talked about, but the technology is no longer
a futuristic dream. Some companies have already developed marketable goods,
and say they are just waiting for federal approval to launch their products.
The Bush administration took a step towards setting up a regulatory
framework in February this year, when it issued a set of ground rules for
the biotech industry. The guidelines stressed that in order to block the
development of such products, strong evidence of environmental harm would
have to be presented.
'The most important thing about the document was that it seemed to support
the idea of genetically engineered food,' says Suzanne Shaw of Du Pont,
which is one of several companies working on a new tomato. 'It was seen as a
green light for the industry.'
If all goes according to plan, designer foods may become a familiar item at
grocery stores. Boasting superiority in flavour, texture and durability,
these products could change the way we eat.
Some of the foods which could soon grace our tables are better-tasting
tomatoes and melons, unbruisable potatoes and natural margarines. The
product likely to hit the market first is a new tomato made by Calgene of
Davis, California, which could be on the shelves as early as next year.
The tomatoes, already being cultivated on farms in Florida, California and
Mexico, have been genetically altered so that they no longer produce the
rotting enzyme polygalacturonase. That means the tomato can stay on the
vines longer, and vine-ripened tomatoes taste better. The technique also
enables farmers to cultivate strongly flavoured varieties which they would
usually ignore because of excessive softness.
ICI, the UK chemicals group, is also carrying out large-scale field trials
in the US of a non-rotting tomato. If all goes well, this will reach the
market in 1994-95, says Keith Pike, public affairs manager for ICI Seeds.
'Beyond that we have a follow-on programme, using other genetic constructs
in the tomato which appear to influence spoilage and flavour.'
Pike says ICI is also working on several other fruit and vegetables. 'We
believe we have the widest and deepest programme of anyone,' he says.
With the regulatory issues closer to being resolved, companies are investing
huge amounts of money into the development of designer food. 'As the
regulatory structure becomes clearer, companies are getting more excited
about it,' says Shaw. 'And there are a lot of good things for consumers
which will come out of this.'
The potential market for these products is huge. The potato business in the
US alone is worth about Dollars 1.7bn, according to Geoff Keyes, head of
business development at Monsanto.
The company is trying to develop a potato which would have more
carbohydrates and less water. 'That would mean using less oil in the cooking
process for fries and chips,' explains Keyes. 'Now, you have to use oil to
remove the water from potatoes.' The result should be lower-fat potato
products.
Calgene believes it can earn Dollars 500m a year with its new tomato.
According to Roger Salquist, the group's chairman and chief executive
officer, a patent on the product will guarantee the group a large portion of
the Dollars 3.5bn he estimates bio-engineered food will generate annually by
the end of the decade.
The company believes that sort of revenue potential will more than justify
its expenditures in the area. 'We've sunk Dollars 175m into bio-engineered
food over the last few years,' says Salquist. 'But we don't consider that a
very high figure. We put Dollars 20m into research on the tomato, and when
you consider that we may bring in Dollars 500m a year on that product alone,
the investment has been very small.'
Calgene is also developing other products, such as cooking oils which would
contain no saturated fats. That market, according to Salquist, will be even
more profitable than tomatoes, with a Dollars 700m a year revenue potential.
The US Department of Agriculture is getting in on the act, too. In
California, the USDA has put William Belknap in charge of a programme to
develop a potato which would not be susceptible to black spot bruises.
Belknap believes that the technology could save the industry Dollars 100m in
annual losses. Efforts are also under way to make soya beans, maize and
other products immune to disease.
But people in the industry say that consumers should not expect supermarkets
to fill up immediately with designer products. 'Only a few foods are ready
to be marketed,' says Belknap.
'It's not easy to get the effect you want. We have to test our potatoes in
the fields before we can be sure that it's a viable product. Because spring
only comes once a year, that's a slow process.'

FT  08 MAY 92 / People: PEPping up the Trio trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At 45, David Hagan, chartered accountant turned money broker, is still
waiting to break into the big league. Having set up Tullett &amp; Tokyo Equities
and tried and failed to buy Exco, one of the world's biggest money brokers,
he has now re-emerged as full-time chairman of Trio, a small and
unsuccessful investment trust.
Hagan, who has paid Pounds 225,000 for a 12.5 per cent stake in Trio, has
been given the job of trying to inject some life into a trust which was
brought to the stock market 16 months ago at 50p per share by Raphael Zorn.
It was intended to be a specialist trust appealing to investors with
personal equity plans. But the rules were changed; the trust lost its
original sense of purpose and is trading at a substantial discount to its
Pounds 2m of net assets.
English Trust, which has a substantial stake in Trio and is the company's
financial adviser, has given Hagan the job of coming up with some new ideas.
Hagan, who will be executive chairman, says that he has been given a 'very
broad brief'. He refused to speculate on his options, but the company's
flexibility would be enhanced if it gave up its investment trust status. In
order to ensure that Hagan has 'an adequate interest in the company's
future', Hagan will be granted substantial share options subject to
shareholder approval.
Lord Tryon and Alan Arscott have resigned as directors, and Peter Glossop,
Christopher Moore and Christopher Spence remain as directors.
Robert Henderson, former chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has stepped down as
deputy chairman of CADBURY SCHWEPPES at the age of 74. He has been on the
board since 1977 and deputy chairman since 1984. In the course of his career
at KB he had been instrumental in the merger of Cadbury and Schweppes back
in 1969.
The new deputy chairman is 61-year-old Tom Hutchison, on the board since
1986. A director of ICI from 1985 to 1991, he is deputy governor of the Bank
of Scotland, and a non-executive director of The Hammerson Group and AMP
Asset Management.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Processed shark fin on the menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No gourmet Chinese dinner is complete without a dish of shark's fin. But
preparing the delicacy is a long, tedious and labour-intensive task.
Traditional preparation takes many hours and involves soaking the shark's
fin several times before removing the scales and sand with a knife. After
that the shark's fin is deboned and the prized stringy ligaments are removed
ready for cooking.
Neils Elvig, a technical service manager with Novo Nordisk, the Danish
pharmaceuticals and enzymes group, stumbled across the problem a year ago
during his chats with local businessmen and began to experiment in the
company's laboratory.
He discovered that shark's fin could be scaled in a shorter time with less
effort if it was soaked in a proteolytic enzyme called Neutrase. The
procedure is simple, effective and hygienic. Despite initial hesitancy,
processed shark's fin has found growing acceptance from top chefs in
Malaysia. Novo Nordisk: Kuala Lumpur, 603 230 3267.

landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past 90 years the design of binoculars has changed very little, but
their use has sometimes been limited by the narrow field of view which makes
it difficult to find or follow fast-moving objects.
Mike Freeman, who heads Optics and Vision, a consultancy company based in
Denbigh, Wales, believes he has found a solution with a new design of

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Installing or moving video-based applications like dealer board systems in
financial services companies is prohibitively expensive.
Now Amulet, an Exeter-based company, has developed an adapter which allows
video systems to be run over high-quality telephone cable. Under a marketing
agreement with Amulet the new system is available from Case Cabling, a
subsidiary of network specialists Dowty Communications.
The video adapter requires no external power supply and simply plugs into
the video monitors at one end. The system provides a brighter and sharper
picture than the traditional triax cable over long distances.
The cost savings lie in the initial installation and in the reduced price of
subsequent moves or changes. Alterations to the system are a matter of 'plug
and patch', completed in minutes without skilled staff or any cable laying.

FT  08 MAY 92 / People: A regional view of entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite its long-term interest in small business, the Confederation of
British Industry is probably regarded by most outsiders as the mouthpiece
for Britain's large companies.
But this perception may be about to change with the appointment of Liz Amos,
currently in charge of membership promotion, to head up the CBI's membership
directorate with responsibility for small firms and the regions.
The combination of these three areas in one job should mean Amos is well
placed to give a boost to the CBI's recruitment of small business
owner-managers in the regions.
Despite the 'downsizing' of British industry over the past decade, only 60
per cent of the CBI's members are small firms (employing fewer than 200
people) compared with their 97 per cent share of all UK businesses by
number.
Amos, 40, who joined the CBI in 1979 as speechwriter to the then director
general Sir John Methven, may also adopt a slightly higher profile than her
predecessor, Sonia Elkin.
Elkin headed the smaller firms and regions directorate for nine years but
without responsibility for the membership portfolio.
Prime responsibility for putting the confederation's views on small firms to
the outside world will still rest with Richard Brucciani, the recently
appointed chairman of its Smaller Firms Council. But if it serves members'
interests, Amos says she is prepared to speak up.
A history graduate from Bristol University, Amos is particularly keen to
press the interests of British business in the European Community; to
promote the CBI's new-found enthusiasm for family businesses; and to
strengthen the enterprise activities of the Training and Enterprise
Councils.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's church leaders promised after a meeting with Mr John
Major yesterday to take a lead in encouraging progress in the present 'round
table' talks on the province's political future.
Archbishop Robin Eames, the Church of Ireland primate, said the main Roman
Catholic and Protestant churches wanted 'to be in the forefront of
encouraging the political dialogue . . . now taking place and which we
believe is the earnest desire of the vast majority of our people.'
His call came as Unionist and nationalist political leaders completed
another day of negotiations at Stormont, outside Belfast. Public comment was
again limited to a brief agreed statement - probably a sign that the
goodwill surround the deliberations remains largely intact.
Four church leaders joined the prime minister in a meeting intended to show
that Mr Major has put Northern Ireland high on his list of priorities.
Besides archbishop Eames, he also met cardinal Cahal Daly, head of the
Catholic Church in Ireland; Dr Rodney Sterritt, Presbyterian moderator; and
the Rev Winston Good, Methodist president.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Cultural change on training urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs URGED a significant cultural change to improve the status of training
yesterday.
The Commons employment committee made the recommendation in a report
containing a broad sweep of conclusions on the employment consequences of
sudden industrial change. Evidence was taken from a variety of industrial
areas.
The committee said British assumptions about manufacturing jobs needed to be
overhauled radically. It urged a change in attitude to engineers,
entrepreneurs, relocation and career change. 'Some evidence indicates
attitudes are already changing to relocation and career change, but more
needs to be done to encourage this trend.'
The report said companies should regard training as a profitable investment
rather than as a cost and criticised government training programmes for not
meeting the needs of industry.
A serious concern, the report said, was the maintenance of a modern national
skills base if the UK was to remain a serious competitor in world markets
and improve its international economic standing.
The committee commended British Coal Enterprise, a subsidiary of British
Coal, and British Steel, for their efforts to create new alternative
employment in areas where they made redundancies.
It recommended that, where possible, companies that made significant numbers
of employees redundant should extend practical help.
A report of the committee of public accounts published yesterday said it
regarded as 'unacceptable' the accounting procedures that led to more than
Pounds 85m being paid for training between 1989 and 1991 without adequate
documentation to substantiate claims.
The report, which follows a similar one from the National Audit Office, said
it was essential that Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer the
two main government training schemes, fulfilled their obligations to
undertake effective financial monitoring and control. It expected the
Department of Employment to apply contractual sanctions and penalties firmly
if Tecs failed to meet their obligations.

TRADE between Russia and India, seriously disrupted in the past year with
the break-up of the Soviet Union, is expected to resume soon on a hard
currency basis.
'Rupee' trade, the barter system used by the two countries for three decades
will end. The two nations are to sign a memorandum of understanding this
week.
The payments will now be credited and debited to a central account with
India's central bank. The bank hopes trade will be balanced so that there is
no outflow of dollars.
Mr Gennady Burbulis, the Russian secretary of state, who visited New Delhi
this week, said his country stood by the trade protocol signed earlier this
year.
For India, the most important exports from Russia are crude oil and
petroleum products worth Dollars 650m this year. India has agreed to provide
a credit of Dollars 85m to enable Russia to buy four agricultural
commodities - tea, coffee, tobacco and spices. Further credits will be made
available as the flow of trade increases.

<TEXT>
DELEGATES to the final round of negotiations in New York on a global climate
treaty are working to produce a late compromise that could avert a breakdown
in the talks before the Earth Summit next month in Rio de Janeiro, reports
George Graham in Washington.
After protracted negotiations broke off at 4am yesterday, no agreement had
yet been reached on a draft treaty, but a text could be produced today
before the talks are due to end.
Some delegates were still hopeful that Mr Jean Ripert, French chairman of
the talks, would be able to produce a text to resolve the glaring disputes
on whether to set firm targets for reducing emissions of gases that cause
the greenhouse global warming effect, and on financial arrangements to help
the developing world make environmental improvements.
Mr Ripert proposed last week a draft text that seemed to win US acceptance.
The US has has been a big obstacle to agreement by refusing to accept a
specific target for pegging emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse
gas, at 1990 levels by 2000.
However, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, described the
text as a 'sell-out'.
German delegates expressed unhappiness at the absence of any goal for a
reduction in emissions.
Delegates to the talks said they believed a 'reasonable compromise' on goals
was still possible.
Progress towards an agreement without targets has increased the likelihood
that US President George Bush, the only major leader who has not yet agreed
to go to the summit, would attend.

FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK-led consortium wins HK bridge contract
 -Accusations of unfairness after lower tender by Korean group is rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN Anglo-Japanese consortium led by Trafalgar House has won the contract to
build one of the world's longest suspension bridges, linking Hong Kong's new
airport with the mainland, even though Hyundai of South Korea made a lower
tender.
The Hong Kong government said yesterday the Trafalgar consortium's HKDollars
7.14bn (Pounds 517m) bid was the 'lowest acceptable offer'. Hyundai had bid
HKDollars 2.43bn less than Trafalgar House, but the Korean company fell
USDollars 393m short of the government's standard capital requirements,
designed to ensure the company has enough capital to complete the contract.
The decision provoked controversy in the colony. The lion's share of
airport-linked contracts awarded so far have gone to British companies.
However, immediate reactions to the awarding of the contract to a more
expensive British-led tender were more subdued than expected.
The airport core project is already over-budget and there is local suspicion
that the project is Britain's final move to cash in on its colony before the
hand-over to China on July 1, 1997. It is scheduled for completion within
five years.
Mr Albert Chan, of the United Democrats, the party which won the majority of
the directly-elected seats in the Legislative Council last year, said he was
concerned there may have been undue favouritism towards British companies
over airport consultancy contracts. The majority have been picked up by
UK-related companies.
But with regard to the bridge contract, he said the government's argument
for choosing the Anglo-Japanese consortium appeared convincing. However, he
deferred judgment until he had time to examine the decision more closely. He
said he would discuss it with Hyundai.
The Chinese authorities have been kept informed of the decision, although no
formal consultation is necessary since the project does not straddle 1997
and does not require financial guarantees from the post-1997 government.
China has made no official comment.
The Tsing Ma bridge is the largest single contract so far for Hong Kong's
Port and Airport Development Scheme, which will cost HKDollars 114bn at
March 1991 prices.
With a centre span of 1.38 kilometres, the bridge is the longest section of
the Lantau Fixed Crossing, which provides a road and rail link between the
Chek Lap Kok airport and central Hong Kong.
The government has been accused of unfairly requiring Hyundai to provide
special financial guarantees, thereby creating an uneven playing field for
competitors on the bridge contract.
Mr KY Leung, secretary for the Treasury and chairman of the Central Tender
Board, denied showing favouritism to any British consortium. He said Hyundai
had been the only bidder to fail to meet the standard financial
requirements.
'Hyundai have not been able to offer us satisfactory assurances that their
position would be corrected,' said Mr Yeung.
The final decision was made on the basis of four criteria: price, technical
and management expertise, evaluation of the construction programme and
compliance with contract specifications, including the fulfilment of
completion deadlines. Mr Leung said the Anglo-Japanese consortium came first
in all the categories, with the exception of price.
The next highest bidding consortium was the French-led Hong Kong
International Consortium, which made a HKDollars 7.36bn tender, while an
all-Japanese consortium made a HKDollars 10.96bn tender.
The Anglo-Japanese consortium comprises Dorman Long Overseas (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Trafalgar House), Costain Civil Engineering and Mitsui, with
each company holding a one third share. The major sub-contractor will be
Gammon (the Hong Kong construction company owned by Trafalgar House and
Jardine Matheson).
Trafalgar House has significant expertise in bridge building. Its subsidiary
Cleveland Structural Engineering has been a principal contractor for five of
the world's 15 longest span bridges.

FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Tanzania pressed to ban wild bird trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TANZANIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TANZANIA is coming under increasing international pressure to end its trade
in wild birds, largely because of the appalling conditions in which many are
transported.
Tanzania is understood to be the second largest exporter of wild birds in
the world, trading up to 2m a year as pets in Europe, the US and Japan. Nine
illegal shipments of protected birds have been discovered in Tanzania this
year, all using forged documents.
Tanzania is desperately short of foreign exchange, and has seen the trade as
a valuable source of earnings - about Dollars 15m a year. But following the
discovery of abuses, all airlines except the national one has banned the
cargo.
In March this year, an illegal shipment from Dar es Salaam carrying 11
crowned cranes and eight saddle-billed storks aroused controversy when six
of the birds were dead on arrival in Amsterdam. These had been carried by
Aeroflot via Moscow, and the Russian airline is being sued by Dutch airport
authorities.
About 60 airlines worldwide now refuse to transport live birds. But for the
Lausanne-based Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species
(Cites), most concern is focused on proper enforcement of regulations
governing the carriage of live birds, rather than a total ban on the trade.
Cites argues that many birds suffer unduly because basic standards to ensure
their safety are ignored by airlines.
Up to 20m live birds are traded worldwide each year to supply the pet
industry, with the EC the largest market, accounting for about 3m birds.
Other leading exporters are Indonesia, Senegal and Argentina. Around 10 per
cent of birds die either during or shortly after being transported.
Local trappers receive only a fraction of the selling prices. They get about
40 cents for a small bird selling on world markets at about Dollars 5, and
about Dollars 40 for a larger bird that will sell for around Dollars 150.
The Tanzanian Wildlife Exporters' Association concedes that the government
has come under increasing pressure to end the trade in wild birds, but
blames abuses on 'newcomers who see profit in something which is free in the
bush'.
The country's Wildlife Conservation Society has called for a two-year
moratorium.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Congress are heading for stalemate over plans to
cut unnecessary spending from the US budget for the current year.
In March, Mr Bush sent Congress a bill to rescind Dollars 5.6bn of
authorised funds, which he called 'wasteful spending.'
Congress is now ready to send him a bill to cut even more, but is wielding
the scalpel in places the president had not selected, creating the
likelihood of a presidential veto.
Mr Bush's list of cuts targeted agricultural research programmes in the home
districts of influential Democratic senators and representatives.
The Democrats hit back by picking on administration spending, such as the
cost of a door-to-door chauffeur for the director of the Agency for
International Development.
Aside from this backbiting, the core of the debate has been over the future
of the Seawolf submarine, a very expensive boat whose usefulness is felt by
defence analysts to have died with the Soviet Union.
Mr Bush wanted to end the Seawolf programme after the one submarine already
under construction. The House of Representatives voted for two vessels.
The Senate - influenced by its two members from Connecticut, where the
Seawolf is built - wanted to build three. It preferred to trim funding for
the B2 stealth bomber and the Strategic Defence Initiative, drawing Mr
Bush's veto threat.
It was disingenuous of Mr Bush to call the Seawolf, whatever its merits or
demerits, an example of pork-barrel spending. Less than a year ago, his
administration fought to preserve the Dollars 2bn submarine.
Besides, the Seawolf's principal advocates, although motivated primarily by
concern for Connecticut jobs, can make a reasonable case for preserving the
US capacity to build nuclear submarines, even at the cost of building
vessels that are not needed.
Meanwhile, neither side has found the willpower to cut the big spending
programmes which are swelling the US budget deficit: social security and
medical insurance.

<TEXT>
NEWS OF the Tsing Mabridge contract was received yesterday with delight,
pride and some relief at Cleveland Structural Engineering, the
Darlington-based Trafalgar House subsidiary which has shed 400 jobs in the
last two years.
Managing director Mr Jeremy Beeton said the bridge superstructure accounted
for two thirds of the contract and involved 57,000 tonnes of steelwork, to
be divided between the Darlington factory and Mitsui of Japan.
The British company will be responsible for the project's most technically
critical element, the erection of the steel deck and its supporting cables.
The contract would mean a few new jobs for white-collar staff, to strengthen
teams working on other contracts.
Mr Beeton said the Tsing Ma bridge offered job security for the 750 workers
rather than substantial recruitment.
Cleveland Structural, which can fabricate 45,000 tonnes of steel a year at
Darlington, is continuing to pursue other contracts to supplement its
workload.
Steel sections of up to 20 tonnes will be shipped to an assembly yard in
China, made up into 1,800 tonne box sections and moved to the bridge site
for erection.

THE NEEDS of the environment will be taken into account in new international
trade rules resulting from the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, Mr Arthur
Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), told the Business Council for Sustainable Development in Lausanne.
In particular, the right of governments to set their own environmental rules
would be considered, Mr Dunkel said. The preamble to the final agreement
would include a commitment to implement new Gatt rules 'in the light of the
general need to preserve the environment and promote sustainable economic
development'. The agreement 'does not limit any government's right to pursue
its own environmental goals, provided the measures are used in a
non-discriminatory way', he said.
This assurance will go some way to quelling fears of environmental groups,
particularly in the US where they have a strong influence in the Congress.
They fear the agreement would ride roughshod over a country's right to
defend higher environmental standards.
A group of leading American companies and exporters is urging the Bush
Administration to ensure that a final agreement for the Uruguay Round
specifically allows countries to enforce legitimate food, health or safety
standards without fear that they will be accused of raising trade barriers.
US environmental and consumer groups have criticised the draft agreement for
the Uruguay Round submitted in December by Mr Dunkel, saying it threatens US
environment regulations.

FT  08 MAY 92 / Filipinos ponder choices as presidential election nears:
Jose Galang looks at the candidates' backgrounds and their chances of
succeeding Mrs Corazon Aquino as head of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEM with Filipinos, it is often observed, is that everyone wants to
be leader. This perhaps is the best explanation for the large number of
candidates vying for national and local government positions in next
Monday's general election.
There are seven candidates for president. Some 80,000 more are competing for
nearly 16,980 other positions - from vice-president to town mayors and
councillors.
Given the reputation also of most local politicians as poor losers, the
immediate task of unifying the nation after the bruising 90-day campaign
appears most daunting for the winners.
No clear winner is emerging among the presidential contenders. Mrs Miriam
Defensor Santiago, a former judge and immigration commissioner, has
consistently topped the polls.
But most analysts trivialise these, arguing that political machinery of the
big parties will play a big role. Mrs Santiago is running for the newly
formed People's Reform Party which pegs its agenda on a crusade against
corruption in government. The party was the only one not able to gain
official accreditation from the Commission on Elections (Comelec), which
recognised only six.
Comelec accreditation is important because it authorises the party to deploy
'watchers' at the polling centres and intervene in activities in case of
questionable acts. Parties accredited are also entitled to copies of the
Comelec certificate of canvas, the document on which any protests can be
based.
An awesome machinery is what Mr Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of
Representatives, is banking on. He is the standard bearer of the majority
Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), under whose wings the bulk of
incumbent officials are standing. The LDP's bid has also been boosted
recently by the 'implied' endorsement of Cardinal Jaime Sin, head of the
Roman Catholic archdiocese of Manila, whose influence over the predominantly
Catholic population is substantial.
However, Mr Mitra's image as a 'traditional politician' (referring to
old-style politics of patronage and largesse) is a handicap. The recent
discovery of LDP campaign printing materials at the House of
Representatives' printing office, furthermore, has imperilled his bid. He
and his entire line-up could be disqualified if his involvement is proven.
The Comelec is conducting an inquiry into the discovery of the printing
materials at the House in a 'raid' by leaders of the Lakas Edsa-National
Union of Christian Democrats, which is fielding Mr Fidel Ramos, former
defence chief. LDP officials, attempting to defelect attention from the
discovery, have warned that the 'raid' could be a preview of the militarist
rule of Mr Ramos if he wins.
Mr Ramos was head of the Philippine Constabulary, regarded as the most
undisciplined of the four military units during the martial law government
of former president Ferdinand Marcos. The human-rights record of the
military during Marcos' rule has been raked up as a campaign issue against
Mr Ramos.
Indeed, the past continues to hound most candidates in an election that
should be focusing on how the country could move briskly into the future.
Two big symbols of the excesses of the Marcos government - his widow Imelda
and his best-known crony Mr Eduardo Cojuangco - are also among the
presidential hopefuls. But while Mrs Marcos has only a slim chance, Mr
Cojuangco is considered one of the frontrunners at the home stretch.
Mr Cojuangco has diversified investments in local industries and is one of
the few candidates seen capable of putting up a credible programme to rev up
the economy. However, his involvement in monopolist policies in the Marcos
era, such as that in the coconut industry, is proving to be a tough stain to
expunge.
Mr Marcos allegedly provided Mr Cojuangco with a large financial base,
through the United Coconut Planters Bank, in the form of a levy on the
coconut industry.
Collected between 1973 and 1982, the levy brought in at least 9.7bn pesos,
of which a large part was apparently permitted to be used by Mr Cojuangco to
buy into various businesses, including San Miguel Corporation, the country's
largest industrial entity.
Along with Mrs Santiago, the only other candidates who have not been linked
to the tarnished past are Mr Salvador Laurel, Mrs Aquino's estranged
vice-president, and Mr Jovito Salonga, former Senate president. Mr Laurel,
owing to his bitter falling out with the Aquino administration, has
marginalised himself over the past years.
Mr Salonga, on the other hand, appears to offer a vision for the future
which so far has been attracting academics and certain left-leaning groups.
However, many of the country's jobless remember Mr Salonga's rejection last
year of a treaty to extend the stay of the US military facilities here.
Although their withdrawal will be not be completed until this summer, the
bases are now almost bare, as are the cupboards of the families who made
their livings there.
Unemployment is also a major problem in rural areas, where most of the 65
per cent of the population living below the poverty line reside.
Whoever replaces Mrs Aquino after the May 11 election may not enjoy the same
majority which swept her to power in 1986. However, he or she may be able to
provide the decisive leadership that Mrs Aquino clearly lacked .

FT  08 MAY 92 / Tajik opposition consolidates hold

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COALITION of Islamic and democratic opposition forces consolidated their
control of the Tajik capital Dushanbe yesterday, after their apparent
overthrow of the ex-Communist government.
The situation last night remained very tense with both sides allegedly still
holding hostages. Sporadic outbursts of gunfire continued throughout the
city and former Soviet army tanks were patrolling the streets near their
garrison.
A protocol agreement, aimed at ending the bitter dispute between the
opposition and the former communist government was yesterday signed by
representatives from both sides after 24 hours of negotiations and fighting
which left at least 20 people dead.
Under the agreement, the Communist government has been replaced by a
Revolutionary Coalition Council until parliamentary elections are held later
this year.
The democratically-elected president, Mr Rahmon Nabiyev is to be retained as
nominal head of state. However, Mr Nazrullo Dustov, the powerful hardline
vice-president, and other key government figures have been removed.
The whereabouts of Mr Nabiyev and government ministers is unclear after
reports that he had fled the capital.
How effective the protocol agreement will be in defusing the situation is
unclear.
Many of the more radical opposition factions bitterly oppose any form of
coalition with the former government. The opposition is divided over how
prominent a role Islam should play in the future government.
It seems unlikely that the northern regions of Tajikistan, traditionally a
Communist party stronghold, will peacefully accept the new regime.
A ceasefire has been declared and appeals have been made for all militia
groups to be dismantled. Although the garrison insists it will not intervene
in the conflict, it has been placed on full alert after two of its personnel
were shot dead last night.
Earlier in the day most of the pro-government militia groups and supporters
who had been guarding the parliamentary buildings left the city in a convoy
heading towards the Kulyab region, a stronghold of government support.
As they left, opposition gunmen and armoured personnel carriers bearing the
green Islamic flag overran the parliament amid a hale of indiscriminate
shooting and shouts of 'Praise to Allah'.
With weapons still spread throughout the city, further clashes and reprisals
remain likely.

The Russian government yesterday freed the price of vodka and gold,
implementing moves promised by the government earlier this year. Other price
controls are due to be phased out under a programme being fleshed out with
the International Monetary Fund.
A government spokesman said the freeing of the vodka price - which now
fetches Rbs120 a bottle on the black market - would eradicate corruption and
speculation connected with artificially low prices.
Vodka at controlled prices is already virtually unavailable in most Russian
cities, including St Petersburg where inhabitants have been given ration
cards supposedly entitling them to buy one bottle a month for Rbs45.
The state is to keep its monopoly on production of spirits - although
yesterday it gave up its monopoly on the production of beer and wine.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Baltic republic of Latvia yesterday introduced a parallel currency to
the rouble to make up for a shortage of rouble banknotes to pay salaries.
Mr Einars Repshe, chairman of the Latvian central bank, said he hoped
Russia, which is giving republics a choice of staying in a rouble zone or
setting up their own currencies, would not take retaliatory action.
The so-called Latvian rouble, which has been printed in Latvia, would
co-exist with the Soviet rouble, which Russia is now calling its own. 'From
today all salaries and wages are being paid with it,' he said.
Both currencies would be accepted in Latvian stores.
But he said that to avoid swelling the money supply, Soviet roubles would be
frozen in bank accounts and exchanged for new Latvian banknotes.
The Soviet currency could only be bought by Latvian inhabitants wishing to
purchase goods in the other former Soviet republics.
Mr Repshe said the decision to introduce the new currency was not in
reaction to a Russian ultimatum stating that only those republics that
observed strict monetary, budgetary, and credit policies from July 1 could
continue using the rouble as their currency.
A Russian spokesman said the move could cause problems but admitted Moscow
had no organised plan how to respond.
Mr Repshe said that Latvia would be ready to issue its own proper currency,
the lat, next year at the earliest. He said privatisation had to get under
way and Latvian enterprises had to become more competitive. In the mean
time, it would be prepared to join a tough financial policy with other
republics that was 'civilised'.
There are shortages of cash all over the former Soviet Union but because
Russia controls the printing presses, it has some discretion as to where
cash goes.

FT  08 MAY 92 / German competitiveness surviving a bruising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPETITIVENESS of Germany's exporters, as well as the stability of its
government, has been dented by the rise in wage inflation following German
unification.
But German will need a few more years of high pay settlements before the
relative gains in competitiveness of the last few years are whittled away.
German unit labour costs are now rising faster than those of its main
European competitors, as the right-hand charts shows. With exchange rates
now fixed in the European exchange rate mechanism, higher growth of unit
labour costs - the wage cost per unit of output produced - feeds directly to
lost export competitiveness.
But this rise in German pay inflation represents only a small erosion of the
relative competitiveness gains made by German industry over the past five
years. The rise in German unit labour costs since 1987 is still lower than
that of France, Italy and the UK.
German wage earnings have grown faster than those in France since 1987, the
date of the last important realignments within the ERM. But German's
superior productity growth record has meant that its unit labour costs, have
lagged behind those paid by French industry. Both the UK and Italy have had
faster earnings and unit labour cost inflation since 1987.
But German unit labour costs have been catching up rapidly since German
monetary unification in July 1990.
In part, the rise in German wage inflation results from the economic
consequences of German unification. The rise in consumer spending by east
Germans following the fall of the Berlin wall - and funded largely by
hand-outs from the western government - sparked a consumer boom.
But this rise in west German wage inflation was, and remains, unsustainable.
The Bundesbank has responded to rising inflationary pressures by pushing up
interest rates across Europe; and the government, faced with a ballooning
fiscal deficit, has pushing up income taxes. The recent crop of wage
demands, and ensuing strikes, is the direct manifestation of the refusal of
west German workers to accept a fall in their after-tax incomes.
But the wage acceleration also results from pre-unification tensions. The
latter half of the 1980s was a period of unusual wage restraint in west
Germany. In return for a drop in working hours, the unions agreed to
moderate their wage demands.
With hindsight, the unions underestimated the cost of the fall in working
hours. As a result the share of national income distributed to labour, as
opposed to capital, fell to levels not seen since the early 1970s. The
strikes partly result from their attempts to claw back their share.
But if recent pay trends are worrying for German exporters, they are
disastrous for those in the UK and Italy. Despite Germany's boom, and slow
or zero growth elsewhere in Europe, UK and Italian wage inflation remains
higher than in Germany. Unless wage inflation in these countries falls soon,
their competitiveness will quickly start to deteriorate again once
productivity growth returns to trend.

Correction (published 26th May 1992) appended to this article.
Graham Ford is leaving Brown Shipley Insurance Brokers to launch a new
national insurance broking venture. Ford, now 52, has been closely
identified with the growth of the Brown Shipley broking business and had
been involved in efforts to lead a management buy-out. After the failure of
these, however, Ford has joined forces with Merseyside-based Berkeley Burke
and Manson Reed, a broker which specialises in meeting the needs of sport
centres, bowling alleys and other leisure installations. Ford will be
managing director of the new venture, which is to be known as Burke Ford
Reed Insurance Management. The group hopes to obtain a full Lloyd's
registration within 18 months.

Correction (published 26th May 1992)
The FT stated on May 7 that Burke Ford Reed Insurance Management had 'joined
forces with Berkeley Burke'. This was incorrect. Burke Ford Reed has linked
up with Berkeley Burke Northern Group, a former subsidiary of the Berkeley
Burke Group, which also conducts insurance broking business and continues to
trade independently.

<TEXT>
Pepkor, the South African retail group, lifted attributable profits by 18
per cent in the year to February in which it took over Checkers, one of
three largest supermarket chains in South Africa.
Turnover rose by 118 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) following the
takeover of Tradehold and its subsidiary Tradegro which controls Checkers.
Operating profits was up by only 30 per cent, to R218.3m, reflecting the
larger contribution from food sales relative to clothes on which margins
were better.
Attributable income was 18 per cent up to R93.8m and there were
extraordinary profits of R75.3m.
Pepkor's results included losses and large write-offs at Tradegro which made
an operating loss of R30m on turnover of R2.2bn. It wrote off R46m in
rationalisation and other costs related to its incorporation into Pepkor.
Mr Christo Wiese, chairman of Pepkor and Pepgro, the holding company,
announced that the two companies would be raising R398m through rights
issues. Pepkor would raise R262.4m and Pepgro R135.5m.
Mr Wiese said Pepkor's 18 per cent growth was satisfactory given the
'extremely difficult trading conditions still prevailing, especially since
October 1991'.
He forecast a turnaround in trading conditions in the third quarter and said
he was confident of satisfactory results for the 1993 financial year. He
added it would take two or more years to bring Shoprite and Checkers, the
two food stores in the group, up to profitable levels.
The dividend was lifted by 15 per cent to 244 cents per share.

HOESCH, the German steel and engineering group merging with its former
rival, Krupp, says it is satisfied with its performance in the first third
of the current year.
Profits were slightly ahead of budget, and the core steel business made a
profit during the period. The order book was stable, Mr Kajo Neukirchen,
chief executive, said.
Hoesch also released its profits for 1991, which were down by almost a half
over the previous year at the operating level. It said it would hold 1991
dividend at DM10 per share.
Operating profits fell to DM262m (Dollars 158.70m) last year, down from
DM440m in 1990. Sales fell from DM16.14bn to DM13.31bn - reflecting not only
poor steel prices but also the decision not to consolidate the O&amp;K
construction equipment subsidiary.
Rationalisation measures meant that Hoesch Stahl, the core steel subsidiary,
broke even despite the 'incessant' fall in steel prices. Profits from other
areas - such as processing and industrial technology - were up but did not
reach 1990 levels.
The merger with Krupp is expected to be approved at the Hoesch annual
meeting on June 22.

THE Hong Kong government yesterday disclosed that its budget surplus for
last year was HKDollars 6bn (Dollars 779m) higher than its provisional
figure, revealed in March.
The extra Dollars HK6bn brings the budget surplus for 1991/1992 to more than
Dollars HK20bn.
Legislative councillors expressed concern over the government's apparent
inability to keep track of its finances.
Financial secretary Mr Hamish MacLeod's statement on the windfall surplus
was accompanied by a concession on his first budget.
He said he would not raise property rates by half a point to 6 per cent, as
proposed in his maiden budget speech two months ago.
A number of legislative councillors had said earlier that they would vote
against the rates increase, in spite of opposition by Mr MacLeod to any
tampering with his first budget. He told the Legislative Council yesterday
that the fall in revenue was 'roughly equivalent' to the windfall surplus.
Mr MacLeod said the increase was due to higher-than-expected revenue from
stamp duty, salaries and profits tax, first registration tax for vehicles,
and a shortfall in public works spending.

THE Egyptian government presented its 1992-93 budget to parliament
yesterday, cutting subsidies but increasing both military spending and civil
service salaries in line with inflation, Reuter reports from Cairo.
Egypt is part-way through a radical programme of economic reform, agreed
with the IMF last May.
The budget put spending for the year from July 1 at Dollars 18.9bn, up only
14 per cent against inflation of nearly 20 per cent.
The draft proposed a modest reduction in the budget deficit to Dollars
2.8bn. Targets agreed with the IMF include cutting the overall state budget
deficit to 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 from 9.5 per cent in 1991-92. The
draft budget covers only the central government and the IMF's targets are
based on all state spending.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Followers of Nasser form new party: Surprise as Egyptian
'opposition' party is sanctioned by court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITHOUT any fanfare, a political party bearing the name of Egypt's late
President Gamal Abdel Nasser has been quietly reconstituted in Egypt, but
commentators doubt it will become a force in the land.
Mohammed Sayed Ahmed, a columnist for the daily Al Ahram, said the decision
of an Egyptian court to sanction a Nasserite party after years of rebuffs,
reflected a desire by the government to extend Egypt's democratic base in
the almost certain knowledge that the new party would not pose a serious
challenge to the established order.
'The authorities no longer see it as a liability to have Nasserism as a
symbol of opposition,' said Mr Sayed Ahmed. 'Rather, they view the secular
Nasserites as a potential asset at a time when the religious trend is
gaining momentum.'
While the memory of Egypt's late president, who became a towering figure in
the Arab and developing world until he was diminished by the Arabs'
calamitous defeat in the 1967 war with Israel, remains strong at home, his
socialist-era rule from 1952-1970 is generally regarded to have been deeply
flawed, and to have contributed to many of Egypt's present ills.
Mona Makram Ebeid, an independent member of Egypt's parliament and a
sociology professor at the American University in Cairo, said the
Nasserites, to be known as the Arab Democratic Nasserist party (ADN), may
attract a 'nostalgia' vote, but doubted the party would become a rallying
point for disaffection.
'They have yet to put their house in order,' she said. 'They don't have a
charismatic leader, and their programme is still nebulous. One gets the
impression that they were surprised that they were accepted by the court.'
The Nasserites may, however, emerge as the main opposition bloc in Egypt's
parliament, the 454-seat People's Assembly, dominated by the National
Democratic Party with 348 seats.
At present the leftist Tugammu, or National Unionist Progressive Party, with
just six seats constitutes the only organised opposition. The remainder are
independents, some of whom might join the Nasserites.
Egypt's November, 1990, elections were boycotted by established
organisations such as the nationalist Wafd party, the Moslem Brotherhood,
the Socialist Labour Party and the Liberals.
The main opposition groupings said they boycotted the poll because they
could not be sure it would be free and fair.
Mohammed Faik, a former information minister under Nasser and one of the
leaders of the ADN, insisted this week that the party did not represent an
'idolisation' of Nasser. Rather, it wanted to use his legacy to promote Arab
unity and the 'excellent ideal of independent development.
'Nasserism is not a reactionary movement, it's not a theory, nor does it
mean a hero-worshipping,' he declared. 'It's just an experience affiliated
to Nasser ..'

FT  07 MAY 92 / EC aid of Dollars 496m to help redundant customs agents

THE European Commission yesterday set aside Ecu400m (Dollars 496m) to
retrain or re-employ 250,000 customs agents whose jobs will disappear when
European Community trade barriers fall at the end of 1992, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
'This is a very special sector,' tax commissioner, Ms Christiane Scrivener,
said after the 17-member Commission approved the special aid package: 'Up to
midnight December 31, 1992, they have to work.'
The Commission estimates 240,000 people work in 16,000 companies handling
internal Community customs documents and procedures. Tens of thousands are
expected to lose their jobs and others will have to retrain once internal
tax frontiers are abolished to create the single EC market.
Strike action by customs agents protesting against the job losses has caused
chaos at frontiers, ports and airports in France, Spain, Portugal and
Belgium. Ms Scrivener said the funds would only cover about 20 per cent of
the estimated Ecu2.3bn cost of the industry shakeout. She said member states
and customs had only belatedly accepted that barriers would really
disappear.

THE three central European countries of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland
yesterday agreed to consider how their entry into the European Community
could be co-ordinated.
At the same time, Presidents Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, Lech Walesa of
Poland, and Jozsef Antall of Hungary said they would step up economic,
political and security cooperation as as to speed up entry into the EC.
'We agreed that we will apply to the European Community together  .. if we
join our voices, our demands will be heard more strongly, than if we act
individually,' said Mr Havel.
The three presidents, who concluded a two-day meeting in Prague, the capital
of the Czech and Slovak republic, also jointly expressed their readiness to
recognise Macedonia, the former republic of Yugoslavia.
On the subject of greater European integration, the three presidents also
agreed to promote the possibility of Japan becoming an associated member of
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
Formal relations between Japan and the CSCE, the pan-European body which
includes former Soviet republics, were recently discussed between Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister and heads of state in Paris and Bonn.

FT  07 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Amstrad gains on rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY trading in Amstrad, for the second day running, left it 4 higher at 40
1/2 p, the biggest percentage gain in the London market yesterday. The rise
was sparked by rumours that chairman Mr Alan Sugar was buying stock. More
extreme talk even had him preparing to take the company private.
Both stories were dismissed by analysts as highly implausible and denied
emphatically by Mr Sugar, who put the rise down to 'speculative buying by
investors trying to make a quick profit'. The 8.2m shares traded followed
Tuesday's 7m.
Amstrad shares have been hit hard over the past 12 months as the recession
has begun to bite. A profits warning a year ago was followed by the group's
first-ever loss six months later. 'Since the share price collapsed, Amstrad
has been susceptible to all sorts of rumours,' said Mr Patrick Wellington at
County NatWest. 'I doubt if this old chestnut has any truth in it either.'
Gas deflated
A demand for gas price cuts prompted a sharp fall in British Gas as traders
assumed that any reductions would have a knock-on effect on profits.
Regulator Ofgas told the company to cut prices for domestic customers or
face possible regulatory action. The shares were down 8 at one stage before
rallying to close 2 1/2 off at 262 1/2 p with 12m traded.
A number of analysts said a price cut would have no effect at all as it was
related to inflation, and if inflation fell costs would also come down. The
share price was also hit by concern that first-quarter results, due next
Thursday, may be disappointing.
S &amp; N downgraded
Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle lost 6 to 463p in an active market of 3.6m
shares after Smith New Court downgraded its profits estimate for the current
year and for 1993.
Mr Mike McCarthy, drinks analyst at Smith, pointed out that Center Parcs,
the company's leisure division, has a large exposure to Benelux countries
and future profits may be influenced by problems involving the German
economy. He added that in the short term the performances of Bass, up 26 at
637p, and Grand Metropolitan, 14 stronger at 496p, are likely to be better
than S &amp; N.
Mr Christopher Wickham at Lehman Brothers noted that 20 per cent of S &amp; N's
volume is in the take-home trade, mainly involving off licences, and that
margins are being squeezed by the amount of this business going through
supermarkets.
A statement that the chief executive of Johnson Matthey was resigning his
post as non-executive director of Charter Consolidated raised a flurry of
speculation and the shares in both groups responded sharply.
Charter is the majority shareholder in Johnson and the resignation
immediately sparked speculation that it was either considering selling its
38.5 per cent stake or launching a bid for Johnson.
Apparently, the company said there was no significance in the management
change and the share prices ticked back slightly at the close. Charter ended
the day 11 ahead at 536p while Johnson Matthey closed 18 higher at 432p.
A strong two-way pull was seen in Rolls-Royce shares, sending turnover to
14m as the stock firmed 2 to 172p. The interest was prompted by an
announcement that China has placed an engine order worth around Pounds 100m.
Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. US buyers
were also said to have been in evidence, but County NatWest said the shares
had performed strongly since the beginning of the year and advised investors
to 'pause for breath and take profits'.
Disappointment with the tone of Tate &amp; Lyle's statement accompanying the
interim figures pushed the shares down 8 to 401p on turnover of 6m.
Food manufacturer JLI Group reported a successful rights issue, with 96.1
per cent of the 13.28m shares offered taken up and the remainder placed in
the market at a premium. JLI gained 4 to 124p.
US buying was behind a good performance for Glaxo which, also benefiting
from good news about its anti-nausea drug Zofran, climbed 23 to 774p.
Good first-quarter figures from BAT Industries prompted the shares to rally
24 to 805p.
Nervousness ahead of today's first-quarter figures left BP 1 1/2 easier at
262p.
US investors bought British Steel, which added 3 at 85p on high turnover of
12m. Smiths Industries gained 3 to 316p as it held meetings with its leading
investors.
Car dealer Lex Service rose 11 to 245p after informing investors at the
annual meeting that the UK car market had shown considerable improvement in
April. The market appreciated Lex's Pounds 46m acquisition of Swan National
Motor, formerly part of TSB.
Improved air traffic figures prompted British Airways to gain 4 1/2 to 292
1/2 p.
A larger than anticipated tax charge and higher than forecast borrowings
caused Trafalgar House to buck the general trend as it reported interim
profits in line with market forecasts. The shares eased 2 to 147p and
brokers cut full-year forecasts. County NatWest trimmed its estimate by
Pounds 15m to Pounds 120m and BZW's was cut by Pounds 8m to Pounds 125m.
BZW became the latest broker to downgrade Rank Organisation. The securities
house is looking for profits of Pounds 272m for this year, down Pounds 18m,
and Pounds 340m, off Pounds 30m, for 1993. However, Rank, which was off 6 at
one stage, rebounded to close 9 ahead on balance at 738p.

FT  07 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market surges to all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY overseas buying of June Footsie futures, principally by US investment
banks, and a rethink by domestic institutions of the equity market's
prospects after Tuesday's interest rate cut, saw the FT-SE 100-share Index
burst through its all-time peak and launch a determined but ultimately
unsuccessful attack on the 2,700 level.
At the close of another session of heavy trading the index stood at a record
2,698.7, up 36.5 on the day.
The market's previous all-time peak, an intraday level of 2,683.7, was
attained last September, coinciding with a reduction in bank base rates to
10.5 per cent. Since the Tories' general election victory the Footsie has
risen 262.3 points, or almost 11 per cent. Many dealers were caught on the
hop by a sudden transformation in the market's fortunes which took place
mid-morning.
Share prices had opened with widespread but moderate losses as marketmakers,
mindful of Wall Street's overnight decline and a general view of a period of
consolidation, were happy to cut dealing levels in the hope that the lower
prices would attract much needed stock into the market.
Opening some five points down, the Footsie proceeded to drift back and
registered a decline just exceeding nine points within an hour of the
opening, reflecting bouts of profit-taking, before embarking on a remarkable
rally which eventually propelled the index into virgin territory.
A couple of indifferent trading results, from Tate &amp; Lyle and Trafalgar
House, added to the early uncertainty.
The emergence of the big US-sourced buying orders in the Footsie future  -
one leading US house was said to have purchased 2,000 contracts and another
was heavily involved on the buy side - triggered a scramble to cover short
positions by other brokers, and the future promptly surged ahead.
The cash market, where buying interest revealed widespread short positions
in many stocks, went with futures and, by midday, was threatening to
puncture the all-time high. Shortly afterwards the index sailed through the
previous high and kept on going, helped by a firm opening on Wall Street,
until it met a flurry of resistance just short of 2,700.
The US buying was not confined to futures, but encompassed traditional North
American investment favourites such as Hanson, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham.
BAT, after good first-quarter results, was also well supported.
On the downside, Trafalgar House's halved interim dividend, in spite of the
increased profits, induced exceptionally heavy selling, while Tate &amp; Lyle's
half-year results and the post-figures meeting with sector analysts saw the
shares under pressure throughout the day.
British Gas was another notable underperformer, with the shares persistently
sold after Ofgas's demand for a cut in prices to customers. Mr Steve Turner,
energy specialist at Smith New Court, said Gas's warning on prices was: 'An
indication of a summer of discontent as far as relations between British Gas
and the industry regulator are concerned.' Seaq turnover in equities
totalled 637.1m shares.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Transport stocks lift Dow in
modest volume
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US STOCKS drifted higher yesterday, thanks partly to strength in the
transportation sector, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.06 higher at 3,369.41 after
unexceptional total volume on the NYSE of about 200m shares. Rises outpaced
declines by 1,012 to 680.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.05 easier at 416.79, but the Nasdaq
composite gained 1.29 to 589.36. On Tuesday, the Dow fell about 19 points.
Wall Street largely ignored the Federal Reserve's beige book of economic
activity, which showed an increase in activity, although conditions were
described as uneven. The market is more concerned with Friday's release of
employment data for April, which will provide the first piece of significant
economic news for the month and may indicate whether monetary policy is
likely to be eased further.
Transportation issues outpaced the general market for a second day, with the
Dow Jones Transportation Average climbing 13.45 to 1,407.70, after adding
13.46 a day earlier in a declining market.
USAir rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 14 3/4 in active trade amid speculation
that the company had reached a tentative labour agreement with its pilots'
union.
Among other airline issues, AMR, parent of American Airlines, was unchanged
at Dollars 68 7/8 , Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 60 3/4 and
UAL, parent of United Airlines, gained Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 126 3/4 .
Results continued to trickle in from the insurance sector, with Travelers
reporting first-quarter net income of Dollars 63m or 58 cents a share,
against Dollars 93m or 88 cents a year earlier. Shares in the company dipped
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20.
General Re, which fell sharply last week on the back of its quarterly
results, recovered Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 80 5/8 .
Unocal put on Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 7/8 after the Los Angeles-based
energy group said it plans to sell or place in joint ventures at least
Dollars 350m in non-strategic assets, eliminate at least 400 jobs and take
other steps to improve efficiency and profitability.
A number of blue chip stocks were active on the NYSE, including Exxon, down
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 1/4 , IBM, off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 93 5/8 ,
AT&amp;T, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 44 1/8 , and Ford, Dollars 5/8 firmer at
Dollars 45 1/2 .
In over-the-counter trading, technology and biotechnology stocks were
active. Sun Microsystems rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 and Apple
Computer improved Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 .
Chiron declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 in heavy trading. The company
has received US Food and Drug Administration approval to market its IL-2
Proleukin drug for use in cancer treatment.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed mixed after the composite index shuffled within a
10-point range during a trendless session, but trading volume was a heavy
30.5m shares, well above Tuesday's 23m.
The 300-share index was finally 3.2 off at 3,361.3, but advances narrowly
exceeded falls by 278 to 264.
Nine of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by transportation, up 2.1 per
cent as Laidlaw 'B' gained CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 11 1/2 . The gold group
climbed 2.0 per cent, led by American Barrick, CDollars 1 3/4 stronger at
CDollars 28 3/4 .

FT  07 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar under pressure again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was once again under pressure on foreign exchange markets
yesterday because of its large interest rate differential with the D-Mark,
writes James Blitz.
Although most London dealers feel that the Bundesbank council will not lift
the Lombard rate at its meeting today, overseas operators rushed to cover
their positions, buying D-Marks and selling dollars.
'Deep down, most people are still bullish about the dollar,' said Mr Jim
O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation. 'But with a 6 per cent
differential between the dollar and D-Mark, investors are starting to get
hurt.'
The US unit was adversely affected by comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
the Bundesbank president, that it was too early to sound the all-clear on
German monetary policy. And a repurchase agreement launched by the
Bundesbank in the German money markets dealt a second blow: the bank drained
nearly DM5bn from the money markets, and nudged up the 'repo' rate 5 basis
points to 9.65 per cent.
The dollar fell to a closing DM1.6305 in London, after opening at DM1.6405.
It also lost considerable ground to sterling, which ended at Dollars 1.7945
compared to Dollars 1.7825 the night before, and the US unit dropped to
FFr5.4950 from FFr5.5250. In New York the dollar closed lower at DM1.6287
and FFr5.4845, with the pound at Dollars 1.7975.
Traders were starting to refocus their attention on the yen, after a string
of public holidays had taken Tokyo dealers out of the market. The Japanese
unit ended firmer against the dollar after traders considered the
possibility of future intervention in its favour by the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries. 'More and more people are thinking that the
Japanese and the G7 are keen to get the yen higher,' said Swiss Bank's Mr
O'Neill.
Bullish sentiment over the yen was compounded by comments from the French
finance minister suggesting it is undervalued in the market. In London the
yen ended at Y132.40 against the dollar, after an opening Y133.10. In New
York the dollar slipped to Y132.25.
Sterling also appreciated yesterday, in spite of the Bank of England's 1/2
percentage point interest rate cut on Tuesday. It gained against all the
major European currencies and lost no ground to a resilient D-Mark, again
closing at DM2.9250. Dealers said the UK currency still has the advantage of
a solid political background and brighter prospects for the economy.
The French franc again performed strongly on thoughts that it might replace
the D-Mark as the central anchor in the EMS if Germany's economic problems
continue. Dealers took the suggestion with a pinch of salt, but the French
currency ended firmly against the D-Mark at around FFr3.3662.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Sterling trade quiet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A busy period in the sterling money market dominated by the Bank of
England's  1/2 percentage point base rate cut on Tuesday, dealing resumed a
much calmer tone yesterday.
The volume of futures trading was exceptionally small. The combined trade in
both the June and September short sterling contracts hovered around 16,000
lots yesterday.
'On a normally quiet day, trading in a front month contract would never be
less than 18,000 to 20,000 lots,' commented Mr Nick Parsons, head of the
Treasury Advisory Group at CIBC in London. 'But the general mood is that
this level of base rates will be here for some time to come.'
June short sterling ended the day at 89.93, implying that interest rates in
June will be at 10.07 per cent. Traders believe that the floor for short
sterling is now 89.88, indicating an interest rate of 10.12 per cent in
June. 'The knowledge that interest rates will not go up means that nobody
will sell it any way below that,' said one trader yesterday.
In the interbank market there was only a little movement in period rates.
Most of them, in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday's cut, were at 10 1/8
per cent. Yesterday, rates for everything from two months money to six
months firmed up to 10 3/16 per cent. One week money was at the easier rate
of 10 per cent, after forecasts of a much smaller shortage in the discount
market for the first half of next week.
Yesterday morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds
1.05bn in the discount market. In early operations, the Bank purchased bills
totalling Pounds 275m for resale to the market on May 27 at an interest rate
of 9 15/16 per cent.
In further operations, the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 262m, of
which Pounds 200m were Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 62m
were for resale to the market on May 27 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per
cent. The bank operated in the market in the afternoon, purchasing Pounds
147m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 10m of Band-2 bills
at 9 7/8 per cent.
In the German money markets, attention focused on the Bundesbank's decision
to sell DM19.3bn of 28-day funds and DM7.8bn of 56-day money at 9.65 per
cent, a rise of 5 basis points on previous rates.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's coffee output decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of trees producing coffee in Brazil has fallen from 4.2bn to
3.2bn since 1988, according to a survey by the National Coffee Council, a
producer group. The study says that the country's output is expected to drop
from the estimated 26m-28m sacks for last season to 18m-20m for 1992-93.
International prices for the commodity, now at the lowest level for two
decades, are primarily responsible for the decreased production, says Mr
Luiz Sergio de Paiva Pereira, director of the coffee division of the Pocos
de Caldas Regional Coffee Producers' Co-operative, in Minas Gerais state.
'Unless things turn around, we believe that output will continue to fall
gradually,' he predicts. 'At current prices, income doesn't even cover
production costs.'
The CNC study reveals that 55 per cent of the country's coffee plantations
are considered to be in a poor state of upkeep. Another 35 per cent are
believed 'unsatisfactory'. Yields are low, with 60 per cent of plantations
producing less than five bags (60 kg each) per hectare.
Many producers are shifting, where feasible, to alternative crops - to
sugar-cane and citrus fruits in the south-central state of Sao Paulo and to
soyabeans and wheat in the southern state of Parana, says Mr Pereira. But in
the mountainous regions in the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo,
'it is often a case of pure and simple abandonment', he says. Generally,
these farmers are using their land for cattle grazing, often without pulling
up the coffee plants.
The CNC is using the study to back its request for government assistance for
the coffee sector. It has developed a 74-point plan that includes proposals
for tax reductions, investment in productivity and the establishment of an
official body to carry out many of the functions once handled by the
Brazilian Coffee Institute, abolished by President Fernando Collor de Mello
when he took office in March 1990.
One of the sector's main requests, the roll-over of its debt, was fulfilled
by the government last week.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistani government plans to
increase sugar duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAKISTANI government is considering an increase in import duty on sugar,
in the country's annual budget to be announced next week, as a measure to
boost the domestic sugar market. However, the new rate of duty has still not
been decided.
A senior government official said yesterday that the measure was a way to
cut down on sugar imports at a time when a rise in domestic sugar production
had already created a surplus. The country's sugar mills have produced at
least 2.3m tonnes since October last year, while another 50,000 tonnes are
expected to be produced this month.
Surplus sugar stocks depress prices in the local market and therefore create
economic difficulties for sugar mill owners and sugar-cane farmers,
officials and traders say.
Although wheat, cotton and rice account for about 70 per cent of the
country's annual crop output, sugar-cane is right behind them as one of the
more important crops of the remaining 30 per cent.
The government has also been trying to promote sugar trading in the private
sector as a way to reduce the public sector's participation in commodity
trading.
Pakistan's imports of sugar during the past 9 months have largely been
secured through operators in the private sector, officials say.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India aims to woo fishery
investors

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA IS aiming to build on the impressive growth it has achieved in the
past two years in the export of marine products.
It is planning to encourage the participation of foreign companies in deep
sea fishing, coastal aquaculture and production and marketing of value-added
sea food in consumer packs.
Joint ventures, in which the foreign partners can have majority equity
participation, will be allowed to import new as well old vessels for fishing
and given freedom to hire 50 per cent of their crews abroad.
The Indian Marine Products Export Development Authority has been assigned
the task of wooing foreign investors. According to industry experts, India's
2m sq km (770,000 square miles) of sea area offers a potential catch of more
than 4.5m tonnes of seafood a year.
At present, however, the annual harvest is only about 2.3m tonnes. India has
nearly 1.4m hectares (3,500 acres) of brackish, marshy lands on the sea
coast offering vast scope for aquaculture, of which less than 70,000 ha has
so far been brought into production.
Out of the 60 varieties of shrimp found in Indian waters, six have so far
been identified as suitable for aquaculture. A number of big Indian
companies, including the Tatas, ITC, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Thapars, DCM and
Escorts, have plans for major investments in aquaculture. The government
believes, nevertheless, that without foreign participation India's progress
in capture and culture fishery will be less than satisfactory.
The country's marine products exports in the year to March 1992 increased by
10.75 per cent to Dollars 557.42m. In terms of quantity, it shipped 171,989
tonnes representing a growth of 23.36 per cent.
According to Mr CT Sukumaran, chairman of Impeda, Japan continues to be the
single biggest market for Indian marine products, accounting for 50 per cent
of exports by value. The other important markets for India are Western
Europe, the US, Singapore and Hong Kong.
The dominant export item is frozen shrimp, which constitutes more than 70
per cent of the total export value of marine products. India also exports
lobster, squid, shark fins and fresh and frozen fish.
If Impeda succeeds in its mission to attract adequate foreign investment and
if Indian business houses' new-found interest in marine products is
sustained, then India should be able to achieve its export target of Dollars
1.184m by 1996-97, the final year of its eighth five year plan.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Bunds rally on speculation of end to
10-day strike
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government bond market staged a rally yesterday, buoyed by
speculation that talks today would end the 10-day-old strike by public
sector workers.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, closed at
87.16 from an opening level of 86.89 and close to the day's high of 87.21.
Volume was a heavy 71,000 contracts for the second day running.
In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent Unity Fund 10-year bond issue
closed at around 100.08, from an opening of 99.85, for a yield of 7.99 per
cent.
Employers and union officials are due to hold talks today aimed at ending
the dispute over pay.
The Bundesbank council also meets today, although analysts are not expecting
any change in monetary policy.
Yesterday, the Bundesbank kept monetary conditions tight, draining a net
DM5bn from the money market in regular repurchase operations.
As a result, call money crept up to 9.70 per cent, from 9.65 per cent, and
close to the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate - the emergency funding rate for
financial institutions.
The rise in the bund market helped other European markets to rally. For
example, the benchmark French government 8 1/2 per cent OAT maturing 2002
closed the day  1/2 -point higher for a yield of 8.68 per cent, from 8.76
per cent on Tuesday.
The French market also rose on speculation that the government would use
today's money market tender by the Bank of France to signal a cut in
interest rates following Tuesday's  1/2 point cut in UK base lending rates.
As a result, the French market out-paced German bonds. The yield spread
between the two markets at the 10-year maturity narrowed from 73 basis
points at the opening to 69 basis points by the close.
The Italian market was also lifted by speculation that interest rates may be
lowered in line with the UK.
The benchmark 12 per cent Italian government bond maturing January 2002
closed at 98.61, up from 98.42 on Tuesday. Trading volume in the cash market
was L14,200bn, the highest recorded.
THE UK government bond market was led higher by the strength of continental
European markets yesterday, with trading volume light in the absence of new
domestic factors.
The long-dated cash benchmark, the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011, closed up
 5/16 of a point on the day at 99 23/32 for a yield of 9.02 per cent.
On Liffe, the June gilts futures contract finished at 98.20, from an opening
level of 98.13. Trading volume was light at 29,000 contracts.
US TREASURY prices firmed across the length of the yield curve following the
successful completion of the second stage of the Treasury's Dollars 36bn
refunding auctions yesterday afternoon.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up  15/32 at 100
7/16 , yielding 7.96 per cent. Gains were less pronounced at the short end
of the yield curve, where the two-year note was  1/32 higher to yield 5.22
per cent.
The Federal Reserve, as the market had expected, refrained from operating in
the open market. Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were
changing hands at 3 per cent during the Fed's usual intervention period.
Short-covering contributed to the higher prices after the afternoon's sale
of Dollars 11bn of 10-year notes, which had a better-than-expected average
yield of 7.53 per cent.
JAPANESE government bond prices firmed overnight in Tokyo, having been
closed for public holidays on Monday and Tuesday and suffering a run of
negative sentiment last week.
The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a
yield of 5.635 per cent, a touch higher than the 5.675 per cent seen on
Friday.
Dealers said the authorities indicated that an auction of 10-year bonds
scheduled for today would carry a higher coupon than last month's sale of
5.5 per cent paper.
Analysts are now expecting a Y800bn auction of 5.7 per cent paper, although
a smaller Y600bn issue of 5.6 per cent stock is still possible.

<TEXT>
CHIRON, the US biotechnology company, has received approval from the US Food
and Drug Administration to market Interleukin-2, a long-awaited treatment
for aggressive kidney cancer.
The approval marks the end of an eight-year struggle to bring to the US
market what had widely been regarded as one of the most promising products
of the US biotechnology industry.
Interleukin-2, to be sold under the brand name Proleukin, was developed by
Cetus, a biotechnology concern acquired by Chiron last year after the long
and expensive approval process drained Cetus's resources.
Proleukin, which harnesses the power of the body's immune system to attack
cancer cells, was originally hailed as a breakthrough in cancer therapy.
However in clinical trials the drug was found to benefit only a minority of
patients and to have severe side effects.
Proleukin shrank tumors in about 15 per cent of patients, with 4 per cent
achieving complete remission, but another 4 per cent died from side effects
of the drug. However, the trial results were better than for those patients
receiving conventional chemotherapy treatment, of whom only about 5 per cent
survived.
Chiron's share price rose sharply on Monday, gaining Dollars 6 1/2 to close
at Dollars 48 1/4 in anticipation of the approval. Chiron's stock fell
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 at close of trade yesterday.

WESFARMERS, the diversified Australian agricultural group, yesterday said it
was confident of meeting its full-year net profit target of ADollars 60m
(USDollars 45.4m) after reporting a 77 per cent increase in profits to
ADollars 38m for the first nine months, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Sales
were up from ADollars 877m to ADollars 984m.
The group said lower interest rates and greater efficiency in the
fertilisers and chemicals division contributed towards the better
performance. In addition, fertiliser sales were higher than in the
comparable period of last year.
Wesfarmers said demand for cropping fertilisers grew strongly in response to
improved wheat prices. The coal, dairy and retail operations contributed
improved results, while profits from the gas and transport operations
remained steady.
The group said it was confident of meeting its full-year profit target, but
warned the result was difficult to predict because of the possible effect of
weather between April and June, when most fertiliser sales take place.

PEPKOR, the South African retail group, lifted attributable profits by 18
per cent in the year to February in which it took over Checkers, one of
three largest supermarket chains in South Africa.
Turnover rose by 118 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) following the
takeover of Tradehold and its subsidiary Tradegro which controls Checkers.
Operating profit rose 30 per cent, to R218.3m, reflecting the larger
contribution from food sales relative to clothes on which margins were
better.
Attributable income was 18 per cent up at R93.8m and there were
extraordinary profits of R75.3m.
Pepkor's results included losses and large write-offs at Tradegro which made
an operating loss of R30m on turnover of R2.2bn. It wrote off R46m in
rationalisation and other costs related to its incorporation into Pepkor.

WOOLWORTH, the US retailer, yesterday reported a small Dollars 17m profit

Sales during the first quarter, the least significant of a retailer's year,
fell by 1.5 per cent to Dollars 2.01bn. However, the 1992 figure excludes

At the operating level, Woolworth's profits improved by 20 per cent to

<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pacific suffered a first-quarter loss of CDollars 39.7m (USDollars
33.3m) or 12 cents a share, in spite of a strong performance by the group's
railway business. The latest deficit at the Canadian conglomerate compares
with a loss of CDollars 5.3m or 2 cents a share, a year earlier.
Total revenues were CDollars 2.42bn, against CDollars 2.46bn last time.
Canada's railways are busy moving record exports of grain, via Vancouver, in
the first quarter and CP Rail almost doubled its operating income to
CDollars 73.5m.
The rail side was buoyed by the fact that expenses increased only slightly
because of higher efficiency and lower fuel prices.
CP Rail has just agreed to annual pay increases of 3 per cent in 1992 and
1993 with most of its unions.
The improved railway results were more than offset by lower income from Pan
Canadian Petroleum, the energy arm, and also contin-uing losses at Canadian
Pacific Forest Products.
The operating loss at CP Forest Products grew to CDollars 83.6m from
CDollars 61.4m a year ago.
CP Ships narrowed its loss with higher container rates, CP Trucks saw its
loss increase, but Fording Coal managed to lift its income to CDollars
22.4m, up nearly CDollars 9m, because of lower operating costs.
Marathon Realty's results were off slightly due to problems in the office
building sector. This unit in April arranged the sale of CDollars 160m of
properties, the proceeds of which will be used to repay debt.
The hotels unit reduced its losses, though the market remains soft. The US
Doubletree chain did better, with new management contracts and lower
overheads.
Telecommunications were unchanged, while the industrial products group
improved.
CP's 19 per cent interest in Laidlaw, the waste management group, generated
income of CDollars 3.8m, against a loss of CDollars 3.9m a year earlier.
CP expects some improvement in overall performance later this year, as the
North American economy recovers from the long recession.

FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics plans sale of
missiles operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the second largest Pentagon contractor, aims to sell off
businesses which contribute about one-quarter of its revenues - including
its large missiles operation - in a radical plan to cope with the shrinking
defence market.
It is in the final phase of negotiating the sale of the missiles business,
and could announce a deal soon, Mr William Anders, the chairman, said
yesterday.
Mr Anders, who has been sharply reducing the size of the company since he
took over as chairman in 1991, told the annual meeting General Dynamics
would adapt to the 'new realities' of the defence market by concentrating on
four core areas: tactical aircraft, nuclear submarines, armoured vehicles
and space launch systems.
It recently sold its Cessna business aircraft subsidiary to Textron, and has
adopted a 'plan of contraction' which involves selling other non-core
businesses accounting for some Dollars 2.3bn of the group's Dollars 8.7bn of
annual revenues.
The list is headed by the missiles operation, which had sales last year of
Dollars 1.3bn and consists of two parts: an air defence systems division,
which makes tactical products such as the Stinger and Standard missiles; and
a section of the group's Convair subsidiary, which makes the Tomahawk
sea-launched cruise missiles used during the Gulf war.
Mr Anders said the missiles business had been seriously considered as a
potential core business. However, it could not become the leader in a field
which included nearly a dozen firms in the US alone. During talks with
numerous other companies, 'we found more interest in the purchase of our
operations than the sale of their own'.
Other parts of the group up for sale include the remainder of Convair, which
makes fuselages for the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 commercial aircraft; the
electronics division, which is a leading producer of avionics test
equipment; and a materials division which produces aggregates, concrete,
lime and coal.
Mr Anders' strategy is radically different from that of most defence
contractors, which have reacted to the shrinking Pentagon budget by trying
to diversify into non-defence areas. He said yesterday the benefits of
diversification were 'largely illusory'.
The restructuring of the group has helped increase the company's cash and
marketable securities to Dollars 1.2bn at the end of March. Mr Anders said
the company was generating cash 'well in excess' of that needed to meet
investment and debt reduction needs. He continued to favour some
distribution to shareholders. The company's shares closed down Dollars 1 at
Dollars 64 7/8 .

<TEXT>
Shortly after 10 o'clock this morning, in the nondescript town of
Wilmington, Delaware, the banging of an auctioneer's gavel should signal a
most ignominious fate for MGM, the once legendary Hollywood studio.
The auction is mainly a formality - the mechanism by which Credit Lyonnais
of France forecloses on a huge loan default and takes possession of MGM
stock by swapping around Dollars 400m of loans for 98.5 per cent of the
studio's shares.
In theory, anyone hoping to outbid the French state bank creditor and buy
MGM could come along this morning with at least Dollars 570m of cash in hand
 -Dollars 400m for the shares and another Dollars 170m for related loan
commitments. But MGM suffered a Dollars 347m loss last year, and will need a
further Dollars 200m of cash to make it through the current year. It's no
bargain.
Rather, the foreclosure by Credit Lyonnais is intended as the definitive
severing of ties between the Paris-based bank and Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the
controversial Italian financier from whom the shares are being taken away.
The mercurial Mr Parretti, who is still appealing a four-year jail sentence
in Naples on fraud charges, refuses to accept defeat. As recently as this
week he claimed he would win out over Credit Lyonnais, but as far as the
bank is concerned, a recent US injunction has rendered Mr Parretti more of a
nuisance than a threat.
Worse, from Credit Lyonnais's point of view, the ill-starred association
with the stocky former waiter has shocked many of its blue-chip clients and
investors and is costing the bank dearly.
The doubling of its 1991 bad debt provisions, to FFr9.5bn (Dollars 1.71bn),
is believed to have included part of the MGM exposure. According to
information obtained by the Financial Times, Credit Lyonnais's present loan
exposure to MGM and to Mr Parretti's various companies amounts to Dollars
1.25bn.
MGM was suffering long before November 1990, when Mr Parretti paid Dollars
1.3bn - most of it borrowed from Credit Lyonnais  - to acquire the studio.
The studio's difficulties were the result of the juggling of assets and
repeated sacking of executives by Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the Las Vegas nightclub
owner who had owned MGM since 1969.
When Mr Parretti bought MGM, he had as a partial backer, Mr Steve Ross, the
fast-talking chairman of Time Warner who promised Dollars 650m of loan
guarantees in exchange for right to the MGM film library. Within months Time
Warner claimed it had been betrayed and sued Mr Parretti for breach of
contract. In yet another reversal, Time Warner then decided to make peace
and do business again with Mr Parretti.
Mr Ross and Time Warner have come under harsh criticism for the association
with Mr Parretti, but they got a home video distribution deal on the cheap.
From the very start most of Wall Street and Hollywood were betting Mr
Parretti would not last very long at MGM, and rightly so.
By March 1991 - just four months after Mr Parretti took over the desk once
owned by Louis B. Mayer - a group of MGM unpaid creditors sued to force the
studio into bankruptcy.
Credit Lyonnais, alarmed at the deteriorating state of affairs, sent two top
executives to Hollywood, provided MGM with an emergency Dollars 145m fresh
line of credit and insisted as a condition that Mr Parretti give up his
position at Pathe, his master company, and at MGM.
In his place as chairman Mr Parretti put Mr Cesare De Michelis, the brother
of his old friend and fellow nightclub habitue Mr Gianni De Michelis,
Italy's Socialist foreign minister. Mr De Michelis lasted less than a month
before Mr Parretti and the French bank began to sue one another.
By the summer of 1991 the legal battle between Credit Lyonnais and Mr
Parretti had degenerated into a slanging match. Lawsuits flew back and forth
in America.
By late December 1991 the chancery court in Delaware, where MGM is
incorporated, had thrown out all of Mr Parretti's claims and upheld the
right of Credit Lyonnais to remove him and his associates. Mr William Allen,
the presiding judge, even declared that Mr Parretti 'did not give truthful
testimony when he testified under oath in this court'.
Mr Parretti could not be in Delaware to hear the verdict; he spent late
December in a Sicilian jail, accused of tax evasion.
Down, but not forgotten, the controversial Italian returned to the fray two
months ago, claiming that a Rome judge had ordered the sequester of MGM
stock and once again named the brother of Italy's foreign minister as MGM
chairman. It was at this stage that Credit Lyonnais secured the binding
Delaware injunction that ruled any Rome judge's views to be irrelevant under
US law.
With today's foreclosure auction, Credit Lyonnais is seeking to sever all
ties to Mr Parretti. True to form, Mr Parretti yesterday told the Financial
Times he considered the auction to be 'phony' and swore once again that Mr
De Michelis would be named to MGM.
The voluble Italian even argued he was not really in default on his loans
from Credit Lyonnais. 'How can I be in default? They never really asked me
to pay interest,' he maintained. Asked how much he had borrowed from the
French bank, Mr Parretti then claimed: 'I can't remember.'
Mr Parretti may not recall, but the amounts are considerable. It has been
learned that the Dollars 1.25bn total of Credit Lyonnais loan exposure
includes nearly Dollars 650m of loans to MGM itself, plus another Dollars
595m to three of Mr Parretti's holding companies - Comfinance, Melia and
Pathe Communications.
Credit Lyonnais is owed some Dollars 75m by Comfinance, a company that
jointly controls MGM by way of two other vehicles - Melia and Pathe. Melia
owes some Dollars 400m, including interest, while Pathe, owes Dollars 120m,
including interest.
Although Credit Lyonnais will convert about Dollars 400m of these loans into
equity as payment in today's auction, the bank will still be left with
Dollars 850m of combined MGM and Parretti-company debt on its books. The
bank does not expect to be able to sell MGM until the shattered studio can
begin producing profitable films, and that is likely to take at least
another two years.
Internal bank plans call for financial support of at least Dollars 200m this
year, and probably as much again in 1993.
That means that by early 1994, assuming MGM is profitable and saleable again
 -a big if in itself  - Credit Lyonnais will be sitting on a total outlay of
more than Dollars 1.2bn again.
Put simply, Credit Lyonnais is likely to be stuck in Hollywood, with heavy
loan exposure and a battered and loss-making studio on its hands, for quite
some time. Today's auction thus may represent a new beginning for MGM, but
at blockbuster cost.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Morland rises 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORLAND &amp; Co, the Thames Valley brewer which announced in March that it was
talking to potential bidders, lifted interim pre-tax profits 30 per cent
from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 3.06m.
'At a time when there has been some speculation about the corporate future
of the company, there has been no such uncertainty in our trading
performance,' said Sir Humphrey Prideaux, the Morland chairman.
However, The company's efforts to resolve problems stemming from the
government's beer orders were reflected in an extraordinary charge of Pounds
236,000 for advisers' fees.
The problems involve Whitbread Investment Company's 43.6 per cent stake.
Unless this is reduced, WIC's sister company, Whitbread, will have to count
Morland's 300 pubs as part of its tied estate and offload more pubs to meet
the requirements of the beer orders.
Morland's results for the six months to March 31 were boosted by last year's
purchase of 100 pubs from Courage. Turnover rose some 23 per cent to Pounds
18.9m (Pounds 15.4m), and operating profit increased 49 per cent to Pounds
3.41m (Pounds 2.29m).
Volume sales of Morland ales improved 13 per cent. Sales of Old Speckled Hen
premium ale doubled and free trade volumes were 17 per cent up. Pub food
sales rose 38 per cent.
There was a provision of Pounds 250,000 against potential bad debts in its
Pounds 3m free trade loans.
Earnings per share rose to 10.5p (9.1p) and the interim dividend is lifted
to 2.42p (2.11p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in the second half enabled Forward Group, the USM-traded printed
circuit board manufacturer, to report profits of Pounds 622,000 pre-tax for
the 12 months to January 31.
The outcome compared with Pounds 955,000, including exceptional credits of
Pounds 118,000, and was, according to Mr Ray Chamberlain, chairman, a 'most
satisfactory' result given the economic climate. Interest charges fell from
Pounds 399,000 to Pounds 231,000.
The current year had continued the improvements of the second half, he said
and trading subsidiaries had started the year 'materially better' although
there was still 'fierce pressure' on prices reflecting competition.
Turnover declined 11 per cent to Pounds 9.33m (Pounds 10.5m). Earnings per
share emerged at 5.69p (8.95p) and a proposed final dividend of 1.5p brings
the total to 2.5p (2.2p).

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: LIT recovers to Pounds 1.29m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of its UK operations helped LIT Holdings to produce a much
improved result for 1991.
Pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.29m for the year compared with a loss of Pounds
344,000 in 1990 for this financial services group.
Turnover was Pounds 83m (Pounds 91.1m) but operating profits from Johnson
Fry rose 50 per cent from Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 2.4m and LIT America
contributed Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 2.52m).
Both businesses are seasonal, so the bulk of profits were accrued in the
first half when the pre-tax profit was higher at Pounds 1.92m (Pounds
838,000).
Central charges fell to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 4.45m) benefiting from the
refinancing of short-term debt into medium-term debt and redeemable
preference shares. Dividend payments on these shares took Pounds 203,000
after which losses per share were reduced to 1.4p (3p).

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Beattie tackles tough times
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES BEATTIE, the Wolverhampton-based department store operator, saw
pre-tax profit decline by 14 per cent, from Pounds 9m to Pounds 7.73m, in
the year to January 31 1992.
Against the depressed background it was a commendable performance, said Sir
Eric Pountain, chairman.
Operating profit in the second half was only 6 per cent lower than last
year, and compared with a drop of 34 per cent in the first half. The
important Christmas trade was very late to develop.
Sales edged ahead to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds 67m) excluding VAT, and operating
profit was nearly 13 per cent lower at Pounds 5.25m. There had been tight
control on costs and the group also resisted the temptation to secure sales
volume by surrendering margins, Sir Eric said.
Investment income and interest declined to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 3m)
reflecting the downward movement of interest rates. Earnings per share were
11.3p (13.03p) and the final dividend is 4.35p for a total of 5.75p (5.5p).

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Silentnight ahead to Pounds 12.4m but loses
sleep over first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILENTNIGHT Holdings, Europe's biggest bed maker, yesterday warned over the
outlook for profits in the first half, with deep discounting by retailers
having eroded margins in the first three months of the year.
Mr Bill Davies, chairman, said that sales were currently ahead of last year.
However, he said high street discounting was affecting margins in the
group's two middle market bed businesses - Silentnight and Layezee.
'The first half is going to be very difficult,' he said. Unless there was a
change, 'profits will be affected.'
The warning accompanied record profits of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.5m) for
the year to February 1. Turnover fell 9 per cent to Pounds 137.6m, following
the disposal in 1990 of the upholstery division for Pounds 9m. On a
like-for-like comparison, sales were 5 per cent higher at Pounds 137.8m.
The profits advance was helped by interest gains of Pounds 690,000 on the
group's Pounds 13m cash balance, compared with a charge of Pounds 97,000
last time.
The final dividend is increased by 1p to 5.75p for a total of 8p (7p),
payable from earnings per share ahead 7 per cent to 17.92p.
Mr Barry McKenzie, finance director, said all four bed companies had
improved their contributions with sales rising from Pounds 90.7m to Pounds
94.9m. He said that the group had, by his calculations, improved its market
share in the UK from 30 per cent to 31 per cent.
In the cabinet furniture division, sales rose by 18 per cent in a declining
market. Homeworthy, the lower-to middle market range of furniture, was
strongly ahead following heavy capital investment, although Silentnight
Cabinets produced disappointing results.
Gross margins improved from 34.8 per cent to 36.7 per cent due to a better
product mix, said Mr Davies.
The US division suffered losses, although Mr McKenzie said they were not
significant in terms of the overall group. Sales in the US were down 20 per
cent at Pounds 9.5m. Mr McKenzie added that Silentnight did not expect the
US business to 'come back rapidly' this year.
COMMENT
These figures begin to show the benefits of Pounds 11.5m in capital spend,
but there is more to come. The Pounds 8.5m pencilled in for this year will
be spent on more plant and also on a TV advertising campaign to maintain the
Silentnight brand. That is good news for the medium-term investors, who will
be less shy of the fact that the shares have had a good run lately, rising
by 88p in 12 months to last night's 245p. The balance sheet remains strong
although critics would argue that the family-controlled company could use
the cash to better effect. Forecasts are for Pounds 14m this year, in spite
of the cautious noises about margins, and the shares look attractive with a
prospective p/e of about 12 times.

THE BOARD of BHH Group has recommended a Pounds 21.3m cash bid from IM
Group, a private distribution company controlled by Mr Robert Edmiston,
chairman of BHH.
The offer, which has been irrevocably accepted by shareholders representing
39.5 per cent of the equity, is worth 36p per share. BHH shares closed
unchanged at 34p. The property company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
4.7m on turnover of Pounds 25.8m in 1991.
BHH said it was cutting costs, but was unlikely to return to profitability
unless there was a sustained and significant improvement in the property
market. It believed it would be better placed to continue with the support
of, and access to, the funds of IM Group.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds takeover not in public interest,
says Bifu - The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LLOYDS takeover of Midland Bank would lead to monopoly banking in some
towns and would not be in the public interest, Bifu, the banking union, will
tell MPs today, writes Catherine Milton.
The union is trying to increase support for a referral of the bid to the
monopoly authorities because it believes 30,000 jobs and 1,100 branches are
at risk if it succeeds.
In a dossier sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
all MPs and British Euro MPs, the union explains why it believes the merger
would not be in the public interest.
'Such a merger would be harmful to customers and staff and to the UK economy
since it would lead to unemployment and reduce competition.
A number of towns currently have only a Lloyds and a Midland branch and
there would, in effect, be monopoly banking in those towns. The customer
would lose a choice.'
The union rejects the argument that the UK has too many bank branches,
saying it ranks equal fourth with France among nine leading nations for the
number of branches per head of population.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Suitors to lobby MPs next week - The Battle
for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOBBYING of members of parliament by Midland's two suitors will begin in
earnest next week when senior executives from both Hongkong Bank and Lloyds
are expected to meet Conservative backbenchers.
A meeting with Mr William Purves has been provisionally arranged for next
Wednesday or Thursday when the Hongkong Bank chairman is due in London.
MPs are understood to have offered Lloyds a similar opportunity although
details have yet to be finalised. It is expected that all Tory backbenchers
will have the option of attending the meetings.
The standard format is for those addressing such gatherings - usually
scheduled to last about an hour - to be given up to 15 minutes to present
their case before fielding questions.
Mr Tim Smith, the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield and an officer of the
Tory backbench finance committee in the last parliament, is understood to
have played a leading role in arranging the meetings. Such is the geographic
spread of the groups involved that interest among MPs is likely to be
exceptionally widespread.
Midland is next week expected to follow the example of its suitors in
writing to all MPs.
MPs recently received a letter from Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman,
arguing that the Hongkong offer failed to address 'the fundamental problems
in the UK banking sector.' Hongkong Bank is expected to send out its own
letter to MPs shortly.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, will this
week field his first written questions on the tussle for Midland.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour front bench spokeswoman on City and corporate
affairs, is to ask Mr Heseltine when he expects to be informed both of the
EC competition directorate's views on the Hongkong proposals and of the
Office of Fair Trading's opinion of the possible takeover of Midland by
Lloyds.
Mr Heseltine will also be asked whether he proposes any amendment to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's present approach to potential takeovers
in which the implication for competition is the sole criterion taken into
consideration.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Buoyant BAT says US riots will not hit profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, said yesterday the
riots in Los Angeles should not affect the profits of its Farmers Group
subsidiary, a leading provider of insurance to small businesses in
California.
The details emerged as BAT announced a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax
profit to Pounds 262m in the first quarter of this year, with tobacco making
a record Pounds 209m at the trading level. Group turnover advanced from
Pounds 3.63bn to Pounds 3.87bn, and earnings per share from 7.9p to 8.7p.
BAT was able to provide a snapshot of the riot claims coming in to the three
reciprocal insurance exchanges which Farmers manages - obtaining its profit
from fees on premiums, rather than from underwriting.
By yesterday, about 300 riot-related claims had been received. The total
amount was expected to reach at least Dollars 70m (Pounds 39.5m).
Estimates of the total damage in all the cities affected have ranged from
Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn, but it is not clear how much was insured.
To put the riot claims in perspective, Mr Michael Prideaux, public affairs
director, said claims arising from a hailstorm in Texas last week had
amounted to Dollars 70m and the total for last year's Oakland fire was
Dollars 130m.
Bought for about Pounds 3.2bn in late 1988, Farmers increased its trading
profit to more than Pounds 100m in the first quarter. Sir Patrick Sheehy,
chairman, said that after financing costs there was a Pounds 60m
contribution to group profits.
Its profit and that of Allied Dunbar, the UK life business, were again
eroded by losses at Eagle Star, the composite insurer hit by mortgage and
other recession-related provisions. Overall, financial services saw its
first-quarter trading profit fall from Pounds 112m to Pounds 95m.
Tobacco was again a strong performer, increasing trading profit by 11 per
cent to Pounds 209m.
Sir Patrick said cigarette export volumes were 18 per cent ahead. Kent and
Lucky Strike had maintained their success, while State Express 555 had
become the UK's largest export brand.
New markets included Hungary, while penetration continued to increase in
Japan and Korea. Brazil had returned to profit and had recently ended 27
years of price controls on cigarettes.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Trafalgar House halves dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the property, construction and engineering group, halved
its dividend as pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 increased 18
per cent on the back of a strong performance from construction and
engineering.
Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, said the group would focus on construction
and engineering which had an order book of almost Pounds 4bn as he unveiled
pre-tax profits of Pounds 54m compared with Pounds 45.5m. Turnover increased
from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 2.1bn.
Sir Eric said the cut in the interim dividend, from 8.8p to 4.4p, which was
signalled last year, would help mitigate its problems over unrelieved
advance corporation tax. He added the group still needed another UK business
to get rid of the problem once and for all.
Trafalgar had further bad news for former shareholders in Davy Corporation,
which the group took over last June. Although the group hopes to lease the
Ocean Emerald oil rig to Midland and Scottish Resources for about Pounds 20m
it held out little hope of Davy's former shareholders receiving the second
payment, totalling Pounds 54m or 45p a share.
This is because in Trafalgar's view MSR is still unlikely to be able to draw
upon the Pounds 118m letter of credit with the project's bankers. Without
the letter of credit Trafalgar House says it cannot make the second payment
to the Davy shareholders.
Operating profits from property and investment and shipping and hotels
continued to fall. The former reported profits of Pounds 6.6m, compared with
Pounds 19m, while the latter suffered a smaller profit fall to Pounds 5.9m
from Pounds 7.6m.
Sir Eric said property continued to experience depressed conditions,
although the removal of political uncertainty and lower interest rates gave
some prospect of a gradual UK recovery. Occupancy levels still remained
disappointing at between 50 per cent and 60 per cent.
Construction and engineering increased profits by 39 per cent to Pounds
53.3m. Sir Eric said the group would focus on these core businesses.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 450m to Pounds 328m, although debt increased
since the year-end total of Pounds 182m. Fully diluted earnings per share
before extraordinary items fell to 4.8p from 5.9p.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf fate lies with CIBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS yesterday accused Canada's second biggest bank, Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, of threatening to put O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings, developer
of Europe's biggest new office development, into administration under UK
insolvency legislation.
O&amp;Y Canary Wharf is a subsidiary of Olympia &amp; York Developments, which is
today meeting its 15 biggest bank creditors to discuss its proposal to
alleviate its difficulties by restructuring Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn) of
debt.
Today's meeting will discuss the prospects for the contributors to a Dollars
2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to an O&amp;Y subsidiary, Olympia &amp; York Resources Credit
Corporation. A banker said yesterday that contributors to this loan could
lose a third of their money. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is understood to
have lent Dollars 750m of the Dollars 2.5bn.
Meanwhile there have been separate meetings of the 11 providers of bank
finance for the Canary Wharf project in east London.
At a meeting on Tuesday, 10 of the 11 lenders indicated they would be
prepared to support a plan to provide Canary Wharf with Pounds 30m to meet
its needs for the coming month, but bankers said CIBC refused to provide any
new money.
The banks will only provide the Pounds 30m if all 11 contribute. Without the
Pounds 30m, O&amp;Y Canary Wharf would go into administration. Bankers said CIBC
was threatening to 'pull the rug' on Canary Wharf. The banks have until
tonight to say whether they will provide the Pounds 30m, because Canary
Wharf runs out of cash at the end of the week.
CIBC is said to have told other banks that it was pessimistic about the
long-term outlook for Canary Wharf and believed it would be wrong to inject
any new money into the project.
Bankers say CIBC's stance is surprising, as it is the biggest lender to
O&amp;Y's worldwide oper-ations, with about Dollars 1bn of loans outstanding,
and it has the most to lose if O&amp;Y's subsidiaries file for bankruptcy
protection.
Loans to Canary Wharf total about Pounds 1bn. However, these loans are
guaranteed by the parent company in Canada. If Canary Wharf lenders face
losses, they can demand reparations from the parent - with potentially
damaging consequences for the rest of O&amp;Y.

FT  07 MAY 92 / German strike talks to resume today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS aimed at ending the 10-day-old public sector strike in Germany were
adjourned last night until today, with no sign of a promised new offer from
the employers.
Union officials and representatives of federal, state and local authorities
had just a brief meeting in Stuttgart after four hours of separate
consultations by the two sides. 'We stood next to each other and did not
have anything to say,' Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the largest public
service union, oTV, told reporters.
Negotiators said they would meet this morning for 'further exploratory
talks'. The Bonn government's chief negotiator, Mr Rudolf Seiters, the
interior minister, added: 'We will have lots of time then.'
Hopes had been raised by the public sector employers' indications that they
would make a new offer to try to end what is already western Germany's most
disruptive wave of industrial action since the Second World War.
They previously offered a 4.8 per cent pay rise, while the unions originally
demanded a 9.5 per cent increase. Ms Wulf-Mathies, said before the talks
less than the 5.4 per cent proposed recently by arbitrators would be
rejected.
Both sides hinted earlier this week that a deal limiting wage rises for top
earners and giving more to the lower-paid might be the best way forward.
According to trade union estimates, more than 500,000 workers in both public
and private sectors were on strike yesterday.
While leading economists suggested that the stoppages would have to last at
least a month before having any noticeable effects on economic output,
tangible evidence of the strike's effects continued to mount.
The national railway network was within days of collapse, a Bundesbahn
official said. Only a quarter of its locomotives were still in service and
losses had already reached DM100m (Pounds 34m).
In Cologne 120 wagons of mail were standing in sidings. In Frankfurt an
estimated 13,000 tonnes of uncollected refuse was piled in streets.
At the same time unrest grew in the private sector. About 75,000 members of
the IG Metall engineering workers' union defied threats of a lock-out and
continued warning strikes as it became clear that employers were not yet
prepared to increase their 3.3 per cent pay offer.
IG Metall leaders will meet next Tuesday to decide on their next step.
Building workers, members of the IG Bau union, threatened a work-to-rule
until employers improved their 3.4 per cent offer. Printers demanding an 11
per cent increase continued token protests.
Prof Hans Schneider, chairman of the 'five wise men', the group of leading
independent economic advisers to the government, warned of dangerous
consequences for the economy if the talks led to excessive pay rises.
However, he added, a 5.5 per cent overall deal 'would not be the end of the
world'. He agreed with the respected Ifo economics institute in Munich that
a full month's stoppage in the public sector, with an average of 300,000
workers striking daily would cut the year's GDP growth by only between 0.1
per cent and 0.2 per cent.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Polish IMF deal put in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S hopes of negotiating a new deal with the International Monetary
Fund were in doubt last night following the resignation of Mr Andrzej
Olechowski, the finance minister, in protest against a parliamentary vote
for higher government spending.
His departure weakens the minority centre-right coalition government of Mr
Jan Olszewski, prime minister, which has been put in danger of collapse by
the row over budget spending.
The finance minister announced his resignation after two votes in parliament
failed to overturn a 1991 constitutional court ruling which bars the
government from cutting public sector pensions.
The resulting rise in civil servants' pay and additional pension rights
could cost the government Zl 28,100bn (Pounds 1.15bn), the prime minister
said. This rise threatens to overwhelm the government plans to limit this
year's budget deficit to Zl 65,500bn or 5 per cent of gross domestic
product.
This was the limit agreed two months ago after Mr Olechowski's talks in
Washington with the IMF. IMF support for the government's economic policies
is essential for the resumption of payments from the total Dollars 2.5bn
three-year IMF extended loan facility granted last year.
Disbursements were suspended in September when targets, including those for
inflation and government spending, were exceeded. An IMF team is in Warsaw
for talks with the government.
Mr Olechowski said he was resigning because he could 'see no way of
fulfilling these new obligations'. He added that those who had voted for the
spending increases should be asked how they would pay for them.
The former communists, the populist KPN party and the PSL peasants' party,
refused to support either government attempt to secure the disputed cuts in
public sector pay.
The Democratic Union, the largest party, led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
possible contender for the premiership if the government does collapse,
voted against one of the motions.
Yesterday's vote also raises the question of whether it will be possible to
enforce the spending cuts of Zl 24,000bn agreed by the government to keep
this year's budget within IMF-approved limits in the face of arguments that
entitlements once granted by law cannot be taken away.
Mr Olszewski said his government would not resign. He would try to have the
draft budget accepted by parliament in two weeks.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: Right ways for accountants to be regulated and
improve image (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MCNEIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article 'Six ways to improve the profession's image' (Accountancy
column, April 30) contained no reference to steps that have already been
taken by the profession in these areas, namely:
1. The remit of the Accounting Standards Board undoubtedly includes the
narrowing of options and the tightening of financial reporting standards.
2. Proposals from this institute to the Cadbury Committee include the role
of audit committees in all public-interest entities. One of the duties of
audit committees, containing independent non-executive directors only, would
be to recommend auditor appointments and dismissals to the board.
3. We have recently published a paper recommending that auditors should
approve the issue of interim accounts.
4. We (and others) also proposed to the Cadbury Committee that directors
should report on the adequacy or otherwise of listed companies' internal
controls and that auditors should attest the directors' statement.
5. The Auditing Practices Board is about to publish an exposure draft on a
new form of auditors' report, including a proposal that the responsibilities
of the directors for the preparation of financial statements should be
distinguished from those of the auditors. Directors' responsibilities would
therefore be highlighted. The need for auditors to draw attention to items
of significance which may be buried in the notes to financial statements is
also dealt with.
6. Procedures exist to cover the naming of members of the profession when
serious 'public interest' cases result in disciplinary action against them.
The coming months will see further progress on those matters that are still
only at the proposal stage.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Touche Ross is to be congratulated on calling for the regulation of
auditors to be shifted from the Institute of Chartered Accountants to an
independent body ('Touche attacks ICAEW audit role', May 1). The institute
simply cannot be expected to be an effective regulator. Its primary role is
that of a trade association; inevitably, its role as advocate of the
immediate interest of members will take precedence over its role in
upholding professional standards and increasing public confidence. I am glad
I am not alone in knowing of cases where the two roles have been in
conflict.
The article by Geoffrey Holmes and Alan Sugden (Accountancy column, April
30) on 'six ways to improve the profession's image' would have carried more
weight if it had endorsed the Touche Ross proposal. The article did,
however, underline the importance of asserting the independence of auditors
as a step towards better corporate governance.
An audit is an integral part of good corporate governance and an independent
regulator for auditors is but one of the steps we have to take in the UK to
reach the goal of a truly independent audit.

How times change. Had it not been for Trafalgar House's opportunist bid for
its smaller rival P &amp; O 10 years ago, Lord Sterling of Plaistow would not
have been press-ganged into taking the P &amp; O helm.
Today, a revitalised P &amp; O is worth more than three times as much as
Trafalgar House. Nor is it faced with the humiliation of having to halve its
dividend to survive the recession. So does Trafalgar House now need the same
sort of external shock to wake up its rather inbred management team?
Certainly, it has hired a slick PR professional to patch up its
accident-prone image, and there's no doubt that founder Sir Nigel Broackes
looks reinvigorated on his new diet. But something more will be needed to
convince the City that anything much has changed.
A few fresh non-executive faces on the board would be a start, especially if
the Trafalgar House really is intent on transforming itself into a world
class engineering giant. It is the sort of company that the new president of
the board of trade will need to keep an eye on.

To be sure Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, who attracted

not need the money. But Arjo Wiggins Appleton, which made him a
non-executive director 18 months ago, might reasonably have expected him to
stay on its board a little longer. The paper company, the product of a 1990
merger between Wiggins Teape Appleton and Arjomari-Prioux, had hoped that
his wisdom on a mega transatlantic merger would be of benefit in its
Anglo-French endeavours.
Now he has resigned and an Arjo spokesman says he does not know why. It goes
to show the dangers of chasing trophy names to put on the company
letterhead.

For more than a decade left-wing intellectuals have been puzzling over the

Retired member Fred Hattley wrote asking what had happened to his union's

'BT took over sponsorship when the band's financial needs outstripped the

Another Dollars 1.5m of Lloyd's names' money has just been sent down the
tubes by a federal judge in America. But his ruling against the insurers'
objection to paying a robbery claim by a US diamond wholesaler will bring
relief to office workers everywhere else on the planet.
Lloyd's policy with the NY Diaco diamond company stipulated that it must
have a minimum of two employees on duty at all times. It turned out,
however, that the robbery took place while one of the two staff present -
the company president  - had stepped out to the lavatory. Lloyd's therefore
declared the policy void and refused the Dollars 1.5m claim.
But Judge Louis Stanton has ruled the insurers' objection unreasonable. 'A
brief trip to the restroom at various times during the day is not
inconsistent with being on duty or attending the office,' he says.

Like meets like at 10 Downing Street today with prime minister Major's first
visit from his gangling Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt.
Besides sharing the same dry sense of humour and conversational style, the
two Conservative leaders aren't all that far apart in appearance, although
the Scandinavian is fresher of face. Something else they have in common is
an affinity with German chancellor Helmut Kohl, somewhat on the lines of two
nephews to an uncle.
Bildt sees John Major as a strong ally backing Sweden's bid for European
Community membership by 1995. The UK premier wants to make widening the
community a leitmotif of Britain's EC presidency in the second half of this
year.
While the Swede's election win came earlier - he took over last October - he
also has a recent personal victory to celebrate. He has just struck a
telling blow for his industrial policy by forcing the automobile group Volvo
to back away from its controversial plan to take over the Procordia
pharmaceutical and food company.
But their talk won't be only of triumph. Yet another resemblance between
them is that Bildt, too, is presiding over his country's worst recession
since at least the Second World War.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Clash of wills over power for the people: The UK gas
regulator has raised the stakes in his campaign for lower domestic prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, has come out of the trenches
with his bayonet fixed, fighting for lower gas prices on behalf of UK
households. He jolted the stock market, which immediately knocked 8p off the
price of British Gas shares yesterday before they rallied to close 2 1/2 p
down at 262 1/2 p.
Stockbrokers reacted swiftly to Sir James's demands for British Gas to cut
domestic gas prices by up to 2p a therm, calculating that this would slice
at least Pounds 250m from the company's annual profits of more than Pounds
1bn. But the situation is more complex than the simple arithmetic implies.
The public row is just the latest clash of wills between an aggressive
regulator and a company that has yet to adjust to life under public
surveillance. Relations between Sir James and British Gas have struck a
discordant note since privatisation in 1986.
Sir James sets the price British Gas can charge households for gas supply in
a complicated formula which came into force last month. This limits gas
price increases to 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation, which
means that if the annual inflation rate is below 5 per cent, prices must
fall.
Sir James forecasts inflation will hover around the 4 per cent mark this
year; so prices must be reduced now. He is threatening legal action against
British Gas if it fails to comply with his request. 'Customers need a cut in
price as soon as possible. British Gas should not be using customers' money
to smooth out price rises and falls,' he said yesterday.
But a smooth price decline is what British Gas wants: the company says it
must avoid the 'yo-yo' effect of cutting prices now and possibly having to
raise them again if inflation increases later in the year.
When British Gas made its decision to freeze domestic prices at the
beginning of last month, the company said its projections of inflation were
rather shaky because it did not know the outcome of the general election.
'The prices are reviewed monthly and so at any time an adjustment can be
made,' an official said yesterday.
Part of the argument centres on Sir James's refusal to meet British Gas
officials to discuss a price cut. He said a meeting was unnecessary as the
evidence pointing to the need for a reduction was 'blindingly obvious'. The
lack of communication between Sir James and British Gas points to a somewhat
tense and combative relationship. Sir James is careful to maintain a
distance between himself and the company he regulates, but British Gas
accuses him of being aloof.
The contentious nature of the relationship meant that British Gas only
accepted the April price formula after a long-running dispute on pricing and
faced with the threat of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
But the company has now indicated that it wants the formula to be reviewed
in the wake of a separate agreement reached with the Office of Fair Trading
in January. The agreement requires it to relinquish half of its share of the
industrial gas market to rival suppliers in a bid to encourage more
competition. British Gas says its deal with the OFT changes its operating
conditions to such an extent that the tough price formula for the domestic
part of its business needs to be eased.
A gas industry observer suggests that British Gas could be sticking to a
clever strategy of freezing prices now in the hope of seeing the formula
revised later in the year, thereby allowing it to keep prices steady or even
to raise them.
Sir James, however, does not sympathise with the request by British Gas for
a revision to the formula. He believes the company should keep its domestic
and industrial businesses separate and that a drop in profit in one should
not affect prices in the other. His comments yesterday on prices could be
the opening salvo in a much more serious disagreement later in the year over
the actual level of the pricing formula.
British Gas must tread carefully if it wants to avoid becoming embroiled in
another distracting dispute over pricing. Sir James has found sympathy for
his views among some politicians, and his arguments have struck a chord
among consumers who resent the idea that they are being overcharged.
The British Gas case against an immediate price cut is technical and not so
readily absorbed by consumers, because it relies on complicated calculations
in the price formula. However, some industry observers believe the company
is right to be cautious and that Sir James has got his arithmetic wrong.
They point out that the current rate of inflation indicates the need for a
price cut of just 0.3p a therm rather than Sir James's 2p.
Sir James himself is rather vague as to how he arrived at the 2p a therm
figure and admits that a 1p reduction in price would probably be sufficient.
But if the battle goes to court Sir James will have to prove the accuracy of
his figures or risk a dent in his credibility.
A cut of only 0.3p a therm would translate into a very small reduction in
most domestic bills, and British Gas says it could make a more significant
cut if it waited until later in the year.
Overall the price paid for gas by UK consumers compares favourably with that
in other western European countries. According to many international
studies, British households pay lower gas bills than their German or Italian
counterparts.
Lower UK gas prices are, however, more a historical accident than a
regulatory triumph. In the past, the price paid by British Gas to North Sea
gas producers fluctuated with the rate of inflation, while prices on the
continent were more closely linked to oil prices.
When oil prices soared in the early 1970s, British consumers were paying
lower gas prices than continental users. In the 1980s, there was a move to
link UK prices more closely to the price of oil, but since then oil prices
have been low and again gas prices have remained relatively low in real
terms.
Nevertheless, consumers need to be convinced they are getting a fair deal or
they may switch to another energy supply. Mr Ian Powe of the Gas Consumers'
Council, a consumers' lobby, said yesterday that Sir James's initiative is
good news for customers.
If Sir James loses any future dispute over pricing, consumers could lose an
aggressive champion. By threatening British Gas with legal action, Sir James
is taking a gamble on the basis of his own calculations which some observers
believe are flawed. It is not clear whether Sir James would win a court
case.
'This is a battle of wills and it is hard to see how both parties can emerge
unscathed,' said Mr Peter Spring, industry analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite,
the broker. Both the regulator and the company have much at stake. For Sir
James, his reputation as an effective industry regulator and his credibility
are on the line. For British Gas, the loss of Pounds 250m in profit would be
extremely hard to justify to shareholders.

FT  07 MAY 92 / A revolution on the runway: Boeing, the world's largest
commercial aircraft manufacturer, is adjusting to tougher competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A cultural revolution is taking place at Boeing. For the first time in its
75-year history, the world's leading manufacturer of commercial jets has
appointed a woman - Mrs Rozanne Ridgway, a career diplomat  - to its
all-male board of directors.
More significantly, it is being forced to implement fundamental change in
the way it does business. It has adopted a more open stance towards the
outside world and is encouraging airlines, suppliers and subcontractors to
participate actively in the design of its latest airliner, the 777 widebody
twin engine jet.
In the past, Boeing felt it knew what was best for its airline customers.
'But with the 777, Boeing has for the first time given us direct access to
the process of designing a new aircraft,' says Mr James O'Sullivan, British
Airway's chief project engineer on the 777 programme.
Boeing is also openly talking for the first time of forging close ties,
including equity partnerships, with other companies. 'We have always been a
go-it-alone company with a fearsome amount of pride,' conceded Mr Frank
Shrontz, Boeing's chairman. 'It has been difficult for us to share with
others but we are changing that.'
The reasons, according to Mr Shrontz, are the huge investments necessary to
launch new programmes and the market risks which are forcing companies to
pool their resources. 'I see more and more openness in that sense. I don't
know where our next partners will come from but I am not ruling out
partnerships with any other company in the world.'
This new attitude reflects both the current conditions of the civil aviation
market, which is still struggling to recover from its worst slump since the
Second World War, and the changing nature of the competition facing Boeing.
The biggest challenge has undoubtedly come from Airbus Industrie, the
European aircraft consortium which has steadily built up market share during
the past 20 years with advanced new aircraft and government subsidies.
Airbus has now captured nearly 30 per cent of the world commercial jet
market and has started making serious inroads into some of Boeing's
traditional US airline customers.
Airbus has not only developed a comprehensive family of aircraft to compete
against Boeing, but has also sought to leapfrog its US rival by introducing
new technological concepts to commercial jets. These include fly-by-wire
controls, which enable the pilot's commands from the cockpit to be
transmitted electronically rather than mechanically to the flaps and the
rudder, and computer-aided design systems.
The European consortium is now also threatening to challenge Boeing's
dominance of the jumbo aircraft market by studying the development of a 600
to 800-seater aircraft for the end of the decade.
But Boeing is facing a more immediate threat at the top end of the market
from McDonnell Douglas. Boeing's American rival unveiled plans last week to
build the MD12, a 430 to 510-seat double decker jumbo aircraft to compete
against the Boeing 747-400 and the Seattle company's own longer-term plans
to develop a 600 to 800-seater aircraft either by stretching the 747 or
building an entirely new aircraft.
Both McDonnell Douglas and Airbus are seeking partnerships in the Far East,
one of the most promising markets for large jets, to help them develop their
new jumbos. Airbus has already had preliminary talks with three Japanese
manufacturers - Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and
Fuji Heavy Industries - to interest them in a possible equity partnership on
its new jumbo project.
McDonnell Douglas has been in negotiations for the past year to sell up to
49 per cent of its Douglas commercial aircraft business to Asian partners
with Taiwan Aerospace leading the field. Last week, the Taiwanese company
received qualified approval from its government to negotiate the purchase of
up to 40 per cent of the Douglas business for Dollars 2bn.
The proposed Taiwan Aerospace-Douglas deal has increasingly worried Boeing.
It fears this could eventually lead to the emergence of what it calls an
'Asian Airbus'. Mr Shrontz said he hoped the deal would not force Boeing to
fight another subsidised competitor.
The tentative agreement reached last month between the European Commission
and the US government on Airbus subsidies is expected to bring some
discipline to the commercial aircraft market. The agreement will limit
direct government support for future Airbus programmes to 33 per cent of
their total development costs. 'We would have preferred zero subsidies and
zero government involvement,' Mr Shrontz emphasised.
While Boeing believes it has secured an acceptable compromise with Airbus,
it fears Taiwan could distort the market because it is not a member of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) nor of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and therefore not bound by
Gatt and OECD agreements on commercial aircraft trade. While Taiwan has made
it clear that it seeks to join these organisations, it has also said it
would finance up to 49 per cent of the Douglas deal with low interest loans
and tax incentives.
All these pressures have coincided with the worst slump in civil aviation in
40 years. And Boeing has not escaped the downturn.
Although it has continued to report higher profits and sales (first quarter
net profits of Dollars 441m this year represented a 43 per cent increase
over the same period in 1991), Boeing is being forced to cut about 8,000
jobs this year and scale down production of its 737 narrowbody airliners
from 21 a month to 14 a month next October. Rising profits have resulted
from the high level of aircraft deliveries to customers and recovery in the
company's military activities, while the job cuts reflect a slump in orders.
Boeing does not expect any recovery in new orders until later next year.
Some of its main US customers, including United Airlines, American and
Delta, have announced deferrals of committed orders and significant cuts in
spending. At the latest count, about 725 aircraft are lying idle in the
Arizona desert.
Mr Shrontz said he was optimistic about the longer-term prospects for the
industry. In the short term, however, he acknowledged there was still
considerable uncertainty. 'We need a couple more quarters to tell us that we
are coming out of the recession and things are getting better,' he said.
But Boeing says it cannot afford to wait for the recovery to be sure of
retaining its 60 per cent share of the commercial jet market. Instead, the
company has decided to act now.
The strategy, reflecting the marketing and financial demands of airline
customers, is most evident with the Dollars 5bn Boeing 777 programme.
'The real difference is the direct involvement of airline customers right at
the start of the design of the aircraft,' said Mr Philip Condit, head of the
777 project and widely tipped to take over Boeing's commercial aircraft
division if the new aircraft is a success.
Boeing has formed 235 'design/build' teams grouping together airline
designers and maintenance engineers, suppliers of components and
subcontractors together with Boeing designers and engineers. These teams,
devised by Mr Condit, use powerful computers which enable them to share
their designs through a common database. International partners can
therefore communicate directly from their headquarters.
'One of the things we are trying to do is to meet customer requirements as
opposed to introducing technology for technology's sake,' Mr Condit said.
This collaborative approach is also aimed at building what Boeing calls a
'consumer-driven service-ready aircraft'. Airlines have welcomed the change
because it has helped them introduce specific improvements - such as the
fitting of new overhead luggage bins and better-designed cabin lighting
systems - more quickly.
Boeing wants to reduce to a minimum the changes which normally have to be
made to fix design problems during production of the aircraft and after it
has been delivered to its first airline customers in 1995.
In so doing, it is hoping to avoid repeating the mistakes made three years
ago on the development of the 747-400, the newest member of its jumbo
family. 'The scars of the 747-400 are still there,' Mr Condit conceded.
Boeing was forced to delay delivery for several months of the 747-400 to
initial customers because of teething problems and was also forced by
airlines to make changes to its original design. 'With the 777, we want a
fault-free introduction,' Mr Condit said.
Boeing is introducing more electronics in the 777 than it has ever done on a
new aircraft. The fly-by-wire system on the 777 will be as comprehensive as
on any Airbus aircraft; Boeing is introducing liquid crystal displays in the
cockpit; the 777 is the first aircraft Boeing has designed entirely by
computers using a three-dimensional digital system called Catia developed by
the French Dassault group; the US company is using computer-based training
methods to prepare pilots and maintenance engineers; it is using new
composite materials on the 777 tail and floor beams; it is also offering as
an option a folding wing tip mechanism to enable the aircraft to park more
easily at airport terminal gates.
'Boeing has been pushed by Airbus to develop a technically advanced
aircraft. They want to overtake Airbus after the European group leapfrogged
them,' explained Mr O'Sullivan of British Airways 'We are getting
consistently better and cheaper Boeings because of Airbus and the
competition,' he added. Mr Shrontz agreed. 'We would probably be a lot
flabbier today without competition.'
But with the launch of the 777 programme, 'it's bet your company time' all
over again, added Mr Dick Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president. 'The
development costs and lead times are so significant you really risk the
health of the company every time you launch a new programme,' he said.
And just as Boeing will start delivering the first 328-seater 777 widebody
jets to customers in 1995, it will have to consider launching an even more
expensive programme to develop its new jumbo aircraft. That aircraft is
likely to cost more than the 777 and will inevitably force Boeing to
accelerate its open-door strategy. For Boeing, survival as the industry
leader will hinge on its ability to absorb such change.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A UK lead in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN 18 months ago Britain was the perennial spoiler of plans hatched
in Brussels and processed through the institutions of the European
Community. Now it is well placed to be among the first to ratify the
Maastricht treaty. Its economic policy is being shaped to ensure that in the
medium term it meets the convergence criteria set forth in that document.
The government remains determined to bring about the completion of the
single market. It looks forward with enthusiasm to the enlargement of the
EC. It wants to introduce budgetary discipline into community affairs and
will try again to make sense of the agricultural policy. In sum, the United
Kingdom seeks to be more than a good European; its aim is to be a leader of
Europe.
This is a reversal of postwar history, during which Britain has held back
from, or opposed, every development proposed by France and Germany, starting
with the coal and steel community. Now it is well placed to be the proposer
itself, either with the two leading mainland powers, or in concert with
other members. A British government has at last accepted that it is part of
the European entity.
This is the most striking inference to be drawn from the Queen's address to
parliament yesterday. Mr John Major became prime minister in November 1990
as a result of the downfall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher; her political demise
was brought about in large part by divisions among Conservatives over
European policy. Those divisions persist, but Mr Major has done much to
blunt the force of both the irreconcilable anti-Europeans (now reduced to a
rump) and the romantic Eurofederalists. He has united most of his party
around a centrist position defended with skill at Maastricht.
Fundamental decisions
The result was an agreement that recognises that the EC is a congeries of
states, whose fundamental decisions are made in a continuing series of
negotiations between its member governments. This concept has been eroded
with the extension of majority voting, but the essence remains. Defence and
security are not even within the EC structure. Britain stands alone in its
refusal to sign the social chapter and its insistence on an opt-out clause
on the single currency, but the community is learning to live with some of
the idiosyncrasies of its most powerful offshore member.
This general position will inform Mr Major's conduct of his government's
presidency of the EC, which begins in July. To judge by his style in
exploiting similar opportunities in the G7 and the security council last
year, the prime minister will make the most of it. He will be helped by both
pomp and circumstance. The Queen will visit the Council of Europe and
address the parliament in Strasbourg next week - the first such royal visit.
She will also make a state visit to France in June, and Germany in October;
the European Council will meet at her palace in Edinburgh in December.
Domestic discomfiture
As to circumstance, the domestic discomfiture of the French president and
the German chancellor, not to mention the disarray of the Italian
government, weakens if only temporarily the influence of those countries.
Britain is for the moment the only large European power with a stable
government and sufficient energy to shape the next phase of the EC's
development.
The moment may, however, be short-lived. There is an apparent contradiction
between the government's enthusiasm for enlargement of the community and its
distaste, expressed by the foreign secretary in a speech last week, for any
further structural negotiations before the agreed date of 1996. There may be
only three new members by then, but that would make an already complicated
structure even more unwieldy.
The president of the commission, Mr Jacques Delors, will shortly circulate
proposals designed to streamline the decision-making machinery before new
members join the existing 12. These are likely to strengthen the commission
and the parliament, probably at the expense of the intergovernmental
committees that at present hold most of the reins of power. If Mr Major
wants to lead opinion, and to retain the spirit of a Europe des patries, he
had better come up with some proposals of his own.

CHANGING COURSE By Stephan Schmidheiny and the Business Council for
Sustainable Development The MIT Press. Pounds 20.50 hardback, Pounds 9.95
paperback. 355 pages
The business world faces a dilemma over the environment. In only a month,
political leaders from more than 100 countries will gather in Rio de Janeiro
for the grandly named Earth Summit. The conference halls will be packed with
thousands of environmental pressure groups agitating for action. And the
whole world - or such is the organisers' hope - will be watching. Who knows
what will result?
At the very least, the politicians will want to avoid a wasted journey by
signing a commitment to get the world economy on to a more sustainable path.
But they might also agree to more concrete measures, like taxation or
regulation, to tackle the specific ills of global warming, deforestation and
pollution.
The chances of that are rather small. The run-up to the summit has exposed a
world deeply divided on green issues; it cannot even agree an agenda, let
alone a plan of action. But it is easy to see why some business people view
Rio as an ominous prospect. They may welcome the fact that environmental
issues have finally got on to the global agenda. But Rio will not simplify
their life; it could make it more difficult.
Much of the trouble lies in business's poor image, and the widespread view
that protection of the environment and the pursuit of profit are
fundamentally at odds with each other.
A group of 50 top businessmen has got together to try to deal with these
issues, and this book is the result of their labours. It comes very late in
the day, and a lot of it will cut little ice with Mr Greenperson, but it is
unquestionably one of the more important contributions to Rio.
The prime mover is Stephan Schmidheiny, a little-known but highly successful
Swiss businessman who was invited by the Rio organisers to become their
adviser. Rather than do the job alone, he formed a business council with the
top executives of companies such as Shell, ABB Asea Brown Boveri,
Volkswagen, 3M, Nissan Motor and Dupont, and all have contributed from their
experience.
There are several strands to their message. The central ones are that
business favours sustainable development, that it accepts the need for
environmental policies, and that it recognises its responsibility to help
the developing world out of its difficulties. In other words, greenery and
profit-making can coexist.
But these arguments are also highly qualified. Sustainable development must
be achieved by means of free and open markets, environmental measures should
be imposed through economic instruments (like taxes) rather than controls
(which distort) or self-regulation (which encourages business cartels). And
if business is to enrich the Third World with its technology, it must be on
the basis of 'co-operation' (ie on commercial terms) rather than 'transfers'
(terms mandated by government).
None of this sounds specially surprising. But the book fleshes out these
positions with 38 studies of businesses resolving conflicts with the
environment.
There is the case of New England Electric, the US utility which devised a
system with its regulators that enabled it to profit if its customers
reduced demand through conservation. Previously NEE's earnings had been
based solely on the amount of electricity it had sold.
Another case relates how Dow Chemical adopted a policy of eliminating
harmful waste at source rather than by treating it at the end of the waste
pipe, meaning that only a minimal amount now ends up in a landfill.
In a quote that typifies much of this book, Dow's president, Frank Popoff,
says: 'Surveys show that the public is sceptical of industry's efforts at
environmental protection. If we fail to take the initiative, the result will
be a regulatory crunch that costs us - and the public - dearly without
achieving significant benefits.'
Other cases show how Shell promoted local nationals in Nigeria, Henkel
developed the phosphate-free detergent which eventually swept Europe, and
Volkswagen designed the recyclable car.
This book is undoubtedly well-intentioned, but the question is how much
impact it will make. The case studies are rather predictable: the company
always triumphs over adversity. This was a deliberate decision 'designed to
provide positive examples to motivate others to take action', the authors
say.
But what a pity they did not develop a tantalising reference to 3M being
forced to discard a water-based process for making audio tape because it was
not good enough. This is not because, as the authors say 'too often the
media focuses on errors and accidents'. It is because the world knows that
business is having a tough time adjusting to environmental pressures, and it
needs to be convinced that businessmen are acting out of genuine motives.
As NEE chief executive John Rowe says in the book's most memorable quote:
'The rat has to smell the cheese.'

FT  07 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Make Poland governable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT THEIR troubled history, Poles have found it easier to unite in
common purpose against an oppressor than to work together constructively
once liberation has been achieved. That pattern appears to be repeating
itself. The resignation yesterday of Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance minister
in the minority coalition government headed by Mr Jan Olszewski, has
underlined the fragile political basis on which post-communist Poland is
built. It confirms that a continuation of economic reform will be impossible
without fundamental changes to the country's political system.
The immediate cause of Mr Olechowski's resignation is the inability of the
government to secure a two thirds majority in parliament to overturn a
controversial 1991 court decision that obliges the government to pay
inflation-indexed pensions to millions of state employees. The higher social
security bill will add an estimated Dollars 2.2bn to government spending and
demolishes all hope of limiting this year's budget deficit to 5 per cent of
gross domestic product, as agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Mr
Olechowski resigned because he knows, and repeatedly told parliament, that
without IMF backing Poland will not be able to make progress on debt
reduction negotiations with the commercial banks, to which it owes more than
Dollars 11bn. Without this, it will find it increasingly difficult to
attract the private foreign equity investment it requires for future growth.
Fragmented house
Such considerations were ignored in yesterday's parliamentary votes, which
reflected the fragmented nature of the 460-seat Sejm, or lower house of
parliament. The apparent irresponsibility of parliamentarians is above all a
function of the flawed electoral law under which members were elected. This
has to be changed.
The current system is a legacy of Poland's recent past. The electoral law,
which provides for untrammelled proportional representation, was pushed
through by the communists who dominated the previous parliament in a bid to
improve their chances in the first free elections.
The predictable result was a weak and divided parliament of 29 parties, many
with only one elected member, which makes effective government impossible.
This pleased the former communists, who emerged as the second largest party
just behind the Democratic Union, home to many former Solidarity supporters.
But it also allowed President Lech Walesa to step up his own campaign for
greater presidential powers.
Effective opposition
Mr Walesa believes that Poland needs a new constitution, which would combine
a Gaullist-style executive presidency with a parliament of fewer, but more
coherent parties, capable of providing viable governments and effective
parliamentary oppositions. His opponents are reluctant, however, to provide
him with greater powers. They point to his unpredictable nature and his lack
of understanding of economic and financial issues. After 45 years of
totalitarianism, they say, participation in democracy is required, not
another version of charismatic leadership.
The resignation of Mr Olechowski, and the probable collapse of the
government within the next few days or weeks, underlines the urgency of
resolving the present conflict between the presidency and the government.
This means, for a start, accelerating the work of the parliamentary
commission working on a new constitution. One obvious target is to change
the present proportional representation system, in particular by introducing
German-style limits, to eliminate parties with less than 5 per cent of the
vote. The inclusion of an element of first past the post voting would also
help to create fewer but more substantial parties.
Poland cannot afford a series of ineffectual governments and bickering
parliaments. It needs effective government if it is to carry through the
economic and social reforms required to achieve its goal of full European
Community membership by the turn of the century. The EC, which has a strong
interest in encouraging a stable transition in central Europe, should take
every opportunity to help the Poles establish appropriate institutions.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1670 Moliere wrote the ultimate situation comedy about a man who wants to
change situation, Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. Moliere was, as Voltaire said,
holding up views in general for the reprobation of mankind. The original is
rapier sharp, but the National Theatre Company's latest version could not
cut through a warm flan. This is theatre moyen sensuel, proud to be vulgar
and undemanding, the essence of bourgeois.
Moliere strove to entertain and to instruct. Gentilhomme finds him
castigating the arriviste, warning against the advancement of yearning and
suggesting proper self-culture instead. One sympathises with a man who
wishes to better himself but does not know how. This message arrives as a
series of moral choices neatly balanced, so one is instructed and flattered
into recognising the dangers of pretence.
One learns nothing, however, from this production. It lacks basic
intelligence. The director Richard Jones succeeds in making Moliere au
courant (with plenty of swearing), but has failed to use the resources of
17th-century France.
This play was written in the midst of two decades which yielded Pascal's
Pensees, La Rochefoucauld's Maximes and La Fontaine's Fables. Nothing of its
intellectual milieu survives. The Gentilhomme has been reduced to pantomime.
The production's strengths lie in its boldness: it is neither flawed nor
ill-executed, just disappointing. It starts happily, with Monsieur Jourdain
(very well played by Timothy Spall) amidst the competing pleasures offered
by his hireling masters of Music, Dance, Fencing and Philosophy. Jourdain is
quickly established as a boorish patron: 'It's always bleedin' shepherds' he
says to the Maestro presenting a pastoral.
His Tailor arrives to clothe him, a levee ensues; then Jourdain's
unimpressed Maid (Janine Duvitski) and unimpressable wife (Anita Dobson)
laugh at his pretention.
The production's only joke turns on Jourdain constantly slipping into his
bourgeois origins with 'You silly cow' or 'I beg you, please accept my
humble apologies for the bloody behaviour of my repellent wife.' The
earnestness for etiquette pervades every scene. His anxiety dominates the
action and marginalises the sub-plot, in which he is duped into funding a
spongeing aristocrat's amours and conned into marrying his daughter to her
lover disguised as Turkish royalty.
Moliere knew that manners govern general politeness, and change slowly;
etiquette polices the class boundaries, and changes quickly to keep out the
arriviste. But this production never probes at why Jourdain should want to
recreate himself. Only once does he cry poignantly, 'There's so much I don't
know.'
Taste has more to do with manners than appearances, and so the best scenes
of pretension, including a hugely excessive banquet, are conjured by word
and deed. The brash design, however, is inventive: value-added Louis
Quatorze, in pop-up storybook style, adds legs to the harpsichord and makes
puffy clouds float by outside.
The costumes (Nicky Gillibrand), particularly the beautifully accoutred
swarm of cooks, dancers and singers, make a plain delight in a world of
excess.
The fine music (Jonathan Dove), altered from Moliere's collaborator,
Jean-Baptiste Lully, shows that subtlety can make an impact, for the same
reason that Vaux le Vicomte is a finer Chateau than Versailles: it never
tries too hard.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: Marlene Dietrich - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The voice was a mellifluous foghorn. The languorous eyelids hung at half
mast while the eyebrows were an elevated fantasy in mascara. And the
well-lit cheekbones were rocks towards which infatuated men sailed knowingly
to their destruction.
Marlene Dietrich, who died yesterday in Paris, was the cinema's most exotic
creation. Whether dressed for kitsch in her films with director Josef Von
Sternberg or slumming it in low-budget Westerns and thrillers, she seemed a
creature entirely composed of artifice.
She was happy that we should see her that way. Dietrich claimed there was no
connection between her public image and her well-guarded private life.
Different versions of that life battled it out in the biographies. Was she
born in Berlin on December 27 1901, as most books say? Yes - though she
herself preferred later dates. Was The Blue Angel (1930) her first film, as
she often insisted? No - it was merely her first film with Josef Von
Sternberg.
Before the icy master with the megaphone came on the scene, Dietrich had
appeared in some 18 films in her native Germany. And as a little-known
European actress she had even co-starred with another little-known European
actress, Greta Garbo, in GW Pabst's 1925 Joyless Street.
The Blue Angel made her world-famous: though the Dietrich she was to become
later under Sternberg - haughty, mysterious, swathed in soft-focus - was a
far cry from the piping cabaret vamp who sings 'Falling in love again' while
doing strange things with her legs on a chair.
Dietrich went to Hollywood in 1930, leaving her husband and daughter behind
in Germany. An off-screen romance began between her and Sternberg, while
on-screen they continued their partnership with six majestic films. The
sublime and the ridiculous lie down happily together in movie romances like
Morocco (1930), Dishonored (1931) and Shanghai Express (1932). And in the
Sternberg-Dietrich masterpiece The Scarlet Empress (1934) Dietrich's beauty
becomes merely one part, albeit the most plastic and haunting, of an
astonishing fresco of scenic effects and design inspirations.
The Sternberg-Dietrich films may be kitsch (her own favourite word of
dismissal), but they have their own passion and conviction. Away from
Sternberg, Dietrich never found the same creative spark, in either herself
or her directors. She seems miscast or undercast in films like Destry Rides
Again (1939), Manpower (1941), A Foreign Affair (1948) and Stage Fright
(1950). And she seems worse than miscast - wheeled on as if to parody
herself - in Hollywod's vain attempts to recreate the Sternbergian magic
with other directors: Richard Boleslawsky's The Garden Of Allah (1936) or
Mitchell Leisen's Golden Earrings (1947).
In later years Dietrich's legend transferred itself effectively to the stage
in her one-woman concerts. But in Hollywood after her heyday she came to be
used as little more than a flavour-enhancer. Glorified cameo roles in films
like Welles's Touch Of Evil (1958), Wilder's Witness For The Prosecution
(1957) and Kramer's Judgment At Nuremberg (1961) showed that Dietrich, even
if she could not exactly act, could smoulder interestingly. More: she could
suggest better than anyone a whole non-Californian world of casbahs,
cabarets and smoky enigma.
Unlike Garbo, Dietrich retired reluctantly from the screen and even returned
for an ill-judged guest role in Just A Gigolo (1978). Equally ill-judged,
perhaps, was her cantankerous voice-only participation in Maximilan Schell's
feature documentary Marlene (1985). Her bullying of interviewer-director
Schell leaves a harsh aftertaste. But there is no denying the spell of that
husky voice; nor, as we watch the vintage film clips, the power that those
chiselled, shining, iconic features still have today.

A bisexual murderess stabs men to death with an ice pick just after they
have sexually climaxed with her. Who is she? For adding this problem to the
workload of the California police, the screenwriter of Basic Instinct Joe
Eszterhas, formerly of Jagged Edge and Betrayed, was paid Dollars 3m: an
all-time record for a Hollywood script. For playing the San Francisco
detective who goes after her Michael Douglas was paid Dollars 14m. For
directing the film, Paul Verhoeven was paid - enough: let us just say that
the movie's budget was on the runaway side of Dollars 40m.
As a film critic I feel an equivalent amount would compensate me for
injuries to my intelligence. Basic Instinct is no Jagged Edge, even less a
Fatal Attraction. It is a contrived, flashy, predictable crowd-puller, all
the more disappointing for its early promise.
As sexual aggression thrillers go, this one leaves the starting-block at 99
mph. We begin with a young man dying in flagrante with an unidentified
blonde. We move on to Detective Douglas falling for lead suspect Sharon
Stone, a bombshell who writes best-selling novels from her lavish Monterey
retreat. And we are shocked as more ice-picked bodies hit the ground and Mr
Douglas keeps hitting the sheets. He does so in startlingly explicit detail
(for Hollywood) either with Miss Stone or with curvaceous police
psychiatrist Jeanne Tripplehorn.
When not being stoned or tripplehorned, Douglas occasionally does some
police work. Here Basic Instinct shows its edgy best. Douglas displays a
line in teeth-gritting angst worthy of father Kirk, and tension is spiced by
the frequency with which the sleuths are outsmarted by the suspect. For Miss
Stone discovers that by throwing nonchalant sexual candour at the Fuzz or by
wearing no knickers during interrogation - five stunned police heads keep
dipping whenever she uncrosses her legs - she can reduce the San Francisco
PD to drooling incompetence.
Yet for two hours the film asks 'Did she do the murders?' Since no
definitive video evidence of them exists, whereby a Californian court could
identify and acquit the culprit, Douglas must do much leg-work. And
wheel-work too: a night car chase, a series of Vertigo-like trailings over
San Francisco's rollercoaster hills, and a one-man shuttle service between
the city and Stone's glass-and-stone mansion teetering above the Pacific
whitecaps.
Sadly, all this preludial stylishness gives way to hundred-horse-power
hokum. Just when director Paul 'Robocop' Verhoeven has begun to prove that
he can direct human beings - with fine use of focus-pulling to point up
staged-in-depth conversation scenes - screenwriter Eszterhas piles on Mr V's
shoulders one implausible plot twist after another.
This is one of those films in which complete strangers turn out to have been
at school together, or to have shared a common interest in ice picks, or to
have been patrolling the same corridor when bloke X, Y or Z gets a sharp
instrument through the jugular. Finally, the whole overwrought mess is
cleared up, but not so tidily that a final 'twist' does not leave open the
possibility of a lucrative sequel.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Getting customers
taped - Philips has discovered at last the value of promotion, and is
belatedly looking for ways to win over the consumer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month, an eye-catching dome big enough to house 80 people will go on
the road in the UK, visiting shopping centres.
The dome is a promotional gimmick from Philips, not best known for its
clever marketing techniques. The 'Entechdome' as it is called, will carry
demonstration booths for products which the Dutch group hopes will become
hits in the consumer electronics market.
Philips is demonstrating a new-found eagerness to reach out to consumers.
After years at the mercy of its Japanese competitors, it has discovered that
good marketing can make a difference. It reckons that the travelling
demonstration booth - a technique borrowed from Japan - is a better way to
publicise its products than conventional advertising.
The change in attitude is reflected in 'Operation Centurion', which Jan
Timmer, Philips' president, says will 'call entrenched views and habits into
question' and shake the company out of its traditional complacency.
When the programme was introduced a year ago, Philips was in dire need of a
shake-up. Not only was it making heavy losses, it had become a symbol of
what was wrong with much of European industry - it had superior technology
but could not bring it successfully to the market.
Its experience with video cassette recorders is a case in point. Philips was
the first company to make VCRs commercially available. Yet its own machine,
called V2000, which it confidently brought to the market as technically
better than competing products, was a flop because of a shortage of
pre-recorded tapes in the V2000 format.
Meanwhile, the VHS format, which was widely judged to be technically
inferior, was skilfully marketed by the Japanese, and has become the de
facto industry standard.
Philips had a similar experience with Laservision, its laser disc player
which failed to win over consumers largely as a result of a distribution
fiasco and marketing failure. Philips did not bother to ensure that the
discs were sold with the players and, more often than not, salesmen could
not even tell consumers where to buy them.
While its Japanese competitors were busy brushing up their publicity acts,
selling products which were largely based on foreign technology, Philips
appeared to be sleeping unbothered in Eindhoven, the small Dutch town where
it is based.
But the group believes it has finally learnt its lesson. 'We've been through
all the problems now,' says a spokesman.
As a result, the group's philosophy has changed substantially, it says. No
longer expecting products to sell on superior technology alone, it is paying
more attention to consumer needs and preferences, industry trends and
product design.
It has set up a number of task forces charged with keeping up to date on
trends in different markets and developing a greater awareness of customers'
demands. Earlier this year it hosted a Customer Day when Timmer addressed
100,000 Philips employees throughout the world on the subject of customer
responsiveness.
The company's new approach, it says, is illustrated by its approach to the
digital compact cassette.
The cassette tapes, which will be available in September, were developed
after extensive market research showed a need for a product to replace
conventional audio tapes, which have seen sales fall in the past few years.
'You're actually starting from a marketing need rather than take a
technology and try to find a market for it,' says a spokesman.
Philips is also working to improve its corporate image and product design -
two areas which, it now accepts, have an impact on competitiveness.
Where it had - by its own admission  - been old-fashioned in product design,
it is now trying to revamp its image with products that are aesthetically
satisfying as well as of high technical quality.
Its new range of sophisticated audio and video products, called the Philips
Collection, have a simple and elegant look. Consumers' perception of
Philips' products will inevitably influence their view of Philips as a
corporation. But Philips has no illusions about the challenge it faces in
trying to revamp its image as a safe, if dull, company.
The company is looking on enviously at the clever marketing of Sony, which
is aiming electronic products at children with the catch-phrase 'My First
Sony'. Those children who receive their 'First Sony' will grow up with a
feeling of fondness for the Japanese manufacturer's products which they are
likely to retain as adults.
Philips hopes the purchase of Whittle, a US company which produces
educational software, will help it in a similar way by introducing
schoolchildren to Philips' products at an early stage.
Many observers believe the steps it is now taking to shake up the group have
been long overdue. Some still have their doubts as to whether the changes
have come in time for the group to regain competitiveness in an increasingly
difficult environment.
Many of the changes have been accepted practice at Japanese electronics
manufacturers for years. The success of those companies has been founded not
only on the quality of their products, but on skilful marketing.
If Japanese manufacturers are to be taken as a benchmark, Philips still has
a lot of catching up to do.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Technology: Androids on the march - After years on the
breadline, modern robots are finding gainful employment in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US fashion industry they call it 'localised abrasion' - the pre-worn
look for denim jeans produced by applying potassium permanganate solution to
the knee, thigh and seat areas.
The faded effect has traditionally been achieved through manual spraying,
but consistency and quality control have been hard to achieve. Now GMFanuc
Robotics has perfected a robotic solution that is three times faster than
manual spraying, can reproduce a spray pattern to an accuracy of 0.03 inch,
and can be programmed easily to handle a wide range of garments.
The system is a relatively simple example of recent trends in the industrial
robotics industry, which is trying to reduce its dependence on comparatively
mature automotive markets and find new applications elsewhere.
It is a trend that is particularly important for robot suppliers in the
European market, where the overall penetration of robots into industry is
much lower than in Japan, and where a potentially huge market for
non-automotive applications remains untapped.
According to Massimo Mattucci, vice president for engineering and marketing
at Comau of Italy, around 50 per cent of industrial robots installed in
Europe are in use in the automotive industry and 20 per cent in electronics
 -the reverse of the situation in Japan.
'The automotive industry has more or less understood the potential of
robots,' says Stelio Demark, head of ABB Robotics, Europe's largest
producer, although he stresses, along with other robot industry executives,
the potential of robots in the paint-spraying and final assembly area of
European vehicle manufacturing.
The inherent flexibility of modern robots, and the advances made in control
systems and mechanics that have increased their speed and reliability, ought
to increase their suitability for small-batch manufacturing in Europe, where
model changes are frequent.
Demark sees new opportunities for robots emerging in the European food,
packaging, pharmaceutical and white goods industries.
But the pace at which European industry accepts robots will depend partly on
suppliers' ability to counter the mistrust caused by the hype of the 1970s
and early 1980s, when the robot industry appeared to be carried away by
euphoria over business prospects.
There are other obstacles, too, for suppliers to surmount. In Japan, one of
the driving forces behind the growth in the industrial robot population to
274,210 in 1990 - nearly 10 times the population in the former West Germany
 -has been labour shortages.
'Everything has to come back to economic considerations,' says Axel
Gerhardt, an executive board member of IWKA, the holding company for Kuka,
Germany's largest robot supplier. 'In Europe robots are used where it is
economical to do so. In Japan the question is often whether to produce with
a robot or not to produce there at all.'
Mistakes have also been made in the installation of robots, for which the
suppliers and customers have to share the blame. 'People have tended to put
in a robot, then have an operator standing by watching,' says Demark. 'This
is a half-way house that I wouldn't recommend.'
Increasingly, robot suppliers are realising that if they are to make inroads
into the small- and medium-sized businesses that still dominate European
industry - especially outside the automotive sector  - they have to
understand better the customer's needs and worries.
'You have to enter into an economic calculation with the customer and
demonstrate the ability to find a solution,' says Mattucci.
That could mean being paid only for a feasibility study that comes down
against the use of robots. But in the long run this approach makes more
sense for an industry that wants to broaden its customer base and maintain
its reputation.
Comau, which sells most of its robots as part of an integrated automation
package, is around 90 per cent dependent on the vehicle industry. Mattucci
wants to expand the remaining 10 per cent of the business to 30 per cent
over the next five years by exploiting the group's strengths in robotics for
body-welding, mechanical assembly and difficult handling operations.
The Italian company's most ambitious step away from the automotive sector is
its involvement in the Columbus Automation and robotics Testbed (Cat)
programme financed by the European Space Agency. The ground testbed for the
automation and robotics on board the projected Columbus Space Station will
incorporate a new Comau robot using advanced materials such as aeronautical
alloys and composites.
A more-down-to earth approach to broadening the customer base is in evidence
at GMFanuc, the US/Japanese concern which is the world's second biggest
supplier. The jean-spraying robot, developed in the US and now available in
the UK, offers a high return on investment with a payback of less than a
year, says Mike Wilson, the UK sales and marketing manager.
Robotics are also in their infancy in the European food industry, partly
because it has hitherto been difficult to turn a hose on to a robot to clean
it without ruining its electrical circuits. In January, GMFanuc launched its
'Washdown' robot to conform to the strict hygiene requirements of the food
industry and withstand all the chemical substances likely to be used in
washdown or wipedown procedures.
In the European electronics industry, robots are more frequent but
applications are still developing. Data Packaging, an Irish supplier of
plastic moulded components for the computer industry, recently installed an
ABB Robotics painting cell to handle metallic paints used to provide an
attractive finish, and assist in electrical shielding, on parts for the
Apple Macintosh.
Metallic paints are hard to handle because they block supply lines if not
kept flowing continuously. The ABB system programs the robot to fire the
spray gun if the system lays dormant for a given length of time.
Advances such as these are often based on techniques originally developed
for the automotive industry, which is not being neglected in suppliers'
haste to exploit other markets. A number of fairly recent technologies have
relevance to the use of robots in automotive and non-automotive fields.
Laser welding, says Wilson, is attracting interest in a number of
industries, including aerospace, because of its precision and speed. Unlike
conventional spot welding, the robot does not have to reach both sides of
the part to be welded.
Another emerging technology, especially when combined with robotics, is
water-jet cutting, which is likely to become increasingly important for
cutting plastics quickly and cleanly. It is already being used in the
automotive industry for cutting carpets, door panels and instrument panels.
In both areas robot suppliers are forming partnerships with companies which
have developed the technologies so that they can exploit the opportunities
quicker. Comau has a co-operation agreement with Trumpf, the German machine
tool builder best-known for its laser-cutting machines, while last year ABB
Robotics formed a joint venture with Ingersoll-Rand of the US to develop and
market a robotised water-jet cutting system in Europe.
The search for a broader European customer base coincides with a much more
price-conscious attitude over the past two to three years among customers,
due as much to general business conditions as to scepticism about the early
claims made by robot suppliers.
Suppliers are rationalising their product ranges to give customers what they
want and no more, but using developments in control systems to increase the
applications available from each model.
These conditions give advantages and disadvantages in more or less equal
measure to European suppliers and Japanese/US importers, which control one
third of the market. Demark and Mattucci strongly believe that the European
suppliers benefit from a approach based on solutions rather than products.
'The Japanese do not have the solutions for European needs,' says Mattucci
flatly. This is a view strongly disputed by the Japanese producers, but in a
price-sensitive market the the Japanese do have the advantage of size -
investment in control systems, in particular, can be spread over a bigger
sales base.
Ultimately, though, all the robot suppliers could benefit if they can
persuade more European companies of the benefits of robots. And that is
likely to be a gradual process where technology is only one factor in the
equation.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Technology: Striking it rich in the deep blue sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE GO where no one else dares,' boasts an engineer from the deep-sea
drilling team of Petrobras, Brazil's state oil monopoly. At 625 metres, the
company's Platform XIII in the Marlim oilfield off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro is the world's deepest in production.
Petrobras's efforts were rewarded earlier this week with the Offshore
Technology Conference Award for Distinguished Achievement - the oil
industry's most prestigious technology prize.
The company has been breaking records for deep sea oil production since 1986
when it put into commercial operation a well at a depth of 384m. 'Having
identified oil in deeper waters we realised we needed to develop the
technologies to make this production viable,' says Roberto Jardim, director
of deep-sea production at Petrobras.
Since then the company has been going deeper and deeper, breaking depth
records for installation of monobuoys, manifolds and submerged pipelines. In
March of last year it broke through the 750m barrier at its Marlim field.
Previously, 350m was considered the limit because it is the maximum depth at
which divers can work. Most platforms in the North Sea and the Gulf of
Mexico are at less than 200m.
Petrobras was forced to go deeper because Brazil's main oil reserves lie in
water as deep as 3,000m. Until the late 1970s the country was importing 80
per cent of its oil needs but the combination of two oil shocks sent the
bill soaring. In addition, the debt crisis which cut off access to foreign
capital made it imperative for Brazil to start exploiting its own reserves.
'Unlike other companies which test new equipment exhaustively before use we
like to develop our equipment on site even though this may mean interrupting
production. We can do this because we have the advantage of real fields to
test in so we can move quickly to make the process economic,' says Jardim.
Mainly as a result of its deep-sea successes Brazil now imports only 40 per
cent of its 1.2m barrel per day needs. The Campos Basin, where Petrobras's
wells are located, accounts for more than 60 per cent of Brazil's oil
production. It has estimated reserves of 6bn barrels in a 100,000 sq km area
ranging from the coast to a depth of 3,000m.
The secret of the company's success, according to Petrobras technicians, is
the combination of a 'wet Christmas tree' and a deep-sea robot. A 'wet
Christmas tree' is oil industry jargon for the pipe and valve mechanism
placed on a wellhead to control flow before oil can be pumped out.
Conventional oilfields use steel-lines or divers to guide the positioning.
But fields such as Marlim are too deep to use these methods - at 720m where
the first Marlim well was completed the pressure is 14 times that of the
earth's atmosphere. The Petrobras breakthrough was achieved by using a
satellite signal to direct the tree into its place on the wellhead, guided
by the giant eye (in the form of a video camera) of a robot lowered on to
the seabed.
Oil from such sub-sea wells is pumped to a floating pier to which ships can
anchor in the open sea, making it possible to load safely in the Campos
Basin. The company has 11 such floating production systems. 'These have been
very important in leading our deep-sea drilling because they enable us to go
into production within a year of discovery, giving quick returns,' says
Jardim.
According to Petrobras officials, production costs for Marlim are Dollars 8
per barrel - competitive with other offshore operations. Deep-sea production
will be the biggest contributor in the company's plans to increase
production from 650,000 barrels per day to 1m by the end of 1994. 'We want
to go deeper still,' says Ernesto Weber, former Petrobras chief. The company
aims to break the 2,000m depth mark by the end of this decade.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Outlook for merger mania in the early
1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE authoritative history of accountancy were ever yo bewritten,
somewhere towards the end there would have to be a chapter called 'Merger
Mania', charting the acquisitions of the late 1980s. A question now facing
firms is whether it would also have to cover the more cautious era of the
early 1990s.
While the recession bites home and the taste of merged firms being digested
grows increasingly bitter, rumours of a new wave of acquisitions are
beginning to surface. The latest candidates to be mentioned are BDO Binder
Hamlyn and Pannell Kerr Forster, which were respectively seventh and ninth
by fee income last year. Both vigorously deny it.
Whatever the truth of these particular cases, the consensus among managing
partners is that many firms are coming under competitive pressure and the
total number must shrink. None admits, though, that their own practice faces
any difficulties.
This has led to a new game played by journalists and the recipients of their
telephone calls within accountancy offices. The Accounting Standards Board
may be tightening up on the imaginative skills of the creative
practitioners, but merger gossip has provided a new outlet for invention.
Last season's version - which still continues  - involved the issue of
partner redundancies. Some firms adamantly deny that any have taken place.
Most favour a more circuitous response: they stress that partners cannot be
made redundant. Instead, they take early retirement, or depart voluntarily
after deciding that their aims and those of the firm are no longer
compatible. The 1992 variant - for countering talk of mergers - adopts the
same technique.
You can get a straight denial - though generally in a tone of voice that
does not suggest the 'true and fair' pledge of an audit report. More
typically, you hear an oblique comment using language which leaves the
options open.
'We are not in merger discussions with anyone,' says an exasperated Mr Chris
Swinson, national managing partner of Binder Hamlyn. 'I haven't even looked
for the phone number of a dating agency  .. But one keeps one's eyes open.'
Mr Richard Pearson, national managing partner at Pannell Kerr Forster, sighs
wearily: 'There is no strength to the rumours. From time to time one has
discussions about discussions  .. Of course, if the opportunity arises, we
will certainly consider it.'
There is no doubt that accountancy firms have been severely hit by the
recession. Demand has dropped for non-essential services, such as management
consultancy, and for activities linked to periods of economic growth like
corporate finance.
Insolvency work may have prospered, but it remains a small proportion of
income for most firms. Statutory audits continue to command large revenues,
but companies are increasingly putting this work out to tender and
maintaining a tight ceiling on the fees charged.
Meanwhile, costs have escalated sharply. Mergers have left the combined
firms with substantial overheads including considerable surplus staff and
excess property when they could least them.
Corporate litigation is also fast expanding. Accountants, armed with
professional indemnity insurance, have proved a tempting target for
aggrieved users of accounts looking for recompense.
When figures on fee income and employment are released by the top firms in
June, they are likely to look bleak. Undisclosed internal accounts showing
the falls in profitability will probably be gloomier still.
This does not bode well for mergers driven by strategic reasons between two
equal complementary partners, rather than as a panic-stricken survival
measure by from ailing firms. But Mr Hugh Aldous, managing partner of Robson
Rhodes, suggests that is nothing new.
'None of the mergers in the late 1980s was motivated by strategic
cleverness. Despite all the hype from the firms' press offices about
strategy, it is now clear that they were all driven by economic necessity.'
He argues that the entire accountancy profession has come under pressure and
many partners from leading firms are now on the job market.
Mr Aldous believes the 'Big 6' - Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, KPMG Peat
Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young, Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen, Touche Ross - are
likely to survive because of their very strong reputation and the
stranglehold they have on the largest clients. Some of the smaller firms
will probably fade away, he thinks, while the group of six or eight firms
below the premier league are likely to shrink to two or three over the next
few years.
Those which survive - among which Aldous naturally counts Robson Rhodes -
will have to offer 'the same calibre of thinking' as the Big 6, while acting
increasingly as advisers to individuals and private companies.
A number of his competitors share the view of a shrinking middle tier, while
putting up equally strong arguments for their own position as survivors.
Among the most notable is Grant Thornton, eighth largest by fee income,
which embarked three years ago on a strategy to concentrate on advisory work
to small and medium-sized businesses.
'I don't think any firm outside the Big 6 which has a significant part of
its income from the audit market can have a strong future,' says Mr David
McDonnell, national managing partner. He believes two of the Big 6 firms may
yet merge to create five large players, while a number of medium-sized firms
are likely to have to seek partners in order to survive.
The structure of Binder Hamlyn, by contrast, continues to be modelled in
many ways on the Big 6 firms and it retains a number of large company audit
clients. Mr Swinson is confident that such a role is sustainable. 'We have
preserved a reasonable air of professionalism, and avoided the more
rapacious moves of our competitors,' he says.
Mr Paul Hipps, senior partner at Stoy Hayward, says: 'We have certainly
sharpened up our act, putting enormous emphasis on quality and working hard
talking to people to secure whatever business is around.' His firm has
heavily cultivated family-owned businesses.
Mr Peter Orenstein, senior partner with Casson Beckman, argues that his firm
is not in the so-called 'second tier' but is at the top of a 'third tier'.
He suggests that the second tier firms are coming under considerable
pressure squeezed by both the Big 6 firms and the third tier. Many do not
have the strong international networks of the larger firms, but have large
overheads than their smaller competitors.
'We are small enough to be flexible and give clients the personal attention
of individual partners, but large enough to have the specialist expertise
they need,' Mr Orenstein says.
'We are certainly not under any pressure to merge. But that doesn't mean if
a firm comes along with a proposal of some merit we would put up a
brickwall. That would be foolish.'
If further mergers do occur, one result will be a growing headache for
regulators. Fewer firms will threaten both competition and independence. It
is already difficult to find firms not subject to conflict of interest in a
large and complex case such as the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
Mr Swinson remains unconcerned by the rumours about BDO. He has flown off to
Singapore on assignment and said before his departure: 'I would hardly be
leaving if we were about to merge, would I?'

FT  07 MAY 92 / Wellcome supports gene map project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Medical Research Council (MRC) and Wellcome Trust are joining forces to
set up a genetic research centre in Cambridge.
The centre, which will have a budget of several million pounds a year, will
extend a research project led by Dr John Sulston of the MRC Laboratory of
Molecular Biology in Cambridge.
Early this year Dr Sulston was considering an offer to join a genetics
company in the US - a prospect that dismayed British genetic researchers -
but the prospect of new funding has persuaded him to stay in the UK.
Dr Sulston is working out the genome - the entire genetic blueprint  - of
the nematode worm C. elegans, which provides a simplified model of the human
genome.
The centre will continue the worm genome project and begin to apply its
lessons to the much larger task of finding the sequence of chemical
'letters' in the 100,000 human genes. Several sites in Cambridge are being
considered for it.
The research will have strong international links, especially with the US,
France and Japan.
The Wellcome Trust is the world's largest medical charity, with a budget of
more than Pounds 100m a year - half as much as the state-funded MRC -
derived mainly from its majority stake in the Wellcome drug company.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Warhol silkscreen sold for Dollars 2m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SILKSCREEN creation by Andy Warhol depicting 210 Coca-Cola bottles massed
in seven lines sold for Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.17m) at Christie's in New York
on Tuesday night. The buyer was Thomas Ammann, a Zurich dealer.
The price was below Christie's optimistic estimate of up to Dollars 2.8m but
the fact that the work sold for such a comparatively high sum will reassure
the contemporary art market, which has suffered a two-year decline.
The sale of 68 lots totalled Dollars 11.26m and was 18 per cent unsold.
Christie's had turned away works it considered unsaleable and had insisted
on low reserves on lots it did accept. That ensured that the great majority
sold, often close to their low estimate.
The painting 'Untitled' by Cy Twombly went for Dollars 660,000, also below
estimate, but 'The Ocean' by Hans Hofmann was at the top of its forecast,
making Dollars 550,000.
Christie's also offered 25 works from the vast collection amassed by the
late Frederik Roos. All but one sold and new auction records were set for
two of the UK's leading contemporary sculptors, Tony Cragg and Barry
Flanagan.
Cragg's 'Three Cast Bottles', executed in 1988 and consisting of three vast
bronze canisters, sold for Dollars 99,000. Flanagan's 'Acrobats', showing
one of his famous hares balancing another, one of an edition of five, made
Dollars 93,500 slightly below the Dollars 100,000-Dollars 150,000 estimate.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Warrant issued for De Lorean
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUC Fraud Squad was yesterday granted a warrant for the arrest of Mr
John De Lorean, the American whose Belfast car company crashed 10 years ago,
after receiving Pounds 70m in government money.
Last week Mr Fred Bushell, former Lotus Car Company chief, admitted he
conspired with Mr De Lorean and others to defraud De Lorean Motor Company of
nearly Pounds 10m.
The US statute of limitations means Mr De Lorean cannot be brought back
against his will.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Engineers urge better technology teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EIGHT-POINT plan to promote technology teaching in schools was put
forward yesterday by the Engineering Council, Andrew Adonis writes.
The plan calls for a practical technology curriculum, based on the design
and manufacture of products and systems. It was written by Professor Alan
Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of Manchester University's education
department.
They say technology is poorly taught in schools in spite of its inclusion as
a core subject in the national curriculum. It is mainly concerned with
generalised problem solving without specific knowledge or practical
application.

Street, London WC2R 3ER. Free.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Smithfield site row resolved in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday resolved a centuries-old dispute between the Crown
and the Corporation of London concerning the Smithfield meat market in
favour of the corporation.
Mr Justice Hoffmann decided that the corporation owned a plot of land
between St Bartholomew's Hospital and the meat market in the north of the
City of London, the ownership of which has been contested for at least 350
years.
The dispute came to a head with an idea to move the meat market and
redevelop the Smithfield site. Moving the outdated market has been supported
by many tenants, concerned about the rising costs of remaining in the City,
and by alternative sites, such as New Covent Garden, the fruit and vegetable
market in Battersea.
Nevertheless the Corporation of London is determined to keep the meat market
in the City and it recently approved a Pounds 50m refurbishment programme to
comply with EC hygiene regulations.
The land was given to the City under a charter granted by Henry VI in 1444.
The High Court yesterday rejected the Crown's argument that it had retained
the ownership of the site under the 1638 charter.
The judge said that his reading of the charter was that it had given
Smithfield to the City, although for the limited use of holding markets and
fairs.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Sharp drop in company failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies passing into receivership and administration last
month dropped to the lowest level since December 1990, indicating possible
economic recovery, figures from accountancy firm Touche Ross showed
yesterday.
There were 389 receivership and administration appointments, according to
statistics derived from the London and Edinburgh Gazettes, compared with 527
in March and 441 in April last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, national director of corporate special services at
Touche Ross, said the decline was 'indicative' of support from banks towards
companies to which they have loaned money.
'This shows grounds for very cautious optimism,' he said. 'But one swallow
doesn't make a summer. We can be much clearer about a trend when we see the
May and June figures.'
The proportion of appointments for last month fell in London and the
south-east - further evidence that the effects of the recession, which
affected the region particularly badly, may be receding.
There were 30 per cent fewer appointments in the service sector than last
year, while there were sharp increases among wholesaling and distribution,
hotel and catering, and retail.
Mr Morris cautioned that business failures normally peak 18 months after the
bottom of a recession, partly because companies are unable to borrow money
as they expand. He said banks also sometimes called in receivers when they
saw the prospect of recovering the value of assets in companies to which
they had made loans.
However, his recent discussions with banks had disclosed that a decreasing
number of companies were in their 'intensive care' departments on the brink
of insolvency.
National Westminster was the bank that most commonly called in receivers and
administrators, with 97 appointments, followed by Barclays, Lloyds and
Midland. Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland also saw an
increase in appointments, which Touche Ross said reflected the increase in
failures in Scotland and the north.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand was awarded the largest number of appointments.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World standard training targets to be promoted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is for the first time actively to support the promotion of
world-class targets for training.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, in a letter to the chairmen
of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils, said one of her main goals was
to raise awareness of national education and training targets.
The targets were initially set by the government but were abandoned by her
predecessor, Mr Michael Howard, who subsequently supported their voluntary
resurrection by the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Howard never said
they were one of his priorities.
Tecs will be responsible at local level for working towards the ambitious
targets, which include 80 per cent of young people reaching National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) at level two by 1996.
At present, 40 per cent achieve that level.
Resources will be provided at national level to promote the targets through
the National Training Task Force, a group of senior business leaders.
Mrs Shephard, in her letter to the 82 Tecs, outlined six goals that she
wanted to achieve in the Tec area. She will discuss them today when she
meets G10, the group of 10 chairmen of Tecs that represents the common
concerns of the movement to government.
G10 will present its own agenda for change at the meeting. Tecs are
concerned about various issues, including cuts in training budgets this year
which they claim may affect the quality of training.
Mrs Shephard will find it as difficult as her predecessor to fight for more
funds from the Treasury but Tecs believe she may take a more active approach
to promoting them.
Mrs Shepard's goals are: raising awareness of and securing commitments to
targets and securing their delivery; boosting the performance of Investors
in People; promotion of Tecs, defence of their budgets and clarification of
their relationship with government; and taking forward work on women's
issues.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIED WOMEN are finding themselves in a 'ghetto of part-time work' because
of managers' outdated assumptions about attitudes to jobs, according to
research by Lancaster University into employment in the retail sector.
While married women were thought to be reliable, loyal and flexible, it was
also assumed they would take time off because of their children and give
their husbands' careers precedence, the report found.
The majority of the supermarket employees studied were part-timers, and most
of those were married women.
Stores surveyed were Asda, J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer, Littlewoods and
EH Booth branches in the Lancaster area.

FT  07 MAY 92 / House prices fall 1 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell 1 per cent last month, according to seasonally adjusted
figures from Halifax Building Society.
It was the sixth consecutive monthly fall, but Halifax said it expected the
clear Tory win at the election to rekindle confidence, with prices
stabilising later this year. That would be followed by a gentle rise before
Christmas and a strengthening in 1993.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the winter and election uncertainties
had kept mortgage lending subdued in the first quarter but the interest rate
cuts should help it to pick up.
Gross mortgage advances in the three months fell to Pounds 12.8bn from
Pounds 14.9bn in the previous quarter. New lending fell nearly 15 per cent
to Pounds 4.6bn.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Smaller building societies complain over large rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOURNEMOUTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOMINATION of the Building Societies Association by larger societies is
forcing their smaller counterparts to consider new ways of representing
their interests, chiefs of the smaller societies claimed yesterday.
The smaller societies said at the annual BSA conference in Bournemouth that
they were unable to secure adequate representation in the association and
that the interests of the 20 largest societies had diverged from those of
the smallest 65.
They complain privately that the industry's leaders are putting pressure on
them to surrender their independence through mergers. Many of the small ones
are smaller than most branches of Halifax, the largest society.
In the past two years, several informal gatherings of small building
societies have begun to meet regularly outside the BSA. There is also a
small-societies forum at which common issues are discussed.
Some executives in smaller societies say privately that this week's cuts in
mortgage rates by the larger societies are partly intended to put pressure
on smaller lenders.
The small societies are also unhappy at remarks by Halifax Building Society
that it is not a lender of last resort guaranteeing savings deposits in
smaller societies.
However, they have not yet declared an open revolt and appear reluctant to
face the possibility that they might eventually have to set up a trade
association of their own.
Halifax and BSA officials yesterday disclaimed any knowledge of unrest.
Nationwide, the second-largest society, is cutting the rate for new
borrowers by 0.29 points to 10.7 per cent on loans of up to Pounds 60,000;
by 0.25 points to 10.3 per cent for Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 120,000; and by
0.4 points to 10 per cent for Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 300,000. TSB has cut
its rate for new borrowers from 10.95 per cent to 10.65 per cent. Neither
has announced when existing borrowers will see a reduction.
Complaints against societies are expected to have doubled in the year to the
end of March, building societies ombudsman Mr Stephen Edell said yesterday
in Bournemouth. Changes to savings rates and difficulties with cash machines
top the list.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Hammersmith in court over interest rate swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Bank went to the High Court in London yesterday to claim Pounds
2.94m from the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in an action arising
from the interest rate swaps debacle.
The action is one of six lead cases selected from the multiplicity of
litigation between banks and local authorities that followed the House of
Lords ruling in January last year that all swaps deals were invalid because
they had been outside councils' legal powers.
The ruling left 80 banks facing losses of about Pounds 560m on swap
transactions with 130 councils. Their only recourse was to try to recover
about a quarter of their losses by suing councils for funds they earned by
writing swap contracts.
The lead cases were selected because they covered most of the points of law
arising from the Lords' ruling. The intention was that they would enable the
court to give guidance for the remaining cases and reduce litigation.
That intention was frustrated when four of the lead cases were settled out
of court.
The opening of Chemical Bank's claim was delayed for an hour by last-minute
discussions at the door of the court yesterday. Although they did not bear
immediate fruit, negotiations are continuing and it seems unlikely that the
case will run its estimated six weeks before terms are agreed.
Mr Richard Southwell QC, for Chemical Bank, told Mr Justice Hirst that the
bank, which had made two swaps contracts with Hammersmith in March 1988, had
assumed that local authorities entering into such transactions were hedging
their interest rate risks as end users.
It had been a considerable surprise to the bank to learn during the
litigation that led to the Lords' ruling that in its contracts with
Chemical, Hammersmith had been trading for profit in the swaps market and
acting as an intermediary between the bank and two rate-capped London
councils, Haringey and Camden.
If Chemical had known the true position, it would not have entered into the
contracts. Its policy in relation to swaps had been not to deal with
rate-capped councils.
Hammersmith now contended that intermediation could be justified as
amounting to the management of interest risks on its debts.
The council's defence was that Chemical had voluntarily assumed the risk
that the deals might prove to be beyond Hammersmith's powers and its
payments to the council had therefore been voluntary and irrecoverable.
Mr Southwell said it was a somewhat remarkable proposition that a bank would
voluntarily hand over large sums on such a basis.
He said Hammersmith had been party to 592 swaps deals involving a notional
Pounds 6bn. The potential loss to its ratepayers - had the Lords not ruled
such transactions void - would have been Pounds 194.2m.
The fact that Hammersmith had been saved from making good that loss could be
taken into account when considering whether it was reasonable for it to make
restitution to Chemical Bank, Mr Southwell said.
The hearing continues today.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Early independence urged for central banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL central banks of the European Community should be made
independent as soon as possible after the planned start in January 1994 of
stage two of European economic and monetary union, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the
Danish central bank governor, said yesterday.
Mr Hoffmeyer, who also chairs the committee of EC central bank governors,
said central bank independence would improve the co-ordination of EC
monetary policy, which is an important part of moves towards Emu.
He was giving the 11th annual Mais lecture at the City University Business
School in London. Mr Hoffmeyer was careful not to mention any EC central
bank by name. However, his remarks are likely to renew controversy about the
status of the Bank of England.
The Bank has made no secret about wanting more independence. The Treasury
acknowledges that the Bank will have to be independent if Britain moves with
other EC member states to full monetary union in the third and final stage
of Emu but the government has rejected earlier independence for the Bank
because monetary policy will remain a national responsibility and it says
that should be accountable to parliament.
Mr Hoffmeyer also criticised the Emu provisions of the Maastricht treaty for
being 'weaker than appropriate'.
He noted that monetary policy would be concentrated in the European System
of Central Banks once full Emu had been established, while governments would
very largely retain responsibility for fiscal policy.
As a result, a close relationship between the future European central
banking system and 12 national decision-making units in fields other than
monetary policy would be difficult.
Although Mr Hoffmeyer said the proposed Emu blueprint 'is definitely a
workable proposition', he expressed concern about how it would operate.
Lines of liaison would have to be created between the future EC monetary
authority and national economic policy-making units. Such lines would be
weaker than existing links at the national level.
'This implies that the system will be more vulnerable,' he warned. 'There
will be a higher risk that tensions will create dissatisfaction at the
national level.'

FT  07 MAY 92 / GEC joins battle for Pounds 2bn deal: Three vie for
helicopter order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GEC group joined the US helicopter manufacturer, Bell Helicopter
Textron, yesterday to compete for a Pounds 2bn contract to supply anti-tank
helicopters to the British Army.
The agreement between GEC and Bell brings a third leading contender to the
contest, which is expected to be the biggest in UK arms procurement between
now and the end of the century.
The others are Westland, the UK helicopter maker, in collaboration with
McDonnell Douglas of the US, and British Aerospace in association with the
Franco-German Eurocopter consortium.
The Ministry of Defence plans to invite formal tenders in October and to
place a contract in June 1994. That would initially involve 12 helicopters,
but the purchase is expected to total about 125.
The contract, to replace the Westland Lynx helicopter now in service, would
include weapons, ground equipment, training and support.
GEC and Bell are offering a variant of Bell's AH1W Super Cobra, derived from
the Huey Cobra and developed for use in the Vietnam war in the 1960s.
The UK version, the Cobra Venom, would feature GEC electronics. GEC Avionics
would lead the project.
Westland has already reached agreement with McDonnell Douglas for a
UK-assembled version of the AH64 Apache. BAe is preparing to lead a rival
bid by the Franco-German Tiger helicopter, which is still under development.
GEC's entry into the contest is part of a strategy aimed at securing a
leading place for the group in prime contractorship for whole defence
programmes.
Last year GEC failed in a joint bid with BAe for a Pounds 1.5bn contract to
manage the supply of EH101 Merlin helicopters to the Royal Navy.
The British Army has indicated a strong preference for the Apache because of
its impressive fire power. A recent report by US Congressional
investigators, however, raised questions as to how reliably the helicopter
performed in the Gulf campaign.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Confident Tories pin hopes on turnround: The prospects for
political parties in the local elections in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Conservatives, long accustomed to keeping their upper lips stiff in
the face of adversity, are suddenly beaming with confidence. They believe
they will do well in today's district council elections and consolidate the
turnround in their fortunes that began with the general election.
In the prize target of Edinburgh, Mrs Christine Richard, leader of the Tory
party, says: 'I am quite convinced that we are going to win here. I believe
Conservative party supporters will turn out and the disaffected ones will
come back to us.'
The party is still basking in delight at confounding sceptics by winning two
extra seats in the general election and increasing its share of the Scottish
vote - admittedly by just 1.7 percentage points to 25.7 per cent.
Tories gaze at the turmoil in the opposition parties, each of which lost a
seat and failed to make promised conquests - although the Scottish National
party's vote went up by 7.5 points to 21.5 per cent.
Yet the Tories hold only three councils, the same number as the Liberal
Democrats, while the SNP has only one. Labour controls 27 of the 53 Scottish
districts and the rest are held by independents or non-Tory coalitions.
The Conservatives believe they will win Perth and Kinross, run by an
SNP/Lib-Dem/independent coalition, and Stirling, where Mr Michael Forsyth
held his parliamentary seat on April 9 and where Labour rules thanks to the
spin of a coin by the returning officer after a dead heat in 1988.
They hold Berwickshire, where most of their councillors are unopposed, and
should keep Eastwood, and Bearsden and Milngavie, both outside Glasgow. They
hope to gain seats in Aberdeen and to remove the Liberal Democrats from
power in Gordon, although they have no seats there at the moment.
The main goal, though, is Edinburgh, which the Tories lost to Labour in
1984. In 1988 the Conservatives took 22 wards against Labour's 32 in spite
of winning 70 more votes overall than Labour. To win a majority the Tories
need a swing to them of 6 per cent, although a 1.5 per cent swing would be
enough to rob Labour of its majority.
Even the most enthusiastic canvassers of all parties admit that the voters
are suffering from election fatigue. Yet the SNP is presenting the district
elections as a re-run of April 9 and is fielding more candidates than any
other party.
Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, sees it as a 'second chance' for Scots 'to
vote in the light of the general election result'.
The SNP has taken up the call raised after the general election for a
multi-option referendum on Scotland's constitutional future. SNP councils
and individual councillors will be committed to trying to organise the
referendum - offering a choice of independence, a devolved parliament and
the status quo - some time next year.
It remains to be seen whether many voters will ignore local issues such as
poll tax levels and housing to vote SNP on a national issue.
So far the party controls only one council, Angus. It takes comfort from a
System Three poll last week which put its support at 25 per cent, 3 points
up on the general election.
The SNP expects to win control of Banff and Buchan, and of Moray, from
independents. Both are in the north-east, where the SNP's MPs are. It also
hopes to capture Cumbernauld in the central belt, where Labour kept control
in 1988, again on the spin of a coin in a dead heat. Further gains such as
West Lothian, Clackmannan and Kilmarnock will still need substantial swings
from Labour.
The Liberal Democrats will be under pressure from the Tories in Gordon, in
north-east Fife and in Annandale and Eskdale in the south-west. As in other
parts of Britain they are strong in their own local-government areas.
The big question is whether Labour can motivate enough of its supporters to
go out and vote.
Having failed to win power at Westminster and being unable to deliver the
Scottish parliament it had promised, it is the most demoralised and divided
of the Scottish parties. Last week's opinion poll put its support at 36 per
cent, 3 points below the general election result.
Labour is protected in many districts, however, by the large swings of votes
needed by the opposition to unseat it. Provided its hardcore supporters turn
out to vote, its losses should be limited. If not, there will have been a
political earthquake.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Ford moves 300 R&amp;D jobs to Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD's restructuring of its European research and development operations
will consolidate them at its sites at Dunton, Essex, and Merkenich, near
Cologne in Germany.
As part of the restructuring, announced earlier this week, about 300 jobs
are to be transferred from the UK to Germany and 20-30 jobs will be moved
from Germany to the UK. Ford's Aveley engineering site, about 10 miles from
Dunton, will close. Ford said there would be no compulsory redundancies.
In the UK, Ford plans to move by the end of 1994 1,200 engineering staff
from satellite operations at Aveley, Basildon and Dagenham in Essex to the
main R&amp;D site at Dunton, where the total workforce will be increased to
nearly 4,000.
In Germany, about 1,300 staff are to be relocated to Merkenich from other
sites in Cologne. That will bring the total at the site to about 3,300,
including the 300 jobs transferred from the UK.
The engineering reorganisation follows a far-reaching review by Ford of its
European automotive operations, which had a net loss last year (including
Jaguar) of Dollars 1.079bn (Pounds 605m) from a net profit of Dollars 145m
in 1990.
Mr John Oldfield, Ford of Europe vice-president for product programmes,
vehicle and design, said the company was seeking to bring together design
engineers and production engineers at one site so that 'we can achieve
better communication and teamwork and thereby generate significant quality
and efficiency gains'.
Ford says it has to spend 10 per cent to 15 per cent more than rival
carmakers in Europe to have its R&amp;D operations split between the UK and
Germany.
However, it emphasised its continuing commitment to research and development
in the UK yesterday.
The company said it had invested heavily at Dunton, where the site
facilities had a total capital value of about Pounds 500m. It was planning
capital investment totalling Pounds 40m at Dunton this year, having spent an
average of Pounds 20m a year there since 1985.
Research and development expenditure at Dunton totalled Pounds 236m last
year. Further jobs would be created at Dunton over the next three years.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Leaseholders to be given right to buy -
Lease Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is proposing to give many of Britain's 1.5m long-leaseholders
of flats the right to buy a share in the freehold of their building.
The proposal, to be included in a Housing, Land and Urban Development Bill,
will end the centuries old system by which much of the country's property
reverts to the original landlord once the lease expires.
Flat-owners in blocks will get the right to buy their freehold at market
value, provided two-thirds of householders in the block vote in favour. The
buyers will become the joint freeholders for any tenants or leaseholders who
do not participate.
The right will only apply to properties where not more than 10 per cent of
the floorspace, excluding common parts, such as staircases, is used for
non-residential purposes.
At least two-thirds of the flats must be held by long-leaseholders, those
whose original lease was for more than 21 years.
Crown property and charitable trust housing already let at a discount will
be exempt, as will converted flats in houses where the landlord is resident.
Flat-owners in blocks which do not qualify will get the right to extend
their leases, at market price.
The Bill does not include proposals to introduce a new system of common
ownership or 'commonhold' of blocks of flats for new developments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and risked possible protests from its own supporters - by accelerating a
review of parliamentary constituencies which would help the Conservative
party at the next general election.
The work of Boundary Commissions is seldom without controversy. Before the
1983 election, Mr Michael Foot, then Labour leader, tried to use the courts
to prevent the last review's implementation.
After the 1955 general election, when acrimoniously debated changes
undoubtably helped the Tories to increase their majority from 17 to 60,
there was a consensus that the period between reviews should be extended.
The four Boundary Commissions (for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland) were to report every 10 to 15 years, rather than every three to
seven years.
Now Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is risking charges of
'gerrymandering' by planning to reduce the period between reviews to eight
to 12 years. More immediately, the Boundary Commissions' work, begun in
1991, will be speeded up. A statutory deadline of the end of 1994 will allow
conclusions to be reached in 'good time' for the next election, the Home
Office said.
The work could probably be approved by parliament well before May 15 1997 -
the latest date for the next general election. The consensus at Westminster
is that the reviews will help the Tories to gain up to 20 seats.
The 1983 review, which formed the basis for last month's general election,
was drawn up on the 1976 electoral register. There have since been
substantial movements of population out of inner cities - traditionally
Labour's strongest areas. Mr John Major's constituency of Huntingdon, for
instance, has an electorate of 92,913 while Birmingham Sparkbrook, held by
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour deputy leader, has only 51,677.
But experience suggests that that will not stop complaints from Tory MPs who
will lose out - such as in Chelsea which has an electorate of 42,371 - and
even name changes could lead to local complaints.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Lottery angers pools workers - National
Lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USDAW, the union representing workers in the pools industry, voted
unanimously yesterday to campaign against the introduction of a national
lottery, warning that it could cost thousands of jobs.
The long-awaited announcement of plans for a UK lottery was first made in
March by the then home secretary, Mr Kenneth Baker, after a determined
campaign by lobby groups and a number of prominent MPs and public figures.
The new Department of National Heritage, under Mr David Mellor, is charged
with setting up the lottery, with proceeds going to sport, arts, heritage,
charities and a new Millennium Fund to celebrate the year 2000. It is
estimated that the lottery could raise up to Pounds 1bn a year.
An independent board will be responsible for distribution of the proceeds,
with day-to-day management undertaken by the private sector under contract.
Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw's general secretary, warned that the lottery could
have a serious impact on the pools industry. 'If the pools companies lose
business then our members lose their jobs,' he told the union's annual
conference in Blackpool. Delegates unanimously backed a motion to campaign
against the lottery and to call for support from the TUC and the Labour
party to block the bill.
The pools industry has an annual turnover of Pounds 700m and employs nearly
7,000 people, mainly in Liverpool, with some in Glasgow and Cardiff. It also
provides part-time employment for around 70,000 collectors around the
country.
Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons pools in Liverpool, said he
was sceptical of the claim by lottery supporters that there was plenty of
room in the market for both pools and a lottery.
He said the argument that annual spending on gambling in the UK is
considerably lower than in other countries did not take account of the true
size and diversity of the British gambling market.
Littlewoods, the biggest pools promoter, said it had been invited to make a
joint submission about the lottery with Vernons and Zetters pools to the
government by the beginning of June.
A spokesman said he did not rule out the possibility that the pools industry
might bid to run the lottery itself. 'We have raised billions of pounds over
many years and would certainly be the most qualified to run it,' he said.
Mr Denis Vaughan, the conductor, and head of the Lottery Promotion Company
which has been lobbying for a lottery for more than a year, said he was
delighted with the proposed format, but was anxious that the proceeds should
be used only for capital investment and endowments.
He dismissed the threat to the pools industry, saying that several thousand
jobs were already at risk from a possible move towards online computer
systems. He added that any job losses in that area would be more than offset
by the estimated 85,000 jobs that could be created through investment of
lottery proceeds.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Major's chance to show European heart -
European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major likes to distinguish himself from his predecessor by saying
that Britain is at 'the heart of Europe'. Britain's turn as president of the
European Community for six months, which starts on July 1, will give him an
unrivalled opportunity to show that the heart is beating at a measured but
healthy pace.
Political difficulties in other EC countries, combined with Mr Major's
improved personal stature after the election, seem likely to provide the the
prime minister with an ideal European springboard.
The Queen's Speech made clear that the government will be giving priority to
ensuring a brisk passage for the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty on
European union agreed five months ago.
UK officials are drawing quiet satisfaction from the recent spate of
opposition to the Maastricht treaty in other countries such as Germany and
France.
Britain's view is that the government's well-known scepticism over a federal
Europe has been vindicated by the anti-Maastricht flurry on the continent.
At the same time, setbacks for government parties in elections in France,
Italy and Germany will make Mr Major a more persuasive partner in dealing
with his counterparts from other EC capitals.
The resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the long-serving German
foreign minister, seems likely to weaken, at least temporarily, the cohesion
of the traditional Franco-German alliance in the EC. This may boost the
chances for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to promote British
views.
Britain will be using the presidency to push forward enlargement of the
Community, as well as to complete the establishment of the single market,
due to come into force on January 1 1993.
To stress its commitment to free markets, the government wants to make
particular progress in breaking down trade barriers in life insurance,
transport and energy, and public procurement.
Even before the presidency has started, the aim of EC enlargement is being
emphasised by a series of top-level visits to London from representatives of
applicant countries. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, will be in
Downing Street today, while Mr Esko Aho, the Finnish prime minister, was in
London last week. Both countries, along with Austria, want to join on
January 1 1995.
The government believes that the Community can continue to be 'deepened' -
through the single market, as well as through greater co-operation in
economic and foreign affairs - at the same time as it is being enlarged.
But, as one official puts it, 'deepening is going to slow down as you go
wider.' The UK believes that the timetable for European monetary union will
be delayed by Germany's economic difficulties.
The UK wants to hold out the hope of maximum access to EC markets, and
eventual full membership, for former communist countries Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary. But there is little enthusiasm for the
wide-ranging institutional reforms suggested by Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, as a way of managing a much more numerous Community.
The UK is banking on support from Germany for toning down another Delors
initiative - the plan for a large increase in spending on poorer regions,
conceived as part of the 'cohesion fund' agreed at Maastricht.
Germany's criticisms of Mr Delors' latest suggestions have been as strong as
Britain's. British officials are banking on Mr Major's strong personal
rapport with Chancellor Helmut Kohl to help revise downwards the
Commission's proposals.
Whitehall also opposes signs of growing trends in the Commission towards
interventionism. These were highlighted by the recent row between Sir Leon
Brittan, the competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the
commissioner for industry, over aid for the automotive industry.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Changes to bankruptcy and parole -
Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is proposing a light and relatively uncontroversial
legislative programme for Scotland.
The first of two bills is designed to close loopholes in bankruptcy
legislation. Since the 1985 Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act, many debtors use
sequestration to solve their debt problems.
A debtor transfers his assets to a trustee, who then petitions for
sequestration and for his appointment as permanent trustee under the 1985
Act. As the debtor's estate has few assets, the fees for the trustee
managing the estate are met from public funds, at a total cost in 1991-92 of
Pounds 18.5m.
The government proposes that new powers be given to the accountant in
bankruptcy (a civil servant) to administer sequestrations.
The other measure will reform parole arrangements. Prisoners serving
sentences of less than four years would be released after serving half their
sentence instead of two-thirds as present.
Prisoners serving sentences of four years or more would be eligible for
parole at half-sentence instead of one-third.
Prisoners who commit another offence between release and the end of their
sentence would be recalled to serve the remaining part of their term.
The legislation would bring Scottish practice roughly into line with changes
in England and Wales under the 1991 Criminal Justice Act.
A BILL will promote the use of Welsh in Wales by requiring public sector
bodies to set out schemes for providing services in Welsh, and by
establishing a statutory Welsh Language Board.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Crackdown on vote-rigging - Industrial
relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will, as expected, go ahead with its sixth significant piece
of industrial relations legislation since 1979, persevering with the core
proposals in last July's industrial relations green paper. Only the plan to
make collective agreements legally enforceable has been dropped.
In 1990, the government announced it had completed its programme of
industrial relations reform but then decided to have one more go.
Nevertheless, the new Conservative government is expected to be less hostile
to the unions than its three predecessors and further legislation of this
kind is not expected in this parliament.
One of the four areas for legislation that the government spelt out
yesterday follows allegations of ballot-rigging in the TGWU general union in
1990 and misuse of National Union of Mineworkers funds during the 1984-1985
strike. The government will 'strengthen the rights of trade union members
against fraud and vote-rigging in union elections and mismanagement of their
union's finances'. Proposals include independent scrutineers for election
and enhanced powers for the Certification Officer over union finances.
The second area states that the government will 'give workers greater
freedom to join the union of their choice and protect them against the
unauthorised deduction of subscriptions from salaries'.
The first part involves making the Trades Union Congress rules for
controlling inter-union disputes - the Bridlington rules  - inoperable. Some
union officials fear that the proposal could release a wave of inter-union
disputes, further discrediting trade unionism, and undermine the movement
towards single-union deals.
The second part will hurt union income, 65 per cent of which currently comes
from union subscriptions 'checked-off' at source by employers. Instead of
giving permission only when they join the system, as at present, union
members are likely to have to give written permission for 'check-off' every
three years and must be informed by employers every time the subscription is
raised. Some observers think unions could lose 1m members as a result.
Less controversial proposals include: giving users of public services the
right to take action against unlawful strikes even when the employers do
not; requiring seven days' notice of strike action; and extending the
requirement for postal ballots to strike ballots.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Businesses win more rate relief - Local
Government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCILLORS WILL be relieved to hear that for once local government,
prominent in recent years, is notable for its virtual absence from the
Queen's Speech.
Virtual, because occupiers of 900,000 business premises will welcome the one
minor measure proposed: to enact the concession announced in the last Budget
extending transitional relief for payers of the uniform business rate,
introduced in 1990.
The concession will spare them any real terms increase in bills in the
current year, with the existing limits on real annual increases to apply
again from 1993-94. It will grant relief on the same terms to new occupiers
when premises change hands.
It will also increase the maximum reduction for businesses in transition to
3 percentage points higher than that applying now. These businesses will
receive all their remaining gains in 1993-94.
The existing transitional arrangements give businesses that face severe rate
increases a year-on-year rise limited to 20 per cent in real terms for large
premises, 15 per cent for small premises and 10 per cent for small premises
with living accommodation attached.
The reliefs apply to England and Wales, but business rate payers in Scotland
and Northern Ireland - which have different systems  - will gain reductions
of a similar size.
The legislation will backdate the the relief for new occupiers to March and
other changes to April.
Meanwhile, councils will have their hands full introducing the council tax,
due to replace the poll tax next April. A few may also be visited by the
local government commission, another fruit of Mr Michael Heseltine's brief
stint at the environment department, which is examining the case for more
single-tier authorities.
Local councils will be keen to know whether Mr Michael Howard, the new
environment secretary, shares his predecessor's enthusiasm for unitary
authorities. The current signs are that he does not - but a strong Tory
lobby is urging him to the contrary. With county council elections due next
year, the outcome will soon be a hot issue in Britain's council chambers.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Radical schools syllabus based on opting
out - Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER FOUR years of radical but piecemeal tinkering, the government intends
in the coming session to enshrine in legislation its blueprint for state
schools in the 21st century.
A white paper will be published before the summer, with legislation soon
after.
The regime for schools that have opted out of local education authority
control will be the white paper's main preoccupation. Of the 25,000 state
schools in England and Wales, only 217 are currently grant-maintained -
funded directly from Whitehall, with their governors enjoying almost
unfettered control over their management, budgets and recruitment, subject
to fulfilling the national curriculum.
A substantial increase in that number is top of the agenda for Mr John
Patten, the new education secretary. He wants to see most of England and
Wales's 4,000 secondary schools grant-maintained within a few years, and to
make inroads into the primary sector, which currently boasts only 34
grant-maintained schools out of 21,000.
The Tory election manifesto proposed that primary schools be allowed to opt
out in groups - to share management and overhead costs, even budgets. A plan
on those lines will doubtless feature in the white paper.
It is also likely to include provision for a funding council for
grant-maintained schools. The education department believes that if more
than 1,000 schools opt out then it will be obliged to introduce some form of
funding body. It is estimated that this number may be achieved within two
years.
However, Mr Patten will not only be concerned with numbers and funding. His
white paper will have to address two other crucial issues: the future of
local education authorities, shorn of day-to-day control of schools; and the
type of education to be provided by grant-maintained schools.
Some Tories would like to see local education authorities abolished outright
once opting out has achieved a critical mass. Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Patten's
predecessor, was no fan of local government. Mr Patten may be more
sympathetic to retaining a distinct servicing and 'enabling' role for
councils in a reformed system.
The issue of selection is at the heart of the second aspect. The Tory
manifesto pledged to allow grant-maintained schools to introduce selection
'if that is what parents clearly want and it fits in with the wider needs of
the local area'.
The wording was deliberately vague. Mr Patten will want to avoid the trauma
involved in a wholesale return to selection through some newfangled 11-plus
exam.
Yet he recognises the popularity of grammar schools, particularly in the
Tory shires (where most of the remaining 159 are located), and is keen to
promote diversity and choice for parents. Extending the idea of 'magnet'
schools and city technology colleges, specialising in particular areas of
the curriculum, is the most plausible way forward.
The Queen's Speech also promised 'to promote vocational training for young
people and adults'. Although less divisive politically and requiring no
legislation, this is as important an issue as opting out. The first general
vocational qualifications - intended to offer a vocational alternative to
A-levels for full-time students - are to be piloted over the coming year.
Whether a success or failure, the fate of these qualifications may have a
profound impact on the shape of post-16 year old education.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): Hurried along the track to
privatisation - British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF BRITISH Rail had harboured hopes that political and practical obstacles
to its long-awaited privatisation were pushing the event ever further into
the distance, it must have been sorely disappointed by the Queen's Speech
yesterday.
The government made it clear that it was determined not only to secure a
large-scale hand-over of BR's operations to the private sector, but to do it
much more quickly than had been expected.
Within days, the British Rail and British Coal (Transfer Proposals) Bill
will be put to parliament, seeking powers to do essential preparatory work
for the privatisation of the rail and coal industries.
This will be a purely technical measure: but in the case of the railways, it
is expected to be followed within weeks by the much-delayed privatisation
White Paper, and by full-blown legislation in the shape of a Rail Bill as
soon as the autumn.
Cynics will say they have heard that before, only to see see the plans
founder amid ministerial wrangling or the sheer impossibility of finding a
buyer for such a heavily loss-making operation.
But if the government has at last found a successful formula, the result
could be radical change for Britain's railways - not so much in the form of
the 'big bang' privatisation originally envisaged by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
former transport secretary, as in the form of a creeping denationalisation.
The framework agreed by Mr John MacGregor, Mr Rifkind's successor, and the
rest of the Cabinet follows the lines set out in the Conservative party's
election manifesto.
BR will be split into two bodies: one owning the railway tracks and
associated infrastructure, and the other operating the trains. Separate
accounting systems will be set up so that the track body knows how much to
charge train operators for the use of its tracks.
Once that charging system is in place, it will be possible to give private
sector operators the right to run trains on BR's tracks provided they are
prepared to pay the price. Several companies, including Mr Richard Branson's
Virgin Group, have already expressed an interest in becoming train
operators.
The next step will be to start getting BR's own services into the private
sector. To quell fears of line closures, ownership of the track
infrastructure will stay with BR indefinitely, but the operation of the
trains will gradually be handed to the private sector. The freight and
parcels operations will be sold, and the operation of passenger services
will be franchised to private sector operators, with subsidies to ensure the
preservation of loss-making but socially necessary services.
One possibility is that passenger services will be franchised in groups of
routes, so paving the way for the re-emergence of regional companies such as
the London Brighton and South Coast.
An official regulator will be set up to award the passenger service
franchises and to make sure that BR's track infrastructure body treats
private sector entrants fairly. Safety, as now, will be administered by the
Railway Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive.
The government will also seek powers in the bill to sell stations outright
to the private sector - not just to franchisees operating the trains that
run through them, but to any private-sector operator which believes it can
make more productive use of the assets than BR.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said Labour favoured more
private investment in the railways, but he opposed the break-up of the
railways and the removal of strategic decision-making from the government.
Trains and tracks needed to be upgraded together to get the best out of
both, he said. Dividing the ownership of tracks and trains meant that
investment in the two would not be co-ordinated. The break-up of the network
would also lead to a fragmentation of services, swingeing cuts in fringe
routes such as those in rural areas, and big fare increases.
The omission from the Queen's Speech of controversial proposals for the
deregulation and privatisation of London's buses is likely to be seen as a
setback for Mr MacGregor.
Transport minsters had repeatedly promised the extension of de-regulation to
the capital's buses early in the next parliament. The plans have met strong
resistance from bus user groups, the London boroughs, the London Tourist
Board and others.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): Generators hold key to size -
British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATISATION of British Coal was confirmed, although no timetable was
given. Civil servants said yesterday that the sale could take place by the
end of next year.
The announcement provoked fresh criticism from the Labour party and mining
communities, which believe that the controversial privatisation could lead
to the closure of more of British Coal's 49 remaining pits.
The government itself says that the size of the company will be determined
not by privatisation, but by the contracts agreeing how much coal British
Coal sells to the privatised electricity industry.
The Queen's Speech announcement will intensify pressure for these contracts
 -which represent the bulk of British Coal's revenue  - to be renegotiated
within the next few months. Existing contracts expire in March 1993.
But they are proving difficult to settle, because the two big electricity
generators, National Power and PowerGen, believe that British Coal's product
is too expensive.
The signs are that they are reluctant to buy more than 50m tonnes - possibly
falling to less over the life of the contract - compared with 65m in the old
contracts. But this would force British Coal to close more pits.
The electricity companies accept that the government will have to intervene
to forge a deal that is acceptable to all the parties concerned.
There are still many obstacles. The generators need to back their contracts
with sales to the regional electricity companies, which supply domestic
consumers. And the regional companies are waiting for the regulator to give
them a sign of the kind of deal he thinks would be fair on domestic
consumers. But the regulator said yesterday that the negotiations between
British Coal and the generators were a matter for them alone.
The government will have to resolve this issue before it can proceed with
the privatisation.
It can, however, proceed with legislation. The first stage, the Queen's
Speech indicated, would be a 'paving bill'. This bill, which is expected
shortly, will simply give British Coal powers to restructure itself in
preparation for the sale.
This will be followed, probably in the autumn, by the privatisation bill, or
Coal Bill, itself - clearing the way for the sale late in 1993.
A white paper, or policy document setting out the government's approach,
would precede the bill, said officials at the Department of Trade and
Industry, which is now responsible for energy.
So far, the government has given few clues about how the privatisation will
be structured, and ministers are still studying reports from N M Rothschild,
the merchant bank advising on the privatisation.
But a likely option is that the company will be split into two or more
parts, and sold to trade buyers.
One prospective buyer is the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM), which,
with Lloyds Bank, is planning an employee-led buy-out of the company.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): More measured approach -
Political asylum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL momentum behind the Asylum Bill has fallen since it was first
published last November. And while the government still regards the task of
controlling flows of refugees into Britain as a serious problem it gave the
bill little more than a passing reference in yesterday's legislative agenda.
With the election out of the way, and with the first three months of the
year showing a sharp fall in asylum requests, the government can adopt a
more measured approach.
The Bill was postponed by being withdrawn from the committee stage in the
House of Lords in February. This followed fierce criticism from lawyers,
church leaders and refugee organisations.
Opponents claimed that plans for a highly restricted appeals procedure for
applicants refused asylum could lead to refugees being unjustly returned to
face persecution in their home countries.
Government officials said yesterday that it was not clear when the bill
would be resubmitted. If it were delayed until the autumn, the bill would
not become law until next summer.
The government has made clear that the Bill will be reintroduced with the
amendments already made during its passage through the Commons earlier this
year.
The bill as originally tabled gave asylum-seekers only 48 hours to request
leave to appeal against their applications being turned down. The government
has since increased this to 10 days, a period which Amnesty says still does
not give applicants sufficient time to prepare their cases.
According to government figures, there were 44,700 applications for asylum
in the UK last year, a 10-fold increase compared with 1988. Officials
however recognise that a large proportion reflected requests by people
placing more than one application in order to defraud the social security
authorities.
Applications in the first three months this year fell to only 1,730 a month
against an average of 3,730 last year.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): Scheme to spur inner-city
renewal - Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will renew its assault on inner-city dereliction in a
Housing, Land and Urban Development Bill, which will also extend home
ownership to more council tenants and strengthen their hands in getting
repairs done to their homes.
The headline-catching provision of the bill will be the creation of an Urban
Regeneration Agency to co-ordinate the task of regenerating England's inner
cities. The agency is to be headed by Mr Peter Walker, a former Conservative
minister who retired from the Commons at the last election.
The main function of the agency will be to bring back into use vacant and
underused land. It will have compulsory purchase powers, in the same way as
the existing urban development corporations in London's Docklands and other
UK cities, including Liverpool and Birmingham.
The corporations have had some success in using limited amounts of
government finance to lever in private capital, attracting developers by
reclaiming derelict land and putting infrastructure in place. The agency is
expected to take over responsibility for administering much of the present
government spending on urban programmes. However, ministers appear to have
ruled out giving it responsibility for administering City Challenge, the
competitive bidding by towns and cities for urban development funds.
A second measure in the Bill will offer council tenants a chance to become
part-owners of their homes, through rent to mortgage schemes. With more than
1.4m council homes bought by their tenants since 1981 under the hugely
successful right to buy legislation, these schemes reach further down the
income ladder to those who cannot afford full ownership.
In return for accepting some obligations of ownership, the tenant's rent is
converted into mortgage payments, buying part of the equity in the home. The
intention is that tenants acquire full ownership by stepping up their
payments at a later date, or cash in their equity when they move home.
However, pilot studies in Scotland, rural Wales, Basildon and Milton Keynes
have not indicated great demand for rent to mortgage schemes. Fewer than 400
tenants have taken them up in all four areas.
'Given the low level of take-up so far, there is no reason to believe that a
national scheme will be popular,' said Mr John Perry, head of policy at the
Institute of Housing. 'And rent to mortgage schemes will do nothing to
address the urgent need to help homeowners move back to renting if they can
no longer afford to buy.'
Also to be strengthened is the right to repair, which allows council tenants
to get essential and urgent repairs done when the local authority fails to
do them in time.
The existing scheme has not been a conspicuous success, mainly because it
was administratively cumbersome and relied on the tenant to pay the bill and
claim the money back. A consultative paper put out last autumn suggested
that tenants should be able to get essential and urgent repairs done by
contacting contractors on an approved list who would send the bill for the
work to the council.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Kinnock attacks Tory lack of ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT had returned to office with no new ideas as to how to tackle
Britain's underlying economic weaknesses or to build a sustained recovery,
Mr Neil Kinnock told the Commons yesterday.
In a confident performance, the Labour leader used his last important state
occasion as leader of the opposition to highlight continuing high
unemployment and the danger that tax rises or spending cuts will be needed
to balance the budget.
In spite of a jobless total of 2.7m, there was 'nothing new' in the
government's approach and the word 'unemployment' was not even mentioned in
the speech, he pointed out. Its strategy for growth was entirely
consumption-led, included no measures to restore training funding, provide
incentives for industrial investment or reverse the reduction in
research-and-development spending. Meanwhile, Britain lay at the bottom of
the Group of Seven industrialised nations' league table for growth,
investment and employment.
Rising to Labour cheers, Mr Kinnock began with a witty, if barbed, tribute
to Mr Kenneth Baker, the former cabinet minister who moved the loyal
address, and his seconder, Mr Andrew Mitchell, the MP for Gedling. In their
choice of speakers, he remarked, the Tory whips had combined exuberance with
experience and a loyal Heathite with a loyal Thatcherite - 'all together in
the person of the Rt Hon member for Mole Valley'.
Mr Baker, he added, had been described as 'capable of falling from grace
without hitting the ground'. The Labour leader went on to compliment Mr
Mitchell on his 'rare admission' of ambition. Some of the greatest love
affairs he had ever seen in the Commons, he said, 'have been by one
Honourable Member unaccompanied'.
Turning to the Queen's Speech itself, Mr Kinnock said Labour could support
the government's commitments to combating drug trafficking and terrorism. It
also backed efforts to bring peace to Yugoslavia, push forward the process
of nuclear disarmament and participate in the environment conference in Rio
de Janeiro.
He then went on to the attack, charging Mr John Major with failing to tackle
adequately the issue of joblessness. Unemployment and the fear of
unemployment were hanging over individuals, families and households, he
said: 'Yet the prime minister cannot even bring himself to mention the word
in this Queen's Speech.'
He challenged Mr Major to say how he would rid the country of unemployment
and reduce the budget deficit in the medium term. Such a goal required
either growth rates in excess of those reached at the height of the boom in
oil revenues, or tax increases, or public expenditure cuts.
Mr Kinnock added: 'When the government says with such certainly they will
get rid of the budget deficit in the medium term, they must know how they
are planning to do that.'
The National Lottery now to be set up was an apt symbol for policies that
were making 'life itself' a gamble, with schools and hospitals opting out of
local control in such a way as to make the provision of their services a
matter of chance.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, urged the government to give a
strong lead on Europe by moving to the narrow band of the exchange rate
mechanism and ditching the 'unnecessary and damaging' opt-out clause on
Britain's entry into European monetary union.
Britain's European presidency was beginning at a crucial time, with many
European countries facing internal difficulties. It would be 'very easy
indeed' for Europe to lose momentum at this stage.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: MPs gain question time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF parliament will be able to ask questions directly about the
Citizen's Charter for the first time under the new arrangements for
departmental questions to be approved by the Commons today.
There will also be an extended opportunity to ask questions on the arts,
with Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, having a 40-minute
question slot once every four weeks.
Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter, will
face questions from MPs for 20 minutes once every three weeks. Mr John
Taylor, the new junior minister in the lord chancellor's department, will
answer MPs' questions for 15 minutes once every six weeks.
Energy matters will be subsumed in the hour-long monthly slot for questions
to trade and industry ministers.
The new arrangements for questions have been made quickly, but there is some
uncertainty about when the all-party committees that monitor departments can
be set up.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, is keen to see them established
early, but at present there are difficulties about the timing of opposition
nominations.
Labour party rules say that no frontbench spokesman can be a select
committee member. Until the shadow cabinet elections are over - in late July
 -and junior spokesmanships agreed, therefore, it will not be clear who will
be available and keen to serve on the committees, including perhaps those
who may have lost places in the frontbench team.
Other Commons committees such as the public accounts committee and the
committee looking at European legislation are likely to be established more
quickly.
The parties will have to decide whether there should be a committee to
monitor the national heritage department. The Opposition hopes that the two
extra Tory MPs for Scottish seats will mean that in this parliament, unlike
the last, a Scottish affairs committee will be appointed.
Labour will also be pressing for the chairmanship of at least one additional
departmental committee, beyond the four it holds already.
As a further element in the Commons' becoming operational again, the three
deputy Speakers, who will take turns at substituting for the Speaker in
presiding over MPs' debates, were appointed yesterday.
Mr Michael Morris, Tory MP for Northampton South, was appointed the senior
deputy Speaker, as chairman of ways and means. Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, the
Labour MP for Pontefract, and Dame Janet Fookes, the Tory MP for Plymouth
Drake, are the other two deputies.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: MI6 comes in from the cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S decision to bring the Secret Intelligence Service in from
the cold was long overdue after the public recognition of organisations such
as the KGB in Russia and the CIA in the US.
For most people, the biggest surprise about SIS - better known as MI6 - was
not that it exists but that Mr Major's reference to the service and Sir
Colin McColl, it's head, during the Queen's Speech debate was the first time
that it has been officially recognised by the government.
Mr Stephen Dorril - whose book, In From The Cold, on the development of the
intelligence services during the 1980s and the 1990s is published in October
 -said: 'We know quite a lot about MI5 and its structure, but we know very
little about MI6, which seems to have escaped attention.'
Like MI5, its sister organisation, MI6 developed from branches of British
military intelligence during the First World War. It is responsible for the
collection of foreign intelligence, particularly in the military and
economic spheres. It also carries out counter-espionage, involving the
infiltration of foreign intelligence services.
The idea that the existence of a secret service should in itself be classed
as a secret was exposed to ridicule in the 1980s with debacles such as the
failed government prosecution of Mr Peter Wright for alleged breaches of the
Official Secrets Act in the publication of Spycatcher, his account of his
career in MI5.
The announcement is part of a wider trend towards accountability.
MI6 managed to maintain its cloak of secrecy longer than MI5 whose new head,
Mrs Stella Rimington, was announced late last year.
New MI6 offices close to Vauxhall Bridge in London are currently under
construction. The organisation has about 2,000 staff and a budget of about
Pounds 150m.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Major aims to avoid tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in Britain's budget deficit without the imposition of any increase in
taxation was envisaged by Mr John Major, the prime minister, when he
outlined the government's programme for the new parliament in the Commons
yesterday.
He insisted that the renewed confidence generated by the Conservative
party's fourth successive general election victory was already being
reflected in the economy.
To government cheers, the prime minister underlined the favourable impact
already made by Tuesday's  1/2 -percentage-point cut, which brought the bank
rate down to 10 per cent.
After the election, Mr Major said, business surveys had immediately
reflected stronger prospects, the stock market had risen by 10 per cent, and
sterling had risen to DM2.92. He emphasised that the policies endorsed by
the British people were designed to encourage the creation of wealth - 'in
Britain and for Britain'.
He reaffirmed that the government intended to expand the 20p income tax band
 -introduced in the March Budget for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable
income - 'steadily' up the income scale so that it applied to more and more
people. He emphasised that the 40 per cent upper rate was at a 'proper and
sustainable level'.
He announced that the Finance Bill, to implement the proposals from the
Budget that could not be enacted before the election, would be introduced
later this month.
Mr Major promised to carry forward the 'crusade' against over-regulation and
state interference, and renewed his commitment to opposing any pressure from
the European Community to reimpose handicaps on industry removed during the
Thatcherite era. Amid further government cheers he said: 'Not for us the
interventionism that would put people out of work with minimum wages and
artificial restrictions on working times.'
The prime minister also highlighted the developments it would fall to him to
set in train when Britain assumed the presidency of the EC in July - with
ensuring the survival of 'fledgling' democracies in eastern Europe a top
priority.
Labour backbenchers caustically reminded the prime minister that the
public-sector borrowing requirement for the current financial year was
expected to exceed Pounds 28bn.
Mr Major referred his critics to the figures in the Budget statement, or Red
Book, and assured the House: 'We will seek to stick to them until we have a
balanced budget.' He said the budget deficit reflected cyclical factors and
added: 'As we come out of recession, that deficit will begin to fall.'
Pressed for a detailed explanation of his stance on Scotland, the prime
minister underlined his determination to prevent the break-up of the UK,
stressing that the union was not negotiable.
The government would seek to be 'more responsive' to Scotland's needs, and
he undertook to report back to the House after fulfilling his pledge to take
stock of the situation in the light of the outcome of the election.
Mr Major said the Citizen's Charter would be at the centre of the
government's decision making, with policies designed to make public services
more accountable. Tougher performance targets would be set by Mr William
Waldegrave, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and he would ensure that
high-quality, responsive public services were provided for the individual
citizen.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Realism steers PM's first agenda -
Reduced majority forces caution; Balance of controversial and populist
measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Neil Kinnock began the unfinished task of returning the Labour party
to the centre ground of British politics, somebody coined the phrase 'the
new realism'.
As Mr John Major set out yesterday the first legislative programme that he
can call his own, it was from the comfortable position of a leader who has
defied overwhelming odds to win a fourth term of office for the
Conservatives.
Yet as the prime minister's colleagues emerged from the pomp and ceremony of
the state opening of parliament, the most frequent comment was that his
programme's strength lay as much in its realism as its radicalism.
Mr Major has not abandoned reform in favour of consolidation - but he has
called a halt to the permanent revolution that proved the downfall of his
predecessor.
The programme for the next 18 months is radical in intent but realistic in
its ambitions. It is intended to reinforce his reputation for achieving
objectives by consensus rather than confrontation. It recognises that there
is a world outside Westminster, that legislation is not the sole instrument
of change.
That does not mean it will be free of controversy. The short bill due within
a few days to implement the treaties concluded at the Maastricht summit will
provoke great public soul-searching on the right of the Conservative party.
With his majority reduced to 21, Mr Major cannot afford more than a handful
of rebels.
Mr Major's promise to make the London government more responsive to
Scotland's aspirations may do little to cap the rising tide of support north
of the border for a new constitutional settlement.
Legislation to privatise British Coal and parts of British Rail may not be
free from political risk. The first will force a belated acknowledgement
from the government that many more pits will be forced to close. The second
will throw up more hidden horrors - and demands for public money - than
ministers are ready to accept.
The education bill planned for the autumn - designed to accelerate rapidly a
move towards grant-maintained status for most of the nation's schools - will
oblige the government to decide who or what will replace local authorities
in making strategic decisions about educational provision. Some parents will
welcome the return of selective education. Many more will not.
Mr Major has been careful to balance the difficult with the more instantly
populist. The National Lotteries Bill and legislation establishing the urban
regeneration agency and extending further rights  - including rents into
mortgages - to council tenants promise some good headlines.
Even without its present debilitating troubles over the party leadership,
Labour would find it hard to stir public anger against the bill promising a
further erosion of the power of trade unions.
The pace will be more sedate. Ministers are desperately anxious to counter
the impression that parliament could be twiddling its thumbs for much of the
18 months. They admit, though, that the programme has been designed to mesh
with the proposed reform of MPs' working hours and with the political
reality of a reduced majority.
The prime minister's public avowal yesterday of the existence of the Secret
Intelligence Service was designed to signal another break with the past by
promising a more open, relaxed, style of government. But there was a more
substantial shift.
Much of the legislation has been framed around Mr Major's belief in
individual choice, ownership and responsibility, but a single sentence
emphasises the core of his own prospectus. The government, it says, will
'give priority to improving public services through the Citizen's Charter
which will be at the centre of decision-making'.
Translated, that means that the welfare state is to be preserved but its
monolithic structure dismantled in favour of a more diverse pattern of
locally managed services.
Mr Major's ambition is to create a new consensus on the management of the
public sector to outflank Labour in the 1990s, in much the same way as his
party's approach to the economy left the Opposition stranded during the
1980s.
It may prove a powerful brand of realism.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Environment protection pledge from top banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL banks in 23 countries, with combined assets of Dollars 1,500bn
(Pounds 847bn), made a formal commitment at the United Nations yesterday to
pursue common principles of environmental protection in all their
operations, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York.
An official of National Westminster Bank of the UK, an initiator of this
first such collective effort by the industry, told a press conference that
environmental risk was now a vital element in credit risk.
The group of 31 signatories did not include any US or Japanese banks. But Dr
Mostafa Tolba, head of the UN environment programme, said Citibank had
expressed an interest.
The signatories included Germany's Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner
Bank; Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp; Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corp;
Westpac of Australia, Royal Bank of Canada, and Royal Bank of Scotland.
Among the principles to which they have committed themselves is to ensure
'the best practices in environmental management, including energy
efficiency, recycling and waste minimisation.'
In a report published today the UN environment programme says that
ecological destruction has accelerated over the last 20 years, David
Lascelles reports from London.
Malnutrition has increased, the gap between rich and poor has widened and
children have become the worst victims of environmental mismanagement.
The report predicts that the world's population, currently 5.4bn, will rise
by a further 1bn by the end of the decade.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Brazil may request loan tranche delay

BRAZIL is likely to ask the International Monetary Fund to delay the second
tranche of a Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.18bn) loan agreed earlier this year
because it has failed to meet some targets agreed with the Fund.
Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, does not want to ask for
a waiver fearing this will reflect badly on Brazil, which has never
previously come anywhere near completing an IMF programme, according to an
Economy Ministry official.
Instead, Mr Moreira has apparently suggested to Mr Michel Camdessus,
managing director of the IMF, that the Dollars 250m payment due in May be
delayed to August, when a six-month review of the programme is due.
A collapse of the IMF standby programme would jeopardise the government's
economic reform plan and severely set back Brazil's negotiations with
creditor banks over a reduction in its foreign debt burden.
Mr Pedro Parente, planning secretary, said yesterday the economic programme
was going well. 'We have met the majority of targets but some have been
missed by a small margin.'
The problem lies on the fiscal side. As a result of falling tax revenues,
Brazil's economic team has been unable to bring the operating deficit under
control.
An operating deficit means government revenues have fallen short of
expenditures, including interest payments on its debt. Tax receipts fell by
14 per cent in real terms between January and March.
Under the terms of the accord signed in January, Brazil must produce a
primary surplus - which does not factor in interest payments  - of 3 per
cent of GDP by the end of this year.
'We already have a primary surplus but it's just not enough,' Mr Parente
said.
The economic team hopes that by delaying the second drawdown to August it
will gain time for an increase in tax revenues as a result of tax reforms
coming into effect this month.
The news is likely to increase instability in the Brazilian financial
markets. The central bank started intervening again in the gold and parallel
(black) dollar markets yesterday after a six-month absence.

FT  07 MAY 92 / White House reviews domestic policy in wake of riots
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration is working on a new domestic policy programme to
deal with problems exposed by last week's violence in Los Angeles and to
counter criticism of its lack of ideas or action.
President George Bush, who left for Los Angeles last night for a two-day
visit to tour the riot-torn areas of the city and discuss reconstruction
measures with local officials and community leaders, said he wanted new
ideas, not a continuation of existing welfare programmes that have not
worked.
'It is far more important to give people a piece of the action than it is to
have the federal government simply dump largesse on them,' he said.
The Republican administration has been put on the defensive by criticism of
its neglect of urban problems during 11 years in the White House.
Party strategists had been hoping the violence in Los Angeles would rebound
to their advantage by heightening concerns over law and order, a traditional
Republican strength.
But the haste with which the administration has struggled to define a new
urban policy agenda reflects a worry that voters might blame the incumbent
president for failing to tackle the underlying social problems.
The debate over how best to respond to the Los Angeles riots has now erupted
into a partisan argument over the social safety net programmes of the 1960s
and 1970s.
Mr Bush's Democratic opponents had at first reacted cautiously to the riots,
fearful of the dangers of appearing to politicise the issue. Goaded by the
White House's attack on President Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society'
programmes as the cause of today's urban problems, however, the Democrats
have punched back.
'When domestic problems become too visible to ignore, all this
administration does is look for somebody else to blame. First it was Jimmy
Carter, today it's Lyndon John-son. Who is next? Grover Cleveland, maybe?'
sneered Congressman David Bonior, Democratic whip in the House of
Representatives.
Mr Bush said yesterday that he did not want to 'play the blame game,' but
went on to reaffirm his criticism of Great Society programmes.
The administration has, however, shifted its position to emphasise that it
has increased spending on many of these programmes, such as Medicaid and
food stamps. 'Every single agency of the federal government is spending more
today than it was in 1980 and spending more than it was in 1988,' said Mr
Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development.
Mr Kemp has long been the principal, and sometimes only, advocate within the
Bush cabinet of a more active domestic policy agenda, based on the
'empowerment' of poor people by helping them accumulate capital to buy homes
and start businesses.
His ideas are now likely to receive more enthusiastic support from the White
House as it seeks to play up Mr Bush's response to domestic problems.
The programmes have their critics, but the more devastating charge against
the president is that he is once again following a pattern he has perfected
in his three years in office: create a paper trail by proposing legislation,
do nothing to push for its enactment, then blame the Democratic- controlled
Congress for not passing it.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Task force looks to the private sector: How restoration
plans for Los Angeles offer a national model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBUILD Los Angeles, the task force created by Mayor Tom Bradley to take
charge of efforts to restore the riot-ravaged sections of the city, has set
its sights on creating a model for urban renewal throughout the US.
To be headed by Mr Peter Ueberroth, whose ties to Los Angeles stem from his
role as chairman of the 1984 Olympics organising committee, the task force
aims to revitalise the economically depressed parts of the city that
suffered most of last week's destruction.
Private-sector investment will be the key focus of the group. State and
local government funding is limited. California is already facing a Dollars
9bn (Pounds 5bn) budget deficit that can only be worsened by the problems in
Los Angeles, while the city is in the red to the tune of more than Dollars
800m.
'We will be out soliciting and wrenching out commitments from the private
sector,' says Mr Barry Sanders, a prominent international business lawyer
and counsel to the 'extra-governmental' non-profit group and a member of
Rebuild LA.
The task force will seek support from a wide range of businesses with
established ties to Los Angeles, including foreign as well as US companies.
'We intend to reach out to the people who have investments in this
community, or who ought to have, and that will include the British and the
Japanese,' says Mr Sanders.
'There are Japanese car plants in southern California, for example. We want
those companies to consider locating their next plant in Los Angeles. We
will try to get tax breaks and low-interest loans for large and small
businesses. We want them to go into this with a profit motive but at the
same time train and employ people from this community.'
But that will take time. 'By next week there are going to be people asking
'why hasn't this group done anything yet',' Mr Sanders predicts.
Therefore, the initial thrust of the task force will be to have a visible
impact on the hardest hit areas; to move ahead with demolition and clean up.
Already there are tentative plans involving a landscaping industry group
that has offered to plant grass and trees and install irrigation on
demolition sites. Although such parks might be only temporary, at least they
would improve the outlook of burnt-out neighbourhoods and, as Mr Sanders
puts it, 'show that something is being done'.
Longer-term efforts to attract investment to the area may prove difficult.
'The riots have dealt a serious blow to Los Angeles' image,' says Mr Jack
Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation.
'Foreign investors are hesitant. They are reconsidering the risks' in light
of last week's events. Even US companies may 'sit back and assess whether
they want to pump money into an area already besieged by problems of riots
and earthquakes,' Mr Kyser adds.
The more immediate problem may be to stem the outflow of businesses leaving
the area, Mr Kyser suggests. In the past 18 months California lost half a
million jobs, according to a report issued last month by the Council on
California Competitiveness, chaired by Mr Ueberroth.
Others are more optimistic. 'Los Angeles is still a huge market that will
continue to attract investment,' argues Ms Mary Tuten, president of the Los
Angeles World Trade Centre.
'Some businesses will leave, but some will view this as a tremendous new
opportunity,' she predicts. 'In the long term you will see major
reconstruction.'
History would suggest otherwise. The Watts district of Los Angeles, the site
of race riots in the 1960s, has never recovered despite reconstruction
programmes.
'But they were driven by government spending and it did not work for
business reasons. This is going to be different, this community is going to
rebuild itself,' Ms Tuten maintains.
Rebuild LA, however, has also yet to win the trust of key segments of the
community. Black leaders, in particular, have voiced concerns that the task
force may not provide opportunities for their people.
'Whatever we do, it must be done with the full involvement of all segments
of the community,' Mr Sanders responds. 'This cannot be a bunch of downtown
businessmen imposing their ideas on the community,' he stresses.
People from all segments of the community will be invited to join the
governing board of the task force. 'They have been at sword point with one
another, but this is a chance for them to start over, to work together, if
anything good is to come out of all of this.'
Raising hopes are the commitments of Bank of America and smaller local banks
to offer preferential loan terms to people affected by the riot.
And other offers are 'flooding in' to Rebuild LA, says Mr Sanders. 'We have
to capture this rush of enthusiasm and hope.'

AN ACCORD is due to be signed next week to repatriate tens of thousands of
Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong, the UK Foreign Office said last
night, PA reports.
'We are on the verge of signing an agreement to return to Vietnam all
Vietnamese who arrived in Hong Kong before October 29, 1991, who, after
careful screening, are judged not to be refugees,' an FO spokesman said. The
accord covers over 20,432 people, and the operation could take three years.
An agreement already exists between Britain, Vietnam and Hong Kong for
repatriation of boat people - not deemed political refugees - who have
arrived since October 29.
The Hong Kong government yesterday disclosed that its budget surplus for
last year was HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 437m) higher than its provisional
figure, revealed in March, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong.
This brings the budget surplus for 1991-1992 to over Dollars HK20bn.
Financial secretary Hamish MacLeod's statement on the windfall surplus was
accompanied by a concession on his budget: property rates would not rise
half a point to 6 per cent, as announced in the budget speech. The revenue
fall was 'roughly equivalent' to the windfall surplus.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Riots force Lebanese premier to quit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR OMAR Karami, Lebanon's prime minister, and his 30-member cabinet resigned
yesterday after anti-government riots spread throughout the country.
The departure of the pro-Syrian premier after two days' civil unrest may
diminish Syria's influence in Lebanon and presage a more independent line
for his successor. It is the first time a Lebanese government has been
toppled by civil unrest since the country's civil war began in 1975.
Thousands of rioters took to the streets of Beirut and other Lebanese cities
early yesterday, brandishing sticks, shovels and pistols. Main roads were
blocked by heaps of blazing tyres. They smashed windows of government
offices, banks and shops and set up barricades of burning tyres. Two
teenagers were wounded when looters broke into Beirut's Arab Bank.
Rioting broke out on Tuesday after radio reports that the Lebanese pound had
collapsed to about LPounds 2,000 to the US dollar on the black market. But
violence subsided after Mr Karami's resignation was announced. 'I have
resigned to save the country,' the 57-year-old lawyer said after meeting
President Elias Hrawi.
The unrest has been sparked by Lebanon's economic crisis. For the first
time, Lebanese of all faiths, trade unionists, industrialists, bankers and
business people united in denunciation of the government and support for a
four-day general strike aimed at ending its mandate. The country's main
trade union is scheduled to reassess the strike today.
Because the Karami half-Christian, half-Moslem cabinet was installed under
Syrian supervision in December 1990, Lebanese rejection of the government
constitutes a growing resentment of Syria's hold over the country. The
Treaty of Brotherhood, Co-operation and Co-ordination signed with Syria last
May required Lebanon to link its economic, foreign and security policies
with those of Damascus, which keeps 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
The Syrian presence made the disarming of Lebanese militias possible, but in
recent months the Syrian embrace has choked public confidence and potential
foreign investors. Lebanese leaders have made no important decisions without
travelling to Damascus for 'consultations'. Mr Karami had sought Syrian
approval in a trip to the Syrian capital on Tuesday before he resigned.
Mr Karami, a Sunni Moslem, feuded openly with President Hrawi, a Maronite
Catholic. When Mr Hrawi pleaded with Syrian officials for permission to
replace Mr Karami in March, the Syrians refused, saying the Karami
government would have to oversee parliamentary elections soon.
A new cabinet is unlikely to be announced immediately. Officials in Beirut
suggested the decision may take a few days. Most popular candidates to
replace Mr Karami are Dr Selim El Hoss, the former prime minister, and Mr
Rafiq Hariri, the Lebanese-born Saudi millionaire.
Mr Hariri, a friend of the Saudi royal family, would appear well placed to
obtain Saudi economic aid for Lebanon. Both men have in recent days met
Syrian leaders in Damascus. Both are believed to have demanded greater
independence from Syria as a condition for becoming premier.
Syria's strategy regarding the crisis in Lebanon remains unclear. Many
rioters in southern Lebanon and Beirut were members of the Syrian-backed
Amal militia, and Syrian troops made no attempt to intervene during the
disturbances. Damascus could seek to impose an even closer ally as prime
minister, perhaps Gen Sami Khatib, interior minister, who was among those
who resigned yesterday.

</HEADLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 80,000 Thais surrounded parliament last night demanding that the
general who engineered a coup last year resign from his new position of
prime minister, police said.
As room for compromise between Gen Suchinda and his critics appeared to
dwindle, a group of academics appealed to the king to defuse the crisis by
dissolving parliament and calling another general election.
The Thai monarch would have the power to do that although he normally keeps
strictly above politics. Some observers say his intervention might be the
only way to break the deadlock.
Maj-Gen Chamlong Srimuang, former Bangkok governor and leader of one of the
opposition parties, continued the hunger strike he began on Monday. His
threat to die if Gen Suchinda does not resign has brought a number of
normally passive supporters out on to the street in front of parliament
where he is encamped, communicating only in writing.
He has predicted he will last only seven days, adding urgency to the crisis
which has caused panic on the stock market, whose share price index shed
43.36 points yesterday to close at 717.62. So far, the protests have been
peaceful, but observers fear there is a real danger of unrest if Gen
Suchinda remains prime minister, as is his constitutional right, and Maj-Gen
Chamlong dies.
Maj-Gen Chamlong, whose party took 32 of the 35 seats in Bangkok in the
March 22 general election, has gained popularity as a modest-living
politician. For either to back down would mean a serious loss of face and
reputation.
Opposition MPs boycotted the start of yesterday's debate when the prime
minister presented his first policy statement to parliament.
After that, they launched a barrage of criticism, questioning his ability to
fulfil promises to maintain democratic government. They accused him of
destroying democracy by engineering last year's coup d'etat and putting
himself and his military friends in key positions.
Members of the five-party coalition defended their constitutional right to
pick an outsider to be prime minister. Opposition MPs also addressed the
rally outside parliament where the more emotive speeches concentrated on Gen
Suchinda's earlier promise not to accept the premiership after this year's
election.
One MP said the planned 12-hour debate on the policy statement would be a
waste of time because Gen Suchinda's word was 'worthless'.
MPs, who were expecting to continue until midnight, were caught by surprise
when Gen Suchinda left parliament shortly before 6pm and the debate ended
abruptly without any explanation.
Some opposition MPs said the prime minister feared for his safety because of
the large numbers outside parliament.
The debate is scheduled to to continue today.

THE Asian Development Bank closed its annual meeting yesterday with renewed
calls to step up the war against poverty and environmental degradation in
Asia's fast-growing economies, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
But some delegates privately attacked the bank for what they see as its
flabby response to the region's growing social needs and inability to trim
its bureaucracy. The task of meeting growing social and infrastructure needs
at a time of shrinking funds from rich member-nations such as the US was a
main theme at the ADB's three-day meeting of Asian finance ministers and
international bankers.
ADB president Kimimasa Tarumizu urged more efficient use of resources to
tackle the bank's priorities for the 1990s. 'Global changes have created new
demands on the flow of resources; the need to augment these flows becomes
more important,' he said. The US delegation has vowed to oppose an early
increase in the bank's capital until it sees more evidence to back the
request. Last year, the bank proposed its capital base of Dollars 23bn
(Pounds 12.9bn) be doubled by 1994.

IRAN has awarded a consortium led by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the
Zurich-based engineering group, a Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 700m) contract to
build a 2,000MW hydroelectric plant on the Karun River.
ABB said its German subsidiary, ABB Mannheim, would supply eight generators
and all the electrical equipment for the project, giving it a Dollars 340m
share of the Karun-3 contract overall. The hydroelectric plant, in
south-west Iran, will be one of the world's largest and follows ABB's
energetic pursuit of work in the Gulf.
Gebruder Sulzer of Switzerland will supply turbines, valves and other
equipment worth Dollars 230m, while Austria's Voest Alpine will provide
hydromechanical equipment worth Dollars 145m. Brazil's Andrade Gutierrez
will undertake work worth Dollars 530m on constructing the dam and other
civil engineering.
Financing for the project, which is due to have the first 500MW on stream
before 1997, is still being negotiated, ABB said. The project is one of
several power plants planned by the Iranian government on both the Karun and
Arras Rivers, including a further, Karun-4, hydroelectric plant.

ALL depositors in EC banks should have a minimum Ecu15,000 (Pounds 10,500)
of their deposits guaranteed, the European Commission proposed yesterday.
The EC executive began work on the draft directive before the failure of the
Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI) last year, but accelerated
its initiative after the scandal surrounding the bank's collapse.
The Commission suggests that bank customers should obtain their deposit
guarantee reimbursement within three months, in contrast to the much longer
period that many depositors with the Luxembourg-incorporated BCCI had to
wait. Responsibility for deposit insurance would switch from the host to the
home country of a bank. Mr Pierre Jaans, head of the Luxembourg Monetary
Institute, said this would not pose a problem for the duchy. Very few
Luxembourg-based banks, with the notable exception of BCCI, had branches
abroad.
Commission officials hope that EC governments will reach basic agreement on
the guarantee scheme under the UK presidency of the EC later this year. The
plan would require Greece and Portugal to institute deposit guarrantees for
the first time.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, will seek the British government's
support in speeding up his country's application to join the European
Community during a meeting with Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
today. The meeting comes amid doubts over the feasibility of Sweden's
self-imposed timetable for entry.
Mr Bildt would like the British EC presidency, which starts its six-month
term on July 1, to give EC enlargement top priority. He insists formal
negotiations must start with Brussels early next year and be concluded by
the end of 1993. This would ensure time for a national referendum on
Sweden's entry to be held during the first half of 1994. Such speed is
dictated by the Swedish constitution.
Any change in the country's fundamental laws requires two identical
approvals by the Swedish parliament, with the first given not less than nine
months before a general election and the second after an election. Sweden
will elect its next parliament on 20 September 1994, which means any EC
entry agreement must be submitted by 18 December next year, or be delayed
until 1 January 1998. It would need a majority of parliament's
constitutional committee to waive this provision. Another concern for Mr
Bildt is the sign of growing opposition within Sweden to EC entry.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Bold action to transform Russia's 'wooden' rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIPLOMATS and businessmen in Moscow laugh about it. Russian enterprises are
worried by it. The Russian people are bewildered. But the government is
deadly serious about it.
The announcement on Tuesday that the Russian government would make the
rouble internally convertible this summer was a bold political statement
following the west's decision to provide a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn)
stabilisation fund for the project.
Politically, it served notice to the battered Russian people that the
government would deliver its promise to transform the much-maligned 'wooden'
rouble into a real currency. It told the world Moscow was on track with its
bold plans to integrate Russia into the world economy. It warned the other
republics that they would have to play by tough budgetary, financial and
credit policy rules dictated by Moscow in order to continue using the
rouble.
The plan involves floating the rouble rate from July 1 and then defending it
up to 7.5 per cent either side of the fixed rate from August 1. Russian
officials admitted yesterday that many of the details had yet to be decided.
But the general idea, as explained Mr Andrei Vavilov, the first deputy
finance minister, is that if central bank intervention to defend the rouble
becomes excessive, the government responds by either raising interest rates
(to encourage people to convert dollars into roubles to earn interest) or by
devaluing.
Foreign diplomats and businessmen doubt whether the rate of Rbs80 a dollar
at which the goverment hoped to start defending the rouble was realistic
given the enormous demand for hard currency in Russia. But Mr Alexander
Potemkin, head of the Russian central bank's international department,
suggested that the rate might be as strong as Rbs50-Rbs60 with the moves
towards convertibility. He pointed to three factors: if exporters were
encouraged to sell hard currency earnings at a free market rate there would
be more supply than at present. Secondly, if the government's macro-economic
reforms stayed on track, the state-owned enterprises would have to become
more efficient. Thirdly, he said, the exchange rate would continue to
benefit from a physical shortage of roubles in the economy - yesterday the
rouble strengthened to Rbs128 per dollar from Rbs143.6 last week.
The reform will seek to create a single exchange rate, abolishing all other
rates such as the punitive 'commercial' rate at which exporters are obliged
to sell 40 per cent of their earnings to the state. This means doing away
with favourable exchange rates for certain types of state-owned enterprises
to purchase vital imports such as spare parts.
Competition from imports is unlikely, since imports would probably remain
too expensive for most Russian consumers for some time. But for foreign
companies contracting to sell goods to solvent buyers in Russia, the system
would be little changed. The Russian buyer converts roubles into currency
and sends it to the seller's bank account.
Another argument in favour of proceeding with convertibility is to encourage
badly-needed foreign investment - investors will be less afraid of making
mountains of roubles they cannot spend or convert to hard currency.
It remains to be seen if the supply of currency can be vastly increased.
Estimated annual export earnings are Dollars 25-Dollars 30bn, but only 2 per
cent of that is sold voluntarily by enterprises to the state, with many
avoiding the 40 per cent tax by keeping earnings in foreign bank accounts.
The government plans to open exchange points around the country to encourage
the ordinary citizen to part with dollars. It is unlikely that this will
attract currency in itself. But what may have more of a role will be a
proposed clampdown on the use of the dollar to buy and sell goods within
Russia - if it can be enforced.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Tajikistan opposition militia seizes control of capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE communist government of Tajikistan was in disarray yesterday after
opposition militia groups seized most of the capital, Dushanbe.
But there were signs of a possible compromise last night, with attempts to
put together a coalition between the opposition and moderate members of the
government.
Opposition forces said up to 60 people had been killed in clashes in the
republic since Monday.
The government appeared to have lost control of all key structures of power
in the capital, apart from the parliament buildings.
Mr Rakhmon Nabiyev, the Tajik president, appeared to have vanished and a
split was said to have emerged in government ranks between hardliners  -
including Vice-President Nazrullo Dustov and parliamentary speaker Safarli
Kenjayev - and moderate factions.
The opposition, a loose alliance of Islamic and democratic parties, set up
roadblocks, guarded by nervous and shabbily dressed opposition militia
carrying Kalashnikovs.
The presidential palace was under opposition control, and the television
station, captured earlier in the week, broadcast pro-opposition statements.
Gun battles broke out in the tree-lined parks around the city's radio
station, as the opposition sought to take away the government's last channel
of mass communications.
Many Interior Ministry troops appeared to have joined the opposition militia
group.
In an attempt to stop the bloodshed, leaders from opposition parties
re-opened negotiations with some of the more moderate government figures,
with the aim of forming an interim coalition.
But with armed militia groups still roaming the city, finding a compromise
appeared extremely difficult. Although the government's hand seemed weak,
many key government figures remained bitterly opposed to the political
reforms the opposition has been demanding, and seemed far from ready to give
in peacefully.
The conflict is exacerbated by bitter regional splits in the republic. Most
government supporters come from the Kulyab and Khodjent regions in the north
and south-east, while most Islamic party supporters come from the east and
south.
Another problem lies with the fragile nature of the opposition coalition of
Islamic and democratic parties.
For a month, the opposition had been peacefully demonstrating against the
government before being provoked into a more radical stance by the arrival
of thousands of government supporters bussed into the capital 10 days ago.
Its official aim is establishment of a multi-party democracy. But with the
Islamic party clearly the stronger partner, many fear the democratic leaders
could soon be swept away by more radical Moslems.
The square where thousands have been demonstrating for the last month is
decorated with Islamic placards and slogans. Many of these have been copied
from Iran. White-veiled women and determined young men declare themselves
ready to die as martyrs for Islam.
Opposition leaders continue to insist that these fiery sentiments will not
be necessary. But with most of their supporters insisting that they will not
go home until the communist government is completely overthrown, the
opposition leaders will find it difficult to persuade them to accept any
compromise.

MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, said yesterday that both
east and west deserved blame for the Cold War and that the Soviet Union
never intended to attack the west, Agencies report.
He told a crowd of thousands in Fulton, Missouri, that the US mistakenly fed
hostilities by believing in 'the probability of open' Soviet aggression.
'This could never happen, not only because Stalin ..was afraid of war and
did not want war ..but primarily because our country was exhausted and

FT  07 MAY 92 / Kravchuk reassures US over N-weapons treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine assured the US yesterday that his newly
independent republic would implement the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(Start) reducing long-range nuclear weapons.
Speaking after talks with President George Bush at the White House, Mr
Kravchuk denied reports in Moscow that all Ukraine's tactical - or
short-range - nuclear weapons had been removed to Russia to be destroyed.
But he promised they would be moved by the agreed July deadline.
Mr Kravchuk said the US and Ukraine had worked out a protocol by which
Ukraine, which inherited some of the Soviet Union's long-range missiles,
would endorse Start.
The US wants the former Soviet republics with nuclear weapons - Ukraine,
Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan - to commit themselves to the treaty, signed
by Washington and Moscow last year but not yet ratified by either side.
The confusion over the withdrawal of tactical missiles follows months of
shadow boxing between Moscow and Kiev over this and other military issues
dividing the two most powerful members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
Earlier this year Ukraine held up the transfer of tactical nuclear missiles,
arguing that once in Russia it was not clear they would be dismantled. This
objection was overcome by an agreement to do it under international
supervision.
The two republics have also been arguing over dividing the Black Sea naval
fleet and control of the Crimean peninsula.
The transfer of all tactical weapons would be widely welcomed in the west as
a step towards ensuring a stable outcome for part of the vast nuclear
arsenal inherited from the Soviet Union.
The Crimean parliament yesterday took a big step back from a declaration of
independence approved a day earlier and proclaimed the peninsula to be part
of Ukraine.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Heseltine acts to cut gap in car prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to open talks with car manufacturers to remove
restrictions on dealerships which have been blamed for keeping British car
prices higher than those in other European countries.
A two-year European Commission study of the EC car market has confirmed that
many models were 30 per cent more expensive in the UK than on the continent.
A so-called 'block exemption' allows carmakers to determine which
dealerships can sell their brand of cars and where they can be sold. They
generally prevent dealers from selling more than one brand of car and do not
allow them to import cars themselves.
'I am seeking a better deal for consumers through the removal of some
restrictions placed on dealers by car suppliers,' said Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, yesterday. He welcomed moves announced
yesterday by the European Commission to ensure car companies do not abuse
their selective dealership system.
Mr Heseltine said the government would now push ahead with the
recommendations of the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on
new car sales in the UK. This called for the removal of some restrictions
placed by some carmakers on their franchised dealers, which the MMC claimed
operated against the public interest.
As part of the push for fairer pricing, manufacturers are being encouraged
by Brussels to publish price lists to help consumers shop around the EC for
models with the same specifications.
'We want to ensure people's right to buy the car they want at an undistorted
price,' said Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner. He claimed his
campaign for cross-border selling in the EC car market would lead to 'a
substantial downward pressure on prices and to a more equal distribution of
prices'.
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, claimed the EC report showed no evidence that selective
distribution was responsible for price variations.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Major cuts at secrecy by naming MI6 chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday foreshadowed a significant shift towards more open
government with a pledge to provide a legal framework for Britain's Secret
Intelligence Service.
His public acknowledgement of the existence of the SIS, the first by any
prime minister since the forerunner of the country's spy establishment was
set up in 1909, came as he presented his legislative programme in the
Queen's Speech.
The programme includes bills to pave the way for the privatisation of
British Coal and parts of British Rail, as well as to implement the
Maastricht treaties on European union. A finance bill, due within the next
10 days, will reintroduce those measures in Mr Norman Lamont's Budget which
were dropped because of the general election.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Major said one of his most immediate
aims was 'to sweep away some of the cobwebs of secrecy which needlessly veil
too much of government business'.
He confirmed that among the first steps would be publication of the details
of the cabinet committees which make most important government decisions and
of the guidance issued to ministers on their personal financial interests.
Mr William Waldegrave, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, had been asked
to review other areas where 'excessive secrecy' might be removed.
The prime minister then told MPs that it was time to acknowledge officially
the existence of the SIS, commonly known as MI6. It was responsible for
foreign intelligence designed to support the government's foreign, defence,
security and economic policies.
He confirmed that the service works directly to the foreign secretary and
the prime minister, and that its current chief is Sir Colin McColl. Sir
Colin is listed in reference books as a senior official at the Foreign
Office.
MI5, the domestic counterpart of the SIS, was given a legal basis in 1989.
This year, Mr Major broke with tradition by making public the appointment of
Mrs Stella Rimmington as its director. Between them the two services have a
budget of Pounds 185m for the current financial year.
Mr Major insisted that the government would continue to refuse to comment on
the activities of the two services because of the risk that would bring to
their effectiveness and staff.
Senior Whitehall officials said this meant that the legislation to place the
SIS on a statutory basis was unlikely to subject it to direct scrutiny by
MPs. Instead the legislation is expected to be modelled on that introduced
for MI5, which provided for limited rights of redress by the public.
Mr Major's first legislative programme as an elected prime minister included
a range of bills designed to enhance individual choice and ownership, and to
improve the responsiveness to public sector services.
Among the most significant measures in a parliamentary session which will
last until the autumn of 1993 are bills to push ahead with the government's
education reforms, to tighten the law on asylum and to set up an urban
regeneration agency.

FT  07 MAY 92 / OFT blow for Lloyds' plan to buy Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading plans to recommend that the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission examine Lloyds Bank's proposal to buy Midland.
It does not, however, believe the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
bid for Midland raises competition issues worthy of extended investigation.
The disclosure of the OFT's view by a senior government official will come
as a blow to Lloyds. It has been hoping that both its plan and Hongkong
Bank's bid would be examined by the MMC. Lloyds has said it would only
convert its takeover plan into a fully fledged bid if the MMC looked at the
takeover approaches of both banks.
The official stressed that the OFT had not made a final decision. By the end
of the week it should have submissions from all three banks on the
competitive issues raised by the takeover proposals. It will review these
documents next week and make a recommendation to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary.
However, OFT officials have had meetings with executives of all three banks
and they have already assessed the effect on banking markets of both
takeover proposals. The OFT believes that the Lloyds' approach may have a
detrimental effect on competition in small business loans.
The OFT decision on Lloyds and Hongkong Bank will be the last one taken by
the director-general, Sir Gordon Borrie, who retires in June. Mr Heseltine
has not instructed Sir Gordon to review the takeover by any other criteria
than those he has been using for the past eight years which give the highest
priority to competitive issues.
In the Hongkong Bank case, the OFT believes it will not have the leading
role in making a recommendation on whether there is a threat to competition.
It has been told by DG4, the European Community's competition authority,
that jurisdiction over the Hongkong Bank takeover offer is likely to rest
with DG4. A decision is expected in the coming week.
The government official said the question of which body has jurisdiction on
the competition question may be less important than Lloyds believes. If the
OFT were to have jurisdiction, the official said, it would not recommend
that the Hongkong Bank bid was scrutinised by the MMC.
Mr Heseltine does not have to follow the recommendation of the OFT. But in
the past 16 years, Mr Heseltine's predecessors have done the opposite of
what the OFT has recommended on only 14 occasions. On just two occasions
have they ordered an MMC inquiry when the OFT recommended against one.
Mr Heseltine could ask the MMC to investigate whether a Hongkong Bank
takeover of Midland would be against the public interest for reasons other
than competitive ones. But this would not be easy for him.
If the EC decides it has jurisdiction on the competitive aspect of the
Hongkong Bank bid, Mr Heseltine could ask for a separate UK review of
whether the takeover was a threat to Midland's depositors.
However, he would have difficulty making such a request, because the Bank of
England has already said it does not believe Hongkong Bank's bid would put
Midland's depositors at risk.
Mr Heseltine could also argue, under Article 9, that the Hongkong Bank bid
raises general issues of national concern and should therefore be reviewed
in the UK. However, the European Commission has to date been reluctant to
comply with requests for national reviews of takeovers under Article 9.
Lloyds is putting pressure on Mr Heseltine not to deprive Midland
shareholders of its takeover proposal by making a reference.
However, the government official hinted this argument was unlikely to
influence the government. Lloyds' condition that the bid will only be made
if there is no MMC reference is self-imposed, he pointed out, and can
therefore be dropped.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK shares reach record high as hopes of recovery rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES in London closed at record levels last night on the back of
optimism about recovery prospects and signs that sterling was holding on to
its recent gains.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares gained 36.5 at 2,698.7 as investors
took heart from Tuesday's half-point cut in interest rates to 10 per cent.
The reduction in borrowing costs is expected to lead to a gradual uplift in
the retail and housing markets - developments seen as helping a sustained
revival from the recession that started around mid-1990.
Sterling was unchanged in London against a stronger D-Mark, closing at
DM2.925. That underlined the perception of many investors that, in spite of
the cut in UK rates, sterling is unlikely to encounter serious strain within
the European exchange rate mechanism over the next few weeks. The currency
was close to its London levels in late New York trading.
The possibility, viewed as remote by many economists, that the Bundesbank
council might decide to increase German rates at its regular meeting today
led to some switching of funds into the D-Mark. This caused the dollar to
drop 1 pfennig to DM1.6305 in London. It closed at DM1.6287 in New York.
But the buying pressure buoying the D-Mark was not enough to disturb
sterling's position within 3 pfennigs of its DM2.95 central ERM rate.
Against the dollar, the pound gained more than 1 cent in London to Dollars
1.7945. It closed at Dollars 1.7975 in New York.
The rise in share prices pushed the FT-SE index above its last closing high
of 2,683.7, reached eight months ago. The rise contrasted to Tuesday's tepid
stock market reaction to the UK's first base rate cut since September.
Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of economics research at stockbroker Charterhouse
Tilney, said investors had needed time to tell whether the rate cut would
damage sterling. 'If you are confident an upturn is really going to happen,
the stock market looks 10 per cent undervalued.'

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (15): The nuts and bolts - Engineering
is still the motor of the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE still tend to think of Switzerland as a country of solid banks,
delightful tourist retreats and quaint watchmakers.
In fact, the country's outsize engineering industry is the motor of the
Swiss economy. With 3,000 companies and a labour force of 370,000, it dwarfs
the banking sector, and its exports of SFr39.3bn last year were worth six
times those of the watchmakers.
By the late 1980s, the Swiss engineering industry had become so large that
it was having difficulty keeping up with its customers' demands. In
particular, it was suffering from skilled labour shortages, and chafing at
Switzerland's tough restrictions on immigrant workers.
In the past year, however, the industry's concerns have changed dramatically
as, like its counterparts elsewhere in the world, it has been hit by the
downturn in capital spending in many of its important markets.
While Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), by far the biggest group in the sector,
managed to eke out a 2 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits last year,
few others did as well.
Von Roll, the steel and machinery group, and Rieter, the textile machinery
group, slumped into loss, while others, such as Sulzer Brothers, the pumps
and textile machinery group, George Fischer, the machine tool builder, and
Schindler, the lifts and rolling stock maker, reported sharp declines in
their profits.
At the annual press conference in February of the Swiss Association of
Machinery Manufacturers (VSM), concern about labour and skill shortages gave
way to shock at the soaring jobless rate. By the end of 1991, the number of
full-time unemployed in the sector had nearly tripled to 5,700 compared to
the end of 1990, and short-time working, which was virtually non-existent in
the late 1980s, was affecting 21,000.
Hardly a week goes by without announcements of closures and redundancies.
Perhaps the most significant last month was the closure by Sulzer Brothers
of its large-piece grey iron foundry at Oberwinterthur. This was the last
remaining large-scale iron foundry in the country, and even though its
demise will eliminate only 520 jobs, it was a chilling indicator of how
tough things have become in some industry sectors.
Sulzer pointed out that the foundry's main clients were the machine tool and
textile machinery industries and their combined orders tumbled from 10.7m
tonnes in 1989 to only 5.3m tonnes last year.
Surprisingly, output and order statistics do not yet fully reflect the agony
that is being felt in many engineering sectors. Last year, new orders of 200
leading companies surveyed by the VSM were down only 1.4 per cent and their
combined sales advanced a healthy 11.3 per cent to SFr26.1bn. Total industry
exports were up 0.3 per cent.
However, other figures are more revealing. The combined backlog of 260
companies in a VSM study dropped from 6.1 months in the fourth quarter of
1990 to 5.3 months in the fourth quarter of last year, the lowest level in
10 years. Capacity utilisation also fell from a record 91.5 per cent in 1990
to a seven-year low of 85 per cent last year.
The hardest hit was textile machinery, which is the second largest sector in
the industry after machine tools. Textile machine sales were down nearly 18
per cent, as clothing and home furnishings makers turned cautious.
The machine tool industry's sales tumbled 11 per cent to SFr3.6bn, hurt by
the virtual drying up of eastern European markets. Sales of electrical and
precision equipment eased 2 per cent, but electronic industries' revenues
were up, thanks in part to major modernisation programmes of the Swiss
telecoms establishment.
As for the outlook, there is little optimism for the near term. Mr Martin
Erb, executive director of the VSM, noted in February that the slight upturn
in orders in the fourth quarter of last year was due to a single large order
received by ABB to build a power station in Indonesia.
In the first quarter of this year, exports were up a surprisingly healthy 7
per cent by value, but VSM officials cautioned against reading this as an
indication that there will be much improvement in the year as a whole.
For one thing, the export figure is flattered by the sharp decline in the
value of the Swiss franc in the past year. For another, the important
machine tool sector is still sagging, with exports down 21 per cent.
Another negative factor is that domestic demand is likely to be softer this
year than last because of budget constraints at all levels of government.
'It is still difficult to tell if we will even achieve the same level of
sales this year as last year,' a VSM official says gloomily.
This sharp change in the industry's health has heightened its anxiety about
Switzerland's position in Europe and the world. Nearly two-thirds of all its
exports go to EC countries and over 70 per cent go to the 18 west European
countries.
The VSM has long officially supported the idea of Switzerland joining the
European Community and major international organisations, and this year
added its formal endorsement for the proposal to join the European Economic
Area.
Mr Erb said that the engineering industry, with its record exports to the
EC, 'provided further proof of the absolute necessity of free access to the
largest internal market in the world'.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (14): Wine goes upmarket - The
country's last cottage industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE mid-1980s Swiss winemakers awoke from a slumber worthy of Rip van
Winkle to find the world utterly changed. Shifting consumer tastes and a
domestic wine glut are forcing the country's last remaining cottage industry
to become more efficient, professional and outward-looking.
As a consequence, thousands of small vineyard owners are expected to bow out
over the next few years.
Traditionally, Switzerland has produced eminently quaffable but unremarkable
wines with little staying power. About 60 per cent of its production, 140m
litres last year, is white wine, mostly from the Chasselas grape. The
dominant red grapes are Pinot Noir, Gamay and Merlot.
Cushioned by high government subsidies and tight restrictions on competing
imports, especially for white wine, Swiss growers had little need to worry
about quality in what was essentially a captive market. For white wine,
domestic production meets nine-tenths of consumption, against about
one-third for red wine. Winemakers had little interest in exporting abroad
and no incentive to do so.
Things changed abruptly 10 years ago when a string of bumper harvests from
1982 created Switzerland's very own wine lake, one big Valais winery went to
the wall, and the federal government was forced to implement a costly
surplus disposal programme.
In 1986, the mountain canton of Valais, Switzerland's main wine-producing
area, became the first to impose stringent measures to rein back production
and boost wine quality by restricting the quantity of grapes left to grow on
the vines. Switzerland's first 'Appellation d'Origine Controlee' (AOC), wine
conforming to strict quality standards, was introduced in 1987, also in the
Valais.
The Swiss parliament is currently discussing a draft federal decree that
will restrain production and improve wine quality nationwide. At the
beginning of this year the government scrapped import quotas for bulk
deliveries of red wine, and it plans further liberalisation of wine imports
in the light of the international trade talks under way in Geneva. Earlier
government proposals to regulate wine production were thrown out by voters
two years ago on the grounds that they did not go far enough to eliminate
barriers to imports.
The draft decree also classifies wines into three quality groups (with
'appellation d'origine', 'indication de provenance' and 'vins ordinaires').
This, too, is a big break with the past. In the Valais, for instance, most
small growers sold their grapes to big wine distributors to be bottled
simply under the generic names of Fendant (Chasselas), Johannisberg
(Sylvaner) or Dole (Pinot Noir and Gamay).
The effects on the structure of the Swiss wine industry will be
far-reaching. Mr Francois Cordonnier, president of the Valais Federation of
wine growers, thinks the number of vineyard keepers in the canton could
shrink from 22,000 to just 4,000 over the next decade. One in five working
adults has a vineyard, often no bigger than a tennis court, and 90 per cent
of holdings are worked part-time.
Equally revolutionary, the Swiss are turning their minds to markets abroad,
and not just for offloading the odd surplus. Switzerland now exports under
2m bottles of wine a year, a tiny 1 per cent of production which the
Association of Swiss Wine Exporters in Lausanne would like to see boosted to
5 or even 10 per cent in the longer term.
The problem with exporting more, as Swiss growers concede, is that
Switzerland has few distinctive wines, and even fewer distinguished ones, to
entice sophisticated overseas palates. Yet with production costs in
Switzerland two to four times those elsewhere in Europe, Swiss winemakers
have little choice but to follow their compatriots in watchmaking, machine
tools and other export industries in moving resolutely upmarket.
The industry is split on how best to do this. Some growers in
French-speaking Switzerland, which produces 80 per cent of the country's
wine, propose abandoning the ubiquitous Chasselas grape in favour of more
reliable varieties such as Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc. Others say the
Chasselas gives Swiss wine its distinctiveness and advocate research to
improve the grape's wine-making qualities.
Mr Christophe Von Ritter, secretary-general of the wine exporters'
association, thinks prospects are good for wines made from some of
Switzerland's unique indigenous grape varieties, which could sell not only
on quality but also on curiosity value. But, despite the association's best
endeavours, exporting is likely to remain a marginal pastime for growers
while subsidies and protection continue to provide easier rewards in the
domestic market.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (13): The prospect of a Swatch car -
After the rescue of the watchmaking industry, there are more ambitious plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON APRIL 1, the French language daily, Le Nouveau Quotidien, published an
interview with Mr Nicolas Hayek, boss of SMH, the watchmaking company best
known for the Swatch plastic watch. Referring to the current political row
over the Swiss government's intended purchase of 34 US fighter planes, Mr
Hayek said Switzerland should develop its own aeroplanes. Aircraft design
needed rethinking to produce a high-performance, low cost, environmentally
friendly machine.
Of course, the 'Swatch fighter' was a spoof. But Mr Hayek's real-life
project to build a Swatch car has met much the same kind of amused
disbelief. In proving the scoffers wrong, he hopes to demonstrate a personal
conviction that Europe, even high-cost Switzerland, need not surrender its
manufacturing base to the Far East.
This conviction underpinned Mr Hayek's rescue plan for the Swiss watchmaking
industry in the early 1980s when it was in danger of obliteration by
Japanese competition.
An engineering consultant who had already built up a successful business,
Hayek Engineering, Mr Hayek was brought in by the banks to guide the
troubled merger of SSIH and Asuag, the two biggest watchmakers, to form SMH
(Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie) in 1984.
Rejecting the conventional wisdom that Switzerland should retreat to the
luxury end of the watch market, he argued that a thriving industry needed
the mass market to provide the impulsion for cost control, technological
development and marketing. The Swatch, which first appeared in 1982, was to
spearhead recapture of this market from the Japanese.
Greeted sceptically at the time, the Swatch has become a classic success
story. Last month, the 100 millionth Swatch came off the production line -
making it the biggest selling watch in history. Early Swatches are
collectors' items, fetching thousands of dollars at auction and contemporary
Swatch variants like the chronograph are the object of a flourishing black
market trade.
Stylish, constantly changing designs, a careful distribution policy and
clever marketing have kept the Swatch boom going. But at its heart rests the
original Swatch innovation - a big cut in the number of watch parts and a
way of assembling them in one operation, allowing fully automated production
for the first time. Today, the basic Swatch still sells for its original
price of SFr50.
Sales of Swatches, which are all produced in Switzerland, topped 17m in
1991. SMH plans output of 25-30m this year, doubling to 50m within five
years, including variants such as the Pop Swatch, chronograph and the Scuba
diving watch. A Swatch automatic, with a self-winding mechanism, will be
launched later in 1992.
Swatch accounts for something over half SMH's finished watch output of 30m
last year and about a quarter of its SFr2.37bn sales. But production and
marketing skills honed on the Swatch have helped to revitalise SMH's
higher-priced watch brands, such as Omega, Longines, Rado and Tissot.
SMH is now a world leader in luxury watches, which are estimated to
contribute over half its profits, though analysts think it may be losing
money in the highly competitive medium-priced market.
The company has also pursued an ambitious strategy of vertical integration,
manufacturing its own components including state-of-the-art microchips and
batteries. These, and some 50m watch movements produced by SMH last year,
are sold for assembly by other manufacturers in Switzerland and elsewhere.
Within a decade, SMH has become the world's most profitable watch company,
according to James Capel, the London stockbrokers, and sales by value are
poised to overtake Seiko of Japan within five years. Profits have risen
steadily, jumping by a third last year to SFr252m, and in 1992 the company
is expected to have cash in hand after repayment of debt.
Taking watches and movements together, SMH accounts for some three-quarters
of total Swiss production (about 13 per cent of the world total) and about a
third of Swiss sales. The rest is accounted for by mainly top-of-the-range
watchmakers such as Rolex and Patek Philippe, whose dominance in the luxury
market gives Switzerland over half the total world watch sales by value.
Mr Hayek, who with a group of investors, bought out the banks' controlling
shareholding in 1985, says SMH is and will remain primarily a watch company.
But he believes other, more dynamic markets are ripe for the Swatch formula
of technological innovation combined with skilful design at a competitive
price, that can capitalise on the company's experience with micro-electronic
and micro-mechanical devices. About 5 per cent of SMH's sales are currently
outside the watch sector, mostly accounted for by the Swatch twinphone (a
dual handset model) in the US and Europe.
However, initial problems with telephone type approval, marketing and
distribution have now persuaded SMH to opt for tie-ups with established
telecommunications companies. Mr Hayek plans to announce in June a deal with
a major telecommunications manufacturer to produce the twinphone and the
cordless, cellular and fax telephones SMH already has on the stocks. SMH
hopes to produce 1m twinphones this year - assembled in south-east Asia -
and in March launched the Swatchpager, a paging watch, in the US in
partnership with BellSouth.
More ambitiously still, SMH and Volkswagen, the German car maker, last year
set up a joint venture to develop, manufacture and distribute the
Swatchmobile, an ecological car intended to exploit the huge potential
market for non-polluting vehicles, especially in the US. The rewards could
be enormous for a car with the right price-performance combination, which
has so far eluded the big car makers.
A Swatchmobile prototype is already under test, and the two companies are
hoping to start production in 1994 for launch in 1995. The details are a
closely guarded secret but the car will have an electric or hybrid
petrol-electric motor and, Mr Hayek claims, the performance and safety
features of a normal petrol-driven model.
Though the project seems fanciful, SMH is not taking too big a risk. VW is
thought likely to put up most of the funds needed for the manufacturing
operation, with SMH taking a royalty fee on sales and perhaps an equity
stake. The companies, which are sharing development costs of around Dollars
20m, are planning production of 100,000 cars a year if the launch goes well.
Analysts concede that Mr Hayek's track record makes it difficult to dismiss
the idea out of hand. 'If VW and SMH can bring a car to market that is
cheap, clean, handy and comfortable, it could be a nice surprise,' says Mr
Roland Leutenegger of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (12): A radical package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR-FRIENDLY is the great buzz-word among Swiss quoted companies these
days.
They are all rushing to publish more - and more revealing  - information
about their activities and trying to make their shares more attractive to
investors, including foreigners.
In part, they are doing this to get their share prices up, so they can raise
capital on better terms. But for the biggest companies, such as Nestle and
Roche, the hard fact is that the Swiss capital market can no longer meet
their needs, so they have no choice but to appeal to foreign investors.
If there were an award for the Swiss company that has done the most in the
shortest time to become investor-friendly, it would undoubtedly go to Holvis
Holzstoff, formerly Holzstoff, a long-established, medium-sized group
(SFr823m consolidated sales last year).
Holvis has transformed itself in the past two years from a boring pulp and
paper maker to a world leading producer of the non-woven polymer-based
material for disposable nappies and dozens of other trendy products.
Even the group's name is new, created to help it shed its identification
with paper, which accounted for only 14.5 per cent of sales last year.
Holvis used to be one of the most secretive Swiss companies. 'It was very
conservative; there was almost no information,' Mr Rudolf Wenger, finance
director, says. And when it finally decided last year to change its spots,
it got off to a very bad start.
Like many others before it, Holvis proposed eliminating restrictions on
foreigners owning its registered shares but installing in its place a
general restriction on anyone registering more than a 2 per cent stake. The
idea was to prevent someone from secretly accumulating a bid stake, a move
which is still possible in Switzerland because there is, in effect, no
takeover code.
To their surprise, Holzstoff directors ran into a barrage of criticism from
Swiss institutional investors. 'The culture around us had changed,' says Mr
Pedro Reiser, chief executive, ruefully.
So the directors went back to the drawing board, and emerged in early March
this year with the most radical package of proposals yet advanced by a Swiss
quoted company.
The proposals, which were to be approved at yesterday's annual general
meeting, included the consolidation of capital into a single class of
registered shares with no restriction on ownership, by numbers or
nationality.
In addition, the shares would be split 10 for one to make their price more
accessible to small shareholders.
In terms of disclosure, the group has also led the way, being one of the
first Swiss companies to publish a breakdown of its profits last year by
division. And the directors promise that this year's financial statements
will be published in accordance with international accounting standards
(IAS).
Mr Reiser says that one of the group's objectives in liberalising was to
improve the rating on its shares so that it could raise capital more cheaply
in the future. It spent Dollars 175m in 1990 buying the non-woven assets of
the US paper group, James River, and might need to return to the capital
markets in the future. Since the announcement of the capital restructuring
in early March, the group's bearer shares have risen from SFr5,040 to
SFr5,600.
Mr Wenger adds: 'Management has started to understand that shareholders are
an important part of a company's life. In Switzerland, that has been
neglected.'
However, the group has taken a risk by going all the way, because it is now
vulnerable to a surprise hostile takeover bid. Several other Swiss
companies, including Nestle and Sulzer, intend to liberalise their capital
structures this year. But they have decided to maintain a limit on the
proportion of share capital that any individual may register until a proper
takeover code is in place in Switzerland.
Mr Reiser acknowledges the problem, but he says the rise in the market
valuation of the group's shares since the announcement should drive away the
opportunistic bidder.
'Even if we maintained restrictions, we could not stop a determined
strategic bidder. We could only delay him,' he says.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (10): The mobilisation of a diehard
patriot - Profile: Christoph Blocher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO SOME, he is a right-wing eccentric, to others he is the conscience of the
nation, the quintessential Swiss patriot.
Christoph Blocher is a colonel in the Swiss army, a member of the federal
parliament for the conservative People's Party and executive chairman of a
successful speciality chemical company.
He also led the forces that six years ago successfully opposed the proposal
that Switzerland join the United Nations. And now he is in the forefront of
efforts to block the federal government's plans to take the country into the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Community.
If he were British, he would undoubtedly be a diehard Thatcherite. He
distrusts bureaucrats and believes passionately that less is better when it
comes to governments.
He is also suspicious of corporate bureaucrats, and prefers to pay out big
dividends to Ems-Chemie shareholders rather than use the company's strong
cash flow for risky diversification projects or acquisitions.
Next week, the Swiss are to vote in a referendum on joining the IMF and
early next year they will have to decide whether or not to ratify the
so-called European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, which would bring the six
countries of the European Free Trade Area (Efta) closer to joining the EC.
Mr Blocher is already mobilised for these campaigns, with beguiling negative
arguments at the ready.
On the IMF and World Bank, as on the UN, he h a s no particular complaints,
but he thinks Switzerland is better off as a non-member. He insists that the
country is not isolationist; it pays to support many of these organisations'
projects and agencies, but it also reserves the right not to participate if
it thinks a particular project is ill-conceived.
'If we were a member, we would have only one vote. We are a little country,
so no one would listen to us. So it is better for us to be on the outside
and decide on a case-by-case basis. I think also that our views are sought
more than they would be if we were members.'
Mr Blocher also resents the enthusiasm of what he calls 'official Bern' for
joining these organisations. 'They say we must participate, that we must be
in solidarity with other countries, but they really just want to be in the
club so they can tell us, the people, that the club has decided something
and there is nothing we can do about it. They like power, but Swiss
democracy is against power.'
His complaints against the EC are more numerous. Indeed, Mr Blocher opposes
the EEA because he believes it is designed as a halfway house towards full
EC membership. 'The government's policy is that the EEA is a first step
towards EC membership. You cannot find many people in Switzerland who are
for the EEA and against the EC. If anyone says he likes the EEA but not the
EC, he is saying it for tactical reasons.'
The basic problem with the EC, he says, is that it is an 'intellectual
construction'. Viewing it with Swiss eyes, it appears very centralised,
undemocratic and unfederal. 'We have a lot of difficulty finding out what
officials in Bern are doing with our money. Brussels would be much worse.'
He says the whole idea of a united Europe is fundamentally flawed. Europe is
composed of several states with substantial differences in history, culture,
language and economic and political systems. Several attempts have been made
to unify it, but all have failed, and the EC will fail too. 'I am sure that
it cannot function.'
The current tensions between Germany and other countries in the European
Monetary System (EMS) illustrate the difficulties. 'It is not that Germany
has made a mistake or France or Britain; the mistake is having one system.'
Mr Blocher thinks it is better to have competition between governments to
prevent any one of them from getting too powerful or arrogant.
He acknowledges that if it turns out that Switzerland is the only western
European country to refuse to join the EC, Brussels might get tough. 'But
they need Switzerland, too. This is not a new problem for us, and we have
been in much more dangerous positions in the past than we are today.
'The EC wants to export. We are their largest single market after the US and
they sell more to us than we sell to them.'
Mr Blocher is not distressed either by the prospect of 'missing the train'
by not joining the EC at the same time as the other Efta countries. 'Nobody
can see what Europe will be like in 10 or 20 years. Perhaps it will be more
decentralised, and then we could apply, if we wanted to. In a situation like
this, it is better for a little country to wait and watch.
'This is not an egotistical stance. We want to be friendly with everyone,
politically and economically open, but always maintaining our sovereignty.'

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (11): A neutral force - Is the army
that absurd?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE NEVER knows whether to treat the subject of the Swiss army with humour
or respect.
The idea of a small, resolutely neutral, land-locked country of 6.8m people
having a huge citizen army constantly at the ready to repel any invader and
enough nuclear shelters to house every citizen somehow seems absurd.
Yet historically, Swiss military achievements, up to and including the
second world war, speak eloquently for the competence and courage of the
country's armed forces and for the durability of the country's neutrality
and democratic institutions.
And the Swiss militia system, under which every able-bodied male is
constantly on call and has to train for a few weeks every year, has long
been admired for its contribution to the country's social fabric as well as
to its military effectiveness. The system has even been copied, notably by
Israel.
And yet, and yet. The cold war is over and the prospect of nuclear
conflagration on the European continent seems to have disappeared.
Even before the fall of the Berlin wall, Switzerland's military stance had
been questioned. After all, the military was still working under a security
doctrine published in 1966. Did the country still need a 600,000-strong
army? Did every strategic bridge and tunnel in the country still have to
have vast quantities of high explosives strapped to it?
Some even doubted that the country needed an army at all. In 1989, a
referendum on the subject revealed that a startling 35.6 per cent minority
favoured scrapping it.
Perhaps that galvanised the federal government into action. In the spring of
1989, Bern launched a full-scale re-evaluation of the country's future
military requirements, called Army 95.
The result will be implemented towards the middle of the decade.
The plan retains the principle of armed neutrality for Switzerland, claiming
that an army contributes to the credibility of a country. It also accepts
that Switzerland should continue to rely on an army composed almost entirely
of part-timers.
But it acknowledges that the potential missions of the military concerns
about maintaining order at home in the event of natural catastrophes or
shock waves from conflicts or disasters in neighbouring countries.
'The line between simple violence and warlike actions is a very moving one,
notably when the development of a situation has not been understood quickly
and responded to energetically,' the draft says.
As a result, Switzerland needs a smaller, more flexible army. Troop numbers
could fall by a third to 400,000 and the class system, dividing soldiers
among elite, support and stormtroop cadres, should be eliminated.
Time given over to military service could be substantially shortened. Now
the minimum service consists of a 17-week basic training course at age 20
plus a further 12 sessions totalling 212 days taken up to the age of 50.
Under Army 95, it would be reduced to an initial 15 weeks and only 10
additional sessions of 19 days, taken every two years up to the age of 42.
There has been little public reaction to the Army 95 proposals, which would
suggest that most Swiss are comfortable with them. Many men in their 40s are
pleased because they are at points in their careers where the time given
over to the military can be a real loss.
Similarly, young people now envisage the possibility of doing some kind of
civil service instead of joining the army. Up to now, this has been
forbidden, but a referendum on a proposal to introduce it is being held next
week.
In March, a consultation process on creating a battalion of 600 armed 'blue
helmet' forces to help in United Nations peacekeeping operations has also
yielded positive results. Up to now, the country has supplied only unarmed
'blue beret' peacekeepers, but the political parties are agreed that the
country must do more in the future.
All this is not to say there has been no controversy on the military front.
The country was gripped last month by a surge in opposition to the
government's plan to invest Dollars 2.3bn in 34 McDonnell Douglas F-18
fighter aircraft to replace ageing Mirages.
The plan was approved by one of the two parliamentary chambers in March and
now requires only approval from the other in June to be put into effect.
The pacifist Group for an Army Free Switzerland has launched a petition that
would cancel the project, and hopes to raise the 100,000 required signatures
before the June vote.
The drive just might succeed. Many Swiss who are not pacifist still do not
understand the need for a sophisticated fighter aircraft to face the kind of
adversaries posited in Army 95.
Another issue is the future of Swiss neutrality. In March, a group of
experts submitted a report to the government, saying that the country's
tradition of neutrality did not prevent it from joining the European
Community or participating in UN mandated economic sanctions. EC entry would
not conflict with Swiss neutrality as long as the EC did not have security
and defence policy structures fixed by treaty.
If the EC subsequently set up a military alliance, the Swiss might have to
reassess their policy of neutrality but, 'even as a member of the EC,
Switzerland could stand aside during conflicts between other states,
maintain a credible and autonomous national defence and carry out its
traditional humanitarian and mediating roles'.
The foreign ministry is now assessing the report and may recommend policy
changes to the cabinet.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (8): Struggle to stay at the top - The
problems of Swissair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISSAIR may be a widely admired airline, but as a shareholder-owned company
based in a small country, it has a struggle on its hands to keep pace with
the giant groups taking shape in its industry.
Last year, in common with most international airlines, the group suffered
from a substantial slump in traffic. Total passengers carried were down 8.2
per cent to 7.9m and cargo volume eased 3.3 per cent to 271,000 tonnes.
However, thanks to cost-cutting and more than normal aircraft sales, the
group was able to show a substantial gain in net profit from SFr48m in 1990
to SFr83m last year. Still, as Mr Armin Baltensweiler, the retiring chairman
said, this was 'not a brilliant result by any means', with return on equity
a dismal 3 per cent.
On the other hand, the group has a relatively strong financial position for
an airline, with debts of SFr5.3bn supported by SFr2.8bn of shareholders'
equity, and its fleet of 60 aircraft has an average age of only six years.
Swissair's major problem is that it has a small national customer base. This
makes it hard for it to muster enough passengers to fill the non-stop
flights that customers demand these days.
New medium capacity aircraft with long-haul capability, such as the
McDonnell Douglas MD-11, have helped the group remain competitive, but its
main strategy for dealing with this problem has been to form pacts with
other airlines.
Late in 1989, it formed one with Delta Airlines of the US and Singapore
Airlines for long-haul routes. In May 1990, it formed another with Austrian
Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines, called the European Quality Alliance.
The idea was that the airlines would share facilities and route management
and exchange strategic share- holdings, but they have found that working
together is easier in good times than in a recession.
'Alliances are not enforceable,' Mr Paul Muller, a Swissair director, says
wryly. 'And when things are bad, a company's first thoughts are for its own
problems.'
There were, for example, plans for SAS and Swissair to combine forces on
aircraft purchases, but they have been scuttled because of SAS's financial
problems. Similarly, the depressed state of the shares of both companies has
delayed a planned share swap.
Swissair's role as the distribution and collection point for Delta in Europe
was undermined when Delta acquired Pan American's European routes.
However, that does not mean the alliances have failed. Mr Muller claims the
co-ordination of Swissair and SAS schedules has contributed to a big
increase in Swissair's business from Scandinavia to and from Africa. SAS,
Swissair and Austrian Airlines have set up a jointly operated station in
Vilnius, thus saving costs.
Also, Swissair has won a contract to service Delta's 21 Airbuses, 'our most
important maintenance contract in 10 years,' Mr Muller says.
Swissair's other big headache is a political one. The airline is terrified
about being left out in the cold when EC-wide air transport policies are
made.
'If Switzerland remains isol- ated from the rest of Europe, our ability to
compete will be further handicapped,' Mr Otto Loepfe, the airline's
president, said last month. 'Swiss integration in Europe is a matter of
survival,' he added.
Most other Swiss companies have already insulated themselves against the
possibility that Switzerland will not join the EC by setting up subsidiaries
and factories within EC countries. However, Swissair cannot do this, because
EC transport policy requires that EC airlines be owned and controlled by EC
nationals.
The country will hold a referendum later this year on the plan to build new
tunnels through the Alps. This is a vital element of the Alpine transit
treaty negotiated last year with Brussels. Also in the treaty is a provision
for bilateral air transport negotiations.
Swissair desperately hopes the treaty will be approved by the Swiss people.
'We are telling all our employees to be sure to vote and to get their
families to vote too,' Mr Muller says. 'It is not a matter of politics; it
is a matter of jobs.'

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (5): A tale of triumphs and disasters
 -Banks have scored bigger profits and record loan provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWISS banking industry has lived through a bewildering combination of
triumphs and disasters in the past year.
Many banks scored handsome increases in profits. The big three universal
banks all recorded new records on the bottom line and showed that in spite
of the unpopularity of the notion of global banking these days they could
made significant progress in international markets.
Yet most banks had to make record provisions for bad loans, some in
connection with the embarrassingly well publicised collapses of companies
controlled by Mr Werner Rey and the late Robert Maxwell.
The Swiss banking community was also embarrassed by the spectacle of the
forced closure of a sizeable regional bank, Spar und Leihkasse Thun, last
October, something no-one ever expected to see in Switzerland.
And early this year, the removal by Moody's of its triple A rating from the
long-term debt of Credit Suisse, and its threat to do the same to Swiss Bank
Corporation (SBC) caused further discomfort.
Moody's cited the increased risk to banks caused by the liberalisation of
Swiss banking and security markets in the past two years, but the
indications are that over the period both the big universal banks and the
top private banks have strengthened their positions in securities dealing
and fund management.
Probably the most important of these developments is the growing success of
the big three banks in world markets. Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the
largest, and Credit Suisse have had considerable troubles in the past with
their foreign subsidiaries and SBC was slow in establishing an international
strategy.
But in the past year, aided by their strong balance sheets and no doubt also
by the retreat of troubled Japanese and US banks from the key international
markets, the big three have found profitable pickings in international
lending, foreign exchange dealings and fund management.
Credit Suisse said 30 per cent of its net income came from foreign
operations, but Bank Julius Baer, in a recent study, argues that the figure
would be more like 66 per cent if income from the group's Luxembourg-based
mutual funds, which are managed from Zurich, were included. UBS said the
foreign contribution to its earnings last year tripled to 25 per cent.
SBC said that its association with the derivative specialists, the O'Conner
Partnerships in Chicago, in which it invested about SFr90m a little over a
year ago, yielded net income of SFr107m last year, but overall foreign
earnings were depressed by large provisions on bad debts.
In spite of the Thun failure, the country's regional banks also did well.
The Union of Swiss Regional Banks (VSRB) said its 173 members increased
their combined net profits by 12 per cent to SFr264m and enlarged their
balance sheets by 5.1 per cent to SFr86.1bn. However, even their combined
profits are tiny in comparison with UBS's SFr1.2bn last year, indicating the
need for further consolidation.
Mr Robert Studer, chief executive of UBS, startled a Zurich audience in
March by predicting that 100 of the country's banks could disappear in the
next 10 years.
That seems a large number for a small country, but it makes more sense when
you consider that Switzerland's total bank count is still a whopping 630.
Indeed, some might think Mr Studer's proposed reduction too modest.
Leaders of the country's financial services industry have known for a long
time that rationalisation was inevitable, and that the need for action had
intensified since various cartel-like conventions, providing protection for
various types of banks, were abolished.
But they preferred not to think about it much until the failure of Spar und
Leihkasse Thun shocked them into action.
It was the first time in memory that the Federal Banking Commission had
closed a well-known bank without warning, and the sight of queues of
depositors outside the bank's doors was not one anyone had ever expected in
Switzerland.
In the wake of the closure, the various bank associations in February agreed
to set up a two-layer safety net designed to prevent any more forced
closures.
First, the VSRB, which represents many of the smaller local banks that are
in the greatest difficulties, has formed an examining board to discover
problem cases and try to solve them. Union officials say that about a dozen
of their 185 member banks are now being examined.
Ideally, another bank will be found to take on the problem bank or its
assets. If a problem bank refuses to co-operate, the Federal Banking
Commission will apply pressure. If no bank is willing to take over the
troubled bank, a working group within the Swiss Bankers Association will
move in to make sure that, whatever happens, creditors are protected.
Meanwhile, rationalisation is also the order of the day among big banks. In
his March speech, Mr Studer also shocked his audience by suggesting that one
of the big three might decide to give up retail banking in the foreseeable
future because profits were so thin in this area.
Analysts immediately pointed the finger at Credit Suisse, the third largest
of the big three, and a relatively recent player in the retail area.
However, Credit Suisse officials denied that they had any intention of
abandoning its retail network.
Nevertheless, all three big banks are now looking carefully at their retail
businesses for ways to raise revenues and trim costs. Thus, UBS announced in
January that it would concentrate certain specialised services in a limited
number of branches rather than have every branch offer every service. Credit
Suisse said it had already made considerable progress on this front.
Mr Franz Galliker, chairman of Swiss Bank Corporation, said last month that
SBC too was thinking of 'streamlining' its branch network. In March, SBC
announced that it was restructuring Banca della Svizzera Italiana, in which
it acquired a majority stake last year, to become part of a private banking
group, leaving it with retail activities only in its canton Ticino base.
The big three banks have also participated in the trend among leading Swiss
companies to greater transparency and investor friendliness in recent
months. They have much stronger equity bases than most of their leading
international competitors, but their return on equity, ranging from 7 per
cent to 10 per cent, still leaves considerable room for improvement.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (9): Trying to carve out a niche -
Profile: Volksbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW PEOPLE outside Switzerland had heard of Swiss Volksbank until it emerged
as a lender of Dollars 35m to a private company controlled by the late
Robert Maxwell.
The loan attracted wide attention abroad because it was made only after Mr
Ian Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell had pledged Berlitz shares owned by Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC) to Volksbank. The brothers had previously
agreed to sell the shares to a Japanese company.
The loan also raised eyebrows because few people in Switzerland would have
expected this rather sleepy and parochial bank to be involved with the likes
of Maxwell.
Although Volksbank is Switzerland's fourth largest commercial bank, it is a
distant fourth behind the third largest, Credit Suisse, and does not have a
particularly distinguished performance record.
While Credit Suisse had total assets of SFr155.6bn at the end of last year,
Volksbank had only SFr46.5bn. And Volksbank's after-tax return on equity was
only 3.1 per cent, compared with 9.9 per cent at Credit Suisse.
The bank has been trying to improve its performance, and the Maxwell
misadventure is a curious footnote in the story.
Volksbank has long looked a rather awkward player on the Swiss banking
stage. Though it is in a different league from the big three Swiss
commercial banks, it is more than just a building society.
It is a full service bank with 191 branches and agencies throughout
Switzerland and a strong presence in both retail and corporate lending.
The fact that Volksbank does not fit neatly into a clear category has given
rise to speculation that it might be taken over. But none of the big three
banks - and they are the most likely potential bidders  - is much interested
in expanding its already large presence in the Swiss market.
Volksbank's leaders recognised a few years ago that their main customers -
Switzerland's army of small and medium-sized businesses  - were expanding
abroad. 'We did not want to lose them because we could not serve them any
more,' says Mr Rudolf Bosshard, the bank's director responsible for
international development.
They knew that they could not match the big three in the world's leading
financial mar- kets. But they thought they could build a sufficient inter-
national presence to preserve their client base at home.
The obvious first step was to set up offices in the key financial centres
that could provide customers with export finance, foreign exchange, capital
markets and portfolio management services on competitive terms.
A London branch was opened in 1985, and offices in New York, Tokyo and Sing-
apore followed in 1989. Early this year, Volksbank purch- ased a 20 per cent
stake in Banque Odier Bungener Cour- voisier in Paris rather than try to
build up from scratch there.
Ironically, it was through the application of this strategy that the bank
came into con- tact with Robert Maxwell. In 1987, one of its Swiss
industrial customers won a contract to supply machinery to a Maxwell company
and Volksbank's London branch provided a guarantee of delivery.
The contact was maintained. Volksbank lead-managed a bond issue for MCC a
few months later and participated in a syndicated loan for it. However, it
then decided to back away a bit. 'We realised Maxwell was too big for us,'
Mr Bosshard says.
Even so, the bank still has some Maxwell business on its books, and last
year made provisions for a Dollars 73m loan to MCC. No provision was made
for the Dollars 35m loan to the private Maxwell company because it was
covered by the Berlitz shares, which the bank has since claimed.
The second stage of Volksbank's international strategy began to take shape
last year. Under its expansion programme, it has concluded co-operation
agreements with banks in Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and France. Now, says Mr
Bosshard, it is looking for a partner or acquisition in northern Italy.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (7): Cloud over the cartels - Trade
policy faces an overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTICIPATION in the European Economic Area (EEA) and eventual EC membership
will give a substantial boost to the Swiss economy, but some sectors will
suffer painful adjustments. Economists agree that the impetus to growth will
come not so much from higher exports to more open European markets, but from
greater efficiency due to stiffer competition in domestic markets.
Though Switzerland's heavily protected agricultural sector is not directly
affected by the EEA, it too is being forced to contemplate radical change in
the light of the current round of global trade talks now nearing a close
under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in
Geneva.
A Gatt report on Switzerland's trade policy last autumn pointed out that,
while Swiss per capita incomes were more than 25 per cent above those in the
US and Canada in 1989, they lagged in terms of purchasing power. Swiss food
prices are well above EC levels, with consumers bearing 80 per cent of the
SFr7bn annual cost of farm support through guaranteed prices, tariffs and
border restrictions.
In industry too, while external trade policies are a model of liberal
economic principles, a network of formal and informal cartels between
domestic producers and traders keeps prices high and stringent regulations
tend to restrict competition from new entrants. As a result, Swiss consumers
pay over 40 per cent more for goods and services than their EC counterparts,
according to the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Unusually in Europe, Swiss law permits cartels, providing only for
investigation of abuses. No-one knows for sure how many cartels there are,
but one estimate puts the number at 900, many of which involve price-fixing.
Some, as in brewing, have crumbled under competitive pressures and others,
like the banking conventions, have been dismantled at government insistence.
But the bulk have been untouched for many years.
EEA membership will entail adoption of EC competition law which forbids
cartels and curtails monopolies. The SBC study published last month
estimated that the EEA could boost Switzerland's economic growth rate by 0.5
percentage points a year, a gain of 4-6 per cent by the end of the decade.
The Basle-based Economic Research Institute (BAK) thinks the benefits would
be even greater, with the Swiss economy growing by 2.3 per cent a year
within the EEA to the year 2000 and only 1.1 per cent a year outside it.
SBC's economists identified two vulnerable sectors: the construction
industry, due to an opening of public procurement - especially at cantonal
level - to foreign bidding; and medium-sized companies geared primarily to
the domestic market, notably in commerce, the food and drink industry and
services. Main beneficiaries would be pharmaceuticals, insurance companies
and multinationals including the banks.
Switzerland's successful export industries have undergone major structural
adjustments over the past decade or so, shifting further to
capital-intensive, high value-added products and services to economise on
scarce and expensive skilled labour and land. Most already have a solid base
in the EC. The Community accounts for nearly half Switzerland's foreign
assets of SFr85bn, half the near-1m overseas employees of Swiss companies,
and two-thirds of Switzerland's foreign trade.
Useful but unspectacular gains will come from harmonisation of standards and
common regulations throughout the 19-nation EEA, as well as freer movement
of labour and an end to the Lex Friedrich which restricts land sales to
foreigners. Industry will also welcome the assurance of future harmonisation
of technical and environmental standards, which could otherwise pose trade
barriers.
Swiss farmers view the future with much more apprehension. They have turned
out in their thousands to demonstrate in the capital, Bern, and in Geneva
against Gatt proposals that would oblige Switzerland to scrap its import
quota system on agricultural products in favour of tariffs, and reduce
domestic subsidies for agriculture by some 20 per cent by 1999. These
proposals, and future EC membership, could slash farm incomes by as much as
half, according to farmers' groups.
The government has said that the Gatt plan is not acceptable. But it has
admitted that Switzerland's 'war economy' farm policy based on ensuring food
self-sufficiency and maximising farmholdings is no longer tenable.
The effect has been to generate chronic surpluses and encourage heavy use of
chemical fertilisers and pesticides, while failing to protect farmers'
incomes or stop the exodus from the land.
The federal council is now proposing a shift from price supports to direct
income payments which would be largely independent of production. These
would be permitted under the Gatt plan. The intention is to target payments
at services provided in the public interest, such as food security and care
of the countryside, while ensuring that prices better reflect market
conditions and come down further towards EC levels. This is bound to produce
some restructuring and consolidation of Switzerland's 90,000 farms, 40 per
cent of them part-time.
While international pressures will lead to greater economic competitiveness,
many of the economic and political constraints that handicap efficiency will
require independent action by the Swiss government. The federal council has
said that it plans to reduce the extent of regulation (for instance, it
recently denoun- ced the International Labour Organisation convention
banning night work for women in industry). But it is not obvious how it can
reform the legal and political system that enables citizens to delay
inordinately investment projects and other economic initiatives, while
maintaining desired high environmental and health and safety standards.
Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the economy minister, gave a telling example of
Swiss dilatoriness to the upper house of parliament a couple of months ago.
'One Sunday, the Swiss people said yes to Rail 2000 (a programme to
modernise and expand the rail network). The following Monday, the French
government said yes to the construction of the Atlantic TGV. Result: we have
constructed a few metres of Rail 2000 and Adolf Ogi (the transport minister)
is fighting 80 appeals per kilometre. Meanwhile, the TGV is running at 514
kilometres an hour from end to end.'

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (4): Worrying outflow of funds - Moves
to stem the decline of a financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF INTEGRATION with Europe is the biggest concern of the Swiss these days,
the second biggest may well be the future of their country as an
international financial centre.
Hardly a week goes by without someone worrying about or proposing measures
to secure the future of what is known in all the official Swiss languages as
Finanzplatz Schweiz.
The name itself reveals part of the problem. One does not discuss the future
of Finanzplatz Zurich or Finanzplatz Basel, or even La Place Financiere de
Geneve. The country's financial industry is typically Swiss; it is
decentralised inconveniently among three centres (not to mention Lugano) and
to propose any large-scale concentration is out of the question.
Although precise statistics are hard to come by, there is no doubt that
Switzerland has declined as a financial centre in the past decade.
The country's big corporations have gone global for their banking and
capital market needs, and the big Swiss banks have followed them. This year,
some even held their financial results press conferences in London rather
than Switzerland. While the Japanese provided a blizzard of equity-linked
Swiss franc bond issues in the late 1980s, these have petered out as Tokyo's
stock market has plunged.
Many of the 42 Japanese banks and brokerage houses in Switzerland have been
shedding staff in recent months, and observers expect more than a few to
close their doors within the next year or so.
Meanwhile, the heart of the equity market has decamped to more liquid
London, where prices for most leading Swiss shares are now set. Mr Robert
Studer, president of Union Bank of Switzerland, says that about 15 per cent
of dealing in the top 18 Swiss blue chips now takes place in London.
Dealers point out that the figure would be larger but for the reluctance of
the big banks - which dominate equity trading  - overtly to irritate the
Swiss authorities by executing more deals in London.
Ironically, Zurich is about to open a new spacious stock exchange building,
planned more than a decade ago in anticipation of expansion that has gone
elsewhere.
Zurich's foreign exchange market is also fading, as trading is increasingly
concentrated in three big global centres: London, Tokyo and New York. And
the big three banks have tended to build up their trendy derivatives
businesses outside Switzerland as well.
The only sector in which the Swiss financial centre appears to be holding
its own is in asset management, mainly in connection with private banking.
According to Mr Jean Pierre Cuoni, president of Coutts &amp; Co in Zurich,
Switzerland still attracts about half of the world's cross-border private
banking business - worth perhaps Dollars 1,500bn.
The country also has outsize institutional pools of money because of its
large insurance companies and legislation requiring every Swiss company to
have a pension fund for its employees.
Indeed, private banking is an area where even foreign banks, including
Coutts, think they have a future in Switzerland.
If that roughly is the state of play, perhaps the first question to ask is
whether it is the result of a shift away of financial activity, especially
to London, or whether things can be done to improve or restore some lost or
weakened elements of Finanzplatz Schweiz.
The consensus appears to be that some of the outflow, notably of mutual
funds to Luxembourg, could have been stopped if the Swiss government had
been more sensitive to the negative impact of some of its regulations and
taxes in this area.
Similarly, if the country's stock exchanges had combined forces sooner, they
might have created a sufficiently liquid market in Switzerland so that
London would not have snapped up so much of the dealing business. Even
today, there are still three stock exchanges in Switzerland.
However, in a book* published this week, Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, president
of Bank J. Vontobel, a leading Zurich private bank, suggests that the
departure of much financial activity from the country was inevitable because
of the 'opening up and vitalising process of the foreign financial centres'.
Mr Vontobel also blames the four big banks for being too willing to let the
Swiss financial centre decay. He points out that the four opened only 10
branches in Switzerland in the 1980s, while they created nearly 150 offices
abroad.
In any event, he thinks there is not much point chasing after lost business.
Instead, it would be better to concentrate on taking steps to help preserve
the competitiveness of the Swiss asset management sector.
His main argument is that competition should be allowed free rein. He claims
that despite the elimination of various conventions in the banking sector in
the past two years, there is still too much concentration and oligopolistic
practice and the Swiss generally are too afraid of competition.
But Mr Vontobel says there is not much point in waiting for the government
to take action as the process is too slow. The international competitiveness
of Swiss asset management has to be ach- ieved by the firms themselves,
notably through productivity gains. He suspects that 20 per cent of the
115,000 jobs in the Swiss financial industry could be lost in the next five
to 10 years, even if the government moved quickly to improve the regulatory
environment.
The next reform milestone comes in the autumn when a referendum will be held
to approve a government proposal to reduce substantially the 0.3 per cent
stamp duty that has been blamed for much of the weakening of the Swiss
financial centre.
Although the reform is endorsed by virtually all political parties,
financial circles fear that it will be rejected by the people. Many Swiss
see no reason why the big banks should receive a gift at a time when they
are boasting about record profits.
The irony is that more and more of the banks' profits are coming from
abroad.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (2): Decisions loom on Europe - Ian
Rodger looks beneath the calm of the country's political life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS IT is the calm before the storm. In the past year, Swiss political
life has been eerily quiet, especially in contrast to the previous turbulent
three years of scandals and consequent debate about the effectiveness of the
country's peculiar political institutions and traditions.
Probably the biggest issue to disturb politicians in the past year has been
dealing with the country's surprisingly large number of drug addicts. And
while one would not attempt to underrate the seriousness of the drug
problem, it is not a matter that is likely to influence the country's
future.
By contrast, everyone knows that vital decisions about Switzerland's place
in Europe and the world are just around the corner, starting with next
week's referendum on joining the International Monetary Fund and followed by
another one in the autumn on whether or not to build new railway tunnels
through the Alps.
The tunnels are aimed at defusing the long-running dispute between
Switzerland and the European Community over transit rights for EC lorries.
That referendum is a prelude to another plebiscite, now expected in
mid-1993, to approve a treaty uniting the six countries of the European Free
Trade Association (Efta), including Switzerland, with the EC in the
so-called European Economic Area (EEA).
That, in turn, is seen by the government as merely a 'first step' towards
Switzerland becoming a full EC member.
Yet, so far, public debate on Europe has been muted, to say the least. In
last October's general elections, for example, the issue was scarcely
discussed. There was no clear theme in that campaign although, as in other
European countries, extremist and single theme parties made gains at the
expense of the four-party grand coalition that has been in power since 1959.
The anti-immigrant Automobile Party, for example, raised its representation
from two seats to eight in the 200-seat National Council, while the Swiss
Democrats, another anti-immigration group, raised their tally from three to
five. On the left, the Greens won 12 seats, three more than they won in the
1987 elections, while the Lega dei Ticinesi, a new populist formation from
the Italian speaking canton of Ticino, took two seats.
Among the coalition parties, only the Social Democrats and the conservative
People's Party maintained their totals of 41 and 25 seats respectively. The
conservative Radicals dropped from 51 to 44 and the Christian Democrats from
42 to 36.
In all, the election result was seen as only a mild rebuke to the ruling
parties for the scandals of the last parliament, notably that over Mrs
Elisabeth Kopp, the former justice minister, who tipped off her husband that
a company of which he was vice-chairman was under investigation for money
laundering. She was acquitted in 1990 of breaching official secrecy, but the
judgment was widely criticised.
Another scandal raged over revelations that cabinet ministers were unaware
that federal police maintained secret files on more than 900,000 Swiss
citizens and foreigners living in the country.
These scandals, together with other indications that the Swiss government
system was no longer working effectively, led a number of critics to press
more stridently for radical reforms.
The fact that parliament sits for only four three-week sessions a year, for
example, is considered an anachronism. It should become a full-time body,
many argue, but the politicians themselves rejected the idea last year.
Similarly, the size of the cabinet, with only seven members, one of whom
takes a turn at being president under an annual rotation system, is
considered hopelessly inadequate for today's needs. And many of its tasks,
such as setting speed limits and appointing minor officials, could be
delegated.
The result is that the cabinet has trouble finding time to debate important
issues, such as those thrown up by a group of experts in March on the
compatibility of Swiss neutrality with membership in the European Community.
Also, the cabinet's composition, according to the so-called magic formula
that splits the ministerial portfolios among the ruling parties and
representatives from regions and language groups, is considered by many to
be far too rigid.
However, critics admit that the cabinet is a fair representation of the
bland combination of four parties making up the governing coalition. It is
perhaps worth pointing out that the two conservative parties could, with the
help of splinter parties, control parliament on their own.
There have been suggestions from time to time that the grand coalition may
collapse, but there is no sign of it at the moment. The Social Democrats
threatened last month to take the government to court for making a SFr50m
down payment on a Dollars 2.3bn order for 34 F-18 fighter aircraft, but they
backed down when their coalition partners suggested this was an unfriendly
move.
Another complaint about the political system is that the conditions which a
group of citizens has to fulfil so as to force a plebiscite have become too
light. It is said that almost anyone with enough money to hire the right
public relations agency can raise the required 100,000 signatures to force a
vote on any issue. The figure has not changed in a century, except in 1977
when it was roughly doubled to take account of women being given the right
to vote.
But all these complaints have receded somewhat in the past few months,
perhaps reflecting a feeling that, compared with some other countries in
these tough times, Switzerland is not, after all, that badly governed.
Also, the cabinet has at least twice shown an uncharacteristically high
sense of purpose in recent months. Last October's decision to make
membership in the EC official government policy and to declare that
ratification of the EEA treaty was only a 'first step' towards accession to
the EC itself startled many observers.
Only two members of the cabinet, Mr Rene Felber, the foreign minister and
this year's president, and Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the economics minister,
are unconditionally enthusiastic about EC membership. Another, Mr Adolf Ogi,
the transport and communication minister, is in favour, but cannot stray
from his People's Party's negative stance.
Mr Flavio Cotti, the interior minister, and Mr Arnold Koller, the justice
minister, are unenthusiastic and Mr Otto Stich, the finance minister, is
resolutely opposed.
In March, Mr Felber, flanked by Mr Stich, Mr Delamuraz and Mr Markus Lusser,
president of the Swiss National Bank, appeared before the press to make a
passionate appeal to the people to endorse the government's plan to join the
IMF and World Bank.
'It is in institutions like the IMF or World Bank which practise
international co-operation on the basis of recognised rules that states see
their rights best protected,' he said.
It remains to be seen if this forceful presence is enough to win the day in
next week's referendum. Many observers doubt it, but even if the
government's policy is rejected, life will go on as normal.
'There is no opposition in parliament,' says Mr Christoph Blocher, the
outspoken president of the People's Party in Canton Zurich. 'In our system,
the people are the opposition.'

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (3): A paragon is humiliated - The
country's economic problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE HELD up as a model for the industrialised world, the Swiss economy has
lost its allure. Switzerland has suffered a deeper recession than any
European Community country, its inflation rate is above the OECD average,
unemployment is at its highest level in more than half a century, and the
former rock-solid Swiss franc is looking feeble.
An economy as open as Switzerland's could not hope to insulate itself from
the world economic slowdown, which has been longer and more pronounced than
predicted just a few months ago. Imports and exports account for some 40 per
cent of Swiss GDP.
However, the drop in national output last year of 0.5 per cent was tempered
by buoyant exports to the booming German market, which takes nearly a
quarter of all Swiss merchandise exports. By the same token, this year's
recovery will be weakened by the slackening German economy, not only through
the effect on exports but also through the higher Swiss interest rates
necessitated by the German Bundesbank's tough monetary stance.
Most economic forecasters are predicting export-led growth of 0.5-0.9 per
cent in 1992, concentrated in the second half, as the world economy picks up
steam. But even in 1993 GDP is not now expected to exceed 2 per cent, which
will make little dent in the unemployment total.
For the Swiss, accustomed to tight labour markets and negligible
unemployment, the rapidity of the climb in joblessness has come as a shock.
Just a year ago, 35,000 people - 1.1 per cent of the workforce - were
registered as unemployed. Even this was high by comparison with the 0.5-0.8
per cent rate common for much of the 1980s. But in March 1992 nearly 76,000
 -2.5 per cent  - were out of work. The total is still rising.
The surge in the numbers out of work contrasts with the recession in the
early 1980s. Companies have been readier to lay off surplus staff this time
around and redundant workers have been readier to register as unemployed.
Unemployment benefits are more generous than 10 years ago, the social stigma
attached to unemployment has lessened, and women and foreign workers have
not withdrawn from the labour force as they did in the past. Most of the
country's 1.2m foreigners - who make up a quarter of the workforce - now
have long-term residence rights.
Despite the mounting jobless total, the Swiss government has firmly rejected
calls by the trade unions for reflation and large-scale job-creation. This
refusal partly reflects a long-standing federal government policy of
eschewing intervention in the economic cycle, as well as the need to curb
government spending. But it also reflects fears that reflation would hinder
necessary structural adjustments to reverse the country's declining
long-term competitiveness.
The high costs of doing business in Switzerland, a shortage of skilled
workers and a legal system that permits projects to be held up for years by
appeals, have led multinational companies to move production, and even
research facilities, abroad. The decision last December by Ciba-Geigy, the
country's biggest chemicals group, to locate a genetic engineering research
centre just over the border in Alsace, was a recent example. But even at the
end of 1990, the 15 biggest Swiss enterprises employed 684,700 people - 82
per cent of their total workforce - outside Switzerland.
Government and industry are in accord that the Swiss economy suffers from
excessive regulation and too much cosiness in business. Heading industry's
wish list, aside from participation in the EEA and eventual EC membership,
are a relaxation of strict restrictions on skilled foreign workers, a change
in Swiss competition law to ban cartels, which are widespread, the
introduction of VAT (rejected by Swiss voters last year) to replace the
present unsatisfactory sales tax, and less regulation, especially in the
labour market.
These objectives are shared by the much-vilified Swiss National Bank (SNB),
the central bank, which has been struggling to control an unruly bout of
inflation sparked off by an inadvertent over-relaxation of monetary policy
in 1987-88.
The subsequent monetary tightening, accompanied by high interest rates,
precipitated the recession by hitting investment, especially construction,
and has prevented any decisive recovery. Inflation has subsided from its
peak of 6.6 per cent last summer to just under 5 per cent in March, but is
expected to fall only slowly to 3-3.5 per cent next year. Mr Markus Lusser,
SNB president, says there is no room for any significant loosening of
monetary policy.
The Bank says its policies have been less effective than they should have
been because of important structural rigidities in the Swiss economy. These
include widespread indexation, notably of rents (tied to mortgage rates) and
of wages (linked to prices), steep rises in public sector charges and the
high degree of cartelisation in industry as well as one of the most
protected farm sectors in Europe.
The fight against inflation has also been hampered by the weak Swiss franc,
which has lost about 10 per cent of its value against a trade-weighted
currency basket since January 1991. The SNB decided not to follow the rise
in German rates last December, so as not to squash the first signs of
economic recovery. But it was subsequently forced to intervene heavily in
the money and foreign exchange markets earlier this year when the currency
tumbled, threatening to push up inflation once again.
Some commentators, such as KOF, a leading economic forecasting institute,
have suggested that counter-inflation policy would be more credible if the
Bank abandoned the pretence of an independent monetary policy and declared a
floor or band for the Swiss franc against the Deutschemark. The Swiss
parliament has asked the government to examine Swiss membership of the
European Monetary System.
EC economic and monetary union may soon be the order of the day. But, as Mr
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the economy minister, has said, Switzerland would not
currently qualify for EMU because its inflation rate is too high. For a
former economic paragon, this is humiliation indeed.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (1): Gear after neutral - The
government has firmly committed itself to joining the European Community.
Line is overdrawn But doubts remain about whether the inhabitants of neutral
Switzerland will want to follow this lead
</HEADLINE>

THE TIME for decisions has at last arrived. Over the next year, the Swiss
will be called upon, after years of debate and soul-searching, to take a
number of decisions that will set the framework for their relations with the
rest of Europe and the rest of the world for the foreseeable future.
At stake is whether the country will continue to pursue its detached stance,
maintaining strict neutrality and avoiding foreign alignments. Or will it
adopt a more conventional role for a small, landlocked, resource-poor
country of 6.8m people, and join formally with its neighbours in building
the European Community of the future?
Opinion polls have consistently indicated that the Swiss are sharply divided
on these questions, worried, on the one hand, that if they remain detached,
their highly developed industrial base will suffer and their much-envied
standard of living will decline.
These worries are understandably acute at a time when the Swiss economy is
having difficulty pulling out of a year-long recession, when inflation is
uncharacteristically high and the country's role as a financial haven seems
to be disappearing.
But the Swiss are strongly attached to their decentralised style of
self-government and they fear that their interests would be not be
well-protected in an organisation such as the European Commission. They
dread a further rush of immigrants and foreign property buyers if the
country has to accept the EC principle of freedom of movement of people.
It would be wrong to overdramatise the distance between the two options on
offer. Even if it decides to maintain its autonomy, Switzerland would not be
isolated or aloof from the problems of its continent or the world. It
already participates as a non-member in the activities of most international
organisations; it has an increasingly liberal and open economy and it shares
the burdens of refugees that strain most western European countries these
days. More than 16 per cent of Swiss residents are non-Swiss.
Conversely, if the Swiss decide to move towards joining the European
Community, they will still be able to maintain - at least at the local level
 -their unique and cherished political structures.
The decision-making process on these issues begins as early as next week
when the Swiss will vote in a plebiscite on whether their country should at
last join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
This will be the first test of Swiss sentiment towards international
organisations since a majority rejected a proposal in 1986 to join the
United Nations. In the meantime, Switzerland startled many observers by
joining in the UN-led coalition to roll back Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
A few weeks ago, it joined the sanctions against Libya over airline
terrorism.
In the autumn, the people will vote in another plebiscite on a mammoth
project to drill two new rail tunnels through the Alps. This project, called
NEAT, is the Swiss government's contribution to trying to solve the
inflammatory dispute that pits Austria and Switzerland against the EC over
the use of Swiss roads by EC lorries moving between Italy and Germany.
The EC and the Alpine countries reached a comprehensive agreement on the
problem late last year, subject to ratification by the Swiss and Austrians.
The importance of the agreement for EC-Swiss relations is great enough in
itself, but other factors make it even more important.
For one thing, it includes an air traffic agreement, which is vital to the
survival of Swissair, the Swiss national airline, especially if Switzerland
later decides not to join the EC.
The treaty is also part of the transport element in the agreement between
the six European Free Trade Area (Efta) countries, including Switzerland,
and the EC that was initialled last month to create what is called the
European Economic Area (EEA).
So if the NEAT proposal is rejected by Swiss voters, Switzerland will have
reneged on its commitments under the EEA treaty.
The final referendum of interest is on the EEA itself. This was originally
going to be held in December, but because parts of the agreement had to be
rewritten early this year to overcome the objections of the European Court
of Justice, completion was delayed and so the referendum must be postponed
until May 1993.
The vote on the EEA has taken on increased importance since the federal
cabinet's declaration last autumn that it considers the EEA nothing more
than a first step towards full EC membership. Thus, the ground has been cut
from under those Swiss who like the idea of the EEA - essentially a free
trade area - but do not like the EC, at least in its present form.
Since the cabinet's declaration, some political and business leaders have
argued that the country should put in its application to join the EC
immediately rather than wait for the EEA referendum result. They say that
speed is of the essence if the country is to sit around the table with the
likes of Sweden, Austria, Norway and Finland rather than having to apply in
a few years' time with Czechoslovakia, Turkey and Hungary.
In particular, the Swiss would like to be involved in the resolution of how
neutral countries' interests will be protected in the EC. This will be
sorted out in the negotiations with Austria, Sweden and Finland, so if
Switzerland is not present, it will have to accept the same terms when and
if it applies at a later point.
There is also a tactical point. Some argue that if a majority of the Swiss
vote against joining the EEA in next May's referendum, it would be awkward
for the government to turn around and apply immediately for EC membership.
Thus, these people say, it would be smarter to put the application in now.
Then, if the EEA referendum was lost, the government could just move on to
the EC negotiations.
Even though the federal government and most top business leaders are
recommending that the people endorse all the above steps towards integration
with the European Community and the world, it is far from certain that they
will do so.
The Swiss tend to be very practical voters and, according to one Zurich
banker, they will probably vote against joining the Bretton Woods
institutions simply because they do not see what they will get out of them.
Attitudes toward Europe are more complex and varied. In general, the Swiss
do not like what they see as the concentration of more and more jurisdiction
at the EC centre in Brussels. One is frequently told that if the EC were
developing along the more decentralised lines that the British government
has proposed, then the Swiss might be more enthusiastic.
In the business community, the thousands of small wholesalers, retailers and
contractors - not to mention farmers - who still benefit from protection
from foreign competition obviously fear the potential arrival of the EC
anti-cartel office and the Common Agricultural Policy.
For totally different reasons, many of the country's large industrialists
and bankers no longer seem terribly worried about the outcome, which means
that they may feel free to vote with their hearts rather than their heads.
This is because, at their level, life has already become very European and
international. Switzerland exports 36 per cent of its output and imports an
almost identical proportion of its consumption, with the great majority of
its trade in both directions being with other European countries. Leading
Swiss banks and industrial companies have large and successful operating
bases abroad, and many leading EC companies, notably car makers, have
substantial sales in Switzerland.
More important, whatever unfair advantages they once enjoyed as a result of
being based in Switzerland are rapidly being swept away.
Perhaps the most significant of these advantages was the relatively closed
Swiss capital market, which is now in serious decline. (Ironically, Swiss
voters are expected to veto in yet another referendum later this year a
government plan to help the capital markets by cutting an irritating stamp
duty on securities transactions.)
This decline has forced big companies to make their shares more accessible
and attractive to foreigners and to become more transparent in their
reporting so that they can attract foreign capital. In the past few months,
several companies have split their shares and removed restrictions on
foreign ownership.
They are still feeling their way in the new, more liberal environment and
there have been no hostile foreign takeovers of Swiss companies so far.
Friendly sell-outs are starting to occur though. In January, German
interests took control of the big Movenpick restaurants and hotels group and
an Italian company took a strategic stake in the machinery group, Saurer.
But one lesson that already seems to be emerging is that business will go
on, whether or not companies are controlled by Swiss owners. It will also go
on whether or not Switzerland joins the EC.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (16): Investors urged to
behave like owners - Corporate governance is taking hold in the
consciousness of UK pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of determined passivity, UK pension funds are finally waking up
to their own power. With over Pounds 250bn in assets, they provide the
largest single source of working capital for British industry.
Thus, it should come as no surprise that pension funds are finally coming
around to the view that they should act like owners, rather than simply
passive investors.
The issue of corporate governance - the way companies are governed by their
directors - has slowly taken hold in the consciousness of UK pension funds
in a way unimaginable just a few years ago. Shareholders are beginning to
demand that managements tell them more about how their companies are run,
and seeking the right to do something about inefficient, profligate or
arrogant managers.
In the US, where the corporate governance movement has been in full swing
for years, pension fund activism has been assisted by the US Labour
Department, which in 1988 determined that voting rights are an asset of
pension fund trusts which must be exercised on behalf of members.
Meanwhile, in Britain, the National Association of Pension Funds last year
highlighted the passivity of its members, when it conducted a survey showing
that fewer than 20 per cent of them regularly exercised their proxy rights.
Mr Clive Gilchrist, deputy chairman of the NAPF and chairman of BesTrustees,
a company which acts as an independent trustee on pension boards, has
repeatedly urged members to use their voting rights. A survey conducted in
1990 showed that some 23 per cent of NAPF members did not even know whose
responsibility it was to make voting decisions. 'By 1991, the numbers were
only very slightly better,' he said.
To encourage members to vote, the NAPF has just established a proxy voting
service. In its initial stages, it will track all the companies in the FT-SE
100 index, preparing reports on matters to be voted at each annual general
meeting. The reports make no effort to advise pension funds on how to vote;
they simply inform readers whether or not the matter in hand is consider
contentious. It will also inform readers whether they are being asked to
approve a development which does not conform with NAPF guidelines on best
practice on corporate governance.
Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, acknowledges
that the group has not been deluged with demands for the new service, but
says that, at Pounds 2,000 per participant, response has been better than
expected. Currently, about six large institutions have signed up. 'So many
of then haven't even given the matter of voting any thought,' said Mr
Matheson.
The debate about corporate governance has been spurred on by the recession
of the past three years, which has exposed many managerial weaknesses
covered up by the go-go years of the late 1980s. Shareholders began asking
hard questions only when managements proved themselves unable to cope with
the downturn in business.
The NAPF, among other shareholder groups, has been busy developing codes of
practice intended to promote shareholder influence and make companies more
responsive to the interests of their owners. As a member of the
Institutional Shareholders Committee, it has participated in the drafting of
codes outlining the rights and responsibilities both of directors and of
shareholders.
Also, the NAPF has held discussions with the Accounting Standards Board, to
urge new rules which would require companies to disclose more about their
operations in their annual accounts.
Meanwhile, the legitimacy of demands for better corporate governance is
likely to get a boost from a report to be issued at the end of this month by
the so-called Cadbury Committee. The Committee on the Financial Aspects of
Corporate Governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, is expected to
recommend a wide range of measures, aimed at improving the quality of
information offered to shareholders and improving board accountability.
For hawks on the corporate governance issue, the report is likely to be
disappointing, because it will have no enforcement mechanism other than a
new rule from the London Stock Exchange requiring companies to disclose the
extent to which they comply with its recommendations.
But the report will underline the growing seriousness of investors in seeing
to it that boards are held accountable for their own performance.
But if those codes are to be any more than self-righteous posturing,
shareholders will have to use their muscle in the form of votes to put their
recommendations to the test.
Mr Matheson notes that, for those pension funds that use external managers,
the sheer mechanics of voting mitigate against it. 'For a large external
manager with several hundred clients, there's quite a lot of paper to be
signed,' he said.
A manager unable to contact pension fund trustees may have to forgo a vote
on their behalf. Also, many pension fund trustees may feel they are not well
informed enough about each company's affairs to use their votes wisely.
Thus, such decisions are better left to professional money managers who are
paid fees for their judgments.
Mr Matheson said that the NAPF's effort to encourage members to vote has
been helped by the Institutional Fund Managers Association, a trade group,
which urges the adoption of a standard management agreement authorising the
manager to make voting decisions on the pension fund's behalf.
Ann Simpson, co-director of the Pensions Investment Research Council, which
largely advises local authority pension funds, notes that, when fund
managers need to seek trustees' permission to vote, the typical 21-day
notice period offered by most companies is inadequate.
The PIRC has for some time been running a proxy voting service similar to
that newly established by the NAPF. However, the PIRC's bulletins include a
discussion of matters not on the agenda - such as companies' refusal to
offer their executive directors for periodic renomination - and suggests
that shareholders raise the issue with managements.
Meanwhile, Mr John Wilcox, chairman of Georgeson, a US-based investor
relations consultancy, argues that UK laws actually offer far more freedom
to domestic institutions to influence managments than is offered to their US
counterparts. US securities laws, for instance, prevent institutions from
discussing joint courses of action without filing certain documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. 'The barriers to the exercise of power
are much lower here in the UK,' he said.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (17): Morale lift for
boutiques - A move towards specialist managers in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING ODD seems to be going on among trustees when it comes to selecting
pension fund investment managers. Are they, or are they not, abandoning the
traditional UK preference for balanced managers in favour of US-style
specialists? The latest evidence appears to point both ways at once.
Until the late 1980s, British pension schemes not managed internally were
nearly always entrusted to investment houses with a very broad brief - to
invest at their discretion across the spectrum of equities, bonds and cash.
Only property investment, always regarded as something of a law unto itself,
was usually conducted by a specialist manager.
This style of management, which produces a balanced portfolio, is in marked
contrast to the US, where trustees themselves set a specific strategy for
the fund and then hire numbers of specialist managers to carry out different
aspects of the strategy. Only funds too small to warrant splitting up into
separate tranches are generally managed by a broad-spectrum 'balanced'
manager.
By 1990 the UK picture had begun to change sufficiently for the National
Association of Pension Funds' committee of inquiry into investment
performance measurement to take note. In his report, the committee chairman,
Maurice Stonefrost, commented on the 'move towards some specialisation of
managers' briefs (and therefore greater trustee involvement in detailed
asset allocation decisions).'
Mr Stonefrost attributed this in part to the increasing availability of more
detailed disaggregated information on managers' performance in the 'sub sets
of balanced fund portfolios' - for example, in their international
investment portfolios.
He also believed that it reflected regulatory change. The Financial Services
Act, for instance, requires trustees explicitly to define objectives as part
of their contract with managers, because the ultimate responsibility for a
fund's investment risk profile, and therefore broad asset allocation, lies
with the trustees.
That same year, a survey by Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Managers (PDFM) of large
pension schemes, produced some electric figures in support of this view.
Although only 14 per cent used specialist UK equity managers and 20 per cent
used international equity specialists, more than 10 per cent said they were
actively considering such a move.
The enthusiasm with which trustees appeared to be embracing specialists was
a great morale booster for small or new niche managers, who could not hope
to compete across the board with large 'balanced' houses.
One such niche (though hardly small) boutique is Lombard Odier Investment
Management, the London-based fixed income and continental equities
investment arm of the Geneva bank. Paul Abberley, LO's head of fixed income,
explained:
'We are seeing a trend towards funds splitting into a balanced core and
specialist satellites as and when they review the structure of their
operations. There is no reliable data yet, but the shift is quite strong
whenever trustees undertake their reviews.'
Even the established houses are prepared to concede that they may soon face
competition from specialists. However, Chris Cheetham, director of
investment strategy at the Prudential, warned that Mr Stonefrost may have
overstated the change.
'We are seeing the growth of specialisation,' said Mr Cheetham, 'but it
won't reach US proportions.' Today his caution seems more than justified. A
second survey carried out by PDFM in 1991 showed little growth in the
numbers of specialists actually hired. But, more important, the number of
trustees actively considering their use had dropped sharply to under 4 per
cent.
And the initial figures from the 1992 survey, which will be published in the
summer, are nearly identical to last year's. If PDFM's figures are reliable,
'the move from balanced to specialist, which most commentators expected to
accelerate, appears to have come to a very sharp stop.'
PDFM can throw little light on the turnround, although they speculate that
there may be three factors at work:
1, The difficulty of controlling asset allocation within a specialist
structure;
2, The difficulty of coping with innovation in a rigid specialist structure
(except by adding more and more specialists); and
3, Lack of evidence of any improvement in performance.
If trustees have abandoned their shift to specialists on the basis of poor
performance over just two years, this will disappoint Mr Stonefrost's
committee, which strongly advised that performance should be measured
against a background of no less than five years.
But it may be that PDFM's surveying equipment is not sensitive enough for
what is going on. Lombard Odier, for example, has noticed a shift from
balanced to regional bond and equity portfolios as updated computer
facilities have introduced trustees to tactical asset allocation techniques.
This in turn, they say, has meant that trustees who used to 'employ more
than one balanced manager, now farm out the asset allocation decision to
these professionals who in turn appoint a growing number of specialists'.
Thus, in one sense, the trustees can still claim to be running balanced
funds while simultaneously promoting the growth of specialists.
PDFM's antennae have been able to pick up another curious fact: a clear
tendency for larger schemes to go the specialist route, sometimes by
appointing an internal specialist. It is possible that the internalising
process may have taken the place of overt external specialisation to the
point where the slow growth of external specialists does not tell the true
story.
If that is so, it suggests that trustees want to have their cake and eat it,
carrying out specialist techniques under a balanced label.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (15): Consultants blamed
for short-term view - Manager selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PIGS MIGHT fly,' said a leading fund manager wistfully, considering the
demise of the pensions consulting industry.
The role played by pension fund consultants does little to soothe fund
managers who complain bitterly of the so-called 'beauty parade', which has
become a ritual of the selection process. The fund managers claim that
consultants urge clients to switch managers simply to justify their own
positions.
Worst of all, fund managers say, the role of consultants has caused pension
funds to take too short a time-horizon into account when considering the
performance of managers.
Mr Robert Baker, a senior consultant in the asset planning department at the
actuarial and consulting firm of Mercer Fraser, said that he urged pension
fund clients to look at performance over at least a three-year period.
Recently, he said, Mercer Fraser had conducted some research, and discovered
that the top performers for one three-year period were unlikely to achieve
that status in the following three-year period.
Also, he said, pension funds should spend more time trying to understand the
investment objectives of the fund managers they choose. When circumstances
were particularly adverse for that strategy, performance would suffer for a
time.
'What happens if a good firm goes through a bad patch - what happens if
their style goes out of favour?' Mr Baker said. He generally urges clients
to stick with the fund manager so that, when the pendulum swings back again,
the client will benefit from the upside. This has particularly been the case
in the recession when fund managers specialising in small companies or
recovery stocks have been hard hit.
Also, he argues, pension fund trustees do not spend enough time selecting a
fund manager, even when they are advised by a consultant. 'The beauty parade
is a very bad way of picking a manager,' he said.
Mr Baker urges trustees, instead of inviting managers in to make a
presentation, to visit the fund manager's own premises and see how he runs
his business.
But not all consultants have the same long-term time horizon, fund managers
complain.
'These guys have set themselves up as judge, jury and executioner of fund
managers. They earn fees for conducting searches, and its in their interest
to shuffle the pack periodically,' said one investment director.
The tension between the two groups is palpable. The power of pension
consultants is such that fund managers are unwilling to speak candidly about
them publicly, for fear that their views will damage future business
prospects. But even they grudgingly admit that the consultants play a
valuable role.
'We brought the consultants upon ourselves by being too complacent,' said
one.
The fund managers say there is wide variation in the quality of consultants,
with most of the large actuarial consulting firms winning generally high
marks for thorough research and sensible guidance.
However, less well-known consultants, seen as more keen for the business,
attract the greatest ire. 'I've been asked to fill out a 100-page
questionnaire, only a small portion of which was sent on to the client,'
said one fund manager, complaining that consultants, too, often stand
between fund managers and their clients.
'Its a kind of a love-hate relationship,' said an official of the
Institutional Fund Managers Association.
And fund managers' insistence on displaying their own performance records in
the most flattering light - to the complete confusion of potential clients -
has only hastened the rise of an industry whose job it is to peer through
the hyperbole to get at the performance below.
In recognition of this, the National Association of Pension Funds last year
produced an advertising code of conduct designed to coerce fund managers to
standardise the way they advertised their track records. Among other things,
it urges the display of a five-year time horizon.
But even if comparison of performance becomes a simpler matter for the
layman, fund managers and consultants agree that the average pension fund
trustee is often badly equipped to make manager selections on his own.
'There is caveat emptor in the selection of fund managers, and that's where
we come in,' said Mr Baker.
He believes that tensions between investment managers and consultants may
have increased in recent years, as consultants have taken on some of the
tasks - especially that of asset allocation  - previously within the strict
remit of fund managers.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised about the role that pension fund
consultants have played in directing larger and larger sums into the hands
of just a few major fund managers. A recent study of pension funds by the
100 Group of Finance Directors, representing the UK's largest companies,
found that just six fund managers and five internally-managed pension funds
accounted for over half the funds surveyed. The survey covered roughly a
third of the Pounds 300bn in UK pension funds.
'You have to have a track record to attract new business,' Mr Baker said.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (14): Caution still needed
 -Property yields remain high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN THIS business you have to take the rough with the smooth. And last year
was rough, believe me.' Thus Tom Heyes, head of ICI's pension funds,
commenting on the market for investment property. He does not exaggerate.
In mid-1989, average property yields took off vertically and did not stop
rising until the last quarter of 1991, by when they were 30 per cent higher.
Since then the decline from this all-time historic peak of 10.2 per cent has
been barely measurable. Statistics from the Richard Ellis Monthly Index
suggest that yields may have dipped to 9.9 per cent by the year end. No
lower.
Little wonder, therefore, that fund managers with the decades of experience
of Mr Heyes are still advocating 'a great deal of caution', and categorise
some sectors (notably offices) and regions (particularly the City of London)
as disaster zones. New funds, which may have bought within the past five
years at yields above 7 per cent, would have taken a bad enough hit if
forced to sell properties last year. But pity those whose holdings go back a
decade or more to the days when yields were under 5 per cent.
Yet Mr Heyes and his counterparts at the other gigantic pension funds remain
philosophical, and continue to believe that large funds should maintain an
exposure to property, if only as a diversification from the dominance of
equities in their portfolios.
Outsiders will note that the large funds have little choice but to hold on.
When times are hard, the property market dries up, its illiquidity making
sales extremely difficult.
That illiquidity, coupled with the fact that properties come in expensive
lumps and require skilled and continuous management, is also the reason why
significant property holdings are not really suitable for smaller funds
(Jones Lang Wootton estimates that a fund needs a minimum of Pounds 15-20m
in a property portfolio to give it reasonable diversity).
With such different factors operating at either end of the scale, the
statistics for pension fund property exposure need careful interpretation.
Overall, they show a very significant run down in exposure. From a high of
19 per cent in 1974, average pension fund property holdings were only 7 per
cent of total assets last year, according to the Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management annual figures. Many funds had no exposure at all. But that
probably disguises the tendency for smaller funds to avoid going into the
sector and/or to sell those smallish holdings which they had already bought.
Independent figures reinforce the experience of JLW's in-house fund managers
(whose clients are almost exclusively in the middle to large bracket) that
large funds entered 1992 with property holdings amounting to between 8 and
12 per cent of their total assets.
It is more difficult to draw a line through the different claims about
current strategies. Malcolm Naish, a partner of JLW's fund management arm,
says that more of his clients are today increasing their holdings if they
have fallen below 10 per cent, than allowing them to continue to shrink.
But other fund managers are adamant that they have no new money going into
property at the present time. There may be a number of reasons for this:
some have little or no new money arriving for any form of investment, as
redundancy programmes continue to erode the number of contributors and
cash-strapped companies gratefully take contribution holidays on the back of
the outperformance of the late 1980s. Others are robbing Peter to pay Paul:
that is, selling one form of investment (or property sector) to buy another.
According to the latest in PDFM's Pension Fund Indicators series (whose
publication should coincide with the National Association of Pension Funds
conference) the tentative conclusion is that some net new money - about 4
per cent - was allocated to property last year, compared with the net 2 per
cent disinvestment in 1990.
The trend remains to be confirmed later this year and will bear close
examination. For anecdotal evidence suggests fund managers have become
highly selective in the forays into the property market.
Although many, like the Prudential's pension fund management arm, now
believe that the drop in property values has now been sufficient to
compensate for the poor outlook for rental growth, they are still wary of
the office market overall, and of the City's prospects in particular.
Tom Heyes reserves real enthusiasm only for smallish retail units where
demand has already begun to pick up. 'In the cathedral towns, there are five
buyers for every Pounds 2m shopping centre investment,' he observes.
In previous downturns in the UK cycle, British fund managers have been able
to turn their sights abroad. This time the range of sparkling opportunities
is small. The US is in a worse state than the UK, and may take more than
five years to find its feet again. Forget Japan. Too many investors are
trampling over one another in Berlin, though that is taking some of the
pressure off Frankfurt. France is at best flat. Some are beginning to look
again at Spain. As for east Europe, it's a case of: 'After you. . . No,
after you, sir.'
Jones Lang Wootton may accurately have pinpointed the turning point when
British fund managers regained their appetite for property in the home
market, but they are scarcely ravenous.
When a pensions manager on the scale of the Prudential - which dramatically
reduced the numbers in its property department in 1990 - now talks of a
mixed programme of sales and purchases but makes no moves to increase staff
numbers, it speaks volumes for the expected future exposure to property.
Property unit trusts, the once-popular vehicle for funds too small to
consider direct property holdings, have also fallen from favour as a result
of a decade of under-performance. However, Medidian Funds Management, the
global investment arm of NML, the Australian insurance group noted for its
consciously counter-cyclical approach, will begin marketing this month a
planned DM1bn closed-end European Property Fund, to be launched in
September. The success of that launch may offer a pointer to whether mutual
funds can be revived.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (12): Holidays reduce the
flow of new money - Charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN THE current level of fierce competition in the fund management
industry, pension funds ought to be in a better position than ever to get
the service they want at attractive prices.
Competition for pension fund management mandates has been heightened by,
among other things, the recent surge of non-UK houses into the market. Major
US firms, offering their expertise in index-matching and 'active
quantitative' approaches to investment, have aggressively sought to mark out
their stake in the pensions market.
But also, competition has been heightened by a shrinking pie. The past three
years' recession has caused so many companies to seek 'contributions
holidays' from their pension funds that, in fact, pension funds under
management in 1991 actually experienced a net outflow of roughly Pounds
2.5bn, according to figures compiled by Caps, the pension fund performance
measurement service.
Only 30 per cent of funds surveyed by Caps in 1991 had any new money to
invest over the year. Since fund managers' fees are expressed as a
percentage of funds under management, the shrinkage in pension pools hits
them in the pocket.
Mr Rob Collinge, director of compensation and benefits at SmithKline
Beecham, said he had recently renegotiated management contracts with a
number of his outside fund managers which, to his surprise, had resulted in
lower charges for some. 'I was surprised at how successful we were,' he
said, explaining that several of the managers involved had strong
performance records and no shortage of clients.
The problem with competition, he said, was that those fund managers with
mediocre performance records were the ones most willing to cut fees. 'But
for us, a few basis points of improved performance can far outweigh the
advantages of slightly lower fees,' he added.
The shrinkage has caused a pinch for investment managers who have now had to
work harder to secure mandates away from their competitors. However, it has
also provided the incentive for managers to find ways to cull fees from
clients in ways which are not immediately obvious. Indeed, at least one US
bank was said to have been offering its index-matching fund management
services for no fee at all - provided the clients used the bank's global
custody service.
The use of hidden - or so-called 'dirty' charges  - is an issue that has
troubled pension fund trustees for a long time. But in recent years,
publicity surrounding charges and the ensuing calls for regulators to do
something about them has made trustees look even harder at them. Indeed, the
National Association of Pension Funds has formed a committee on fee
transparency, to examine dirty charges and make recommendations to members
about how to deal with them.
Pure charges on pension fund pools range from 0.2 to 0.5 per cent for
balanced pools, depending on the size of funds under management. However,
segregated pools or specialist and overseas accounts incur transaction
charges of up to 1 per cent and additional charges above that, depending on
circumstances.
By international standards, particularly those of the US, UK pension fund
management charges come cheap. In the US, fees can easily average 1.5 to 2
per cent, partly reflecting the wider use of specialist and boutique-type
fund managers.
But it is the hidden charges that are the bone of contention in the UK. The
most significant of these are 'soft commissions' - the provision of services
in kind to fund managers who transact a pre-agreed level of
commission-generating business through a broker.
Last month, the Securities and Investments Board, after vacillating for
months over the matter, declined to outlaw soft commissions, on the grounds
that fund managers can use them legitimately to obtain services which
ultimately enhance returns to clients. However, it has required fund
managers who accept soft commissions to begin disclosing the extent of these
to clients. Among services typically received by fund managers in exchange
for soft commissions are research, data retrieval systems and software
packages.
Because all commissions costs are deducted from the clients' total funds
under management, effectively, it is one way of shifting overheads to
clients from fund managers.
Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, partner at pensions consultants and actuaries Bacon and
Woodrow, said that there was no good reason for pension fund managers to pay
soft commissions. 'Commissions are a voluntary cost, because many fund
managers are able to negotiate transactions with no commission whatsoever,'
he said. 'The only reason I can see for paying soft commission is to hide
the charges from the customer.'
In the US, where disclosure rules have been in place for some time, pension
funds are increasingly demanding that soft commission payments be rebated to
them by the managers which accept them.
Also, fund managers are able to add on dirty charges by placing client funds
in internal unit trusts, which carry charges of 0.5 to 0.75 per cent. While
these are typically used for overseas assets, managers are often inclined to
place clients with pools below Pounds 10m in domestic unit trusts as well.
Mr Fitzpatrick says that he urges clients to seek 'clean' charging
structures wherever possible. While these rarely mean lower costs for
pension funds, they do clarify exactly what the service costs. In a clean
structure, a client may not be charged for anything but the service fee.
Mr Collinge said that almost all his fund management agreements were now
'clean'. 'Its a cost control mechanism - we know what we are paying,' he
said.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (11): Trust deeds may need
amendment - Increased understanding of derivatives is paying off

   UK PENSION funds are starting to make use of futures and options
</DATELINE>

but slowly. Concern about the inherent risks remains a deterrent, but other
issues also counter the shift towards derivatives.
Trustees can prove resistant, particularly when they are not certain how to
assess the use of such products, and fund managers themselves may be unsure
how to report performance. However, efforts to broaden understanding of
futures and options among both fund managers and trustees are starting to
pay off.
According to a recent survey by KPMG Management Consulting, five out of the
10 top UK pension fund organisations use futures and options in more than 25
per cent of their funds - an increase on last year, when eight out of the 10
funds surveyed used futures and options in less than a quarter of funds
managed. However, the use of derivative products is far less widespread
among smaller organisations.
themselves aware of the benefits which might be derived from using futures
and options,' said Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the National Association
of Pension Funds' investment committee.
But from that starting point, the journey is not always straightforward.
Once fund managers have decided to adopt futures and options, they must in
turn convince trustees of the advantages.
Trust deeds can prove a further pitfall.
'Check your trust deeds. Do not do anything unless you are empowered to do
it,' advises Mr Clive Gilchrist, managing director of BES Trustees and vice
president of the NAPF. 'If you want to play the game, learn the rules.'
Some trust deeds specify which investments are not permitted; others define
which investments are allowed. In the latter case, unless derivative
products are specifically included, the trust deeds have to be changed.
Some important barriers have been removed, however. Crucially, fund
managers' tax position was clarified in the 1990 budget. Although there was
no dramatic shift in attitudes, fund managers started to look at the market
seriously after the tax change.
There has been progress on other issues, such as performance measurement. A
recent set of recommendations by the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange (Liffe) for the reporting of financial futures and
options in investment portfolios, provides an industry standard for the
first time. The guidelines will allow trustees to assess more easily whether
fund managers are using futures and options for investment or hedging
purposes, or whether they are taking more speculative positions.
'(These recommendations) will lead to a better understanding of the uses of
these instruments, higher standards of reporting and more consistent
performancecalculations,' said Mr Tim Gardener, head of planning services at
Mercer Fraser, the actuarial consultancy firm commissioned to write the
report.
The educational effort by Liffe, which has run seminars with the NAPF for
trustees, has fostered interest in derivative products.
Where fund managers are using futures and options, their application is
generally quite restricted. For the most part, UK fund managers do not
regard futures and options as a separate asset class, but as part of the
underlying asset class. (For example, a stock option is essentially an
equity asset, not an option.)
Derivative products are 'part of the armoury', says Mr Gilchrist. While a
few US pension funds have started to allocate part of their funds to
specialised managed futures funds, there are no signs of a similar trend in
the UK. Managed futures fund managers consider futures an asset class in
their own right, representing a diversification of portfolio risk.
'The idea of trying to persuade pension fund trustees to put a pot of money
into a dedicated futures fund is very far away,' said Mr Peter Stanyer, head
of investment for British Rail pensions. So far, futures fund managers and
specialist trading advisers (particularly US-based commodity trading
advisers, or CTAs) have been marketing UK pension fund managers to little
avail. The poor performance of futures funds this year is unlikely to
encourage any change of heart.
Most pension funds use futures and options in two ways: to hedge exposure -
that is, to reduce potential losses on cash holdings by taking a contrary
position in the futures market; and for asset allocation - to shift exposure
from one market to another. These uses come under the concept of efficient
portfolio management, under Securities and Investment Board rules.
A future obliges the holder to buy or sell at a set price at a future date;
an option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell
at a set price at a set date. Futures are of particular use in asset
allocation, while options can be used for stock selection.
The use of derivatives for asset allocation is attractive, because buying
and selling large holdings of stocks or bonds can be both time-consuming and
expensive. It is often cheaper and more efficient to shift exposure by, for
example, buying FT-SE index future contracts and holding a cash deposit, so
creating a synthetic equity asset.
There is a growing use of index products on foreign markets, which is likely
to increase as portfolios become more international. Funds which aim to
match the performance of stock indices often use index futures rather than
stocks.
Because UK pension funds are broadly UK equity-based, they have so far been
most active in Liffe's FT-SE contracts. Liffe's gilt futures are also widely
used. They are less active in individual stock options, but if the market
picks up following the merger of the Liffe and the London Traded Options
market earlier this year, activity could increase.
UK pension funds remain for the most part resistant to over-the-counter
products offered by banks, partly because of the credit implications, and
also because they fear such products will lack liquidity.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (13): New code agreed -
Performance measurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION FUND performance measurement has moved into a new era this year,
with the publication of a code which has the backing of many pension
industry interests. But, ironically, the whole idea of league tables and
performance comparisons could be undermined by a slowly emerging trend
towards individual fund benchmarks.
Performance measurement is now a highly developed service, which has become
concentrated into two main specialist operations. One is the World Markets
company, which started as a soft commissions venture of a stockbroking firm
but is now owned by Bankers Trust, the US commercial banking group. The
other is Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) which, as its name
suggests, is the result of merging the separate measurement service of
various actuarial firms such as R Watson, Bacon &amp; Woodrow, Mercer Fraser and
Noble Lowndes.
WM is the market leader in terms of the size of funds measured. Last year
its WM All Funds Universe consisted of over 2,000 UK pension fund portfolios
worth Pounds 241bn, said to represent about three-quarters of the industry.
Caps measured rather more portfolios, at 2,760, but a rather smaller
aggregate of Pounds 156bn.
While Caps has a slightly smaller - although clearly overlapping - coverage,
in some respects its funds are more typical of the industry. The WM results
tend to be affected by the performance of a few huge funds which may have
rather different characteristics, such as a significantly higher investment
in property. The WM Universe had an 8 per cent property content in its
aggregated portfolio last year, against only 2 per cent for Caps.
However, the performance of property can be separated out. Moreover, WM now
also divides its funds into the WM Very Large Funds Universe, worth over
Pounds 1bn each, and the WM Average Funds Universe.
A dismal property market meant that the giant funds did worse than average
in 1991. The WM Very Large Funds earned an average rate of return of 16.2
per cent (income plus capital growth) compared with 17.8 per cent for the WM
Average Funds.
Meanwhile, the Caps median fund earned 18.3 per cent including property, and
18.6 per cent excluding it.
Despite an element of harmonisation within the past year or two, the WM and
Caps services retain slight technical differences. WM tends to talk about
averages, and Caps about medians, for instance. But these are of little
consequence, and there will be no repetition of the minor embarrassment two
years ago, when the rate of return on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index for
was measured as 36.1 per cent by WM and 35.5 per cent by Caps. The
discrepancy related to the timing of dividend receipts. For 1991, however,
both services measure the All-Share return as 20.7 per cent.
Possibly the methodology still needs to be refined in specialist areas such
as index-tracking funds. Last year, for instance, the presence of a
significant element of recently-privatised stocks within the All-Share
tended to flatter the index funds, because they held these shares in
partly-paid form, and outperformed because prices rose. However, such
details may be a matter for interpretation rather than changes in technique.
At any rate, a code of practice for both methodology and the presentation of
historical performance records has now been agreed. The code was developed
because of complaints that performance measurement figures have been misused
by fund managers, particularly when soliciting for new business.
There has been a tendency to choose funds selectively for inclusion in the
records, and to pick particular periods, indices or measurers. Fund managers
have developed a kind of Orwellian tendency to rewrite history, notably by
dropping poorly-performing funds from their records, on various pretexts.
Accordingly, a National Association of Pension Funds inquiry in 1990
recommended the establishment of a voluntary code; and the simple outline of
the code has now been published by a working party, which included the
representatives of various industry bodies.
A further working group has been set up to monitor compliance with the code,
and consider how it might be further developed in the future.
Already many investment management houses have
begun issuing figures which they certify to be in accordance with the code.
This means, inter alia, that the standard performance presentation should
cover five calendar years, should include all discretionary balanced funds
under management, and must state the name of the measurer.
At the very least, the industry is therefore now developing a standard
format for performance data. But there remain some grey areas, particularly
in the selection of funds and the definition of 'discretion' as applied to
management mandates.
From next year, however, the performance league tables which have been
appearing in various journals and consulting actuaries' circulars will have
a little more credibility, although gaps may remain. The biggest pension
fund manager, Mercury Asset Management, has refused to publish any aggregate
figures, probably because it fears that clients underperforming the
published house median would complain.
Moreover, the whole idea of developing comparable performance statistics may
be torpedoed by a trend towards the setting of individual performance
benchmarks by pension funds. In time, the idea of discretionary balanced
management may fade away.
Already, WM has divided its Universe into two. In future, the measurers may
need to set up a series of specialist universes (global equities, say, and
international bonds, or UK index trackers). Beyond that, increasing numbers
of funds may give their managers individual briefs in terms of investment
risk and return in relation to specific scheme liabilities.
It could be that the industry league table could will begin to lose its
relevance almost as soon as it has emerged into statistical daylight.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (9): Opportunities for
overseas players - Japan's rapidly ageing population will oblige funds to
place greater emphasis on performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION FUND management in Japan, traditionally the exclusive territory of
Japanese life assurers and trust banks, is changing as the emphasis in fund
management appointments shifts towards performance.
The shift in attitudes is expected to provide opportunities for foreign
companies, which have been unhappy with the limitations due to appointments
ruled by the complex and cosy corporate networks.
The recent appointment of Invesco MIM Asset Management, the Japanese arm of
the UK asset management group, by Nagasakiya, a leading retail company, to
manage a portion of its pension funds, came as a surprise to the industry.
Foreign managers have only managed to win appointments from quasi-government
organisations, and Nagasakiya became the first single private Japanese
company to appoint a foreign-based fund manager. Nagasakiya indicated that
it was dissatisfied with the returns of investments by trust banks, and
allotted Y1bn of its Y23.7bn (Dollars 178m) pension fund to Invesco MIM.
Foreign fund managers and more aggressive Japanese managers believe that the
rapid ageing of the country's population will force company funds and the
Japanese government to put more emphasis on performance. Other leading
Japanese companies have also started to indicate interest in allowing
foreign companies, which have more expertise in fund management.
For those companies wishing to diversify their investments internationally,
foreign fund asset managers are attractive, because foreign asset management
companies are permitted to invest up to 70 per cent of assets overseas,
compared with 50 per cent for domestic asset managers.
The weakness of the Tokyo stock market has made Japanese companies wary of
the deployment of funds. The uncertainty over Japanese share prices has made
overseas investments all the more attractive.
Last year, Japan's 1,400 pension fund schemes had Y38,500bn in assets. This
figure is expected to hit Y161,000bn by the year 2000. Public pension funds
and mutual aid programmes boasted another Y127,000bn.
Foreign companies also hope that the government's own concern about the
financial burden of expected demographic changes in Japan will stimulate
further reforms of pension fund management. About 11 per cent of Japanese
are now aged 65 or over, but the ratio is expected to jump to 16 per cent by
2000.
Given such figures, the momentum for pension management reform is mounting.
Asset management firms were allowed limited access to pension fund
management in 1990. Investment advisers were permitted to manage only new
pension contributions in portfolios with a minimum value of Y1bn and up to
one third of total assets.
The finance ministry responded to US pressure last year by allowing foreign
affiliated asset managers to handle pension funds with as little as Y500m in
assets and to hold up to 70 per cent in foreign investments.
SG Warburg, Jardine Fleming and Fidelity were appointed to handle a fraction
of the Pension Fund Association's own account, and part of the
schoolteachers' fund was handed over to Jardine Fleming and Merrill Lynch.
Foreign trust banks, which have been in the pension fund management business
since 1985, now manage Y59bn, of which Y29bn is handled by Bankers Trust.
Mr Noboru Terada, of the Pension Fund Association, says there is a change in
attitude among Japanese companies towards appointing foreign managers.
However, he points out that companies are still worried about the commitment
the fund management company has made to Japan and the efficiency of
administration and reporting procedures.
Mr Haruaki Deguchi, at Nippon Life, Japan's largest life assurer, says that
pension fund management will shift to be more 'western style' in the future.
'Japan's pension fund system is relatively new compared with that of Europe
and the US. As the pension liabilities of companies start growing, managers
will become more severe about investment returns,' he adds.
Corporate pensions have usually been allotted to trust banks in the same
keiretsu (corporate group), or to life assurers which in return would be
buyers of the company's equity in times of fund raising. Until recently,
trust banks held 65 per cent of the market, while life assurers held 35 per
cent. Winning an appointment would be virtually impossible for a
fund-managing company without such links.
This arrangement has started to become a burden for the life insurers. The
slump in share prices and low dividend payments has made long-term
shareholdings unattractive investments. Mr Deguchi says that if companies
start to base fund management relationships on performance, the nature of
the funds will become more unstable. Selling life assurance policies,
roughly 80 per cent of the total funds in the life assurance industry, will
be the main focus of business, rather than pension fund management.
However, changes in Japan do not happen overnight. Objective performance
analysis of the industry has yet to be established, and performance data is
not available to western consulting firms in Tokyo, including Intersec
Research and Frank Russell.
Once the growth in pension liabilities starts to affect a company's profits,
the improvement of return on assets will become a more pressing matter for
the companies. To wait for this to happen may require patience, because it
could be at least another five to 10 years.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (10): Protectionism and
suspicion of equities - A genuinely open market for pensions in Europe is
still some way off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURTAIN on a single European market formally goes up in less than eight
months' time. But so far as pension funds and their managers are concerned,
the long anticipated drama will take rather longer to unfold.
It is not just that the draft EC directive on pension fund freedoms - likely
to be adopted by member states later this year - will not be implemented in
many national legal systems until the mid-1990s. The challenge of securing a
genuinely open market for pensions will only be achieved when cultural
barriers, local protectionism, and continental suspicion of equities as a
suitable investment medium are finally overcome.
Major UK groups, such as Morgan Grenfell Investment Management (part of
Deutsche Bank), Warburg Asset Management and the merchant bank Robert
Fleming, are all chipping away. It seems, however, that some of the UK
investment management industry's earlier expectations of picking up mainland
European business were overdone.
'The European marketing chaps are the ones with the big expense accounts and
glamour lifestyles,' observes an employee in one leading fund management
business, a touch irreverently. 'The amount of money which they have brought
in is pitiful compared with what we can pick up in the UK.'
Signs that the French government, for one, may introduce tax-efficient
money-purchase schemes to take pressure off the state - notwithstanding
recent opposition from unions and others - is one good reason not to lose
heart over Europe. Others are the EC pension fund directive, and pressure
which continues to be exerted on Brussels by multinational companies seeking
a more efficient way of organising their employees' pension arrangements.
Ironically, last October's draft EC pensions directive omitted the freedom
which the likes of IBM would most dearly appreciate, namely cross-border
membership of funds. The Commission insists that it has not abandoned this
principle for the longer term, but acknowledges that the inherent tax
complications could hold up progress on the other morestraightforward
issues.
These are the freedom for pension funds to choose an investment manager
anywhere in the Community, and the removal of national restrictions on where
and how funds should invest their money. Neither of these will fundamentally
alter the UK market per se, but they are highly relevant in countries such
as Belgium and Portugal.
One question constantly raised by the approaching single market and the
reduced currency risk of the exchange rate mechanism is whether the EC
should be seen by pension funds as a single area for investment purposes. At
the end of last year, however, the split of UK to continental European
investments was roughly 6:1, suggesting that old preconceptions die hard.
One measure of the appropriate split, for instance, might be individual
stock market capitalisations, which showed the UK as 42 per cent of total
European stock markets at the end of December 1991. It is not as though
historic performance justifies UK pension funds' bias in favour of their
domestic territory.
Another consideration is whether multinational employers will ultimately
want to take advantage of the possibilities for consolidating the pension
fund assets of their various European subsidiaries. IBM and Digital
Equipment Corporation are among those looking at the options, but Ford Motor
company is among those adopting a more cautious approach. The companies
which are pursuing consolidation plans clearly think that they will be in a
strong position to negotiate a competitive fee structure and reap the
advantages of economies of scale.
Within the EC, there are signs that some pension funds are beginning to look
beyond traditional boundaries for new opportunities - the Dollars 90bn Dutch
civil servants pension fund ABP being one cited by the leading consulting
group Watsons. Wells Fargo Nikko was a beneficiary to the tune of a Dollars
600m account, but generally the sums involved tend to be much smaller as
companies put their toes in the water. Many managers admit that their
continental fees are smaller, not least because of competing local banks'
ability to take advantage of dealing spreads.
The Netherlands is the one market which is recognisable from an Anglo-Saxon
point of view. As Mr Patrick Gifford, a director of Fleming Investment
Management, puts it: 'Everyone in Holland has a funded pension, and the
country is open to non-resident managers.'
At this stage, though, it looks as though Europe's big banks and insurers
are fiercely protecting their patches from the incoming hordes. Another
problem is that the cult of the equity is only slowly catching on, while the
saga of employees dependent for their pensions on companies controlled by
the late Robert Maxwell has hardly advanced the cause. Some have not been
slow to point out that the German system of accounting for pensions on a
company's balance sheet has its advantages after all.
Reaching clients, meanwhile, is not easy, given that the UK's consultant-led
marketing structure is not familiar in continental Europe. Firms such as
Watson and Wyatt have blazed a trail, but they are not retained by companies
in the same way as in the US and the UK.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (7): UK funds hesitate to
leap in the dark - The progress of quantitative management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S QUANT scene is hotting up. A number of new quantitative managers,
such as Pareto Partners, Quorum and Barr Rosenberg European Management, have
opened up, joining the slightly longer-established operators like PanAgora
and GMO Woolley. Many of these have American connections.
Domestic leaders include clearing bank subsidiaries like County NatWest
Investment Management and Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management.
These dominate the basic quant product area of index funds. And there are
clear ambitions on the part of several houses to move into higher value
added sectors, involving active, rather than passive, management, for which
much higher fees can be charged. But British pension funds appear to be
rather cautious.
Quant managers seek to exploit electronic technology and statistical
analysis to achieve enhanced investment performance.
Index management is still in a growth phase. Its characteristic is that it
involves large economies of scale so that, untypically of investment
management in general, indexation has become concentrated amongst a few
large players.
The UK market leader is BZWIM, which has been putting on new business at the
rate of Pounds 1bn or more annually for the past few years. It now runs
almost Pounds 10bn in indexed portfolios tracking various equity and bond
indices.
It is estimated that about 15 per cent of the assets of UK pension funds are
now indexed, formally or informally. There is still some way to go to reach
the US indexed proportion of more like 25 per cent; the US penetration has
changed little for five years, suggesting that it represents something of a
natural ceiling, which may also eventually apply in the UK.
Indexation is a cheap, low-risk option for pension fund trustees
disappointed by traditional active managers. This is no strategy for
trustees aiming to top the performance league tables, but it has obvious
appeal for those fed up with featuring in the fourth quartile.
For more ambitious clients, however, the quants have plenty of
second-generation products. Some of these are bottom-up stockpicking
systems, which aim to add several percentage points a year to investment
performance without adding risk. There has also been a lot of emphasis
recently on top-down models to control tactical asset allocation -
basically, bond-equity switching  - and handle currency exposures for global
portfolios.
County NatWest has found UK pension fund clients for its Value-Based
Investment Service, an asset allocation system. But generally its more
advanced and weirdly-named products, like Dynamic Currency Hedging and
Ratcheted Multi-Bond Option (call it Rambo for short), are only selling in
Japan and the US.
Japanese houses have become quite keen on quant. Nikko's London asset
management arm, for instance, has this year launched a so-called Return
Reversal Fund, aimed at exploiting stock rotation effects in the Tokyo
market. But it has not been fortunate with its timing.
Several of the US-owned houses in London are basically selling global
products back into America. Pareto, which has only been running for about a
year, but is backed by Mellon Bank, has already won over Dollars 2bn of
currency overlay business, mainly from US pension funds.
Mr Ronald Liesching, a director of Pareto, suggests that many US
institutions may already have becoming disillusioned with 'black box'
stockpicking products, some of which have had enough time to go wrong for
American clients. 'Those approaches which have been devised to fit history
are shortly doomed to join it,' he says.
In the UK, he adds, quant is only making very slow progress. In fact, there
are signs that continental European clients are more receptive, being ready
to make the quantum leap from low-performing life assurance contracts or
Swiss bank fiduciary accounts to state-of-the-art high technology investment
products. In contrast, British pension funds have generally received
excellent returns from traditional balanced managers in the 1980s, and have
little reason to take a leap in the dark.
Barr Rosenberg is nevertheless trying to sell to UK as well as continental
funds, seeking to exploit the poor relative performance achieved by British
managers in US and Japanese equities.
Ms Jennie Paterson, the firm's marketing director in London, tends to play
down the technological wizardry. She describes Barr Rosenberg's method as
'using an expert computer system to duplicate the thought processes of the
typical investment manager'. British pension funds have been 'very receptive
to the idea' but have yet to sign up.
Certainly, active quant has had an uncertain reception in the UK. There was
the example of Lazard Investors, which imported an American value-based
system in the late 1980s just when growth stocks were beginning to take off
and value stocks wilted. Lazard dumped the system at the end of 1990 in
favour of a traditional style, with which apparently it has enjoyed
considerable success.
Nevertheless, some active quant products have begun to achieve a
breakthrough. Hill Samuel Investment Management, for instance, a few weeks
ago picked up a Pounds 50m account from the Cable and Wireless pension fund.
It will run the UK equity portfolio, using its established quant product
called Active Value Management.
HSIM has now built up a five-year record for AVM, outperforming the
All-Share Index return by some 4 per cent a year on average, albeit with
some significant short-term fluctuations. AVM portfolios now total Pounds
360m.
Mr Alan Greenhorn, HSIM's quant director, says: 'Many quantitative managers
are single-factor strategists. With AVM, we do not expect any one strategy
to be successful for ever.' Various tilts have been used in practice over
the five years, starting with high asset value, then moving to high overseas
earners, with a recent shift from high to medium market capitalisation.
This restless search for new values and insights could be said to be true of
quant management as a whole. And with computer brainpower and memory
capacity becoming ever cheaper, no traditional manager can afford to ignore
the trend.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (8): Futures gain
respectability - US funds are beginning to diversify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIND of change is blowing through the huge pension fund industry in the
US.
For years, there has been much talk of portfolio diversification,
particularly into international stocks and bonds, and correspondingly little
action. Now, industry observers believe some real developments are taking
place.
For example, Greenwich Associates, the Connecticut-based consultancy, has
noted recently* that 'the proportion of funds using smaller capitalisation
stocks, international stocks and international bonds is up sharply'.
Extrapolating from its annual survey of the 2,000 largest tax-exempt pension
funds and endowments, with a projected Dollars 2,200bn in plan assets, the
firm suggests that the percentage of funds using small capitalisation stocks
last year was up from 48 to 54 per cent; for international stocks, from 38
to 44 per cent; and for international bonds, from 15 to 17 per cent.
This, adds Greenwich Consultants, may only be the beginning. Its consultant,
Joe Purcell, notes that an additional 6 per cent of pension funds plan to
start using small cap stocks in 1992; another 13 per cent plan to start
using international stocks; and another 5 per cent plan to start using
international bonds. The figures in last category, he says, represent 'a
particularly large leap relative to the proportion already using such
bonds'.
The last point is pertinent. The use of international equities, say, in US
pension fund portfolios may be on the rise, but it still accounts for a very
small proportion of total assets - perhaps 4.4 per cent among all funds,
with a rather higher 5.8 per cent in corporate funds and under 3 per cent in
public funds.
Still, boldness seems to be becoming fairly endemic. A good deal of
attention has focused recently on the increasing willingness of large public
pension funds to commit funds to the often-volatile futures market.
This is progressive thinking, by anyone's reckoning. Convention dictates
that futures are a risky game for large public pension funds. Some states,
including New York, even go so far as to prohibit the investment of public
pension money in futures contracts.
But, such prudence notwithstanding, there is a growing school of thought
within the industry which believes that forays into the financial futures
arena at least, will become commonplace for public pension funds in the
decade ahead, and that funds which reject this notion will be denying their
beneficiaries the chance of significant additional returns.
Still, no matter how advanced a pension fund trustee's thinking, the road to
diversification can be littered with all kinds of problems. For example,
much attention centred on the hiccups encountered by the Californian State
Teachers Retirement System, the Dollars 34bn state teachers' pension fund,
as it tried to invest Dollars 1.5bn in foreign stocks last spring.
California has particularly tough affirmative-action laws. Among other
things, these require state contractors - including money managers  - to set
goals of subcontracting with women and minority-owned firms for goods and
services equal to one-fifth of the fees which they receive from the state.
When the state pension fund invited money managers to submit applications to
handle the international diversification, it found that only 36 of the 91
firms chasing the contract had met the affirmative-action law requirements.
Indeed, to a money management business based overseas the affirmative-action
requirements might seem almost impossible to fulfil.
Such hassles aside, the current move towards more diversified portfolios
contrasts sharply with the demand for passive equity management, or
indexation. In 1990, the proportion of total funds using passive equities
stood at 41 per cent. Last year, the figure fell to 36 per cent. Total funds
which expect to start using passive equities in 1991 stood at 6 per cent,
unchanged from the previous year.
Overall, it is currently reckoned that index funds account for about one
quarter of US pension funds total assets.
Finally, it is interesting to note that the proportion of US employees
actually covered by corporate pension funds is steadily declining, although
assets handled by such funds have tripled over the past decade, thanks
largely to the rise in market levels. It has been estimated, for instance,
that only 43 per cent of workers participated in US company pension plans
last year, compared with a peak of 49 per cent in 1979.
This receding coverage has been variously attributed to the anti-union
climate, a declining role for low-paid blue-collar workers who would have
had pension coverage in the past, and the associated expansion of small
business jobs. But whatever the cause, it is scarcely a comforting
development - for employees or fund managers.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): Erisa might be a
welcome transatlantic hurricane - Was Maxwell uniquely crooked, or are all
funds vulnerable to criminal damage?  The possible legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE scale of Mr Robert Maxwell's plundering of his companies' pension
funds became clear, the entire UK pensions industry caught its breath.
Not unnaturally, thousands of individual pension scheme members began asking
whether their own investments were safe from a similar theft. A previously
quiet backwater of pensions management was swamped by a wave of interest.
Suddenly, a parliamentary committee was probing the arcane world of pension
fund security and asset administration. It produced a report which
highlighted the gaps in pension fund security. Pensioners and scheme members
alike began to question the ultimate ownership of pension fund assets. Who
controls funds, and what limits are there on the investment and transfer of
assets?
It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that pension funds are at the centre of a
passionate debate among rival groups of financial intermediaries. The
question is whether Maxwell was uniquely crooked, or whether all funds are
vulnerable to criminal damage. One school of thought believes that a few
simple changes in rules governing fund trustees should suffice to make the
Maxwell affair unrepeatable. Another school thinks changes need to be
widespread.
In particular, the aftermath of the Maxwell affair has been a tense time for
fund trustees and fund managers. It is too early to predict whether
legislation will follow the rush of interest, but it seems likely the
pressure for reform will not disappear.
Legislation could be modelled on US laws passed in 1974. The Employee
Retirement Investment Security Act (Erisa) demanded the separation of fund
management from the custody of the assets, and completely redrafted US
pension fund law. If anything like it were adopted in the UK, it would
overturn decades of self-administration and regulation by London's fund
management community. It would also blow like a hurricane through the arcane
world of the fund trustee.
Erisa made it compulsory for fund trustees (known in the US as plan
sponsors) to demonstrate in an annual report that they had managed their
fund prudently.
In addition, it meant that funds would have to appoint a so-called master
custodian or trustee, to oversee the fulfilment of its requirements, by
providing appropriate records and adequate security against prohibited
transactions.
Indirectly, the prudent investment principle enshrined in Erisa led to
diversification outside the US by its massive pension plans. And the plan
sponsors' need for better information led to huge investment by their banks
in the administrative and reporting systems which became the core of the
global custody product.
Although UK fund managers are often at one remove from administration of the
assets they invest, some of the UK's largest houses do their own safe
custody and are substantial players in the custody business in their own
right.
Erisa-style legislation would require them to pass that function to external
specialists.
That might sound undramatic, but it would have far-reaching implications,
not least for costs. The fund managers might not have the option of setting
up their own subsidiaries to take over the custodial function - Erisa
specifies that the custodian must be an entirely independent entity.
Thus, the recent creation by SG Warburg, for example, of a custody division
separated from its Mercury Asset Management subsidiary, would be made
redundant - it would still have to be sold or closed. Fees would inevitably
rise.
Small wonder that the commercial banks, particularly the large US banks
which specialise in custody and trustee services, have been aggressively
marketing their products to nervous trustee boards of UK pension funds. For
the custodians at least, Maxwell has provided a welcome marketing
opportunity.
A notable example was a seminar on pension fund security held by Chase
Manhattan in February, at which Mr Colin Grimsey, managing director, said:
'I have no doubt that changes in legislation will present significant
challenges and opportunities for custodian banks.'
Mr Grimsey, one of the pioneers of global custody, also made a prediction:
'Whatever the outcome of anticipated legislative changes, there is little
doubt that the role of the independent professional trustee will be
expanded.'
The fund management community is not so sure. It has produced a series of
defensive measures, notably a letter published in the Financial Times from
the chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers' Association. He argued that
the IFMA would broadly welcome any strengthening of restrictions on
self-investment, as well greater powers for trustees.
But the letter went on to point out that wholesale changes along the lines
described above would be expensively aimed at the wrong target. The UK
pension industry as a whole has functioned safely for decades without
over-elaborate restrictions.
That is a view shared by Michael Robarts, a director of Robert Fleming
Investment Management. He points out to the example of local authority
pension funds. Only when the notorious Hammersmith &amp; Fulham swaps case
focused attention on local authority funds did it emerge that the rules
governing them were so narrowly written as to make questionable even the
appointment of external fund managers. Local authorities have largely
withdrawn from stock-lending markets, because some legal opinion suggests
such transactions are disallowed.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): Bonds may prevail,
unless the ERM crumbles - After a decade of exceptional real returns,
short-term prospects are less encouraging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES' emphatic election victory may be about to deliver UK
investors into a promised land of low and stable inflation; but no one is
quite sure how the investment landscape will change as the UK adjusts to
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
The real returns earned by UK pension funds on their equity portfolios over
the past decade have been exceptional. The average annual nominal return on
UK equities over the 10 years to the end of 1991 was 19.6 per cent.
Deflated by the average earnings index, which is the best indicator of the
change in their liabilities, this implies a real return of 11.3 per cent on
UK equities, compared with 6.3 per cent on UK fixed-interest securities and
 1 per cent on index-linked gilts. Little wonder, then, that UK pension
funds have both accumulated large surpluses in recent years and orientated
their portfolios towards equities.
But the short-term prospects for real returns do not look so encouraging.
The rate of economic growth is the most important long-run determinant of
real returns on equity investments. But current tensions within the ERM, and
the pain of adjustment to a low inflation regime, may depress real equity
returns over the next few years.
The total return on equity investments is equal to the dividend yield plus
the capital gain. The capital gain depends, in turn, on the expected future
stream of profits. Assuming that the share of profits in national income
remains stable, the main determinant of real profitability, and thus the
long-term real return on equity investments, is the real growth rate of the
economy.
History confirms the central role of GDP growth in determing long-run real
returns, according to a recent paper from Lombard Street Research. Mr Tim
Congdon and Mr Simon Ward show that the combination of an expected trend
rate of real economic growth of 2-2 1/2 per cent, added to an average
dividend yield of 5.2 per cent over the period 1955-90, implies an annual
real return of 7-8 per cent, before management fees.
A recent BZW study confirms their expectations: the average annual real
return on equities, with gross income reinvested, was 7.2 per cent over the
70 years to 1988, higher than target real return of 4-4 1/2 per cent
normally set by pension funds, but much below the real yield on equities in
the 1980s.
Yet this relationship between real returns on equities and trend GDP growth
tends to hold true only over very long periods: several decades, rather than
a few years. Real returns in the 1990s could stray from this long-run trend
for a number of reasons: sluggish economic growth; changes in the profit
share in GDP; or changes in market expectations.
ERM and European growth:
The clearest threat to UK economic growth, and thus real equity returns, is
the high level of nominal and real interest rates that Germany is imposing
on its ERM partners. Because Germany sets the floor for Europe's monetary
policy, the rest of Europe remains stuck with a combination of slow growth
and tight monetary policy. Even if the Bundesbank feels able to cut its
rates by the end of this year, as inflationary pressures abate, it is
unlikely to cut rates very far, very fast.
ERM and the UK:
UK rates may have to remain above those in other European countries. The
interest rate premium against German rates has narrowed to just half of a
percentage point. But if UK imports surge and the trade deficit widens, the
markets may become nervous once more about sterling's ERM parity.
In addition, there is still some way to go before UK industry fully adjusts
to life in the ERM. Annual wage inflation is still above 7 per cent, and
therefore remains higher than the European average. There may have to be a
few years of high unemployment and squeezed profits before UK unit labour
cost inflation falls to European levels.
Corporate profitability:
But UK productivity growth in the 1980s grew faster than in every main
industrialised country, except Japan; and output per person-hour in British
manufacturing is still only two thirds of the German level, suggesting that
there is room for further improvement.
UK equities benefited from the rise in the share of value-added that was
distributed in profits in the 1980s. According to the OECD, capital's share
rose from 30.3 per cent in 1975-79 to 31.5 per cent in 1980-87. Yet the rate
of return on capital in the latter period was virtually unchanged at 9.5 per
cent, well below the OECD average of 14.2 per cent.
Capital gains:
The main determinant of the rate of return on equities is likely to come
from short-run movements in share prices, as investors reassess their
expectations of the future. Congdon and Ward find that, over one-year
periods, changes in the return on equities come about largely through swings
in the dividend yield. Only over five-year periods do changes in dividend
growth matter. But even over 20 years the correlation between share-price
indices and output is weak, as the charts shows.
At first sight, the UK equity market does not appear over-valued. The
average price-earnings ratio of UK equities is broadly in line with long-run
trends; the prospect of low inflation could boost profitability; and the
ratio of nominal yields on bonds to equities has fallen to 1.95:1, lower
than its past average of 2.25:1
Yet low inflation combined with high and stable yields on bonds may reduce
the need for such a high nominal premium on fixed interest investments. If
inflation were to fall to 2-3 per cent a year, and economic growth remained
below trend for the first half of the decade, the current nominal yield gap
of 4 1/2 percentage points between bond and equity yields would make bonds
an attractive investment.
The market is not yet convinced that the UK will move into this
low-inflation world: the yield gap between nominal and index-linked gilts
remains nearer to 5 percentage points. The capital gains from falling
nominal yield may make bonds portfolios outperform equities during this
adjustment.
The strength of the UK's ERM commitment remains a central uncertainty. If
tensions in Europe were to boil over, the ERM were to crumble and the UK
were to return to its inflationary ways, then the short-term case for bonds
would quickly disappear.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Maturity may point to
gilts - Investment strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a phenomenal change in the investment strategy of UK pension funds
during the 1980s.
Back in 1982, Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) found that the
average pension fund had 19 per cent of its portfolio in UK fixed-interest
securities and 10 per cent in property; by the end of 1991, those
proportions had dropped to 3 and 2 per cent respectively.
The cult of the equity appears to have triumphed, with combined UK and
overseas equity holdings rising from 65 per cent in 1982 to 83 per cent at
the end of 1991.
But could those statistics be about to change? Many might argue that the
prospects of a low-inflation low-growth decade in the 1990s means that bonds
will offer attractive returns.
A shift may be inevitable. The Conservative government's efforts to reduce
the budget deficit in the 1980s (which succeeded in creating a budget
surplus in the latter part of the decade) meant that the supply of gilt
issues dried up. There were few gilts for pension funds to buy.
Now that the budget deficit is back and the government is issuing around
Pounds 2bn of gilts a month - a figure which may increase in future
financial years - UK pension funds will have plenty of gilts to choose from.
There is a further point. Pension funds need to match their assets to their
liabilities. If a large proportion of members of the fund are receiving
pensions, then the fund is described in industry jargon as 'mature'.
Mature funds need to place a greater emphasis on income than capital growth,
and therefore tend to invest a greater proportion of their funds in gilts.
According to John Clamp, of Caps, UK pension funds are more mature than they
were in 1982, so one would logically expect a greater proportion of gilts in
pension funds.
Part of the reason for the low proportions of gilt investment may be the
memories of the 1970s, when inflation, and a soaring budget deficit, savaged
the returns for those managers who invested in gilts.
But for those who bought fixed-interest securities in the 1980s, the returns
were pretty respectable. Caps figures show that the cumulative annual return
on gilts over the 10 years to the end of 1991 was 14.7 per cent. That was
behind the return available from UK equities (19.6 per cent) and overseas
shares (16.9 per cent), but was well ahead of both retail price and average
earnings growth.
Some would argue that, in the 1990s, there will be lower nominal returns
across all the investment categories, and that the gap between bond and
equities will be much smaller than in the recent past.
Whether pension funds will re-discover their enthusiasm for property is a
more thorny question. The well-publicised problems of many property
companies, plus the apparent over-supply of office space in the City, might
discourage many funds from increasing their exposure to this area. (Some, of
course, will see this as the low point of the cycle and therefore the time
to buy). But property has recorded only an average annual return of 9 per
cent over the 10 years to end 1991; well behind the 11.9 per cent earned on
sterling cash.
If there is going to be a shift away from equity investment in the 1990s,
there was no sign of it in 1991. Caps found that new money invested by
pension funds last year was largely placed in the UK and overseas equities
sectors. Cash levels fell substantially from the figures at the start of
1991.
Overall, Caps figures show that the average fund at the end of 1991 was
invested in the following proportions (all per cent):
UK equities (58.6); Europe (9.4); US (5.9); overseas bonds (5.5); sterling
cash (4.3); UK fixed interest (3.2); Japan (5.3); property (1.9); Pacific
(ex Japan) (2.8); index-linked gilts (1.9); other overseas (0.7); other
assets (0.5).
The 1990s could see a shift in the balance of the equity element of the
average pension fund portfolio. As the UK gradually becomes used to the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, the currency risk
in holding continental assets will gradually diminish.
If a single currency were instituted then, of course, currency risk would
vanish altogether. At least in foreign exchange terms, there would be no
reason to differentiate between UK and European assets. A pension fund which
kept all its equity assets in the UK would be akin to a Norwich-based fund
confining its investments to Norfolk.
There may be practical difficulties, however. Many continental markets are
less liquid than in the UK. And by comparison with Britain, publicly quoted
companies play a relatively small part in other big European economies. So
there may be good technical reasons for funds to retain a UK bias.
It is also possible to gain some measure of exposure to European economies
by investing in one of the UK companies with continental subsidiaries.
However, the scope for doing so is limited by the fact that the US has
traditionally been the main area for overseas investment by UK companies,
partly for cultural reasons and partly because the US has been far more open
to acquisitions than Europe.
While complete integration of UK and European assets may not occur, it seems
likely that pension funds will own may more European equities by the end of
the decade. Given that the proportion of UK equities in the average
portfolio is currently six times bigger than that in European shares, there
is plenty of scope for a shift.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): To those that have -
The leading managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINDSAY Tomlinson, UK investment chief at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment
Management, is waiting for the giants of the balanced pension funds
investment business to crack.
His company, an offshoot of Barclays Bank, is the UK leader in index fund
management, with portfolios worth nearly Pounds 10bn linked via computer
programmes to the All-Share and various other UK and international stock and
bond market indices.
'Over the past three or four years the industry has polarised on four or
five top managers,' he says. 'It only needs one or two of them to fall over,
and you will find that a group of trustees will move towards indexation.'
It is a fact that a handful of managers is winning almost all the new
business. According to the newsletter Global Money Management, the top
mandate winner in 1991 was Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, with about
Pounds 1.4bn net. Mercury Asset Management, easily the biggest in terms of
existing funds under management, pulled in another Pounds 1.2bn.
Schroder received Pounds 0.7bn and Gartmore over Pounds 0.5bn, confirming
its position as the industry's current rising star. In the past four years,
Gartmore has leapt from nowhere to eighth in the FT's annual league table of
UK pension funds under management.
Mr David Watts, head of pension funds at Gartmore, reports that the new
mandate scene is quite busy, despite the greater concentration in the
market-place. 'We have not seen the volume of new enquiries going down
recently,' he says. This year Gartmore has picked up a new balanced mandate
worth Pounds 125m from Northamptonshire County Council.
Few managers are fortunate enough to be able to report much activity,
however. Most managers in the list are losing clients, and the overall scene
is likely to be quiet this year as trustees focus on the security and
governance questions arising from the Maxwell pension funds scandal.
Still, there is currently a so-called externalisation under way, as the
previously internally managed Universities Superannuation Scheme seeks two
to four external managers.
Several local authorities besides Northants are also revising their
arrangements, a round of restructuring that reflects the breakdown of the
old relationships between local authorities and stockbrokers that were
characteristic of the pre-Big Bang era.
How far can the polarisation of pension fund investment around a handful of
managers go? Five years ago, the then top four accounted for 41 per cent of
the funds managed by the top 20. Now the proportion is 51 per cent. The
trend has yet to change.
And, while BZWIM may hope that the pacesetters will falter, the
beneficiaries might not just be the index fund managers. There is a whole
group of management companies which hope to improve their performance and
get back into a position where they can start winning significant numbers of
mandates again.
An example is Prudential Portfolio Managers, which had a poor couple of
years for performance in 1989 and 1990 but picked up speed again in 1991
when it claimed a 21.8 per cent return, against the Caps median of 18.6 per
cent (excluding property).
Others with good performance numbers for 1991 included Baring, Henderson and
Lazard, but it takes more than one good year to get back on to the short
lists, let alone to start winning new mandates.
Another top City name which would like to claw its way back up the table is
Robert Fleming. It achieved an above-median performance in 1991 through an
emphasis on UK blue chips. Like Henderson, Fleming suffered a few years ago
from becoming too big too quickly; but, according to its investment boss, Mr
Iain Saunders, a new structure in the investment department is working
smoothly. In 1991, he says, 'the emphasis was on increasing the level of
discipline in investment management.'
Across the industry, fund managers wait eagerly to see if the industry
leader, Mercury Asset Management, will falter. It appears to have had an
indifferent year for performance in 1991, although only hearsay evidence is
available because MAM refuses to disclose its performance - a policy it has
stuck to in the past, even when the numbers have generally been good.
The number two house, PDFM, also dipped slightly below median performance
last year, although it is not unusual for PDFM to underperform in conditions
of high average returns and more than make it up in more difficult years.
As an industry giant, MAM is under pressure to move ahead of the herd.
Moreover MAM cannot hope to deliver the same consistency of performance to
all its client funds as can a smaller manager. Still, it has always managed
to please most of its clients and disappoint its competitors in the past.
Yet little is predictable in the fickle business of pension fund investment
management. Look at the varying performances of two Scottish independents,
Murray Johnstone in Glasgow losing significant numbers of clients, but
Baillie Gifford in Edinburgh powering ahead with a 40 per cent jump in
assets under management.
As the industry giants get even bigger, there is certainly scope for
well-managed and well-marketed smaller houses to find their niches. 'We are
seen as an interesting alternative,' says Mr Jimmy West, chief executive of
Lazard Investors, part of the City merchant bank.
He can offer features such as 'tight dispersion' - that is, all the funds
perform closely in line - which the big managers find harder. 'I think a lot
of people are now looking for a house with a more individual style,' he
says.
A lot of other bosses of smaller pension fund management firms hope so, too.
But not Mr Tomlinson at BZWIM.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Big players sink in
the pool
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of smaller pension schemes which cannot economically justify their
own segregated investment portfolios are clients of the life companies and
other investment houses which provide pooled investment products.
Top performer last year was Lloyds with a rate of return (given full
investment discretion) of over 20 per cent. But curiously the big contenders
in the field - Scottish Widows, Provident Mutual, Confederation Life and
Scottish Amicable - were well below average.
The Caps survey suggests that the median return was 17.4 per cent for 1991
(a little below the median of 18.3 per cent for segregated funds), while the
WF Corroon performance evaluation service reports an average of 16.2 per
cent.
On a long-term view, Confederation Life stays top of the 10-year rankings,
according to Caps, returning 18.4 per cent a year on average.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): Consensus at risk -
Investment performance does not currently cause concern, though there are
warning signs in Japan. UK funds must decide how to respond to an increase
in gilt issues, and any stumble in the equity market might lead to a change
in strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MANAGERS OF Britain's near-Pounds 300bn pension funds are still obsessed
with the consensus. The handful of top management companies which have
played the game of balanced discretionary management to perfection in the
past few years have wound up with an unprecedented proportion of the
available business. But is the game about to change?
The collapse in the Japanese stock market could be a warning sign. With the
typical fund holding 5 per cent of its assets in the Tokyo market at the end
of last year, the market's tumble has knocked more than a percentage point
off portfolios.
It is not a loss which in itself will greatly concern pension fund trustees.
They have other, bigger, worries on their minds: the implications of the
Maxwell scandal, for instance, which will soon lead to new pensions
legislation; and the growing pressure for pension funds to act as good
corporate citizens, exercising votes and behaving like responsible
proprietors.
Investment performance is not currently a source of concern. Most schemes
have healthy surpluses. The long run of years of strong equity market
performance during the 1980s was resumed last year after a hiccup in 1990.
Professional investors mostly remain highly optimistic: last month,
according to an opinion survey by Godwins, the pensions consultants, 84 per
cent of top fund managers thought that UK equities would be high in a year's
time.
At the end of 1991, the typical British pension fund, according to the Caps
measurement service, had 59 per cent of its assets in UK equities and
another 24 per cent in overseas equities. The 83 per cent commitment to
equities in aggregate is the highest ever in the UK, and is much greater
than for pension funds in other countries: the corresponding figure is some
48 per cent in the US and about 25 per cent (though rising) in the most
comparable European country with large and mature pension funds, the
Netherlands.
At the end of the 1970s, British pension funds were much more diversified
than they are now, with some 25 per cent of their assets in sterling bonds
(almost entirely UK government securities, or gilts) and a significant
direct investment in property, too. The main diversification now is that
overseas equities have replaced gilts, which in their fixed-interest form
account for only 3 per cent of the average fund today.
The justification for this strategic shift is that equities have given
splendid performance and are the natural form of investment for final
salary-linked pension schemes, which are the most common in Britain.
In price terms over the past five years, however, UK equities have performed
only in fits and starts. The average annual rate of return of 11.7 per cent
achieved in UK equities by pension funds has only just exceeded the gilt
return of 11.5 per cent. Overseas equities have lagged badly, returning only
4.4 per cent a year.
A few fund managers are starting to look again at the strategy, but there is
no inclination on their part to begin with a clean sheet. Most managers
regard the performance of the median fund as their benchmark, and indeed
this is often part of their contract with the trustees. A modest, but
increasing, number of schemes have undertaken asset-liability modelling
exercises and have established customised benchmarks. For most external
managers, however, to diverge very far from the consensus asset allocation
would constitute a severe business risk, more important in practice than the
investment risk being borne by the client.
Consider the view of Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential
Portfolio Managers, with around Pounds 10bn of corporate pension fund assets
under his care. 'We are the people who challenge the consensus,' he claims.
But what he means is that the Pru, like other managers, will diverge only
slightly from the norm; the intention is to add a percentage point or two of
performance without greatly exposing the managers to the risk of serious
divergence from the median.
For example, the Pru recently had something of a bet on UK equities over the
election period, raising its exposure to 63-64 per cent instead of the
standard 59 per cent. This has paid off for the Pru, continuing its good run
which began last year. But it is far from being a radical formula.
One of the few mavericks who rejects the whole approach of trying to be
slightly ahead of everyone else year by year (or even quarter by quarter) is
Mr Bruce Campbell, an Australian who runs a global management boutique in
London called Pyrford International. Much of Pyrford's Pounds 800m-plus
under management comes from overseas, but it recently picked up a Pounds 40m
mandate from Fisons.
At present Pyrford's strategy for UK pension fund clients is to hold only 40
per cent in equities (about half in the UK), with 30 per cent each in bonds
and cash. It has nothing in either the Japanese or US stock markets. It was
the best performing manager of all in 1990, but was a long way down in the
bottom quartile last year, underperforming the Caps median by some 7 per
cent.
Is this a high-risk approach? 'No, it is the other managers' strategy that
carries extremely high risks,' Mr Campbell insists.
It is true, however, that conventional managers have been diversifying
modestly into international bonds, with the average exposure rising from
zero to 6 per cent over the past four years. International bond portfolios,
in fact, outperformed UK equity portfolios last year.
Specialist international bond managers, however, see little interest so far
from UK pension funds. Mr Paul Abberley, fixed income director at Lombard
Odier in London, hopes that opportunities will come for his company now that
the UK is firmly established in the low inflation EMS currency bloc. 'Fixed
income instruments may be more appropriate for UK pension funds than in the
past,' he argues. But he admits that there are few global bond briefs from
UK pension funds. 'It is slow progress at present.'
But UK funds inevitably face a decision about how to respond to the huge
prospective increase in gilt issues as the British government moves into the
forecast budget deficit - of Pounds 28bn this year. As in the 1970s, it
looks as though a substantial proportion of future issues will have to be
taken up by domestic pension funds. So far, though, life insurance companies
and foreign investors appear to be dominating the gilt-edged auctions.
The pension fund strategy consensus survives. So far equities, especially UK
equities, have done what has been required of them. The stock market revival
after the election on April 9 has put a spring back into the step of fund
managers.
But successive collapses on Wall Street and in Tokyo - and the fear that the
US market may again have departed seriously from fair value - must cast
doubt on the wisdom of the current extreme strategy. If the UK equity market
falters, the consensus may encounter a real challenge.

FT  07 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of large buying orders early in the session sent stock index
futures sharply forward and led the underlying cash market higher, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Early trading in the June contract on the FT-SE had pointed to a quiet
session as it retreated 9 points with dealers digesting the poor overnight
performance on Wall Street and the weakness in the gilts market on Tuesday.
However, a turnround was staged mid-morning as James Capel, along with
several leading US houses, went on a shopping spree. June moved ahead on the
orders, but it was a large early afternoon order from international futures
trader Cargill, said to have been acting for a US investment fund, that
triggered a further squeeze. A firm Wall Street only served to underline the
positive mood.
June closed at 2,737, up 35 from the previous session and around 24 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover reached
9,006 lots.
Volume in the traded options market reached 32,794 contracts, of which the
FT-SE 100 option accounted for 8,914 contracts. Amstrad was the busiest
stock option, trading 2,831 lots, with the June 30 calls the most traded
series.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances 3.3% on
arbitrage buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Tokyo
ARBITRAGE-related buying lifted the Nikkei average by 3.3 per cent, but
volume remained subdued after the recent holidays, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 575.27 to 17,878.66. The index opened at the
day's low of 17,325.77, and hit the day's high of 17,929.65 in the
afternoon. Volume picked up modestly to 280m shares from Friday's thin 230m.
The market was closed on Monday and Tuesday.
Trading was dominated by arbitrage-related activity ahead of today's option
exercise day. The yen's firmness against the dollar and a higher bond market
provided support. Light bargain hunting by foreigners and investment trusts
was noted.
Advances outscored declines by 893 to 125, with 107 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks moved up 26.02 to 1,339.43. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.11 to 1,086.31.
Speculative issues were in the limelight. Teac, the electronics company, was
the most active issue of the day, gaining Y10 to Y1,090. Some
high-technology exporters have been promoted by brokers as beneficiaries of
the US economic recovery. Canon, the precision instruments maker, advanced
Y40 to Y1,440.
Short-term buying also lifted capital goods manufacturers on reports of an
increase in plant construction projects in south-east Asia. Chiyoda added
Y40 at Y1,610 and JGC rose Y40 to Y1,970. Biotechnology issues were firm,
with Morinaga Milk up Y8 to Y792 and Okamoto climbing Y30 to Y1,240.
Toyo Trust &amp; Banking was an exception in a generally firm banking sector,
losing Y10 to Y890 on reports that it will cut dividend payments for the
last fiscal year ended March due to an increase in bad loans to real estate
concerns and non-bank financial companies.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 429.05 to 20,275.69 in volume of 18.8m
shares. Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets were generally weaker, with Bangkok registering its
steepest loss in a single day since the military coup in February 1991.
HONG KONG declined on profit-taking. The Hang Seng index retreated 50.01 to
5,581.20 in turnover of HKDollars 3.8bn.
Cheung Kong fell 50 cents to HKDollars 24.20 and Hutchison Whampoa slipped
30 cents to HKDollars 18.10. HSBC Holdings was HKDollars 1.25 firmer at
HKDollars 43.50.
BANGKOK fell sharply as the political crisis increased. Yesterday
anti-government demonstrators surrounded the parliament building and called
for the resignation of Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon. The SET index
dropped 43.36, or 5.7 per cent, to 717.62 in turnover of Bt3.34bn.
Bangkok Land receded Bt14 to Bt140.
SEOUL weakened, with most activity coming in small-capitalisation issues.
The composite index fell 8.48 to 611.85 in turnover of Won351.8bn.
TAIWAN lost ground after the central bank announced that it was tightening
money supply. The weighted index relinquished 54.28 to 4,482.25 in TDollars
17.67bn turnover (TDollars 16.8bn).
MANILA's composite index slipped 35.78 to 1,209.74 in combined turnover of
240m pesos.
AUSTRALIA gave an unenthusiastic response to the one percentage point cut in
interest rates. The All Ordinaries index edged forward 3.3 to 1,668.9 in
turnover of ADollars 261.18m.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index put on 2.97 to 1,473.09 in turnover of NZDollars
15m. Telecom gained 3 cents to NZDollars 2.01.
BOMBAY fell on fears that a central bank enquiry would lead to tightening of
credit for brokers. The BSE index lost 327, or 8.42 per cent, to 3,560.72.
KUALA LUMPUR advanced on selective buying of major stocks. The composite
index gained 1.44 to 604.46.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Risk of corruption worries IFC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD Bank officials are concerned that the lack of legislation and
regulation has exposed some emerging stock markets to the risk of scandal
and corruption.
Mr Peter Tropper, author of the International Finance Corporation's (IFC)
emerging markets factbook, said yesterday: 'A stock market does not exist in
a vacuum, it has to be part of the economy and has to be effectively
regulated.'
While declining to name offenders, Mr Tropper said that the IFC, part of the
World Bank, was working with them to improve the situation.
Looking back on 1991, Mr Tropper noted that the Gulf war had brought many
regional funds to a discount to their net asset value.
The IFC's 1992 Emerging Stock Markets Factbook is available from 1818, H
Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20433 USA, priced at Dollars 60.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt rises in confident
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES made a broad advance yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT regained confidence on expectations of an early end to the public
sector strike. Sentiment was also lifted by comments by the Bundesbank
president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, that inflation could fall below four per
cent this year. The DAX index gained 10.86 to 1,743.50, its biggest rise in
a single day for nearly three weeks. The FAZ index advanced 6.70 to 704.70
while turnover rose to DM6.3bn from DM4.3bn.
Volkswagen closed up DM5.50 at DM386 following pleasing first quarter
results and the company's positive comments for the rest of the year. There
is an analysts' meeting today. Other car stocks were mixed: BMW advanced
DM4.50 to DM574 while Porsche fell DM5 to DM530.
Deutsche Bank gained DM6.10 to DM712.30 following its announcement after the
close on Tuesday of a restructuring of its US operations and plans to issue
profit-participating certificates with warrants attached.
The reopening of Frankfurt airport after Tuesday's closure helped Lufthansa
regain DM5.50 or 3.7 per cent to DM152.
Among steels, Hoesch shed DM3.50 to DM247 on lower first quarter sales while
Kloeckner-Werke put on DM1.40 to DM121.40 on confident expectations for
1992.
PARIS came off the day's highs on profit-taking but analysts said the market
was likely to move higher as international investors continued to switch
funds out of Germany. The CAC-40 touched a year's high of 2,054.50 before
closing up 0.22 at 2,047.15. Volume was a heavy FFr3.1bn.
The strong rise in Matra and Hachette shares, which were both re-quoted
yesterday, surprised the market. Matra jumped FFr15.50 or 9.5 per cent to
FFr178.90 on expectations of a favourable merger with Hachette, which added
FFr3.20 to FFr150.70.
Hopes of lower interest rates lifted the financial sector. UAP added FFr18
or 3.3 per cent to FFr558 while CCF rose FFr10.50 or 5.7 per cent to
FFr196.50.
Rhone-Poulenc rose FFr18 or 2.9 per cent to FFr646 ahead of next week's
first quarter results.
MILAN got some comfort from Generali's 1991 results. The Comit index rose
3.57 to 495.75 in turnover estimated at less than Tuesday's L122.4bn.
Generali gained L370 to L29,510, while Olivetti rose L75 to L2,910 following
favourable press coverage of its Dollars 300m contract to install computers
in McDonald's restaurants in the US.
The telecommunications sector recovered after its recent drop, with Stet
gaining L22 to L1,949. Italcementi, another recent casualty, put on L750 or
5 per cent to L15,590.
But the construction sector was harmed by the growing corruption scandal in
Milan. Cogefar lost L80 to L3,720 and Grassetto lost L380 to L9,250.
ZURICH maintained its rally to close at another 1992 high. The SMI index
rose 16.8 to 1,937.3.
Industrial companies saw strong foreign buying, with Nestle bearers gaining
SFr20 to SFr10,000. Roche certificates advanced another SFr100 to SFr3,710
on Tuesday's good results and the planned issue of ADRs.
Brown Boveri bearers put on SFr70 to SFr4,300 on news that Asea Brown
Boveri, in which it holds a 50 per cent stake, had won a Dollars 1.25bn
contract to build a hydroelectric facility in Iran.
AMSTERDAM followed other bourses higher and the CBS Tendency index closed up
0.7 at 130.0 in turnover of Fl 771.1m.
Philips disappointed some analysts with its first quarter figures and shed
60 cents to Fl 38.00. Some switching into Polygram was noted: its shares
advanced Fl 1.30 to Fl 50.40.
Ahold, which lists in Zurich today, was Fl 2.60 stronger at Fl 164.50.
STOCKHOLM saw Volvo B free shares rise SKr10 to SKr430 on reports of an
early merger with the French auto maker, Renault. The Affarsvarlden General
index added 10.6 to 1,004.3, as turnover remained heavy at SKr768m after
SKr746m.
Ericsson B shares added SKr2 to SKr135 ahead of its first quarter earnings
report today. The market expects a pre-tax loss of SKr100m.
MADRID's general index gained 0.94 to 250.11. Banks were generaly weaker
with Banco Central Hispano losing Pta30 to Pta3,670 after reporting a 8 per
cent rise in first quarter net profit.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: New listing rules to put listing ship
on even keel - The efforts of private managers to give weight to the Jakarta
exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First impressions of the Jakarta stock exchange do not inspire confidence.
Surly lobby attendants sit on battered chairs, their feet planted on desks,
and a hand-written paper sign is taped to the wall outside the office of
Bursa Efek Jakarta (BEJ), the private managers who took over the running of
the exchange from the government last month.
BEJ's adjoining offices are a building site, indicating that some kind of
transformation is under way. Indeed, the aim of Mr Hasan Zein Mahmud, the
BEJ president, is to inject life and confidence back into the stock market.
Jakarta attracted the attention of international investors in 1990 when the
official index rose 70 per cent in the first three months to peak at 638.8.
It subsequently suffered a severe fall, as a series of accounting scandals
tarnished the market's image, and is now trading just below 290.
Mr Mahmud faces a big challenge in overhauling the stock exchange. The
biggest problem is the lack of liquidity. As one foreign broker comments:
'Try and buy a reasonable stake in some companies and you could double their
share price.'
Domestic investors, such as the state pension funds, have opted to place
money on deposit or invest in property rather than in shares. Deposit rates
have peaked at 20 per cent, pushed up by the government's tight monetary
policy imposed after bank credit grew by more than 50 per cent in 1990. The
central bank has recently eased controls on money supply, but there will be
some delay before commercial bank rates fall.
Lending rates of 26 per cent, coupled with an economic downturn in export
markets, have squeezed company profits and further depressed share values
and trading volume. The value of daily transactions last year averaged
Rp24.9bn (Dollars 12.4m). This increased to Rp29.6bn in January and Rp39.5bn
in February but fell back to Rp25.3bn in March.
BEJ has tightened the listing requirements in an effort to improve investor
confidence and liquidity. From June 18, the qualifications for a listing
are: an operating profit for two consecutive years; minimum assets of
Rp20bn; equity capital of at least Rp7.5bn and paid-up capital of more than
Rp2bn; at least 200 public shareholders; and a free-float of at least 1m
shares.
Companies may be struck off if: they record losses for three consecutive
years; their shares are not traded for more than six months; they cannot
produce scheduled financial reports; or accounting standards are not met.
Brokers had estimated that up to 40 companies of the 141 currently listed
were liable to be struck off. But last week BEJ said the new requirements
would only apply to companies entering the exchange. Brokers now expect
fewer than five companies, which have failed to produce annual reports, to
be delisted.
The tighter listing procedures have been welcomed by brokers, except for the
threat to remove loss-making companies. 'The temptation for loss-makers will
be to falsify accounts, a problem BEJ should be deterring,' explains a local
broker.
Mr Mahmud, however, says the main purpose is to provide an early warning
system to the investor. Furthermore, the removal of loss-making companies
will not be automatic but at BEJ's discretion.
Brokers complain that there are too many of them - 189 domestic brokerages
and 26 joint ventures - for the size of the stock market. Mr Mahmud reckons
75 to 100 firms would be sufficient, but denies that BEJ will limit numbers:
'I do not like the idea of directly intervening in the market.'
BEJ has a paid-up capital of Rp12.3bn, owned equally by 205 stockbroking
firms. The venture will be financed by a 0.1 per cent commission on every
share transaction, and an annual listing fee for listed companies of 0.1 per
cent of the face value of their shares.
Under new rules, local stockbroking firms must have a paid-up capital of
Rp500m, or Rp5bn if they want to act as underwriters. The requirement is
double for joint ventures, in which foreign companies can hold up to 85 per
cent.
BEJ also intends to streamline clearance and settlement, which currently
takes five days or more, but there are no immediate plans to computerise the
exchange.

aluminium alloy in early October. The contract - the first totally new
product since the launch of the nickel contract in 1979 - has been the
subject of hot debate in both the industry and the exchange for nearly two
years.
During metals week last October some LME members put the chances of getting
the contract off the ground at only 50-50. But the odds shortened
considerably earlier this year when a special LME committee recommended its
introduction.
In a short statement yesterday the LME said trading in three month secondary
aluminium will begin on October 6, and trading in cash metal on January 4.
The exchange has not confirmed the grades of metal to be traded, but they
are likely to be the Japanese ADC12, the German DIN 226 and the US 380. The
contract is expected to be in US dollars, cover lots of 20 tonnes and be
traded 15 months forward.
Secondary aluminium was an obvious choice for the LME as it searches for
ways to expand its business. Secondary production is a large industry, with
output of about 4.5m tonnes a year, mainly of automotive grade alloy. The
motor industry uses more than 70 per cent of production.
The secondary industry has been growing at 5 per cent a year, compared with
only 1 per cent for the primary industry.
Mr Angus MacMillan, of Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the contract would be
good for both the LME and the secondary aluminium market. 'It's another
example of how the LME has started to drag itself into the 20th century
since the tin crisis.' Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken,
also welcomed the contract. Hedging secondary metal against the primary
contract was difficult, he said. In theory the two should move in parallel,
but in practice they do not.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee and cocoa futures prices
slide to fresh lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL

<TEXT>
LONDON ROBUSTA coffee and cocoa prices continued their declines to new lows
yesterday, while in New York the July arabica coffee contract had fallen
below 60 cents a lb by midday.
London's July robusta contract plunged nearly Dollars 40 a tonne to a
22-year low of Dollars 678 a tonne before recovering to Dollars 690, down
Dollars 26 on the day. July cocoa closed only Pounds 1 above a new 16 1/2
 year low of Pounds 574 a tonne.
Producers with abundant supplies of both coffee and cocoa have this year
been faced with the stark fact that consumers have high stocks, and see no
need to buy. 'Producers have to sell for what they can get,' said Mr
Lawrence Eagles, analyst with London futures broker GNI.
Stocks of coffee held in importing countries have now reached 90m bags (60
kg each) - probably twice the required level, according to Mr Peter Kettle,
analyst with ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house.
Mr Eagles also pointed out that the markets had become increasingly
oligopolistic, with few trade houses and few consumers. He cited a recent
Unctad report pointing to 'a shrinking number of participants in many
commodity markets' with increasing power to influence prices through actions
such as holding stocks.

<TEXT>
THE LONDON Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) is to decide by the end of
this week on a number of redundancies needed if it is to break even in
1992-93, a memorandum by the exchange's chief executive said, reports
Reuter.
'In order to achieve break-even for the exchange, the executive director
decided it was necessary to examine every item of projected expenditure and
decide whether or not it was vital to the functioning of the exchange,' said
the memorandum, sent out yesterday.
'Regrettably. . . it is necessary to eliminate some jobs from the exchange
and to combine others,' the memorandum said.
An executive group meeting will be held tomorrow, when a final decision will
be made on redundancies, which traders suggest could affect 15 to 20 people.
The drafting of the 1992-93 budget proved time-consuming and difficult, with
previous drafts rejected by the board of directors as it would not agree to
London Fox budgeting at a loss, the memorandum said. 'We came to the
conclusion the exchange must move from its current structure and operating
approach to a maintenance-only basis,' it added.
The exchange will in future provide only those services absolutely necessary
for the safe operation of its markets, which include coffee, cocoa, sugar
and other agricultural products.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spice trade put through the
mill - Problems posed by tighter food safety regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL spice trade is being ground down at present by a range of
non-tariff barriers imposed by some of the major importers. But producers
are hopeful that they will see a recovery in 1993.
Reports by the International Trade Centre of the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development and the Commonwealth Secretariat, say that the
increase in the number and type of non-tariff barriers coincided with the
lowering of tariffs under several rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade negotiations and the introduction of special market access for
some of the least developed countries.
'The most important non-tariff measures imposed by developed countries
usually relate to health and phytosanitary (plant health) regulations,' says
a report from the International Trade Center that was presented to a meeting
in Jamaica of the International Spice Group, made up of producers and
consumers. 'The public concern in these countries about food safety has led
to stricter regulations on food items, including spices.' The report says
that in the US specifications on cleanliness established by the American
Spice Trade Association 'are considered the most stringent among developed
countries'.
The regulations, which differ from country to country 'are so diverse and
standards vary so much that spice exporters in developing countries
frequently experience great difficulty in obtaining up to date,
comprehensive information about them.'
Mr Hernal Hamilton, chairman of the International Spice Group, says that
some spice exporting countries have encountered problems because of the
cleanliness requirements, but many have overcome these by implementing more
rigid inspection systems.
The industry is also worried about the effects on the major markets of the
banning of fumigants, particularly by European consumers, and a reluctance
to accept irradiation to improve cleanliness and remove bacteria.
Successfully meeting the US demands for cleanliness is considered by the
industry to be crucial to hopes for expanded trade, as that country is the
world's largest market. In 1990, US imports, including spice herbs, mustard
and sesame seeds, amounted to 238,949 tonnes, valued at Dollars 355m.
Although the volume imported by the US in 1990 was 12,277 tonnes more than
in 1989, the value was Dollars 19m less.
The volume of spices traded internationally in 1990 reached 400,000 tonnes,
valued at USDollars 1.5bn, according to the International Spice Group. But
producers are unhappy that prices for key products are low, with pepper
fetching about Dollars 1,200 a tonne, a third less than six years ago.
'Sixty per cent of global imports are for the food industry, so any
projections for higher volumes and better prices must be based on the
performance of this industry,' says Mr Fazli Husain, a senior marketing
adviser on spices for of Unctad's International Trade Center.
Consequently, producers are laying great store by the performance of the
food processing industry in the industrialised countries, mainly the US and
Europe.
An improved market will ease the concerns of those producers who have
suffered from recent developments in Europe. Exporters have been affected by
the instability of imports into eastern Europe and the CIS, because of a
lack of foreign exchange to maintain imports.
This has been particularly painful to Jamaica, the leading producer of
pimento (allspice), with exports averaging of 2,500 tonnes a year,
accounting for 70 per cent of world output. The industry earns the island
about Dollars 7m a year.
The Jamaican industry suffered a setback with the loss of an important
market for pimento in what was the Soviet Union. 'The purchasers in what was
the USSR did not buy any pimento last year because of the political
upheaval, but we expect this to be a temporary problem,' says Mr Hamilton,
who is also managing director of the Jamaica Export Trading Company, which
markets the spice.
'They need the pimento for their fish processing industry and we expect this
industry to be in touch with us again soon. We have not lost that market and
I am optimistic that shipments will resume when the political situation
settles down.'
Hopes in the trade for significant increase in the consumption of spices in
non-traditional industries are unlikely to materialise, according to the
International Spice Group.
'The consumption of spices in the non-food sector, in pharmaceuticals and
perfumery, is not in general appreciable, and does not have any significant
effect on overall demand,' it says.
Despite this, consumers and producers are likely to take comfort from
indications that the size of the market could be increased significantly by
two developments that promise an expansion of the trade.
The creation of a single European market at the end of the year will bring
changes in import patterns and could lead to increased demand, the ISG says.
The second development expected to affect that trade is the Uruguay Round
discussions. These will be of benefit, says the International Trade Centre,
'provided the trade liberalisation objectives for tropical products. . . are
attained and maintained'.
In the background, however, lurks a threat from modern technology. The ISG
says that except for vanilla, spices have not so far been threatened by
synthetics and substitutes. It says substitutes for pepper have been
developed, but have not yet made an impression on the market.
'However, the availability of spices in forms other than the 100 per cent
natural spice needs to be monitored. In recent years, spices in other forms,
such as encapsulated spices and spice drops, are entering the market, which
could influence not only the usage pattern, but also affect the actual
amount of spices used, particularly in the industrial sector in the longer
term.'

ZINC prices fell at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, although the
tightening squeeze on supplies available for nearby delivery was reflected
in the further widening of the backwardation (cash premium over forward
metal). The cash price fell Dollars 8.50 to Dollars 1,379 a tonne, but with
the three months position slipping another Dollars 17.50 to Dollars 1,273 a
tonne the backwardation climbed to Dollars 106 a tonne. Traders said that,
while zinc chart indicators were bearish, nervousness about the technical
tightness might discourage fresh sales for the time being. ALUMINIUM staged
an early rise, which traders thought might be linked to May option
declarations, but quickly ran into resistance when the three months price
moved above Dollars 1,321 a tonne. By the close three months metal was
quoted at Dollars 1,317.50 a tonne, up Dollars 5 on the day, and the cash
position was up Dollars 5.50 at Dollars 1,291.50 a tonne. TIN prices also
rose in early trading. Gains were trimmed by profit-taking but three months
metal closed Dollars 37.50 up at Dollars 5,937.50 a tonne and traders said
the near-term target of Dollars 6,000 could reached soon.

</HEADLINE>

Wool prices for wool at recent auctions have been almost static. After
dipping very slightly when sales were resumed after Easter the Australian
Wool Corporation's market indicator has stabilised at 577 cents a kg. This
is said to be around 100 cents below the level needed for woolgrowers to be
persuaded to maintain output and forecasts at present indicate a further
decline next season. The absence of any clear direction in the market as the
selling season draws to its close in June is causing quiet trading
throughout. The recession is showing slight signs of lifting in the severely
affected sectors.

FT  07 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy absent from
international market for last 14 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A country with a burgeoning public sector borrowing requirement, Italy
has been notable by its absence from the international bond market over the
past year.
The last Eurobond issue by the Republic of Italy was in February 1991, a
Ecu2.5bn 20-year issue lead managed by Paribas Capital Markets.
The deal marked the culmination of an increasingly ambitious borrowing
programme in the Euromarket, which saw Italy's international bond market
borrowings rise from Dollars 1bn - Dollars 2bn a year in the mid-1980s - to
Dollars 5.4bn in just the first two months of last year.
Italy's absence from the international market over the last 14 months is
partly due to a deterioration in it's public finances and credit quality.
Shortly after the Ecu issue last year, Moody's Investors Service, the US
credit rating agency, lowered Italy's top triple-A credit rating.
The deterioration of public sector finances continues to worry credit
analysts. Yesterday, Standard &amp; Poor's, which does not rate with the
co-operation of the authorities, said that the outlook for its AA+ rating of
Italy (the same level as Moody's) was now negative.
The rating agency said 'the continued delay in reducing large fiscal
imbalances and the lack of strong political leadership' meant that Italy's
credit quality was likely to diminish over time.
Analysts estimate that the 1992 deficit is now likely to top L170,000bn,
against a budgeted L128,000bn. Parliamentary elections last month failed to
produce a strong government. President Francesco Cossiga resigned two weeks
later, reducing the likelihood of strong measures to curb government
spending.
The decline of Italy's credit rating has made borrowing in the international
bond market less attractive.
Italy would certainly have to pay a premium over top-rated sovereign
borrowers in the international market. Syndicate officials said yesterday
that a 10-year Eurodollar deal should be priced to yield around 45 basis
points more than US Treasury paper, against a yield spread of perhaps 25
basis points for a borrower such as Austria.
Ironically, Italy's reluctance to tap the international bond market may be a
positive factor, according to the rating agencies. With only Dollars 22bn
foreign currency borrowings, Italy is not reliant on international
investors.
While foreign investors are nervous about the prospects for Italy, the
government has continued to raise funds successfully in the domestic bond
market. Last week, for example, the Italian Treasury successfully auctioned
L18,000bn of fixed and floating rate bonds.

FT  07 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Enthusiastic response to Compagnie
Bancaire Dollars 400m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR sector of the international bond market had its first sell-out
for some time yesterday when Compagnie Bancaire came to the international
bond market with its first big dollar issue. 'It was one of the deals of the
year so far,' said a rapturous banker, echoing the sentiment elsewhere.
'People are clamouring for more.'
The reason: the Dollars 400m issue, later raised to Dollars 500m due to
demand, was priced at a seemingly generous level, given the poor state of
the dollar swaps market.
The indicated spread over US Treasuries of the 10-year issue, to be priced
today, was 75-78 basis points, though the final pricing is expected to be at
a 75 basis points spread.
That was seen as a fair spread for the AA-rated borrower. However, were the
proceeds to be swapped into floating rate dollars at that level, the cost to
the borrower would be about 45-50 basis points over the London inter bank
offered rate (Libor) - some 20-25 basis points above the level at which Cie
Bancaire might normally expect to borrow, according to bankers close to the
deal.
The Cie Bancaire transaction, its first attempt to generate a following
among institutional investors in the international bond market, has been
planned for some weeks, perhaps helping to explain its pricing. In spite of
the deterioration of the swaps market, the borrower was keen to push ahead
with the deal, its main aim being to complete its first substantial
transaction successfully. It is not known if the proceeds were swapped,
though bankers close to the deal believed they had not been.
The generous spread against Libor was said in some quarters to have prompted
a degree of asset swapping - that is, banks taking fixed rate paper and
selling on floating rate paper to investors. The co-lead managers to the
deal are thought to have agreed not to engage in asset swapping, but other
banks involved commented that it was impossible to prevent the process if
the attractions were significant, as in this case.
JP Morgan, which led the Cie Bancaire deal, was also credited yesterday with
an Ecu150m issue for Johnson &amp; Johnson which was reported to have sold well.
The five-year issue, yielding 9 per cent, was almost guaranteed to find a
market among retail investors in Europe given the big-name, AAA-rated
borrower, other bankers said.
The yield was nine basis points above the level at which Credit Local's
five-year benchmark Ecu issue was re-opened yesterday by UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, taking the total size of the issue to Ecu900m.
Meanwhile, the World Bank brought its first dollar floating rate issue
priced against Libor, with a Dollars 250m 10-year issue organised as a block
trade through Salomon.
Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP) has launched an Ecu140m convertible bond
issue, led by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Merrill Lynch International and Companhia
de Investimentos e Servicos Financeiros (CISF), the BCP group's investment
and financial services company. The bonds are convertible into BCP shares,
and offer 8.75 per cent interest and a conversion premium of 16 per cent
above BCP shares market price at issue date.
The issue is the first convertible issue launched on the international
market by a Portuguese financial institution. It forms part of a wider
programme aiming to raise Esc50bn (Dollars 357bn) on the international
markets and domestically to build up its international position and
shareholding base.

DENMARK's overseas state debt is expected to fall to DKr77bn at the end of

that of Ecu debts rose to 20 per cent from 15 per cent.
