FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Unilever sets its sights on
satisfying Mrs Jones - The new co-chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not often that a change at the top of a well-managed multinational as
big as Unilever coincides neatly with a shift in the company's direction.
But Michael Perry, who this week succeeded Sir Michael Angus as British
co-chairman of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products manufacturer, talks like a
man who stands on the verge of a new era.
'If you ask what characterised the Angus years, clearly it was the
single-minded focus on improving Unilever's profitability by driving out
inefficiency and low margin businesses,' Mr Perry says.
Boosting the bottom line will remain as important as ever - his aim is to
improve on last year's 8.7 per cent operating margin by 'a percentage point
or two' during his four-year chairmanship. 'But it will have to happen by
different means,' he says.
The challenge now is to move forward by seizing the initiative much more
aggressively in all Unilever's markets: 'We have got to do better than our
competitors and better than we have ever done before at harnessing our
global technological resources to individual markets. It's my firm belief
that restoring the all-important focus on leading and setting the agenda is
what it's all about.'
That does not imply any let-up on cost cutting. In Europe, where Unilever is
rationalising extensively its food business to prepare for the single
market, Mr Perry says the biggest pay-off is still to come: 'You ain't seen
nothing yet. There's a hell of a lot more to come in margin improvement.'
Unilever is also still ploughing a lot of effort into straightening out US
businesses acquired in the 1980s. Profitability at its Cheseborough Ponds
subsidiary should be 'exactly where we want it in the next 12 months or so'.
The big wave of restructuring, disposals and acquisitions of the 1980s, when
Unilever shed many established businesses and expanded into new ones such as
perfumes and cosmetics, is unlikely to be repeated. Further acquisitions are
likely to be closely related to the company's four 'core businesses' of
food, detergents, personal products and speciality chemicals.
One imperative dominates the 58-year-old Mr Perry's strategic vision for
Unilever. It is sharply to accelerate the company's rate of innovation,
showering markets worldwide with new products.
The goal is particularly urgent because some of Unilever's biggest
traditional businesses - notably edible fats, in which it is the world
market leader - have grown mature and face increasingly tough price
competition. To restore margins and growth, the company needs to diversify
into new products with higher added value.
Mr Perry is counting heavily on Unilever's extensive investments in modern
information technology to tighten internal communications. But its ability
to innovate and respond faster will depend, above all, on the success of
radical moves under way to reorganise some of its biggest operations.
These have gone furthest in detergents, where Unilever's previous patchwork
of national baronies has been replaced by a more unified executive intended
to drive the business worldwide. A slightly less sweeping shake-up has been
instituted in European foods, while the personal products division is
seeking to co-ordinate its operations more closely from an office recently
established in Paris.
Although Mr Perry is satisfied with results to date, he admits that the
company is still experimenting. The trick will be to strike a balance which
produces coherent global strategies without endangering Unilever's
much-prized entrepreneurship in the field. As Mr Perry puts it: 'Innovation
and creativity only happen successfully close to markets - not in Brussels
or any other central place.'
Above all, it is essential to keep attention riveted on the consumer. 'The
moment you focus anywhere else, you are lost. Everything that drives you
must be with the sight of Mrs Jones looking you straight in the eye. If you
get that right, all the rest will be in place.'
If Mr Perry has his way, the Unilever of the 1990s will reach more Mrs
Joneses in more countries than ever before, as its reliance on Europe - 60
per cent of its business today - is gradually diminished by faster growth in
other parts of the world.
He is particularly excited by prospects in South America, south-east Asia,
India and China, where he is going in September for 'a first-hand look see'.
China, he says, will be the biggest growth market of them all 'if things
come together, if there are no more Tiananmen Squares'.
Meanwhile, Unilever will keep plugging away at the more mature markets of
the US, Europe and Japan. Although it has yet to show a profit in Japan, Mr
Perry says the company cannot afford not to be in one of the world's most
innovative markets. However, he concedes that Unilever needs to focus its
operations there more selectively.
His expansionist vision owes much to a 35-year career with Unilever which
has included postings in the Netherlands, Thailand, Argentina and Japan. He
expects his international experience - far more varied than that of Sir
Michael Angus - to be a big advantage in steering Unilever through the
challenges of the 1990s.
A self-confessed hands-on manager, whose biggest anxiety is not to grow
remote from the business, he also relishes getting out and meeting people
around the world. 'I've got to be down there talking to people, walking
through stores, looking at what my competitors are doing, sniffing around.
Not second-guessing management, but just asking them bloody tough questions
and making sure they've got sensible answers.'

HAFSLUND Nycomed, the Norwegian company which makes radiology products to
improve the clarity of X-rays, yesterday announced a 46 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to NKr367m (Dollars 57.29m) for the first quarter of 1992.
Operating profit, after research and development costs, improved by NKr66m
to NKr410m. R&amp;D costs rose by NKr27m to NKr168m. Sales rose 10 per cent to
NKr1.415bn.
Hafslund made a NKr43m loss on securities, bonds and foreign currency
trading during the three months, against a NKr111m loss last year.
Hafslund reiterated plans to spin-off its shipping operations into a
separate company, Actinor Shipping. The group plans to retain a 25 per cent
stake and around the middle of the year take a listing for Actinor on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Among individual business units, Nycomed Imaging made satisfactory progress
in all markets in the quarter although operating revenue was up NKr4m to
NKr567m.
Nycomed Pharma saw steady growth in pharmaceutical sales and improved
operating revenue by NKr78m to NKr613m with operating profit NKr25m higher
at NKr123m.

IF Loblaw, Canada's biggest food distributor, fails to buy the Steinberg
chain in Quebec soon, it will push further into the US, said Mr Galen
Weston, chairman of Loblaw's parent company, George Weston.
Loblaw is negotiating with Steinberg's owners for all or part of its
Montreal operations. It is the third time Loblaw has tried to enter the
Quebec grocery market over the past 20 years.
It already has a large automated bakery in Montreal.
Mr Weston said his group has CDollars 500m (USDollars 420m) or more
available for a Canadian or US acquisition. Its north-eastern US bakery
operation is succeeding after a restructuring and is expanding its long-term
supply contracts.
The Weston group has large cash resources but its earnings are being held
down by its forest products and fisheries divisions. First-quarter earnings
fell nearly 50 per cent to CDollars 6.1m on revenues of CDollars 2.5bn.

FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Christiania Bank seeks NKr2.05bn
capital increase
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA Bank yesterday disclosed reduced first-quarter losses but warned
it needs NKr2.05bn (Dollars 320m) in fresh state support if it is to meet
new capital adequacy regulations.
The bank, Norway's second biggest, reported a decline in net loss to NKr86m
for the first quarter of 1992 from NKr279m in the same period last year,
helped by lower operating costs, lower credit losses and higher earnings.
Christiania said it had been given assurances by the state-backed Bank
Insurance Fund (BIF) that it will assist the bank in meeting capital
adequacy regulations as defined by the Bank for International Settlements.
The bank said that at the end of March its core capital had fallen to 1.9
per cent of risk-weighted assets, or NKr1.92bn. But the new rules demand
core capital of 4 per cent by the end of the year. Christiania said a fresh
state capital injection would bring core capital up to 4 per cent as of
end-March.
Contributing to Christiania's improved trading performance was a reduction
of credit losses to NKr565m from NKr610m and a NKr56m rise in net interest
income to NKr780m.
Operating costs were cut NKr137m to NKr750m and Christiania said that the
reduction was in line with the bank's goal to cut costs by at least 15 per
cent, according to demands by its owner, the state, in 1992.
Net profits on securities trading were reduced, however, by NKr13m to
NKr205m. The bank said that as a consequence of changes in strategy it had
reduced its short-term equities portfolio since the end of 1992 by NKr269m
to NKr816m.
Christiania warned, however, of considerable risk for future losses and
pointed specifically to the negative development in the shipping industry in
which ship values have fallen considerably along with charter rates since
the start of the year. As a result the bank had increased general loan loss
provisions by NKr150m to NKr2.66bn, the equivalent to 3.4 per cent of the
group underlying loan portfolio.

FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sandvik plans expansion in
metal-cutting tools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, is hoping to expand its presence in
the SKr50bn (Dollars 8.45bn) world metal-cutting tool market over the next
five years through acquisitions of specialist companies and internal product
development.
The Sandvik Coromant division, which had sales last year of SKr4.88bn, is
the world's largest producer of cemented-carbide tools, but has a relatively
small presence in high-speed steel tools.
Each sector accounts for half the total market, and Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom,
Sandvik Coromant president, predicted this week the company would have 'a
bigger chunk' of business in high-speed steel, and in small-hole drilling
tools, in five years.
The company already produces 12,000-13,000 types of tools, of which around
1,500 are replaced each year. But Mr Hedstrom wants to be able to serve the
needs of big manufacturing customers that use both types of cutting tool.
Mr Hedstrom said there were a number of small cutting tool companies with a
specialised product or market which could come up for sale.
But he doubted whether Coromant would acquire Valenite, the big US tool
company, because the two companies lacked the necessary product and
marketing fit.
Valenite's owner, the US telecommunications group GTE, said in September it
was considering various options including the sale of its electrical
products group, which includes precision materials.
Mr Hedstrom also wants to increase the proportion of Coromant's sales which
derive from fast-growing automation products such as tool changing systems.
These currently account for 10 per cent of sales, but also have a beneficial
knock-on effect on sales of consumable cutting tools known as 'inserts'.
Coromant's sales fell 7 per cent last year, with Germany the last European
market to succumb to the downturn. Mr Hedstrom indicated the German outlook
was clouded by the current political and industrial uncertainty, but said
the US market for consumable cutting-tools had 'passed the bottom'.

KEMPER, the Chicago insurance and financial services company, suffered a
drop in first-quarter net income to Dollars 29.9m, or 61 cents per share,
from Dollars 51.5m, or Dollars 1.08 per share, last year.
Mr David Mathis, chairman, said a decline in net investment income,
particularly from the company's life insurance segment, hurt first-quarter
operating earnings, which dropped to Dollars 35.1m from Dollars 49.3m last
year.
Included in the first-quarter results are after-tax realised investment
losses of Dollars 5.2m, or 11 cents per share, compared with after-tax
investment gains in the year ago quarter of Dollars 2.2m, or 5 cents per
share.
The company had after-tax charges of Dollars 2.6m, against potential losses
on properties, and Dollars 1.8m to write down below investment grade
securities.
Kemper life insurance investment portfolios were more conservatively
positioned late last year in moves which included reductions in below
investment grade securities.
Kemper Securities, once the poor sister of the corporation, was its star
performer in the first quarter. It reported net income of Dollars 3.6m, or 7
cents per share, up from Dollars 929,000, or 2 cents per share, for the same
period last year.
Performance in the insurance side was mixed. Life insurance reported a net
loss of Dollars 4.7m, against net income last year of Dollars 8.5m;
reinsurance's net income declined to Dollars 7.3m from Dollars 10.2m;
property-casualty also reported a decline to Dollars 9.8m from Dollars 13m
in the first quarter of 1991.
The company's asset management operations reported net income of Dollars
20.7m, up marginally from Dollars 19.3m last year.

MOODY'S, one of the largest US rating agencies, said yesterday it was
considering downgrading the debt ratings of Delta Air Lines, one of the
three US 'mega-carriers', writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Its review was prompted by 'the outlook for continued losses in the
intermediate term'.
Last year, Delta bought the east coast shuttle and transatlantic routes
owned and operated by Pan Am.
The benefit from last November's acquisition of Pan Am's European routes
'have fallen short of Moody's expectations, and Delta's domestic business
has reflected weak conditions in the US'.
Mr Donald Carty, executive vice-president of American Airlines, says a deal
to inject CDollars 200m-CDollars 250m into Canadian Airlines International
should be finalised within 30 to 45 days, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
But American might not necessarily end up with 25 per cent of CAIL's voting
equity, he said, and the deal might lead to American forging links with
several other airlines.
'Such alliances are primarily concerned with administration and computerised
booking systems, where tremendous economies of scale are possible,' Mr Carty
said after a service club speech.
Under the alliance CAIL and American would also co-ordinate flights and
develop strong cross-border connections to improve the Canada-US service.
CAIL is insisting on an investment by American, either in equity or other
securities.

HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong-based property development and construction
company, has raised HKDollars 2bn (USDollars 259m) from a private placement
to fund a toll bridge and property developments connected to its 304km
super-highway in China.
The company issued 400m new shares at HKDollars 5 each, representing 9 per
cent of its enlarged share capital. Response was enthusiastic, reflecting
demand from international institutions for China 'plays'.
Hopewell's shares have been the best performing among the Hang Seng Index
constituents this year. Although it had a net cash position of about Dollars
HK4bn, it is undertaking several ambitious projects throughout the region,
including the Guangzhou-Shenzhen toll road project in China, its HKDollars
25bn Bangkok mass transit system and power stations in China, the
Philippines and Malaysia.
The latest China property developments are all linked to the company's
super-highway. Hopewell plans to develop a 3.12m sq ft site adjacent to the
toll road's border crossing with Hong Kong at a cost of HKDollars 300m.
A further 7.75m sq ft of retail and commercial space will be developed on 12
intersections of the super-highway, taking up HKDollars 1.15bn of the new
capital.

UNOCAL, the US oil group, said yesterday that its exploration and production
division would sell or place in joint ventures Dollars 350m in assets and
cut at least 400 jobs to boost profits, Bloomberg reports.
Unocal said it would narrow its exploration focus worldwide, consolidate
regional offices and consider the sale of its geothermal and power
generating operations.
The oil company will incur most of the cost from its restructuring over the
next four months. The plan has been designed to boost the division's
after-tax cash flow by Dollars 100m annually next year, the company said.
The moves are part of a restructuring announced last week. Unocal plans to
sell more than Dollars 700m in assets over the next few years, slash its
work force and boost after-tax cash flow by Dollars 200m a year.
Additional asset sales and job cuts are expected to follow in other
divisions.
Unocal joins a host of other leading oil companies planning to sell domestic
oil and gas assets to concentrate on newer fields abroad.

<TEXT>
DAF, the loss-making Dutch commercial vehicle maker, is spending Pounds 170m
(Dollars 302.6m) to bring into production two new truck ranges, which the
company described yesterday as 'crucial' to its future.
The new ranges, under development for four years, were unveiled at a dinner
to mark the retirement of Mr Aart van der Padt, DAF's chairman. However, the
trucks are not due to enter commercial production at DAF's Eindhoven plant
until the final quarter of this year.
The west European market for such vehicles is 110,000 to 120,000 a year, of
which DAF has 8 per cent. Its total truck output last year was 24,000.
The new ranges offer the prospect of a production boost for Leyland DAF, the
company's UK subsidiary. This is in spite of a decision to concentrate
production of all trucks over 17 tonnes in the Netherlands, and production
of lighter trucks and vans in the UK - at Leyland DAF's plant in Leyland,
Lancashire, and at the former Freight Rover facility near Birmingham.
'This is a very comprehensive and far-reaching range of vehicles. There is
every prospect the Leyland plant will need to share some of the (production)
load,' said Mr David Gill, Leyland DAF's managing director, sales and
marketing.
He said common material supply systems developed for DAF's British and Dutch
plants over the past two years had given DAF greater flexibility to switch
production between the two countries.
DAF, in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, has been one of
Europe's hardest-hit manufacturers, mainly because of its heavy dependence
on the UK market, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of group turnover.
Fiat, Italy's largest car maker, is studying the possibility of
manufacturing four-wheel-drive vehicles in the former Soviet republic of
Kazakhstan, AP-DJ reports.
Mr Renato Ruggiero, Fiat's international affairs director and Italy's former
foreign trade minister, recently led a Fiat delegation to Kazakhstan to
explore the opportunity of developing industrial ties with the republic as
part of its strategy to expand in eastern Europe.
'We examined the possibility of developing a plant to assemble the Panda
four-wheel-drive and light commercial vehicles,' Mr Ruggiero was reported as
saying.
He also said Fiat had reached an agreement with Mr Nasultan Nazarbaev,
Kazakhstan's president, to conduct a feasibility study for the project.
Mr Ruggiero said that the project 'could be expanded to include other
sectors: tractors, earth moving equipment, civil infrastructure and
treatment of agricultural products.'

<TEXT>
TRAVELERS, the US composite insurer, has reported first-quarter profits of
Dollars 63.1m after tax, down from Dollars 93.1m in the same period last
year.
The profit figure is struck after realised investment losses of Dollars
1.6m, against a loss of Dollars 2.4m in the first quarter of 1991.
Travelers has been badly hit by souring property-related investments, and
said a further Dollars 23m was added to reserves to cover potential real
estate losses during the first three months of 1992.
However, the insurer noted that overall earnings from the property-casualty
operations were improved, 'driven by the continued turnaround in personal
lines'.
Profits from the life and pensions businesses continued to suffer from the
real estate difficulties, while lower interest rates reduced net investment
income across the board.
Travelers said that the property environment had remained much as expected,
and the under-performing portfolio increased to Dollars 5.1bn, compared with
Dollars 4.9bn at the end of 1991. The real estate valuation reserves at the
end of the first quarter were Dollars 856m.
Net profits from the property-casualty commercial lines increased to Dollars
51.7m, compared with Dollars 42.5m a year ago, while personal lines turned
in Dollars 19.2m, against Dollars 1.9m.
Life, health and annuities made a net loss of Dollars 4.1m, against a
Dollars 16.7m deficit a year earlier, while managed care/employee benefits
produced Dollars 19.3m, against Dollars 30.4m a year ago.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, posted a 29 per cent rise in net
profit in the first quarter of 1992, although operating profit showed a much
smaller increase because of the continuing malaise in the company's key
consumer electronics sector.
Net profit climbed to Fl 174m (Dollars 94m) in the first three months of
1992 from Fl 135m a year earlier. The rise was substantially aided by a Fl
65m decline in financing charges, which helped to compensate for the more
modest 5 per cent increase in operating profit to Fl 685m from Fl 655m.
Sales were up 4 per cent at Fl 12.96bn.
Philips' biggest product group, consumer products, saw operating profits
plummet to Fl 106m from Fl 298m, as losses in colour televisions and other
types of consumer electronics more than outweighed the advances achieved by
domestic appliances and PolyGram, the group's 80 per cent-owned London-based
music company.
Mr Henk Appelo, group finance director, described the operating losses in
consumer electronics, at less than Fl 100m, as 'satisfactory', given the
fierce, world-wide competition which led to a 5 per cent decline in the
price of consumer electronics early in 1992. A year earlier, consumer
electronics had posted operating profits of around Fl 100m.
Apart from consumer electronics, the company's other three main businesses
turned in strong profit improvements. Philips' lighting division - the
world's largest manufacturer of light bulbs  - posted a 74 per cent rise in
operating profits, while professional products and
semi-conductors/components improved 85 per cent and 50 per cent
respectively.
The 'Centurion' cost-cutting programme launched by Mr Jan Timmer, Philips
president, in late 1990 is producing results. The workforce of 240,000 was,
on average, 27,000 lower than a year earlier, producing savings of Fl 450m.
However, half of these savings were eliminated by average wage rises of 5
per cent for the remaining employees.
Mr Appelo repeated the group's forecast of 'limited' increases in sales and
net profits from normal business activities for the full year 1992.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, plans to increase
further its presence in central Europe by making three more acquisitions in
Poland and Czechoslovakia this year.
If the deals go through on schedule, Unilever expects to expand its annual
sales in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary from about Pounds 200m (Dollars
356m) this year to almost Pounds 700m in less than five years. Without the
planned acquisitions, sales in the region would rise to almost Pounds 500m.
The deals involve the purchase of a margarine and food manufacturing
business in Poland, and of foods, detergents and soap operations in
Czechoslovakia. Total investment, including planned spending on plant
modernisation, would be almost Dollars 70m.
Mr Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's regional director for continental Europe,
said negotiations on all the deals had been completed and were awaiting
approval by the Polish and Czech governments.
He said the investments would largely complete the company's acquisition
drive in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and that any further deals
would be small.
He said more than three-quarters of Unilever's sales in central Europe were
locally produced. Its operations in the region would be profitable in five
years if they achieved their growth targets.
The acquisitions would make Unilever one of the most active western
investors in central Europe.
They would come on top of the Dollars 120m which it has invested, or agreed
to invest, in central Europe since it began acquiring there last year.
Its first acquisition was of an 80 per cent stake in Lever Polska, a Polish
detergents producer. In Hungary, Unilever this year bought the ice cream
business of the state-owned VMTV dairies.

PROFITS growth at Volkswagen, the German motor concern, lagged behind
turnover expansion in the first quarter of this year, with domestic earnings
showing a sharp drop.
VW, which is cutting jobs and reducing costs to improve competitiveness,
said group net income in the period was 3.5 per cent higher at DM202m
(Dollars 122m). Turnover grew by 11 per cent to DM21bn.
Earnings at the parent company, which reflect profitability of VW cars in
Germany, dropped 35 per cent to DM103m; last year, these were 33 per cent
lower at DM447m.
In the first four months, group vehicle deliveries were 5 per cent higher at
1.2m units. Mr Carl Hahn, chief executive, said VW would have a good year in
1992.
Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, said VW had made full use of special
depreciation allowances carrying tax advantages. These were mainly related
to the geographical situation of VW's Wolfsburg headquarters, near the
border with the former East Germany, and previously subject to state
assistance.
He said profits were reduced by nearly DM3bn due to: DM340m in start-up
costs of new projects; the DM1.3bn expense of bringing the new Golf and
Vento family cars into production; and the special depreciation of DM1bn.
Pre-tax profits fell 25 per cent last year to DM1.8bn. Mr Ullsperger said
they would have shown a 25 per cent rise, to DM2.8bn, if the group had not
raised its depreciation provisions considerably.
Earnings per share were flat at DM36, while cash-flow was 25 per cent higher
at DM7.1bn. VW's high depreciation also cut its tax bill. Net profits,
therefore, showed a 2.6 per cent rise to DM1.1bn. Turnover in 1991 was 12
per cent higher at DM76bn. Group capital spending was 84 per cent higher at
DM9.9bn; Mr Hahn said this year's figure would be around DM12bn.
Total VW group output - including the up-market Audi subsidiary in Germany,
Seat in Spain, and Skoda in Czechoslovakia - would rise from 3.3m to 3.6m
units.
In the US, where VW makes a loss, competitiveness would be restored by
production of the new Golf and Vento models in Mexico. Sales in the first
four months were 4 per cent higher in the US, while Audi gained 40 per cent.
Audi's net profits last year were 30 per cent higher at DM370m. Mr Ferdinand
Piech, head of Audi, will become the new chief executive of the VW group
next year.

FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Renault, Volvo closer to merger
deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-owned carmaker, and Volvo, its Swedish partner,
have confirmed they are exploring ways to deepen their successful
two-year-old alliance - possibly through a merger.
The pair would not comment on Swedish television reports, sourced to Volvo,
that a deal - under which a majority French government-owned holding company
would control both groups - would be in place before the summer. However,
they carefully avoided denials.
Mr Raymond Levy, Renault chairman, said in Manchester yesterday: 'We are
getting closer and closer to each other. We definitely share a strong will
to go on tightening the alliance by any means. A merger is one possible
means. I don't say there will be a merger, but I don't say there won't be.'
Volvo has repeatedly underlined its eagerness to get closer to Renault,
though it said yesterday it would not comment on speculation. Only last
week, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman, hinted strongly at a
shareholders' meeting that Volvo would accept a minority stake in a merged
car and truck making group.
Volvo agreed to take 20 per cent of Renault in February 1990, in exchange
for which the French group took a 10 per cent stake in its Swedish partner's
parent. They declared then they would act as one company. A full merger
would create the world's fourth largest automotive industry grouping after
General Motors, Ford and Toyota, and the world's biggest bus and truck
maker.
Whatever the actual state of talks between the partners, the ground is ready
for them to deepen their alliance for several reasons.
Politically, the French government has switched from scepticism about the
alliance to support, with the recent change of prime minister to Mr Pierre
Beregovoy making the difference. Unlike Mrs Edith Cresson, his predecessor,
he does not believe in intervening in the decisions of state-owned
companies' professional management.
The Swedish government has also become less interventionist. It scrapped the
obligation for foreign mergers to seek official clearance at the beginning
of the year, and confirmed yesterday it would not interfere.
The French government, which owns 80 per cent of Renault, now looks likely
to allow Mr Levy, due to retire on May 22, to hand over to his preferred
successor, Mr Louis Schweitzer, managing director and one of the main
architects of the alliance with Volvo. A French ministerial meeting is due
to name the new Renault chairman on May 27, said Mr Levy, who thought Mr
Schweitzer had a 'fair chance'.
Renault has the government's consent, under the original accord, to sell
only another 5 per cent of its shares to Volvo, giving the Swedish car group
a maximum 25 per cent stake.
Any more would require an act of parliament, since Renault's statutes are
governed by its own individual law, dating back to its 1945 privatisation.
Renault, then, will have to ask the government's support before it can stage
a merger with Volvo or make any big change to its ownership. According to
Renault officials, no decision has yet been taken.
Industrially, both sides are ready to go further, in that they are pleased
with the alliance, which has permitted greater-than-expected cost savings
from joint component purchasing and exchanges of engines and gearboxes.
Renault executives, basking in last year's net profits recovery, privately
say they would love to be privatised.
The partners agree at the same time that their brand identities must be kept
separate, otherwise they would both lose market share. Volvo now has its
hands free, following its settlement with the Swedish state over the future
of Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals conglomerate earlier this
week.

FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Salomon warns of extra
provisions for bond affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON INC, the New York securities house, warned yesterday it expected to
make new provisions, on top of the Dollars 200m already set aside, to cover
a settlement with the US government of last year's bond trading scandal.
The announcement came as it reported a drop in first-quarter net income  -
from Dollars 273m, or Dollars 2.30 a share, to Dollars 190m, or Dollars 1.51
a share - as repercussions from the scandal continued to drag down its
earnings.
Salomon reserved Dollars 200m in the third quarter of last year to cover the
likely fines, damages and other costs of settling the bond scandal with
government regulatory authorities and private parties suing the firm.
It said yesterday that although the outcome of its negotiations with the
government was uncertain, it believed any agreed resolution would require an
additional charge, to be taken after the first quarter. However, it did not
expect this charge to 'adversely affect the long-term economic prospects of
the company'.
Salomon's lawyers have been discussing a settlement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the government agency investigating the bond scandal,
since February. The SEC has faced strong pressure from Congress to impose a
large fine on the firm, which has admitted to falsifying bids in Treasury
bond auctions.
Salomon gave no indication when a settlement might be reached. Uncertainty
over the outcome has made many clients wary of giving business to Salomon in
sensitive areas such as investment banking and the underwriting of new
issues of equity.
This was reflected in its first-quarter earnings decline, which contrasted
sharply with the record income figures reported by several Wall Street
rivals, which have been enjoying a boom in the issuance of new corporate
equity and debt.
Salomon Brothers, the group's securities arm, reported earnings before tax
of Dollars 374m, down 26 per cent from the Dollars 503m reported a year ago.
However, the firm said its securities trading and debt underwriting results
were 'highly satisfactory'.
Phibro Energy, its oil subsidiary, reported a pre-tax loss of Dollars 30m,
compared with profits of Dollars 5m a year ago, due to weak demand for crude
oil and refined products, narrow refining margins and relatively low price
volatility.
It also warned it might be unable to recover the Dollars 116m it has
invested in Russian oil development and production joint ventures, due to
unfavourable Russian taxes and pipeline tariffs, as well as unpaid balances
due from various Russian entities.
Nevertheless, analysts were pleasantly surprised by the cost-cutting
achieved by the new management team at Salomon, headed by chairman Mr Warren
Buffett. It has radically overhauled its management systems and pay
structures since last autumn. Non-interest expenses in the quarter totalled
Dollars 584m, compared with Dollars 696m a year ago, while revenue net of
interest expense dropped from Dollars 1.18bn to Dollars 915m.
Mr Perrin Long, analyst with First of Michigan, said the cost reduction
figures were 'quite positive for the future'. He said any additional
provisions for the scandal were 'highly unlikely to significantly impair
Salomon's operating ability'.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Worcester holders challenge aspect of Bosch
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOBBY of shareholders in Worcester Group, the central heating boiler maker
which has agreed to a Pounds 71.8m offer from Robert Bosch, the German
conglomerate, has appealed to the Takeover Panel over an aspect of the bid.
The full panel will meet next Monday to hear the appeal and a decision could
be announced that day.
The shareholders, thought to account for about 25 per cent of Worcester's
equity, have appointed Cazenove, the stockbrokers, to represent them.
They are concerned about the offer Bosch has made to the Worcester
management which would give them a continuing equity interest in the
business.
Worcester's management would be bought out in 1996 at a price up to 384p, or
as low as 100p, while other shareholders are being offered 225p in cash or
loan notes.
The panel executive had approved the arrangement, but the shareholders
believe that it breaches the fundamental principle of the Takeover Code that
all shareholders should be treated similarly in a bid.
Mr Christopher Smith of Cazenove said the shareholders felt that it was a
point of principle which they wanted to test.
It is a relatively unusual case, as managements rarely have such a large
stake as the 38.4 per cent held in Worcester's case.
It is also rare for shareholders to appeal to the panel.
There is some time pressure as the offer's first closing date is May 21.
The bid can go unconditional with acceptances of more than 50 per cent, and
Bosch already has commitments to accept from holders of 51.4 per cent of the
shares, including the management's portion.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cresta slides into Pounds 11.3m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY PROVISIONS against potential losses on its property portfolio left
Cresta Holdings with a Pounds 16.6m fall for 1991. There is no final
dividend.
The group has been disposing of its property portfolio and concentrating on
its CrestaCare nursing and retirement homes business in the Isle of Man -
where it is currently resident  - and the UK.
That business increased profit by 53 per cent to Pounds 3.5m, which
contributed to a group operating profit of Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 5.44m). But
exceptional costs of Pounds 12.6m and heavier interest charges resulted in
pre-tax losses of Pounds 11.3m, against a profit of Pounds 5.3m.
Losses per share were 15.6p (earnings 9.1p). An interim dividend of 0.7p had
been paid (last year's total was 2p).
Of the costs Pounds 12.1m represented potential losses on property pending
disposal. 'These provisions should protect us against further losses, and
the future growth prospects for CrestaCare look set to continue,' claimed Mr
Brian O'Connor, chairman.
Since the year-end the Northampton development was sold for Pounds 6.3m,
along with certain other properties. Realised losses have been fully
provided for in the 1991 accounts.
Mr O'Connor said CrestaCare had reached its target of 1,400 nursing home
beds with the opening of eight new homes over the past 12 months. Expansion
was being constrained, however, by the recession which was hampering
property disposals.
Directors plan to move the company's residence to the UK, where most profits
are generated, and change the name to CrestaCare. There will also be a
capital reconstruction to eliminate the Pounds 13.6m deficit on revenue
reserves.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Meggitt bids Pounds 17.3m for Micrelec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEGGITT, the specialist engineering group, yesterday announced an agreed bid
for Micrelec Group, valuing the USM-traded petrol pump controls company at
Pounds 17.3m.
The offer of 141 new Meggitt shares for every 100 Micrelec values the
target's shares at 130p, against last night's close of 122p, up 10p.
There is a cash alternative of 62 new shares and Pounds 65 for every 100
Micrelec shares.
Meggitt has received irrevocable acceptances from directors holding 35.6 per
cent of Micrelec's shares and undertakings from institutional shareholders
to accept, subject to no higher offer, representing a further 12.2 per cent.
Mr Nigel McCorkell, Meggitt's managing director, said Micrelec's electronics
systems for retail petrol distribution would fit with systems developed by
Triscan, his company's commercial fuel management subsidiary.
Micrelec also had substantial service and maintenance business with the
likes of BP and Shell which was growing and profitable.
Mr McCorkell said Triscan and Micrelec's retail fuel management businesses
would not be merged although some departments, like R&amp;D, would be brought
together.
The market has known for some time that Micrelec would accept sensible
offers and was is believed to have been approached by interested foreign
buyers in January.
It has suffered in the recession from oil companies cutting back on capital
expenditure.
Micrelec estimates that in the year to March 1992 it achieved sales of
Pounds 16.5m and incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.7m.
Mr McCorkell said that for the deal to be non-dilutive in 1993, its first
full year, Micrelec would have to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m, a
figure he thought was attainable.
Micrelec, which sold its Normand subsidiary in January for Pounds 7m, has
cash balances of Pounds 5m. Mr David Willis, one of the two main
shareholders, will stay on as managing director.
Gearing after the bid is likely to be about 10 per cent, down slightly from
the 12-15 per cent position after the Dollars 53m acquisition in March of
Endevco, the US maker of pressure sensors and other electronic equipment.
The acquisition will bring sales in Meggitt's electronics division to Pounds
60m, still behind its controls and aerospace activities.

SHARES IN Andrews Sykes fell from 160p to 140p after the plant hire company
warned that profits in the year to March 31 would be significantly below the
level previously anticipated.
In the previous year, the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.32m on
turnover of Pounds 62.6m.
The board said that although it was disappointed by the fall in hire demand,
it intended to recommend a maintained final dividend of 3p when its annual
results are announced on May 26. Strong cash flow had reduced group
borrowings by Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 14.5m, cutting gearing from 110 to 90
per cent.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Smurfit pleased to see decline limited to
9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEFFERSON SMURFIT, the Irish paper, packaging and financial services group,
yesterday reported surprisingly good results for the year to January 31
1992.
Pre-tax profits fell 9 per cent from IPounds 173m to IPounds 157.5m (Pounds
143.8m), on turnover of IPounds 1.23bn (Pounds 992.6m). Diluted earnings per
share declined 6 per cent to 48.7p (52p), only the second time in a decade
they have dropped.
However, Mr Dermot Smurfit, joint deputy chairman, said: 'We are pleased and
proud of these results given the market conditions. Of course, we are not
happy with the reduction in earnings, but we have been doing better than
everybody else, so we have a right to be pleased.'
Mr Smurfit predicted that next year would be a strong one for the paper
business.
Sales growth last year had mainly been achieved through acquisitions and a 5
per cent rise in the value of the dollar. The group spent IPounds 50m on
four acquisitions
Operating profits increased in four of the five geographical regions. The
one decline was caused by a collapse in prices in the US and Canada. Mr
Smurfit said these businesses, which represented 10.5 per cent of turnover,
had caused significant heartache.
The timely restructuring of JSC/CCA in late 1989 had reduced the group's
dependence on US earnings, he added.
The price of linerboard in the US had recently fallen from Dollars 410 to
Dollars 330 per tonne, said Mr Smurfit. Similarly, the price of newsprint
had been in free-fall and had now reached about Dollars 100 a tonne. Recent
attempts to push through price increases had failed.
A final dividend is not proposed, leaving the 1991-92 total at 2.202p
(5.05p); however, there will be a first interim of 4.872p (2.202p) for the
current year. Mr Smurfit explained this was being done for tax reasons.
Later in the year there will be a 1-for-1 scrip issue.
The group had IPounds 919m in cash and no debt, said Mr Smurfit. These funds
were not invested in Ireland. He said the group had plenty of investment
opportunities, but it was unwilling to pay unrealistic prices for
businesses.
It was planned to expand in mainland Europe and have 10 per cent of the
corrugated cardboard market, said Mr Smurfit. The group presently had about
3 per cent, with little presence in France and none in Germany.
The group had written off its Pounds 15m investment in bonds issued by Brent
Walker, the leisure group. Mr Smurfit said they may eventually be worth
something, but it was better to reduce the uncertainty surrounding them.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Interest turnround pushes Stanhope to
Pounds 15.3m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANHOPE PROPERTIES, the London office developer which is one third owned by
Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian company, more than halved its pre-tax
losses from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 15.3m in the six months to December 31.
However, excluding exceptional items, the losses almost doubled from Pounds
8.77m. The deterioration resulted from an swing from interest receivable of
Pounds 6.61m to interest payable of Pounds 7.09m.
This followed an increase in borrowings from Pounds 35m to Pounds 165m and
the waiver of the interest on outstanding shareholder loans to the Rosehaugh
Stanhope Developments joint venture. The share of the losses of associated
undertakings shrank from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 9.43m, partly as a result of
this waiver.
A charge of Pounds 1.19m resulted from the abortive merger talks with
Rosehaugh, its partner on the Broadgate development in the City, which were
broken off early this year.
'By common consent the property sector is experiencing the most difficult
conditions in living memory,' said the company. 'While there are few, if
any, signs of an early improvement, the anticipated further lowering of
interest rates coupled with increasing economic activity should, in due
course, bring a return of confidence to, and the recovery of, the London
office market.'
Stanhope said that it was actively pursuing a number of low risk partnership
developments in the UK and Europe. It had recently been appointed by British
Rail to act as its partner in a 12-acre mixed use scheme at Oxford Station.
Turnover grew to Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 19.6m), helped by a rise in the rent
roll to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.5m). A subsidiary that specialises in fitting
out offices accounts for 70 per cent of turnover. Administration costs were
cut to Pounds 4.79m (Pounds 5.83m).
Losses per share fell from 20.37p to 9.21p.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BAT sees encouraging signs at Eagle Star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary which has been a drain on profits at
BAT Industries, showed some encouraging signs in the first quarter of this
year, when the tobacco and financial services group increased its pre-tax
profit from Pounds 230m to Pounds 262m.
Although Eagle Star's pre-tax loss for the period increased from Pounds 2m
to Pounds 40m, the previous year's figure included no losses on domestic
mortgages. These were not provided for until the interim stage, when they
amounted to Pounds 121m for six months.
Between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year,
mortgage indemnity provisions were reduced from Pounds 44m to Pounds 25m and
the average claim per repossessed home fell from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds
11,000.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the encouraging signs included an easing
in the number of repossessions and anecdotal evidence of more activity at
estate agencies. It was, however, too early to say whether the improvement
was a genuine trend rather than a quirk.
Eagle Star's total underwriting losses showed little deterioration at Pounds
104m from the previous year's Pounds 102m. In the third quarter of last year
 -normally better for seasonal reasons  - they had amounted to Pounds 147m.
General insurance, which includes part of Farmers' activities in the US, had
staged a recovery from a Pounds 105m loss in the second quarter of last year
to a Pounds 40m trading profit in the first quarter of this year. This was
down from Pounds 65m in the comparable period when the figures also
benefited from a stock market rally, whereas this year the London market had
been in pre-election doldrums. Discontinued activities lost Pounds 17m.
On premiums, Sir Patrick said that although they had been raised by 30 per
cent since last year, revenue was flat because some business had been lost.
There was also a lag in the benefits coming through from the increases.
In the life business, where Allied Dunbar is the group's largest concern,
trading profit improved to Pounds 71m (Pounds 60m) helped by higher premium
income and investment returns. At Allied, advances were made in lump sum
investment, bonds and personal equity plans, but life assurance and pensions
were down.
The group benefited from a Pounds 25m reduction in net interest payments
thanks to lower rates in the US and the UK, and to higher investment income,
particularly in Brazil.
The tax charge continued to be high at 44 (43) per cent, aggravated by
unrelieved ACT. Sir Patrick said the main route to easing this would be a
return to profits at Eagle Star. Growing exports of cigarettes from the
Southampton factory were also an alleviating factor.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle slips to 'satisfactory' Pounds
92m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR WEATHER conditions and pressure on cereal sweetener margins were mainly
to blame for a slight fall in interim profits at Tate &amp; Lyle, from Pounds
94.7m to Pounds 92m pre-tax.
The shares fell 9p to 401p.
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, predicted a 'satisfactory year in the prevailing
conditions'. He said the six month period, to March 28, had been a good one
in terms of enlarging the group's foundations.
Mr Shaw said that the acquisition last year of Bundaberg in Australia gave
the group a way into the south-east Asian market, and the company had more
than covered its financing costs. In the half-year Tate invested more than
Pounds 30m in central Europe which Mr Shaw said was an important market.
The group has high hopes for two products - Splenda and Stellar  - which are
low calorie alternatives to sugar and fat. Splenda is being sold in Canada
and is awaiting approval from the US authorities, which Mr Shaw hoped would
come this year. A number of competitors had appeared to Stellar and the
build-up in production would be slower than earlier hoped.
Group sales were almost 10 per cent higher at Pounds 1.63bn and operating
profits were up 2.5 per cent to Pounds 115.6m. Associates chipped in Pounds
3.1m (Pounds 1.3m) but higher net interest charges of Pounds 26.7m (Pounds
19.4m) cut the pre-tax figure.
The tax rate was lower at 26 per cent (30 per cent) and Mr Paul Lewis,
finance director, said he expected that rate to apply for the year. Minority
interests took Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 9.6m). Earnings per share were slightly
higher at 13.2p (13.1p) on a fully diluted basis.
The interim dividend is increased by 8.1 per cent to 4p (3.7p).
Trading profits fell in two important divisions, both in the US, with the
impact softened by exchange gains.
The US sugar division saw a fall from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds 17.6m, caused
by poor weather affecting sugar beet which was awaiting processing at
Western Sugar. Profits at Western fell 80 per cent, but were somewhat offset
by a good result from Domino Sugar, based in the eastern US.
Also in the US the cereal sweeteners and starches business saw profits down
from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 29.9m, with margins cut from 11.9 to 9.5 per
cent, as cool weather and overcapacity affected volumes.
Pre-interest profits from the Canadian sugar business rose 15 per cent to
Pounds 4.7m; in the UK sugar profits were up 6.4 per cent to Pounds 25.1m;
Bundaberg made Pounds 5.3m before financing costs and sugar profits from
elsewhere, such as Europe and Africa, were up 39 per cent at Pounds 8.5m.
The European starch business increased profits by 14 per cent to Pounds
26.2m. Profits from sugar by-products, such as molasses, rose to Pounds
11.3m (Pounds 9.1m). Commodity trading made Pounds 100,000 (loss Pounds
300,000) and other activities, which includes Splenda, lost Pounds 10m
(Pounds 9.7m).
COMMENT
After five years of double-digit earnings growth Tate can be forgiven a
period of consolidation. There is plenty to look forward to in the longer
term if the promise of Splenda and Stellar is realised and Tate wins its
share of the annual growth in the world sugar market. But meanwhile, this
year's profits depend heavily on the weather, and are likely to be a few
million pounds one side or the other of last year's Pounds 234.6m. If they
were unchanged, the lower tax rate would lift earnings a touch, giving a p/e
of about 11.8. The shares are unlikely to do well until there are signs of a
return to growth.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Time Products down to Pounds 7.62m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME PRODUCTS, the watch and jewellery distributor, yesterday reported a 19
per cent fall in profits but increased the dividend after deciding to close
Remex, its uncompetitive Hong Kong subsidiary.
Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 fell from Pounds 9.37m to Pounds
7.62m on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 51.1m.
Earnings per share dipped from 12.16p to 9.74p but the final dividend is
increased to 4.85p, giving a total of 7.5p, up 3 per cent on the year.
Mr Marcus Margulies, managing director, justified the increase in the
dividend on the grounds that the company had never been too generous in the
past, had Pounds 20m of cash and was still covering the payment with
earnings.
Following the restructuring, including the closure of Remex, Mr Margulies
said he was confident about the future.
The closure of Remex led to a Pounds 4.9m extraordinary item. 'Against the
Swiss and Japanese, it was almost impossible to compete,' Mr Margulies said.
'We would have had to jack up the sales in Hong Kong or reduce costs and we
just couldn't have done it.'
Last year Remex had sales of Pounds 12.2m but made a trading loss. It only
reported an operating profit, of Pounds 78,000, after inclusion of property
rental income.
Margins in the UK were maintained at 12 per cent. 'Whilst the board is not
expecting a rapid resurgence of consumer demand, it remains confident in the
future of the company as the economy improves,' said Mr Richard Langdon,
chairman.
The group ended the year with higher stock and debtor levels, and a lower
cash position. Mr Margulies said there had been no deterioration in working
capital control; one large debtor had paid a bill three days after the
year-end and the company had needed to build stock levels at Apollo, the
watch strap manufacturer which was acquired last September.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: TJ Hughes heads for USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TJ HUGHES, the Liverpool-based discount retailer founded in 1912, aims to
lure investors with a homespun philosophy of value for money as it prepares
to join the USM next Tuesday.
The group - which operates a chain of 11 stores selling a wide range of both
branded and generic clothing, household goods and toiletries at low prices -
yesterday announced plans to raise Pounds 8m via a placing of 11m shares at
75p. Hughes is expected to be valued at about Pounds 15.2m when the total of
20.2m shares begin trading.
Mr Gurth Hoyer Millar, chairman, said the company was stopping off on the
USM, en route to its goal of a full listing in 1993. The proceeds of the USM
placing would be used to pay off Pounds 3.4m in debt and to reduce the
holding of LET, the international property and development division of SPP,
the Swedish mutual life company.
The flotation was partly prompted by the demands of Swedish law, which
restrict the scope of investments held by insurance companies. As a result,
LET will receive about Pounds 4m from Hughes in return for preference and
ordinary shares, leaving the investment group with a holding of 45 per cent.
This stake would be subject to review, and possibly further reduced, at the
end of June 1993, Mr Millar said.
The management and staff of the company would hold a further 7 to 8 per
cent, including options, after the flotation.
Profits for the year to January 25 were up 35 per cent at Pounds 1.1m on
sales 39 per cent higher at Pounds 28.4m.

FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: RBS sinks to Pounds 48m after more debt
charges - Decision to sell all or part of Charterhouse confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER rise in provisions for bad debts hit pre-tax profits at Royal Bank
of Scotland in the six months to March 31. The charge increased Pounds 33.8m
to Pounds 168.1m and pre-tax profits fell 34 per cent from Pounds 72.4m to
Pounds 48m.
But the bank said that the figures were a slight improvement compared with
the second half of last year, and is maintaining its dividend at 2.8p.
Earnings per share fell to 2.9p (6.1p).
Profits before provisions and tax rose by 5 per cent from Pounds 206.7m to
Pounds 216.1m.
Branch banking, the bank's biggest sector in terms of capital employed, saw
its contribution drop from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 7.8m, although profits
from corporate and institutional banking rose from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds
36.5m.
Mr George Younger, chairman, said the last year had experienced the worst
world recession in post-war years. There were no clear signs of an end to
recessionary conditions, and the rest of the financial year would be
difficult, with bad debt provisions likely to remain high.
However, the restructuring, which involved the loss of 1,000 senior posts,
had achieved its aim of introducing a new culture to the bank. Costs were
being brought under control and lending procedures improved.
Mr Younger confirmed the bank's decision to sell all or part of
Charterhouse, the merchant bank which achieved a marginal increase in
profits from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 11.3m. Charterhouse would benefit from
'a larger European dimension.'
Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, said that owning a merchant bank was
not 'synergistic' with a clearing bank and prevented the latter from
developing services. He would not comment on progress in selling
Charterhouse, beyond saying 'we are moving forward in measured fashion.'
The financial services division increased its profits from Pounds 2.4m to
Pounds 7.9m. There was good growth from Direct Line, the motor insurance
company, and Royal Scottish Assurance.
In the US, Citizens Financial Group increased its profit from Pounds 6.5m to
Pounds 8.9m despite higher provisions.
Royal Bank's total expenses rose 7.9 per cent. Reduced staff numbers helped
offset a 7 per cent pay rise. The cost:income ratio rose from 64.9 per cent
to 65.6 per cent. Assets rose to Pounds 34.2bn (Pounds 32.2bn).
Mr Mathewson said the bank's performance would improve as the economy
recovered and reduced bad debts, insurance earnings rose - to account for 20
per cent of pre-tax profit by 1995, and higher fee income and lower costs,
particularly in branch banking.

FT  07 MAY 92 / WPP and banks near deal on plan to reduce Dollars 1bn debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the London-based inter-national marketing services group, yesterday
appeared to be close to an agreement with its 28-bank syndicate on an
equity-for-debt swap of some Dollars 200m (Pounds 111.7m), to reduce its
Dollars 1bn debt.
WPP anticipated that a formal proposal for recapitalisation could be
concluded by the end of next week, ready for presentation to WPP's
shareholders and perhaps finally in place by mid-June.
The co-ordinating committee - JP Morgan, Bankers' Trust, Citibank and
Barclays - last week presented options to WPP's 28-bank syndicate, but it is
understood that the banks and WPP favour the equity-for-debt swap.
Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, announced in March his wish to dispose
of a US advertising agency, Scali McCabe Sloves, along with market research
subsidiaries and the flotation of WPP's minority share in its Asian
advertising businesses. He had wanted to raise Dollars 200m from such moves,
but no deals have yet been concluded.
The difficulty of making disposals for the price Mr Sorrell seeks,
especially during economic recession, has exacerbated uncertainty over the
group's financial health. Disposals would reduce overall group revenues.
Although in March WPP reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 56.1m for 1991
(compared with Pounds 90m), analysts suggested at the time that without the
release of Pounds 17.8m of exceptional items to boost 1991's figure, the
group would have breached its banking covenants.
At the end of 1991, WPP - which owns the Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J Walter
Thompson advertising agencies - had net debt of Dollars 334m on its balance
sheet and negative shareholders' funds of Dollars 268m.
These factors have contributed to some of WPP's banks wishing to reduce
their exposure. With the apparent determination of ABN, the Dutch bank, and
Fuji, its Japanese counterpart, not to renew an Dollars 85m discounting
receivables facility when it runs out in June, WPP is approaching serious
cash-flow difficulties.
Analysts expect that any recapitalisation will involve three items:
conversion of the 213m convertible preference shares to ordinary shares (of
which there are 60m); a rights issue to existing shareholders; and the
banking syndicate taking equity in WPP for a portion of debt.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Building a new image in the City: The importance of a
seminar with a difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House plans a seminar with a difference for analysts and fund
managers next Tuesday.
Senior line managers from the construction and engineering division, rarely
seen in the City, will take part as it outlines its strategy for the 1990s.
Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, says: 'We want people to understand us
better, particularly the core businesses of construction and engineering.
'This is the division which we will be focusing on for the future.'
Most people following the company know that Trafalgar specialises in
building roads and bridges, so an announcement, expected today, that the
Trafalgar-led Anglo-Japanese consortium has won a HKDollars 8bn (Pounds
583m) contract to build one of the world's biggest suspension bridges will
come as no surprise.
'But did you know that 25 per cent of the new pharmaceuticals plants are
being built by us?' asks Sir Eric. 'I bet you didn't know we were building
any pharmaceuticals plants. That's part of the problem.'
Sir Eric hopes those attending next week's meeting will come away with a
better appreciation of the group's construction and engineering businesses
which he claims are like no other in the UK.
'These are technology-led businesses' he says.
Trafalgar will take analysts through the detailed strategy of each business
within its core division.
This will range from the construction of the first plant in the world
producing artificial blood, to the more mundane business of transport and
oil and gas.
At the end of the presentation Sir Eric hopes it will be clear that
Trafalgar is no longer a sprawling conglomerate, but a property,
construction and engineering-based company.
By using that description he is acknowledging that in the 1990s
conglomerates are no longer in fashion.
With more than 80 per cent of the group's half-year Pounds 65.8m operating
profit related to construction and engineering, compared with a mere 20 per
cent in 1989, Trafalgar has changed direction.
This is just as much a result of circumstances as it was of planning. The
group accepts it became too dependent on property development and some of
its acquisitions, such as the ailing shipbuilder Scott Lithgow, could not be
described as great buys.
A change of direction, however, does not mean the sale of its non-core
businesses.
Sir Eric is adamant there are no leisure disposals in the pipeline.
'We are not in negotiations to sell anything, nor have there been any
decisions to do so, although we are not committed to it forever.'
Trafalgar signalled its intention a year ago to leave the hotels business
but only at the right price.
It does not believe that time has arrived and does not see it arriving for
several years.
Its fleet of seven ships is also likely to remain unchanged for the
foreseeable future.
In spite of the disappointing result from property, Trafalgar wants to keep
its property and investment division to take advantage of recovery in the
UK.
In Sir Eric's opinion disposals are not needed to reclassify Trafalgar as a
specialised property, construction and engineering company.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Lex to buy Swan National retail arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEX SERVICE, a leading UK motor retailer, is to acquire the Swan National
motor group, the UK's 11th largest dealership concern, in a deal worth
around Pounds 46m.
Swan National motor group, the retail motor distribution arm of Swan
National, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the TSB banking group, has 23 UK
dealerships.
The deal will make Lex the second-largest publicly quoted car retail group
in the UK with 86 dealerships.
The planned acquisition is the latest move in a radical restructuring of UK
motor retailing. Late last year Inchcape, the international motor
distribution and motor retailing group, took over Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn
(TKM) making Inchcape one of the world's biggest independent car
distribution and retailing groups.
At the same time, the privately-owned AFG motor dealer group, controlled by
Mr Octav Botnar, reduced its 160-strong dealer network to 127 and aims to
retain more than 100 dealerships with a range of franchises.
Lex Service's planned takeover of Swan National motor group follows its
expected loss of the exclusive UK importer/distributorship for Volvo in the
UK.
Lex said the Swan National deal was conditional on the Volvo transaction,
worth a net Pounds 77m to Lex, being approved by its shareholders and given
clearance by the European Commission competition authorities.
Under the deal Lex will acquire the Swan National dealerships for Pounds 26m
in cash and repay inter-company loans of about Pounds 20m.
Swan National sold about 18,500 new vehicles in the year to the end of
September. It holds dealer franchises for Ford (4), Vauxhall (6), Peugeot
(3), Mercedes-Benz (3), and Rover (2) as well as single outlets for Fiat,
Jaguar, Land Rover, Renault and Volvo.
The acquisition of the Swan National operations would raise its share of the
UK new car market from 1.7 per cent to 2.6 per cent.
The existing Lex Retail group has a turnover of Pounds 594m, 3,600
employees, 57 dealerships and a sales volume of 27,000 new and 17,000 used
cars. Swan National has a turnover of Pounds 309m, 1,200 employees, 23
dealerships and a sales volume of 18,500 new cars and 7,400 used cars.

FT  07 MAY 92 / British Gas told to cut prices: Watchdog's tough line over
charges to domestic customers provokes row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS was told yesterday to cut its prices to 18m domestic customers
or face court action, prompting a further row between the company and Ofgas,
the industry's watchdog.
Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas director-general, demanded average cuts of Pounds
15 a year in household gas bills. If British Gas did not reduce charges, it
would break an agreement which came into force last month, he said.
British Gas said in March that it would freeze residential prices with a
view to cutting them later in the year. The company is bound by a tough
formula imposed by Sir James which limits price rises to 5 percentage points
below the rate of inflation.
Sir James said that, since inflation was forecast to remain at 4 per cent
this year, British Gas should cut prices now by up to 2p a therm.
'We are talking here about customers being knowingly overcharged,' he said.
British Gas said its decision to freeze prices was taken before the election
when the outlook for inflation was unclear. 'These prices are reviewed every
month and an adjustment can be made at any time,' the company said.
Nevertheless, British Gas said it was disappointed with the way the row had
broken, as the company had requested a meeting with Sir James to discuss
prices. Sir James said there was no need for a meeting as the need for a
price cut was so obvious.
'It looks like they're trying to hold on to their money as long as they
possibly can,' Sir James said. 'A price cut of up to 2p a therm was right at
the beginning of April and now needs to be introduced urgently.'
Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, welcomed Sir James'
initiative. 'This is a battle that neither side can afford to lose; the
outcome will prove whether or not British Gas puts profit before customer
commitment,' he said.
A cut of 2p a therm would trim Pounds 250m from British Gas's annual pre-tax
profit of over Pounds 1bn.
The stock market reacted immediately to the profits threat and the company's
share price had fallen 8p by mid-morning, but it recovered to close 2 1/2 p
down on the day at 262 1/2 .
British Gas said it did not want to be boxed in by making an early cut in
price, only to have to raise prices again if the inflation rate increased
later in the year. The company still wants a meeting with Ofgas to discuss
the issue.
Some analysts questioned Sir James's calculations on prices, saying they
were not consistent with the price formula. Rather than pointing to a
required price cut of as much as 2p a therm, the current level of inflation
indicated the need for a price cut of just 0.3p a therm, they argued.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 14 per cent jump in BAT's first-quarter pre-tax profits fully justifies
the re-rating which its shares have enjoyed this year. The question after
yesterday's 25p rise is whether investors ought to switch to one of the
composite insurers with which the group now tends to be compared. The
faint-hearted will cut and run ahead of a key US Supreme Court ruling on
tobacco liability expected this summer. But the scope for BAT to use its
relentless tobacco cash flow to increase dividends, combined with Eagle
Star's turnaround potential, more than merits a prospective 6 per cent
yield.

FT  07 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland's interim results ought to be encouraging news for
the banking industry as a whole. Bad debt provisions were lower than
expected and sharply below the preceding six months. But the trend should
not be exaggerated. Royal's provisions tend to be weighted towards the
second half of its business year. Those for the six months to March are
still 25 per cent ahead of the first half of 1990-91.
If that suggests caution about the pace of Royal's recovery, so should its
poor underlying profits. Operating income before provisions rose only 4.5
per cent. Admittedly this partly reflects more stringent treatment of
non-performing loans, but management appears optimistic in its expectations
for overheads and for financial services, which contributed only 16 per cent
of first half profits. Last, but not least, is the ominous ring to its
warning of a possible claim arising from transactions by a former customer
now in liquidation.
There are thus grounds for doubt about the real dividend growth which is
Royal's traditional attraction. It has plenty of spare capital to pay a
higher final this year from reserves if necessary. Indeed, selling
Charterhouse would improve ratios further. But the risk might then be that
low growth prospects in the UK would set it off on a spree in the US, where
Citizens Bank is obviously itching to expand.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stories of Trafalgar wanting out of Cunard and the Ritz are far from
fanciful, official denials notwithstanding. Here, it would seem, is a
company at the crossroads, anxious to throw off the unfashionable
conglomerate tag and focus investor attention on its newly enlarged and
probably underrated construction and engineering skills. After years of
dabbling in newspapers, luxury cruise ships and North Sea oil, a proper
Trafalgar identity may finally be to hand.
The actual restructuring process may not be so smooth. The market was
clearly disappointed by the vague commitment to sell peripheral assets,
which on top of the dividend cut left the shares 8 per cent lower at 147p.
No doubt it is hard for Sir Nigel Broackes to contemplate leisure and hotel
sales given the prices on offer, but Trafalgar's balance sheet raises the
question of whether the company will ultimately have much choice. Gearing by
the September year-end is likely to be 60 to 70 per cent and heading higher
 -in part due to working capital demands for construction and engineering -
just when the commercial property side may be needing new investment.
Another rights scarcely seems a realistic option.

<TEXT>
The market was largely unimpressed by yesterday's feisty reminder from Sir
James McKinnon that he is not about to let British Gas alone. But the
regulator was also threatening that the fundamental differences between the
two sides may yet develop from mere niggling into a full-blown monopoly
reference.
Even by its previous standards, Ofgas's challenge on domestic gas prices was
an aggressive and not fully merited swipe. Gas can fairly argue that when it
froze prices ahead of the election, it was working on a much more cloudy
inflation outlook. But that does not help its case while the two sides are
not talking. The threat is not that a price cut would be devastating for
Gas's profits. More worrying for investors is that the burden of regulatory
changes is starting to slow the company down. This could expose a strategic
problem. Gas has been trying to counteract domestic pressure by building an
exploration division and a global supply company. These businesses are
supposed to account for 60 per cent of profits by the end of the decade, but
already the weak oil price augurs badly. If that approach looks like
failing, the long-term progression of Gas's dividend will be in doubt. The
market might find that prospect rather more unnerving than yesterday's
sabre-rattling.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of the UK equity market continues to astonish. Since the
election, the FT-SE is up by more than 300 points, or 13 per cent. At the
time of the election result, the more bullish broking houses predicted 3,000
by the year end. The market is half way there already. It only needs another
150 points on the index for the return on equities to match that on cash
between now and the end of the year. Even now, the ratio of gilt yields to
equity yields is only just above two, which puts it at the low end of the
historic range. Over the past 12 months, the UK market has risen only half
as fast as Wall Street. Now that the UK economic recovery, like that of the
US, is tentatively established, can the FT-SE match the Dow by pressing into
record territory?
Part of the difficulty in answering lies in gauging overseas demand. US
buying was reportedly strong yesterday, presumably on the grounds that the
combination of interest rate cuts and a right-of-centre government appeals
to any US fund manager out to diversify away from a possibly overvalued
domestic market. But US investors have proved fickle already this year in
such modish sectors as pharmaceuticals. There is also the risk that UK
finance directors will be lured by these heady levels into cash calls, which
will fall mainly on the UK institutions. Given that the gilt market
recovered only modestly yesterday and that the money market still seems
sceptical about whether Tuesday's rate cut will hold, it may yet prove that
the equity market is more bullish than sober reflection can justify.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr DUNCAN I BROWN and Ms FIONA L BELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Dixon (Recruitment, April 29) considered why a recent opinion
survey carried out by the Wyatt Company showed a significant increase in the
proportion of employees intending to find a new job now in comparison with a
similar survey in 1988.
However, the conclusion that there is an increase in employees with 'itchy
feet', dissatisfied with their current jobs is not the only explanation
which can be drawn. Rather, it may be that in a more buoyant job market four
years ago, more employees thinking about a move could actually do so and
therefore fall out of the statistics. Nowadays, with continuing high
employment, many of those wanting a move for positive or negative reasons
can only stay put, waiting for a suitable opportunity - filling surveys
while they wait.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: A German example on competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNST STEINDORFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Jacques Calvet's personal view (April 30), as well as your report on
EC Commission proposals to subsidise training programmes in the automobile
industry ('Shake-up urged in EC car and aircraft sectors', April 30), are
hardly believable against the background of German experience.
Am I really being ideological or a 'competition fundamentalist' if I point
out that the German automobile industry has performed pretty well without
subsidies and without protection against Japanese competitors?
And is it on the basis of their experience and expertise that Mr Bangemann
and his staff conclude that the cause of the European industry's
inefficiency is simply lack of training? Or is it, rather, that political
activism and populism makes them want to spend taxpayers' money? Can they
really be sure that the deficiencies of industry and of specific companies
do not have their roots elsewhere, and that subsidies will not be a waste of
our money?
Or will they concentrate subsidies on those companies which, so far, have
performed best and can be expected, therefore, to make a good use of our
money?
Competition forces companies to rely on themselves. It is the only guarantee
against the states or the EC wasting money on an industrial policy they are
not qualified to handle. We must be aware that the evidence collected by
governments and as well as the Commission in support of such policies
regularly comes from those who have had no success and want to extricate
themselves from inefficiency at the expense of others.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: Prosecution not measure of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs LYNNE BEAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I welcome Nigel Wilkins' support (Letters, April 29) for the
introduction of penalties for the late filing of company accounts. However,
he incorrectly equates Companies House compliance effort with the number of
directors prosecuted. We aim to secure compliance with the filing
requirements of the Companies Act rather than to prosecute.
Companies House has an active compliance programme, which includes the issue
of letters and explanatory leaflets, regular roadshows and seminars around
the UK, national advertising campaigns, and a video. Where these measures
fail, we do, of course, prosecute.
But a truer measure of our success is the fact that, currently, 8 per cent
more companies are filed up-to-date than at the same time last year. This
figure is encouraging, but the introduction of late filing penalties should
be seen as an indication that Companies House is determined to improve upon
this figure even further. In this way, we can offer a better service to the
many customers who are entitled to the up-to-date information.

The curio of the day promises to be True Stories on C4 (9.30). When Dennis
O'Rourke's marriage broke up he went to Bangkok to make a programme about
different attitudes to love and sex. In a bar at 3am a pimp introduced him
to Aoi: 'Only 500 Baht, do anything you want, no worries'. O'Rourke stayed
in Bangkok for nine months, recorded Aoi's life and, according to the
billing, 'his feelings for her deepened into love'. He filmed the punters
and pimps as well as the bar girls and says of his programme that it is
'about prostitution as a metaphor for capitalism'. In the end he offered to
buy Aoi a rice farm because Aids had made her life so dangerous, but she
says that prostitution is her fate.
In the last of its BBC2 series Taking Liberties has yet another appalling
story in which tragedy was not only predictable but predicted. Two mentally
handicapped patients in Greaves Hall Hospital, Southport, were killed by
another patient during one weekend in 1991. It seems the parents of the
murderer had expressed disquiet every night for a week before these events
occurred and an external report had already called urgently for more staff
(8.00).

FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: Proms 1992 season announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven overseas orchestras, seven BBC commissions plus another ten
premieres, works by 104 composers of whom 23 are living and 22 (including
Handel) are British - the statistics of the 1992 Proms came spilling forth
from director John Drummond yesterday.
There will be 66 concerts (all at the Albert Hall) in the 58 eight day
season. It all starts on July 17 with the Princess of Wales in the audience
for a Verdi Requiem and it ends on September 12 with Dame Kiri singing
operatic arias - and 'Rule, Britannia ]'.
Among the highlights are the visits by the Vienna Philharmonic, under both
Abbado and Pierre Boulez, and the St Petersburg Philharmonic also with two
conductors, Jansons and Temirkanov; new works by Richard Rodney Bennett and
John Tavener; plenty of Rossini, including arrangements from his operas by
jazzman Mike Westbrook; and the British premiere of William Walton's suite
Christopher Columbus.
There will be more early music, slightly less opera this season, although
Glyndebourne will bring a semi-staged version of The Queen of Spades. Ticket
prices are only marginally higher than last year but the top price for 55 of
the concerts remains a reasonable Pounds 15.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: The Bacchae - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Buller (b. 1927), whose adaptation of Euripides's Bacchae is the latest
new opera to be presented by English National Opera, is an extraordinary and
peculiarly attractive figure among postwar British composers. He spent much
of his working life outside the world of music, as an architectural
surveyor, and came to it late, driven by personal need.
At least one piece on his short work-list - Proenca (1978), a tautly spun,
richly appealing stretch of orchestral song-setting from medieval Provencal
poetry - has already achieved international circulation. Buller's broad
intellectual interests have fed fertile imaginative inspiration into each
one of his artistic conceptions. The Theatre of Memory, the large orchestral
work first given at the 1981 Proms, may be seen as the direct ancestor of
the new opera in its marriage of ancient Greek theories of memory and
Renaissance conventions of drama.
Buller's insistence on the original ancient Greek words for his ENO Bacchae
 -already widely publicised  - should be seen not as a dotty elitist quirk,
but as consistent with an intense artistic response to the 'feel' of
language (as shown in Proenca), and with an out-of-time approach to
composition. It is no surprise to learn, from an interview in the programme,
that previously he had had no desire to write an opera at all, and that the
subject of his Bacchae was chosen as a sort of 'just response' to Henze's
Bassarids - a very different Euripides opera - as also mounted (in 1978) by
ENO.
For this, as shown at Tuesday's opening performance, is by no means a
straightforward new Bacchae opera to add to the 20th-century list. (Last
year Andrew Porter reported on the Stockholm premiere of Daniel Bortz's
Backanterna, produced by Ingmar Bergman, and in 1990 Andrew Clark described
the 1990 Bielefeld revival of Egon Wellesz's 1931 Bakchantinnen.) My gut
reaction, indeed, is that it is not really an opera at all but, rather, a
type of enacted Bacchae frieze, expertly arrayed, which may well come to be
more fittingly displayed in concert-hall circumstances.
It's hard to imagine a more confidently composed frieze. Buller, whose only
imposition on the play has been to condense it into an unbroken 100-minute
structure, avoids entirely the faults of inexperience - overscoring,
over-extension of material, uncertainties of pacing and word-setting - that
usually stamp first stage-works. The beguiling sound-world of this Bacchae
is its most memorable achievement: Lutoslawski-like in absolute cleanliness
of line, beautifully spaced and contrasted for both voices and instruments,
never clotted or uncertain of purpose or contour.
The work is planned in the form of 17 linked scenes, and marked out in
'realms' of distinct atmospheric texture - by, for example, Dionysus's
liquidly trickling celesta and woodwind, Pentheus's fractious brass consort,
or the frequent unisons and snapping intervallic leaps of the female chorus.
The main characters have their particular vocal styles; Dionysus and
Pentheus are both high tenors differently treated (Dionysus, in addition, is
the only character to use English, when speaking as a god rather than to the
other personages on stage).
Exotic, rather Roussel-like streams of modal harmony, motivic influences
from ancient Greek scales and a fastidious richness of colouristic detail
all aid in supplying the score with its highly individual patina. The
treatment of the play is coolly sophisticated, with absolutely none of the
Expressionist gesture-thrusting and Grand Opera noise-making that other
20th-century composers have thought fit for Greek subjects.
What to my mind this Bacchae lacks is any of the unrepeatable combustion of
dramatic subject and music that is the root characteristic of many different
kinds of opera. The effect of listening to an opera in a dead language is,
as we know from Stravinsky's 'opera-oratorio' Oedipus rex, to repose fullest
concentration upon the dramatic workings of the music. (The libretto
promises more interventions from a narrator than on Tuesday we were given.)
In this case, I felt that the result was to heighten awareness of an
oversimplification of the dramatic subject. With its long scenes built upon
immobile pedal points and its characterisation devoid of psychological
perspective, this seems to me a static Bacchae, whose presentation in a
theatre adds nothing 'kinetic' to my understanding of it, or of the
Euripides play.
By this I mean disrespect neither to the fine, confident musical realisation
under Martin Andre nor to the grippingly intelligent, economical ENO staging
by Julia Hollander in Hildegard Bechtler's rough-hewn angled-box set and
Nicky Gillibrand's bold costumes. The producer has devised a sinuous,
startlingly effective kind of sculptural body-language, derived from Indian
dance, which Dionysus and the Bacchantes employ to contrast with the bans.
This inspires Thomas Randle (Dionysus) to give a sensational performance,
glamorously embodied and lustrously sung, that is alone worth the ticket
price. Sarah Walker, whose mezzo Agave enters the scene only at the
seven-eighth point, sings with moving eloquence; the less obviously grateful
roles taken by respectively Graeme Matheson-Bruce, Gregory Yurisich and
Richard Van Allan with notable authority, and the singing of the nine-strong
female ensemble is thrilling.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doug Oughton, a director of Oscar Faber Consulting Engineers, is the first
chairman of the European Intelligent Building Group, which spreads the
message across the continent about the merits of what is termed
'intelligence' in building design and construction.
The EIBG grew out of the Intelligent Building Group, a co-operative that
claims to have gained considerable momentum in recent years. It counts among
its members consultant engineers such as Oscar Faber, architects including
DEGW, Lloyd's of London as a 'user', a selection of suppliers to the
building trade and a coterie of academics. The first European members in the
expanded operation include Legrand, the French electrical supplies
manufacturer.
Oughton, who is well known in the industry and a long-serving fellow of the
Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers, specialises in energy
conservation at Oscar Faber. He will be chairman of EIBG for a year.
While no-one can quite agree on a definition of exactly what constitutes the
intelligent building, Oughton stresses that it is more than state-of-the-art
technology. 'It is rather a case of looking at everything that improves the
productivity of the workplace.' The Lloyd's representative cites for
instance the dividends paid by flexibility - as when Lloyd's immediately
offered a workable home to the Baltic Exchange after the latter's City
premises were destroyed by the recent IRA bomb.
DEGW has just completed a 1,100 page study devoted to intelligent buildings
in Europe. While this started off as an IBG idea the group did not then have
the resources to effect it itself. Now it would, says Oughton, who says such
studies are an important way of influencing consultants.

FT  07 MAY 92 / People: Wakeling's move: 'routine tidying-up'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Wakeling, chief executive of Johnson Matthey, is stepping down from
the board of Charter Consolidated, JM's biggest shareholder. The move led to
renewed speculation that Charter might be close to deciding what to do with
its 38.5 per cent stake in JM which is worth more than half Charter's stock
market capitalisation.
However, Charles Parker, who is the remaining Charter man on the JM board,
describes the move as a 'routine tidying up operation'. Wakeling, 45, had
been Charter's acting chief executive before moving across to JM as part of
a major management shake-up of Charter's most important affiliate.
Parker says Charter is happy with JM's performance and described the
relationship between the two companies as 'really stable'. He says there are
no plans to nominate additional Charter directors to the JM board and notes
Wakeling's appointment as a non-executive director of Costain.
Nevertheless, Wakeling's departure is a further sign of the growing
independence of the two groups. David Davies, JM's chairman, used to be
deputy chairman of Charter but no longer sits on the Charter board. Charter
has net cash of Pounds 130m and if it chose to sell its JM stake, which
provides around a third of its profits, it could have close to Pounds 400m
to spend on an acquisition.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Desert island discs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's commercial television viewers may be surprised to see a 30-second
advertisement promoting the services of Andersen Consulting sandwiched
between promotions for instant coffee and cars.
In the advertisement, a man stranded on a desert island finds a wooden crate
containing a desktop computer. The castaway ingeniously constructs a raft
from the crate and paddles off towards the horizon - using the computer
keyboard as an oar.
The message - echoed in newsprint and poster adverts featuring the slogan
'metamorphosis in a world of change' - is that Andersen Consulting can help
its clients profit from change.
The campaign is evidence of increasing competition among management
consultants, particularly in technology, which is attracting not just the
big management consultants, but also computer hardware and systems
companies.
Although similar marketing campaigns by service companies are familiar in
the US, they are only just catching on in Europe.
However, most of Andersen's competitors are dubious about the value of
television advertising, which they argue can be useful to promote knowledge
of a firm's name, but is ineffective in generating new business.
Keith Burgess, Andersen's UK managing partner, says the Pounds 1m-plus
mass-media campaign is aimed at raising general awareness of Andersen
Consulting. 'We want people to know we are not just another (consultancy)
arm of an accounting firm,' he says.
Because the firm's consultancy work in the public and private sectors
directly affects thousands of workers, Burgess also hopes the campaign will
convey 'our personality' to a wide audience.
One of Andersen's press advertisement juxtaposes the artist Jackson
Pollock's style of 'abstract expressionism' with the 'realism' of Roy
Lichtenstein in order to show how the complex abstract can be transformed
into the tangible.
Burgess is delighted with the 'metamorphosis theme' which he says 'gets
across what we are trying to do with our clients'.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Turning to
television for the power and the glory - How a Scottish electricity group is
planning to broadcast its message to shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Preston, chief executive of the recently-privatised Scottish Power, is
built with the solidity of one of his power stations.
He does not look the sort of man who throws money around lightly. 'Prudent
is the word,' he says.
Yet the practical Preston has recently been spending time in the media
village of London's Soho discussing new ways of getting his message across.
In July, Scottish Power will become the first user of The Business Channel,
which will use BBC television transmitters in the early hours of the morning
to broadcast corporate meetings.
A half-hour edited version of Scottish Power's 1992 annual general meeting
on July 29 will be broadcast at 5.30 the next morning. And although the
programme may catch a few early risers, the main hope is that people will
record it and watch it later.
Scottish Power's agm is not going to make much of a splash in the ratings
but Preston hopes it might help to solve a rather tricky problem - how to
communicate with his 900,000 shareholders.
The company - the first big privatisation in Scotland  - has shareholders
all over the UK. Although some of the original shareholders are likely to
sell, Preston believes his permanent roster is likely to be around 750,000.
Preston is afraid that many of the company's letters or brochures 'arrive
with the junk mail and many get the same kind of treatment'. He was
initially sceptical about The Business Channel, run as a joint venture
between a new company, BMH Communications, and BBC Select, the subscription
television arm of the Corporation.
BMH was set up by Bryan Hall, the film producer who believes that eventually
it could be broadcasting up to 250 hours a year on both BBC 1 and BBC 2
between 2am and 6am.
'I think we have all warmed to the idea as we began to think what the pluses
are in communicating with both shareholders and staff,' said Preston.
The half-hour programme will cost Scottish Power Pounds 30,000, not
including production costs, but for that they will be able to show an
eight-minute corporate video as well as the highlights of the meeting all
over the UK, albeit it an unearthly hour.
Preston is determined that the programme will be 'a fair representation of
what takes place. Otherwise there is no point in it'.
If there is a riot at the agm in Glasgow that will be shown too.
The programme will be listed in both the Radio Times and TV Times but
Scottish Power will also publicise its experiment in corporate
communications to try to make sure as many shareholders set their video
recorders as possible.
BMH says it is talking to a number of large companies about using the new
channel. Under the agreement with the BBC, it is possible to broadcast any
valid public meeting whether annual or extraordinary or part of a campaign
to fight-off a predator.
Straight advertising of products is not allowed but a meeting to launch a
new range of products or fashions to buyers could be broadcast on The
Business Channel using BBC transmitters.
Preston views his move into national television very much as an experiment
and will be watching carefully to see what kind of audience and reaction he
gets to Scottish Power: The AGM.
Before he hands out another Pounds 30,000, the Scottish Power chief
executive will want to be sure the message was spread a bit more widely than
at his first agm last year when the company catered for an audience of 6,000
and actually got 600.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Business Law: Tangled skein of tax adjustments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH FLOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The differing legal systems and currency fluctuations of nations create
burdens on cross-border investment and commerce. These discrepancies often
cause the greatest inefficiencies when they involve the taxation of
international business transactions.
Most developed countries have long recognised the seriousness of tax
inefficiencies and have adopted a network of bilateral tax treaties, based
on models developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, which are intended to reduce the potential for double taxation
of income from cross-border transactions.
The US has been a leader in this effort but, over the past several years,
has pursued a course that, if not properly contained, has the potential
fundamentally to undermine these arrangements.
The US Internal Revenue Service has become increasingly concerned that many
foreign-owned US companies are systematically under-allocating the portion
of their worldwide income that should properly be attributable to sales and
other activities in the US.
The source of this IRS concern is data gathered in the late 1980s which tend
to establish that foreign-controlled US corporations earn a substantially
lower rate of return in the US than do US-controlled companies.
IRS data indicate that while US-controlled corporations had a ratio of
taxable income to assets ranging from 1.6 per cent to 1.9 per cent during
the period 1983-87, the ratio for foreign-owned US corporations ranged from
minus 0.2 per cent to plus 0.8 per cent.
There are plausible explanations for statistical discrepancies: the fact
that many foreign-owned US companies were acquired within the past decade
and thus have relatively high book asset values; that foreign investors may
be willing to accept a lower return to gain market share in the US; and so
on. But US Treasury and academic economists have not been able to establish
to their satisfaction a statistical basis for any alternative explanations
to the under-allocation of worldwide income to the US.
Responding in part to this data, the IRS has assigned a large part of its
audit and legal staff to foreign-owned US company cases. These auditors are
often aggressive, and suspicious of the audited taxpayer. This has resulted
in cases that are beginning to overload IRS administrative appeals channels
and the US Tax Court.
The IRS readily admits that dealing with these cases through litigation is
inefficient and prefers to resolve them through government-to-government
negotiations under the so-called 'competent authority' provisions of various
bilateral US tax treaties.
The average competent authority case requires two to four years to be
resolved. Because resolution requires the voluntary agreement of both
governments and the taxpayer, success is unlikely unless the foreign
government is willing to refund a portion of any tax payments made to it by
the parent multinational as an offset to the US adjustment.
The US and Japan, for example, agreed in the late 1980s to competent
authority settlements resulting in Japanese refund payments for Toyota,
Nissan and Honda that have been reported to total hundreds of millions of
dollars for each company. Since that experience, Japan's National Tax
Administration has been reluctant to accommodate further US adjustments.
It is thus difficult to see how voluntary competent authority proceedings
are likely to resolve the flood of IRS-initiated adjustments.
It may not be long before other governments decide to follow the IRS example
and initiate their own adjustments against US-based multinationals. The
revenue stakes are potentially enormous. The techniques developed by the IRS
to analyse the activities of foreign-based multinationals can readily be
applied by foreign governments to US-based companies. Given that US tax
rates are generally lower than those of other leading industrial countries,
it is possible that any corporate under-allocation of income to non-resident
jurisdiction applies outside as well as inside the US.
The problem results in part from the internationally agreed tax rules for
related party cross-border transactions, which were largely developed in the
1960s. These rules establish the standard of 'arm's length' dealings between
related parties.
The quest is to determine what unrelated parties dealing with each other at
arm's length would have charged for the relevant goods, services or use of
intangibles. Finding persuasive evidence of what such unrelated parties
would have charged in similar circumstances is often impossible. Many
industries, such as cars, electronics and pharmaceuticals, are dominated by
integrated companies where there are few transactions between unrelated
parties at the same level of trade.
Moreover, multinational related parties enter into specific arrangements
that unrelated parties are often unwilling or unable to obtain - such as
exclusive supply and purchase arrangements or long-term licences of existing
and future technology.
Finally, the efficiencies and long-term perspective of many integrated
multinational corporations often make their expectations of returns in
specific markets at any given time much different from those of an
independent company doing business only in a few geographic markets.
For these reasons, no third-party transaction prices or formula for
determining prices can be identified as correct for any particular
multinational. Instead, a broad range of prices is likely to command nearly
equal merit, even though the price chosen within that range has a
substantial impact on the allocation of income between taxing jurisdictions.
In this setting, IRS auditors can identify a set of reasonably correct
prices that create a substantial allocation of income to the US during the
years under audit. Similarly, in a wide variety of cases, other governments
can no doubt identify adjustments that create a substantial income
re-allocation to their country. Thus new solutions to income allocation
disputes are required.
One possible approach has recently been implemented on a trial basis by the
IRS. It is a procedure for advance pricing agreements (called APAs) among
the IRS, relevant foreign governments and a specific multinational taxpayer.
Each agreement would apply for three or more years subject to further
renewal. It can cover the pricing of specific transactions involving goods,
services or intangibles or can establish a more global allocation of income
generally between two or more related entities.
The IRS has discussed this procedure with various foreign governments and
has found a willingness to entertain negotiations for specific agreements
from Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK, among others. The first
agreement has recently been completed, involving a US-based manufacturer and
its sales affiliate resident in Australia.
This APA procedure holds out much hope as a prototype for avoiding the
spread of inter-company pricing controversies. It is customised to each
taxpayer's circumstances, permitting the creation of specific formulas for
pricing and income allocation that meet realistic expectation of the revenue
authorities of each country.
Because any agreement is achieved in advance of the years in question, the
APA procedure resolves a problem with the current system: the fact that
governments are reluctant to part with revenues that have already been
collected.
Moreover, if the procedure is applied to a large enough group of taxpayers,
a series of informal guidelines may evolve that can be applied on a broader
industry or other basis. Over time, elements of agreed standards might be
developed to apply even to taxpayers not choosing to participate in an APA
procedure.
Any solution to current problems will only work if foreign governments
perceive that their interests are served as well. If that perception is
developed through negotiation, a source of potentially serious tax barriers
to cross-border commerce can be eliminated.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Edinburgh award takes on business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Duke of Edinburgh award scheme, which operates in more than 50
countries, is branching out into the business world and getting a facelift
in the process.
The London design company Basten Greenhill Andrews (BGA) has designed a new
logo and a new element in the award - the Charter for Business  - was
launched yesterday. It is a response to companies which are increasingly
calling for business-oriented skills from young school leavers.
The original scheme started in 1956 and so far about 1.25m participants have
been awarded badges and certificates.
Participants undertake voluntary activities for the completion of which they
may win bronze, silver or gold awards - as well as a claim to personal
achievement.
The scheme is almost entirely funded by business contributions, including
membership fees to an exclusive golf club. Last year Pounds 4m all told was
raised.
Ten companies - Mars, Rover, Glaxo, Kwik-Fit, Bernard Matthews, Halina,
Compaq, Littlewoods, Philips and TNT - have joined the new Charter for
Business to promote it in the workplace.
For the past 18 months Mr Jim Andrews, BGA's managing director, has worked
with Mr Robin Wight, chairman of the advertising agency WCRS, Mr Bob Clarke,
chairman of the business film production company Visage, and the scheme's
small staff to attract business support.
The companies have undertaken to recruit 100,000 new young people from
business as members of the award scheme over the next five years. They have
committed themselves to promoting, supporting and developing the scheme. Mr
Andrews hopes that more companies will join.
According to Mr Eric Worrell, deputy chairman of the scheme, the companies
did not wish to disclose what cash they were putting into the new charter.
'But they have all been very supportive,' he said.
The companies had various reasons for joining the scheme. Some were
'genuinely philanthropic' and others worried about their own young
employees.
All were keen to employ people who could demonstrate personal initiative and
tenacity. 'The gold award means giving up two hours a week for two years,
and the great thing about it is that it is something young people do in
their own time,' Mr Worrell said.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Engineers urge better technology teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN 'EIGHT-POINT plan' to promote technology teaching in schools was put
forward yesterday by the Engineering Council.
The plan calls for a practical technology curriculum, based on the design
and manufacture of products and systems. It is written by Professor Alan
Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of Manchester University's education
department.
They say technology is poorly taught in schools in spite of its inclusion as
a core subject in the national curriculum. It is mainly concerned with
generalised problem solving without specific knowledge or practical
application.
'Technology lacks an identity in the national curriculum,' they say. 'But
Britain is the first country to make technology part of the compulsory
curriculum for all pupils aged five to 16 . . . and some false starts are
perhaps inevitable.'
The report points to the difficulty experienced in devising suitable
technology assignments as part of the compulsory tests being introduced for
14-year-olds.
Mr Denis Filer, director general of the Engineering Council, told a press
conference that the plan had to be implemented if school technology 'is to
be given credibility and respect among the community at large and with
industry'.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Fininvest pulls out of contest for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FININVEST Group, controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian TV
entrepreneur, yesterday said it would no longer submit a bid for the Channel
5 television licence, which is scheduled to start broadcasting by early
1995.
Its decision leaves The Entertainment Channel, a consortium of TV-am - the
UK commercial breakfast broadcaster linked with the Daily Telegraph group -
and Time Warner, and Five TV, a company backed by Mr Moses Znaimer, founder
of City TV in Toronto, as the declared intended bidders. Bids must be lodged
with the Independent Television Commission by July.
Most estimates suggest that at least Pounds 200m is needed to launch Channel
5. Some critics suggest Fininvest might not have sufficient resources.
Yesterday's decision is believed to be related to the uncertainty in Italian
politics.

TODAY 3,798 council seats will be contested as about 23m voters are able to
give their first political opinion since the general election.
There are no contests in London, while all the 53 Scottish districts are
being fought. Four of the 37 Welsh districts are being contested.
A third of the seats are to be contested in all England's 36 metropolitan
areas and 114 of the 296 non-metropolitan districts.
The seats were last contested in 1988, which left Labour with 1,286, the
Conservatives with 943 and the Liberal Democrats with 303.
The opposition parties have a strong showing in town halls. Only one of
England's metropolitan districts is Tory-controlled. Labour has 69 per cent
of all metropolitan district councillors and the Tories controlling just 18
per cent of seats.

A CONSPICUOUS absentee from the Queen's Speech was any commitment to set up
an Environment Agency, as promised in the Tory election manifesto.
This is a thought to result from a disagreement between the Department of
the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture over who should be
responsible for water pollution controls.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, said the omission showed
'just how shallow is the Conservative commitment to the green agenda'.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Queen's Speech: Freeing the market for milk - Agricultural
marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE drawn-out process of bringing to a close the Milk Marketing Board's
60-year-old monopoly right to buy milk appears to be gathering pace.
The announcement in the Queen's Speech that legislation would 'be introduced
to promote improvements in agricultural marketing' is mainly aimed at the
reform of the MMB - a long-term aim of the government.
Shortly after the election last month, and only a few days before the
government's Easter deadline, the MMB submitted to the Agriculture Ministry
its plans to turn itself into a single voluntary co-operative with pooled
prices. The ministry said the legislation would be intended to help the
MMB's move 'to a new structure better able to protect the interests of
producers and consumers in the European single market.'
The ministry has not yet made a formal response to the plans, which will
also have to be approved by the European Commission.
The MMB, which has put up stiff resistance to reforming itself, was debating
the reforms for two years. The plans include the spinning off of Dairy
Crest, its wholly owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent share of the UK's
manufactured dairy products market.
Yesterday Mr Bob Steven, MMB chairman, said: 'In changing a structure that
has existed for nearly 60 years, future legislation must seek to preserve as
many benefits of the current system as possible.' It must give farmers and
dairy companies 'a fair opportunity to adapt their businesses to changed
circumstances,' he added.
Legislation is also being introduced to end government guarantees for the
Potato Marketing Board and British Wool Marketing Board intervention
schemes. The government has not spent any money on the potato scheme since
1984, but the ministry said yesterday that the wool scheme had cost Pounds
40m last year.
However, the wool board said yesterday it was well prepared for the end of
the wool scheme, as the government first announced its intention to reform
it at the opening of the previous Parliament.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Queen's Speech (Analysis): Push for personal provision -
Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S legislative programme heralded few surprises on the
pensions front. Indeed, it may have been more notable for what it did not
say about pensions than what it did.
The speech made no reference to pension law reform - an issue that had been
rising on the political agenda since the disappearance of more than Pounds
400m from pension funds controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Instead, it focused exclusively on personal pensions. As foreshadowed in
February by the then social security minister, Mr Tony Newton, the
government has pledged to maintain the increase in personal pensions which
its tax breaks first inspired in 1988. The 2 per cent incentive payment to
those opting out of the government's State Earnings Related Pension Scheme,
which expires in April 1993, will be replaced by a more modest rebate of 1
per cent on tax payments. Only those over the age of 30 - roughly 40 per
cent of the nation's 4.6m personal pension holders  - will benefit from the
new rebate.
The total cost of the new rebate, at Pounds 175m per year, is considerably
below the estimated Pounds 685m annual cost of the current pension incentive
payment.
The rebate will apply to the national insurance payments of individuals
between the lower and upper wage bands (currently between Pounds 54 and
Pounds 405 a week). At best, this will cut an individual's payments by
Pounds 182.52 per year under the current tax structure.
The Department of Social Security says the new lower tax incentive is
intended to run for 'at least three years', suggesting that no more efforts
to tinker with private social security schemes are envisaged.
The new 1 per cent incentive payment has angered occupational pension
schemes, the members of which will not benefit from it. The National
Association of Pension Funds, the trade body representing those schemes, has
condemned the policy, saying it unfairly promotes private pensions at the
expense of employer-sponsored plans.

GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas notched up his biggest victory margins of
the electoral season in three primaries on Tuesday, and is now within sight
of a first-ballot nomination to be the Democratic party's presidential
candidate.
He won 74 per cent of the vote in the District of Columbia, 64 per cent in
North Carolina and 63 per cent in Indiana, picking up 144 of the 178
convention delegates allocated on Tuesday. He now has about 1,740 delegates
of the 2,145 needed for the nomination, with about 1,100 still to be
selected.
In DC and North Carolina, Mr Jerry Brown, his only active challenger, failed
to pass the 15 per cent vote threshold and won no delegates. He conceded the
numbers were running heavily in Mr Clinton's favour but promised to take his
cause to the final primaries, including his native California, on June 2.
For President George Bush, already mathematically assured of the Republican
nomination, the biggest satisfaction was his 71-20 per cent margin of
victory in North Carolina over Mr Patrick Buchanan, who put in two weeks of
solid campaigning in the state.
Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate who is on no primary
ballot, appeared to attract the support of about 25 per cent of those
interviewed in Indiana and North Carolina.

THE US economy is picking up but the recovery is uneven, the Federal Reserve

The latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions by the Fed's 12 district
banks gave a guarded assessment of the economy. The report said
manufacturing had picked up in most parts of the country, along with home
construction, although the rate of building appeared to have slowed.
Many districts had reported gains in retail sales and more optimism among
retailers about future sales. Loan demand was beginning to increase, but it
remained uneven. Most banks across the country reported an increase in
mortgage originations and a slowdown in refinancings. Demand for
non-mortgage loans was soft.
On inflation, the report said producer and consumer prices were generally
stable.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Japan announces big increase in payments surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus for March more than trebled to Dollars
13.58bn (Pounds 7.6bn), bringing the surplus for the 1991 fiscal year to
Dollars 90bn, a 167 per cent increase and a likely source of trade friction
with Washington.
The leap in the surplus, which was not far below the peak of Dollars 94bn in
1986, included a record surplus of Dollars 113bn in the trade account, and
is expected to prompt renewed international demands that Japan stimulate a
slowing domestic economy.
Balance of payment figures released by the finance ministry also showed the
long-term capital account had a surplus of Dollars 40bn for fiscal 1991, a
turnaround from a deficit of Dollars 16.8bn in the previous year and the
first surplus since 1980.
The surplus followed a sharp increase in foreign net purchases of Japanese
securities, which rose from Dollars 60bn in 1990 to Dollars 101bn, and a
smaller rise in Japanese net purchases of foreign securities, up from
Dollars 48.8bn to Dollars 61bn.
Bonds were Japanese investors' main target, as net purchases of foreign
stocks fell from Dollars 847m to only Dollars 118m, while foreign capital
was used to purchase a net Dollars 36.77bn in Japanese stocks, up from
Dollars 15.92bn in fiscal 1990.
Finance ministry officials said the current account surplus had peaked, and
blamed the surge in March surplus on the payment of Japan's Dollars 9bn
contribution to the Gulf War effort in the same month last year. But the
government fears that the large total for Japan's 1991 fiscal year, which
runs to the end of March 1992, will be an easy target for foreign criticism
of Japanese trade and fiscal policies.
Mr Matthew Berlow, economist at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan), said
that the large current account surplus, in theory, should have been
accompanied by an outflow of capital from Japan, but foreigners' purchases
of Japanese securities in recent months had upset the trend.
'In the longer term, these figures must even out. There has been a lot of
fears about Japanese pulling money out, but they are still buying foreign
securities. We will have to see what happens in April,' Mr Berlow said.
Japanese direct investment in 1991 was Dollars 23.6bn, down from Dollars
44.9bn, showing the effects of tougher financial conditions at home and the
international recession. Foreign direct investment in Japan, as recorded by
the ministry, doubled from a year earlier but was still a mere Dollars
2.2bn.
The Japanese deficit in invisible trade, including tourism, fell 14.5 per
cent from 1990 to Dollars 19.2bn, following an increase in transfers to
Japan of investment income. In the overall balance of payments, the surplus
soared from Dollars 961m in 1990 to Dollars 114bn.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Hekmatyar halts assault on Kabul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KABUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL Mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar halted his assault on Kabul
yesterday so that peace talks could be held with his rivals in the new
Mujahideen government.
Mr Hekmatyar's five-man delegation demanded, among other things, that
President Sigbutulla Mojaddedi's powers to select cabinet ministers be
eliminated.
He also wants an 8,000-man Uzbek militia backing his chief rival, defence
minister Ahmad Shah Massoud, to leave the capital region.
Mr Massoud's chief deputy, Mr Abdur Rahaman, said in an interview that the
ruling 51-member council would negotiate with Mr Hekmatyar, 'but one-way
demands are not reasonable. He should accept the decisions of the council.'
Mr Masoud's political leader, Mr Berhanuddin Rabbanni, who will assume the
nation's presidency in six weeks, is expected to meet Mr Hekmatyar on the
outskirts of Kabul today.
The peace talks are expected to lead to Mr Hekmatyar's admission to the
interim government in some form.
Although Mr Hekmatyar had appeared to isolate himself from nearly all major
Mujahideen leaders by continuing to fight despite Kabul's fall two weeks
ago, it has become clear that his rivals are not ready to sever ties with
him.
This means that a member of Mr Hekmatyar's organisation, Hezb-i-Islami, will
probably assume the post of prime minister. Mr Hekmatyar has nominated one
of his northern commanders, Ustad Fareed, to take the position, and he seems
to have been accepted by most of the rebel factions participating in the
government.
Analysts believe Mr Massoud is reconciled to his bitter enemy joining the
government, but that he would like to delay the move as long as possible.
'Masoud doesn't want to annihilate Hekmatyar. Basically his strategy is to
weaken him sufficiently, then let him join the government,' said an Asian
diplomat.
Mr Hekmatyar, 39, is believed to have huge stockpiles of weapons from his 14
years as the chief recipient of Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5bn) in US aid to the
Mujahideen. A gifted organiser and orator with fierce determination, Mr
Hekmatyar has been able to stall and bully his way into powerful positions
throughout the war.
Meanwhile, Mr Abdul Wakil, the deposed regime's foreign minister, was said
to have fled to Tashkent. Mr Wakil became the face of the government after
ex-president Najibullah went into hiding.

THE Reserve Bank of Australia yesterday cut official interest rates for the
12th time since 1990, ignoring signs that recovery from 18 months of
economic stagnation or decline is already under way.
The Bank announced a cut of one percentage point in official cash rates to
6.5 per cent, the lowest since the mid-1970s. Rates have now been cut by
11.5 percentage points since peaking at 18 per cent in January 1990.
Mr Bernie Fraser, the reserve bank governor, said the cut was justified by
zero growth in the consumer price index in the three months to the end of
March. Inflation is currently 1.7 per cent a year.
Mr Fraser said the economic recovery was uneven, and forecast that excess
capacity would restrain upward pressure on prices. 'A reduction in rates
will help business cash flow, and provide some encouragement (to companies)
to undertake new investments,' he said.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal Treasurer (finance minister), said inflation
expectations were on 'a downward trend,' and forecast that inflation would
average less than 2 per cent for the remainder of 1992.
Mr Dawkins said the outlook for inflation would be 'very important for the
future stance of monetary policy.' He said the government 'will stand ready
to increase rates if circumstances require.'

THE Hong Kong government yesterday disclosed that its budget surplus for
last year was HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 437m) higher than its provisional
figure, revealed in March.
The extra Dollars HK6bn brings the budget surplus for 1991/1992 to more than
Dollars HK20bn.
Legislative councillors expressed concern over the government's apparent
inability to keep track of its finances.
Financial secretary Mr Hamish MacLeod's statement on the windfall surplus
was accompanied by a concession on his first budget.
He said he would not raise property rates by half a point to 6 per cent, as
proposed in his maiden budget speech two months ago.
A number of legislative councillors had said earlier that they would vote
against the rates increase, in spite of opposition by Mr MacLeod to any
tampering with his first budget.
He told the Legislative Council yesterday that the decrease in revenue was
'roughly equivalent' to the windfall surplus.

ANGOLA'S transition to multi-party elections at the end of September is in
jeopardy, the country's opposition Unita movement warned yesterday.
In a strongly worded statement which reflects increasing tension between the
two parties, Unita accused the MPLA government of 'deliberate delay' in
implementing a programme scheduled to culminate in Angola's first democratic
poll since independence in 1975.
It cited the government's failure to establish a National Electoral
Commission, or to appoint an election commissioner. The government had also
failed to provide guidelines for voter registration, due to begin this
month.
This criticism is echoed by western diplomats and UN officials who are
monitoring the transition programme. Government inaction is attributed to a
weak bureaucracy rather than a lack of political will, but there are growing
doubts about the country's ability to meet the election timetable.
Western officials also fear that the monitoring exercise is under-staffed
and inadequately financed. The Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m) budget and
600-strong UN force is well short of what the exercise requires, they say,
pointing out that Angola's 10m population is scattered across a country five
times larger than the UK.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Tired Nigerian leadership battling to limit economic damage:
How Lagos must strive for fiscal stability while attempting to bring about a
smooth transition to civilian rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH just eight months to go before he hands over power to an elected
civilian administration, Nigeria's President Ibrahim Babangida has lost his
image as the mercurial Maradona of Nigerian politics.
Instead, a tired, leaden-footed administration is battling to contain the
impact of depressed oil prices, the ravages of rampant inflation, a
generation of fiscal irresponsibility and an unsustainable debt burden,
domestic as well as foreign.
On the economic front, his government is preoccupied with damage limitation
while still determined to ensure that the transition to civilian rule goes
ahead as smoothly as possible.
The brave, if unavoidable, March 5 decision to devalue the Naira from N10.5
to the dollar to the current rate of N18.6 brought down the wrath of vested
interests on the President's head.
The timing was doubly unfortunate; coming after a period of excessive
monetary growth, the inflationary impact has been lethal.
The latest official figures show inflation running at 29 per cent in January
in the wake of 1991 credit growth of over 40 per cent.
Devaluation was seized upon by all and sundry as justification for sharp
price increases, and according to one survey, retail prices rose 12 per cent
during March alone.
Devaluation was all the more unfortunate too, since after a decade of
stagnating living standards and nearly six years of structural adjustment,
it was hailed by the administration's many critics as concrete evidence of
the decisive failure of economic reform.
Nor has a subsequent series of own goals helped matters. In a newspaper
interview, the President said he kept asking his advisers 'why the Nigerian
economy has not collapsed until now', adding: 'I have still not found an
answer'.
In a statement tying the hands of his officials who at the time were
negotiating a standby agreement with the IMF, the President ruled out any
increase in the domestic price of petrol - currently less than four US cents
a litre.
The sensitivity of the issue has been underlined over the past few days. The
riots that broke out on Sunday were over fuel shortages rather than the fuel
price but Nigeria's history shows that any increase in petrol pump prices
provokes an angry reaction.
The pricing issue, he said, was best left to the future civilian government
to resolve - confirmation, as critics were quick to point out, of his
administration's lame-duck character.
Government hypersensitivity to criticism was reflected in the two-week long
closure of Concord press, whose news magazine African Concord's critical
17-page survey of the economy has been banned.
As time runs out, crisis management is the only strategy to hand. Western
diplomats and bankers believe the best Nigeria can expect in talks with the
IMF is a year-long standby which might just enable the government to secure
a conventional debt-rescheduling agreement from the Paris Club of official
creditors before the handover in January.
Although Nigeria is now eligible for an IMF Extended Structural Adjustment
Facility, (ESAF), negotiations for such a concessional facility must await
the emergence of a new administration that can take a three-year view of the
economic situation.
In last week's negotiations in Washington with the Fund, the Nigerian team
apparently had little to offer. Naira devaluation removed the major
obstacle, but agreement on fiscal management is likely to be extraordinarily
difficult, especially given the probability that in its final months in
power the Babangida administration will seek to buy off its
increasingly-vocal opponents.
With inflation set to reach 50 per cent later in the year, according to
local economists, the government will come under intense pressure to grant
compensatory pay awards to public servants. Wage inflation is already on the
march in the private sector as employers react to the post-devaluation price
surge.
Weak though Nigeria's bargaining hand may be, the Fund negotiators are also
in a bind. If they press too hard for Nigerian concessions especially on the
entirely rational but intensely emotive issue of phasing out the petroleum
subsidy, they run the risk of being accused of contributing to civil unrest
that could derail the return to democracy.
At the same time, both the IMF and the World Bank know that throughout the
main flaw in their Nigerian game plan has been their inability to achieve
fiscal stability. It is not just a matter of the size of the budget deficit
nor the manner of its financing, but the lack of accountability and
transparency in public spending programmes.
Fiscal policy is the key to short-term stability too. Devaluation in March
did no more than bring the official - subsidised - exchange rate into line
with that ruling in the marketplace.
Although officials claim to have deregulated the foreign exchange market,
bankers say that the rate is still being closely managed.
'Its now a fixed rate system,' said one Lagos banker; 'pegged at N18.6 to
the dollar, despite strong fluctuations in the demand for foreign currency'.
The Central Bank no longer publishes the details of the weekly foreign
exchange auction, though it does announce the exchange rate and how much
currency is being sold.
Money market liquidity has tightened a great deal since March largely
because the banks now need almost twice as many Naira to buy their dollar
requirements, but also because the Central Bank issued N5 billion (Dollars
269m) of stabilisation securities to mop up excess liquidity.
This might result in brief respite for the Naira though it may soon be
overtaken by escalating inflation on one hand and increased public spending
on the other.
The familiar Nigerian syndrome of the central bank trying to contain
inflation while the government spends as if there were no tomorrow seems all
too likely to repeat itself during the administration's dying months.
Donors insist that any debt-relief package must be linked to a
closely-monitored reform programme agreed, not with a lame-duck military
administration, but with the incoming civilians. As one donor put it bluntly
last week: 'There is nothing in this administration's recent track record to
merit Trinidad-style debt-relief terms.'
With so little room for manoeuvre on either side both the IMF and the
government seems set to fudge the issues. Its clear that Nigeria cannot meet
its debt-service obligations - of more than Dollars 5bn during 1992 - from
export earnings of around Dollars 9bn.
A one-year IMF standby and a conventional Paris Club rescheduling would
avoid a new build-up in arrears, giving the incoming civilians the breathing
space - but no more than that - to try and put together a coherent economic
strategy.
But in the run-up to the national assembly elections in mid-year and the
presidential primaries in September there is little evidence to suggest that
more than one or two of the literally dozens of presidential aspirants yet
accepts that, whoever wins in December, will have to continue to implement
the military government's highly unpopular economic reforms.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: OECD in campaign to harmonise export
credit insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
launched a campaign to reduce huge differences in export credit insurance
premiums charged by its members, which distort free competition in sales
from the industrialised to the developing world. OECD headquarters in Paris
has invited trade officials from its 24 member countries to meet next autumn
to share information on 'six or seven' Third World countries, to which the
costs of export credit insurance vary widely between different OECD
exporters.
Meetings to exchange information on commercials risks in other Third World
markets are expected to follow.
Officials are unwilling to give precise examples of which countries charge
too little or too much.
However, a recent OECD study shows that premiums on export credit insurance
to one African country vary between OECD members from a minimum of 6 per
cent to a maximum of 26 per cent of contract value.
'It is complete chaos. There are very large differences which are
commercially inexplicable,' said an official.
If the meetings are successful, OECD officials believe export credit
insurance premiums within the industrialised bloc should converge over the
next few years.
Patchy information on Third World market risks accounts for most of the
differences, said an OECD expert.
The study shows no evidence of attempts by the governments of exporting
countries to subsidise overseas sales by encouraging providers of export
credit guarantees - often state-owned  - to charge unrealistically low
premiums.
However, the move is consistent with a separate OECD campaign which is aimed
at preventing governments from mixing aid funds with commercial credits, so
as to win export markets.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel says 'fatigue' is new danger

THE Uruguay Round faces the danger of unravelling because of 'fatigue,
frustration, disenchantment and missed deadlines', Mr Arthur Dunkel,
director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), said
in Lausanne yesterday.
Addressing the Business Council for Sustainable Development, Mr Dunkel
called for trade negotiators to 'display political courage' by recognising
that nothing can be achieved by further delay in completion of the
long-blocked round.
He pointed to a recent assessment by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) that the draft Uruguay Round agreement,
tabled at the end of last year, would increase trade flows by Dollars 195bn
(Pounds 110bn) a year - with Dollars 90bn of that benefiting developing
countries, and the hard-pressed countries of central and eastern Europe.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US Eximbank to adjust fees it charges for
contract cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Eximbank is to adjust the fees it charges exporters when it provides
them with insurance cover on export contracts. The changes are the result of
a programme of comprehensive credit reform and link with efforts by other
leading export credit agencies to provide a 'level playing field' for
exporters to compete for foreign contracts.
The adjustments come into effect on May 15 and will 'somewhat increase costs
at the higher risk end', according to Mr Ray Albright, the bank's new
executive vice-president.
The fees are not intended to cover fully the bank's exposure to possible
default on contract payments, but are intended to reflect more accurately
the level of risk involved in exports country by country. Any scale that
aimed at full recovery of liabilities would result in 'killing exports where
you still want to do business', Mr Albright said.
A month ago, Bonn revealed that Hermes, its leading export credit agency,
would abandon a long-standing practice of offering exporters a standard fee
for providing export credit insurance. This had become a source of
controversy because it gave German exporters a competitive advantage in
high-risk countries, but penalised them in competing for contracts in
countries regarded as low credit risks. The Eximbank's new charges will
range on a scale from 'A' and 'A-minus' down to 'F' and 'F-minus'. Fees at
the highest-risk end of the scale could rise to 10 per cent on a 10-year
contract. Once the Eximbank has fixed a basic country rate, then fees will
vary depending on the type of deal: sovereign public-sector purchasers will
get the best country rate, with non-sovereign public-sector purchasers and
creditworthy banks being ranked as slightly more expensive, and creditworthy
borrowers a little higher still.
'It has taken us four to five years to get a handle on this,' Mr Albright
said. 'We are very comfortable with the (new system) and feel we are
technical leaders.
'We now have an integrated country risk assessment process covering all US
government agencies, with Exim as lead drafter.
'We are keen to accelerate international harmonisation, and if this can move
the system up a little bit, we will be happy to do that.'
Mr Albright was also comfortable with a recent Berne Union workshop in which
the Eximbank and Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department ran their
country risk assessment models in parallel on a variety of countries and
'found our results were very close'.

EGYPT'S parliament has approved the establishment of an export credit

exports.
Dr Hazem Beblawi, chairman of the Export Development Bank of Egypt who will
also head the new Export Credit Guarantee Company of Egypt (EGCE), said
credit support would put Egyptian exporters on the 'same footing' as their
competitors. EGCE is expected to begin operations before the end of this
year, and its establishment coincides with heightened efforts by Egypt to
improve its trading performance. The World Bank, which helped fund studies
into requirements for a credit agency, has been pressing Egypt to expand
non-traditional exports.

FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: German grain blamed for Gatt stalemate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN refusal to agree to cuts in grain prices lies at the heart of the
stalemate over farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks,
according to a senior US administration official.
'Everyone thinks the French are the problem - and the French obviously do
have a problem - but they are not the only or even the worst problem,' the
official said. 'The Germans are the ones who are resisting the decline in
grain prices.'
The German government has failed to provide a lead in breaking the farm
trade deadlock in spite of mounting international expectations that they
would do so. Hopes of a breakthrough in March during a state visit to
Washington by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were frustrated when he arrived
and departed with no initiatives.
The chancellor has apparently been 'very distant' even at summit meetings
where Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, has spoken on trade
matters on the country's behalf.
Germany's role will come into sharp focus in July when it hosts a summit of
the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Munich. Two previous G7 summits
have made commitments to resolve the farm trade problem with no effect, and
a third failure would be both an embarrassment to Germany and a blow to the
standing of the G7.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, was not willing this week to
endorse explicitly the complaint against Germany. She nevertheless conceded:
'The Germans have the capacity to facilitate an outcome.' She emphasised
that the EC's failure to find a common position on farm trade reform was the
critical obstacle to progress in the long-stalled Uruguay Round.
'Since the problem is agriculture, and that is the impediment that has to be
swept away and the Europeans have the broom, we have to wait until they have
a consensus as to how they are going to treat with it,' she said.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt), released at the end of 1991 a comprehensive plan for the
reform of the world trading system. This included proposals to cut
subsidised farm production and agriculture export subsidies and to open all
markets to farm exports.
Within days, the plan was rejected by the EC, which has been hobbled by its
own efforts to reform Europe's Common Agriculture Policy. A frustrated US
agriculture official recalled: 'It was as if the Dunkel Final Act fell out
of the sky.' Intensive talks between the US and EC have brought negotiators
close to agreement. It has been widely assumed that France, which is a
leading farm exporter, was the principal impediment.
However, the US official said: 'Whether it is export subsidies or
rebalancing or internal supports, it comes down to the price of grain . . .
and the Germans are the primary obstacle.'
The mood in Washington improved from 'despondency' to 'mere frustration'
after the visit of Mr Jacques Delors, the EC president. Mr Delors convinced
US officials that he was determined to reach a settlement and agreed to
intensify bilateral negotiations. 'I believe that they want to achieve a
deal,' said Mrs Hills. 'I didn't have that feeling five or six months ago.'
Officials hope to arrange a EC-US ministerial meeting in Washington later
this month followed by discussions at the OECD.

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth in Europe is likely to top the agenda at this weekend's
informal meeting of European Community finance ministers in Oporto, northern
Portugal.
High European interest rates, rising public sector indebtedness, and
sluggish growth prospects prompted Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime
minister, to write to his EC counterparts urging a high level discussion on
promoting EC growth.
Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's finance minister, yesterday said that
the ministers would seek concerted action through a Community-wide
'non-inflationary growth policy'. He also said that the ministers would
examine several structural impediments to European growth and review
concerted means of eliminating these obstacles.
Ministers are expected to examine developments towards the single market and
ways to promote competition in the non-tradeable goods sector, including
services, distribution and the labour and capital markets. 'There is scope
for initiatives in these areas,' Mr Braga de Macedo said.
A paper from the Committee of Central Bank governors on stage two of
European Monetary Union, due to start in January 1994, will attempt to
define some of the steps involved. The thorny issue of choosing a site for
the European Monetary Institute (EMI), which would be converted into a
European central bank by 1999 at the latest, is expected to be raised
separately.
Other topics include requests by non-EC countries for their currencies to be
linked formally to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
Ministers are also expected to discuss broadening EC economic assistance to
all the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well
as the possible extension of European Investment Bank activities to Latin
America.
Discussion of the Community's 1993-97 budget is expected to focus on
improving budgetary discipline and transparency by raising efficiency and
reducing bureaucracy.
'Some (Community) procedures are far too slow, and we want to find ways to
ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted,' Mr Braga de Macedo said.

<TEXT>
ALL depositors in EC banks should have a minimum Ecu15,000 (Pounds 10,500)
of their deposits guaranteed, the European Commission proposed yesterday.
The EC executive began work on the draft directive before the failure of the
Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI) last year, but accelerated
its initiative after the scandal surrounding the bank's collapse.
The Commission suggests that bank customers should obtain their deposit
guarantee reimbursement within three months, in contrast to the much longer
period that many depositors with the Luxembourg-incorporated BCCI had to
wait. Responsibility for deposit insurance would switch from the host to the
home country of a bank. Mr Pierre Jaans, head of the Luxembourg Monetary
Institute, said this would not pose a problem for the duchy. Very few
Luxembourg-based banks, with the notable exception of BCCI, had branches
abroad.
Commission officials hope that EC governments will reach basic agreement on
the guarantee scheme under the UK presidency of the EC later this year. The
plan would require Greece and Portugal to institute deposit guarrantees for
the first time.

FT  07 MAY 92 / French assembly split on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French debate on ratifying the Maastricht Treaty on European Union
heated up yesterday after the French national assembly voted down two
procedural attempts to have the whole exercise thrown out as being
unconstitutional.
Both these fundamentally anti-Maastricht moves, one from the Gaullist
right-wing and one from the communists, were rejected by wide margins.
The motion tabled by Mr Philippe Seguin, a standard-bearer of the
nationalist wing of the Gaullist Party, was defeated by 396 to 101; while
the communist motion was defeated by 411 to 54.
The votes against the Maastricht Treaty were much larger than the government
had been expecting, and suggest that the necessary constitutional reform and
ratification of the Treaty could after all turn out to be closely-run.
As it is, the government has already been forced to give ground to
opposition protests that it tried to ram through the constitutional revision
at unreasonable speed during the preliminary committee stage.
As a result the full national assembly debate, which was to have been
concluded tonight, is being extended with an additional day's discussion
next Tuesday, and will then be wound up with a vote.
But if the size of the two anti-Maastricht votes in the national assembly is
moderately worrying for the Socialist government, it is deeply disturbing
for the right-wing Gaullist party, because it has again opened up the deep
split over the issue of Europe which has traditionally run right down the
middle of the party.
Before the debate, Mr Jacques Chirac, the leader of the Gaullists, attempted
a compromise with tepid support for the Treaty and modest criticism of the
constitutional revision, which he hoped would satisfy both the pro- and
anti-Europeans in the party.
But his attempt to forge a facade of unity in the party has now been blown
apart by the fiercest debate on France's European destiny since the Treaty
of Rome in 1957. Nearly half the Gaullist contingent in the national
assembly (58 out of 126 members) voted for the Seguin motion, and 16
Gaullists even voted for the communist motion.
Some commentators play down the operational significance of yesterday's
votes. The Gaullists knew the anti-European motions would be defeated, so
they could afford a display of anti-European and anti-government ill-temper;
but next Tuesday the more prudent members may fall back into line behind the
leadership.
As a potential candidate in the next presidential elections, Mr Chirac will
find it more difficult to pose as a constructive if prudent European
statesman when nearly half his parliamentary party appears implacably
opposed to the whole enterprise.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Brussels draft budget shows money to spare: Main saving to
come on farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday presented its 1993 draft budget which at
first sight shows the EC has money to spare, thereby undermining its own
controversial plan to increase Community revenue 35 per cent by 1997.
The full 'appropriations' budget would rise from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.62bn)
this year to Ecu67.3bn in 1993, a rise of only 1.1 per cent, against average
spending rises in the member states of 7 per cent. This compares with an
11.3 per cent rise in last year's EC budget and a 19 per cent increase the
year before.
Actual spending this year is forecast at Ecu63.1bn, and Ecu64.3bn next year.
This means that spending in 1992 is below target and that the Commission is
in real terms pitching next year's target below this year's likely outcome.
The EC's revenue ceiling is equivalent to 1.2 per cent of Community gross
national product. This year's forecast outcome would be well within the
ceiling at 1.11 per cent, whereas next year's target would be 1.1 per cent.
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, however, still wants to raise
the revenue base to 1.35 per cent of GNP by 1997, under its new five-year
finance plan.
Net contributors to the budget, led by Germany and the UK, will see the
draft budget as confirming their argument that the revenue base should not
be raised that high because there is enough 'headroom' under the existing
ceiling to accommodate EC spending ambitions.
These ambitions are reflected in the planned 19 per cent rise in regional
spending, from Ecu18.6bn this year to Ecu22.1bn next. This includes Ecu1.6bn
for the 'cohesion fund' to help poorer member states catch up with average
EC living standards. Spending on external aid and foreign policy, and on
research, rises 13 per cent, from Ecu3.6bn to Ecu4.1bn, and from Ecu2.5bn to
Ecu2.8bn respectively.
These priorities and the cohesion fund were agreed at December's Maastricht
summit, but the only attempt to attach sums to them is the so-called 'Delors
II' five-year finance plan which is likely to be whittled down by member
states.
The main saving for 1993 is on farm spending, forecast to drop from
Ecu35.3bn to Ecu32.1bn - the first time since the EC was founded that
agriculture has absorbed less than half the budget. This estimate is based
on current world prices and the strength of the dollar, and also
incorporates modest savings from the Commission's farm reform plan which has
yet to be agreed. But this picture could easily change.
Lower farm spending and more 'cohesion' finance are also likely to increase
pressure on the UK to give up some of the budget rebate it won from 1985,
conceded because it did relatively badly out of a bigger agriculture budget.
Germany, by far the largest net contributor, intends to press for a
reduction of this Ecu2bn rebate, and Mr Delors on Tuesday told Socialist
Euro-MPs that 'consideration of the British situation could be different
from in the past'.
Commission budget officials said yesterday they would recommend whether to
'continue, modify or abolish' the rebate later this month.

FT  07 MAY 92 / Albania to launch economic reform package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALBANIA'S new government plans to launch an economic package this month
aimed at reassuring the International Monetary Fund and other potential
lenders that the country's transition to a market economy is finally under
way.
The Democratic party's March election victory over the communists opened the
door to reform. But the economic and social chaos accompanying Albania's
emergence from half a century of self-imposed isolation has prompted western
governments and international financial institutions to move cautiously.
Yesterday Mr Sali Berisha, Albania's first democratically elected president
appealed to Europe for aid to rebuild his country. On his first European
tour since he was elected president last month, he promised shock treatment
to revive his country's 'ruined' economy.
The first measure will be to cut payments to unemployed industrial workers,
who still receive 80 per cent of their wages, despite the closure of most
factories after supplies of raw materials ran out last year.
Unemployment now exceeds 150,000, which is over 50 per cent of the urban
workforce. Under the new government's programme, wage subsidies will be
reduced by 10 per cent a month until they are eliminated. By that time, the
government hopes that industrial plants will be producing basic goods.
According to Mr Genc Ruli, the economy minister, about Dollars 100m (Pounds
56.4m) pledged in aid or loans from Germany, Italy, Turkey and Greece will
be spent on importing raw materials for industry. 'Our economic situation is
tragic. We shall be dependent on food aid for months to come. But we must
stop the subsidies if we are to get structural loans,' he said.
Albania is negotiating a Dollars 9m stand-by arrangement with the IMF, to be
followed by a World Bank adjustment loan. 'We are hoping for several hundred
million dollars, in a series of instalments,' Mr Ruli said.
The government is already concerned about meeting a major condition for the
stand-by loan: the liberalisation of prices for a basket of subsidised
goods, including bread, sugar and cooking oil. The economy ministry
forecasts that bread prices alone will rise fourfold. With higher wages and
steadily rising food prices, inflation has reached 500 per cent.
Following a disastrous 60 per cent decline in agricultural output last year
as collective farming collapsed, Albania survived the winter on food aid
provided first by Italy, then by the European Community. Despite severe
shortages, remittances in cash and consumer goods from about 150,000 migrant
workers in Greece have helped the south of the country to subsist.
Elsewhere, Albanians from Kosovo in Yugoslavia took advantage of the launch
of privatisation to invest in property and start small businesses. The
Albanian diaspora in the US is believed to have sent more than Dollars 1m in
private aid.
Yet despite the introduction of import taxes on popular items such as colour
televisions and second-hand cars, government revenues cover only 20 per cent
of expenditure. The public deficit has reached Lek10bn (Dollars 100m),
equivalent to 15 per cent of GDP. However, new fiscal arrangements are being
drawn up under the Phare programme, the vehicle for EC technical assistance
to eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
THE US and other western countries yesterday stepped up the pressure on
Serbia by refusing to recognise it as the legal successor of the former
Yugoslavia, and calling for its exclusion from the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)
The moves to isolate Serbia - and Montenegro, its tiny ally - came as CSCE
members met in Helsinki to discuss the civil war in the independent republic
of Bosnia-Hercegovina and as European Community officials tried to
consolidate the latest ceasefire there.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, repeated his plea at the CSCE
meeting for some form of military intervention from the international
community. But several west European countries were sceptical about
intervening.
Growing international criticism of Serbia coincided with the reconvening of
the EC peace conference in Brussels. Although Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, remained in Sarajevo, the talks were
attended by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo
Tudjman of Croatia, who over the past year have held secret negotiations on
dividing Bosnia.
The EC-brokered ceasefire was agreed on Tuesday just hours after Mr Marrack
Goulding, the United Nations special envoy, arrived in Sarajevo to assess
whether any UN peace-keeping forces would be sent. Mr Goulding, whose convoy
came under fire last Tuesday, was yesterday again attacked. Radio Sarajevo
said a bullet hit the envoy's car.
In other parts of the republic, there were reports of heavy fighting.
Radio Sarajevo said Mostar, southern Bosnia, was pounded by some 500
grenades. Radio Belgrade reported fresh clashes around Zvornik, eastern
Bosnia, one of eight mainly Moslem towns seized by Serb irregulars on or
near the River Drina, Bosnia's eastern frontier with Serbia.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Social Democratic opposition yesterday threatened to boycott
cross-party talks on the country's budget crisis in protest at the
government's plans for drastic cuts in unemployment benefits and job
creation schemes.
The hostile response to the first government proposals for long-term budget
austerity was fuelled by an equally angry reaction at the Federal Labour
Office, which declared that any large-scale savings would only increase the
numbers of fully unemployed - above all in east Germany.
The plan put forward by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, would curb
growth in government spending to a bare 2.5 per cent per year until 1996,
and would abolish any central subsidy for the Labour Office, currently
standing at some DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn). Spending by the states and local
authorities would be kept to a 3 per cent annual growth rate.
Mr Waigel's aim is to cut his central government budget deficit, a factor
behind the country's current high interest rates, from DM45bn this year to
DM25bn by 1995.
The plan yesterday split the German political and economic establishments on
predictable lines, winning solid support from the Chamber of Trade and
Industry and the ruling coalition partners, and outright hostility from the
Social Democrats (SPD) and the trade union federation (DGB).
Both Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, and Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the Bonn
parliamentary group leader, called into question their planned talks with
the government on May 27.
Mr Klose said the talks would be pointless on the basis of the 'sloppy and
socially unjust' proposal put forward by the finance minister.
The most disturbing response for Mr Waigel, however, was the reaction of the
Federal Labour Office's conservative president, Mr Heinrich Franke, who
suggested that substantial savings in training and job creation schemes
would simply boost outright unemployment in the east, without any
significant budget saving.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOSCOW announced yesterday that the last tactical nuclear missiles had been
withdrawn from the Ukraine to Russia in record time, ending suspense over
whether Kiev would fulfil a promise to get rid of them by July 1.
Lt-Gen Sergei Zelentsov, of the Commonwealth of Independent States joint
command, said the transfer was completed on Tuesday night. It would help
ensure that the number of nuclear states did 'not grow,' he said.
The announcement is a first success for the republics' attempts to reassure
the west over the future of the vast nuclear arsenal which they inherited
from the Soviet Union.
A Russian foreign ministry representative said he hoped the four republics
with strategic missiles - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - would
soon agree a formula for jointly ratifying the Start treaty on reducing
long-range missiles. It was signed last year but not ratified by the US and
the Soviet Union.
Apart from Russia, Ukraine has 176 strategic missiles, Kazakhstan 104 and
Belarus 54.
The announcement on tactical missiles was confirmed by an aide to the
Ukrainian defence minister, Mr Konstantin Morozov, who said: 'Ukraine is
trying to behave in such a way as to inspire trust in its policies.'
The news coincided with a US tour by Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk,
who sent alarm bells ringing two months ago when he said he was suspending
the shipment of tactical missiles to Russia because he was not sure they
would be dismantled.
A Ukrainian spokesman in Moscow said Ukraine, would be seeking international
guarantees for its security.
In Washington, Mr Kravchuk merely said Ukraine would transfer all the
tactical nuclear weapons on its territory by July as originally planned. He
said he expected Ukraine to sign the Start treaty.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who has made no such promise,
was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as saying he would give up all nuclear
weapons if he received guarantees for his republic's security from the US,
China and Russia.
Lt-Gen Zelentsov said it would take from next month until the year 2000 to
dismantle the tactical weapons and recycle for civilian use the
weapons-grade plutonium contained in the warheads.

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: MIM declines 12 per cent to
Adollars 46m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, yesterday blamed weak metal
prices for a 12 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 46m (dollars 34.8m)
for the nine months to April 5, on sales down 12.6 per cent to ADollars
1.2bn.
The result represents a significant improvement over the first six months,
when MIM reported a 76 per cent cut in new profits to ADollars 16m, on sales
down 10 per cent to ADollars 840m.
After including a second-quarter abnormal profit of ADollars 45.7m from the
sale of its interests in Teck Corporation, net profits rose to ADollars
91.8m, from ADollars 52.8m the previous comparable period.
However, net profits fell to ADollars 70m after including foreign exchange
losses and minority equity interests. The equivalent profit in the first
nine months of last year was ADollars 30m.
MIM said profits had continued to be affected in the third quarter by weak
metals prices, but reported excellent results from the Porgera gold mine in
Papua New Guinea, which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, an MIM
subsidiary.
The group said gold operations at Tick Hill also performed well, and coal
operations at Oaky Creek returned to profitability during the quarter. Oaky
Creek suffered a loss of ADollars 24m in the first six months, mainly
because of operational difficulties.
MIM said average copper prices during the nine months were 12 per cent lower
than in the comparable period of last year. The equivalent falls in prices
for other metals were 27 per cent for lead, 12 per cent for zinc and 10 per
cent for gold.
The directors said the weakness in prices was likely to continue in the
absence of signs of economic recovery in the metal consuming countries.
It said recent data on housing starts and retail sales in the US were
encouraging, but this was offset by worsening economies in Germany and
Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RECOVERY in earnings in the second half of 1992 was forecast yesterday by
Mr Daniel Burke, president and chief executive of Capital Cities/ABC, the US
television and newspapers group.
Mr Burke, speaking at the annual shareholders's meeting in New York, said
the second-half results would benefit from an improvement in local and
national advertising demand in the broadcasting division. The company's
shares reacted with a rise of dollars 7 3/4 to dollars 448.
'We cannot make predictions beyond that for the balance of the year,
although we expect the company's expense growth to be modest,' Mr Burke
explained.
The media group's 1991 net income declined by 28.1 per cent to dollars
343.5m, on revenues of dollars 5.4bn.
In the first quarter of 1992 net profits at Capital Cities/ABC plunged by 45
per cent, to dollars 58.6m, on unchanged revenues of dollars 1.26bn.
Mr Burke promised that ABC would remain 'a player of consequence' in the
global television market, having established partnerships in seven
international media-based ventures to date.
In the US, ABC Television ended the 1991-92 prime time season in last place,
just behind NBC. 'While I live for the day I can report to you that the
network ranked first or second, I would rather that it made a respectable
profit,' Mr Burke told shareholders.
He noted that the broadcasting division had earned dollars 669.7m of
operating profit last year.
Mr Burke said while Capital Cities was considering acquisitions, it might be
'entering a period where internally developed businesses make more sense for
us'.
He cited several internally generated ventures such as new magazine and
fashion shows that have cost the company dollars 42m pre-tax in start-up
expenses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHOP WORKERS' union, Usdaw, has moved to counter government proposals
for legislation to expand Sunday trading, expected in today's Queen's
speech.
Delegates at the union's annual conference unanimously backed their
executive committee's call to move the focus of the anti-Sunday trading
campaign to influencing new legislation and away from simple condemnation of
shops trading illegally.
Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary, said the union would continue to
call for law enforcement, but delegates had to realise that large stores
would continue to trade illegally, especially over the Christmas period.
The union gave qualified support for the so-called 'rest' proposals,
formulated by Keep Sunday Special (KSS), the anti-Sunday-trading lobby. Mr
Connor said the proposals were acceptable because they meant most shops
would be closed on Sundays, law-breaking employers would face fines of up to
Pounds 50,000, and boards of directors would be held legally liable.
He criticised KSS for having little to say about Scottish shopworkers and
for suggesting that illegal traders be closed for up to 14 days, without
clarifying the position of staff during that time.
The union will press EuroFiet, the body that represents the interests of
shop workers at European community level, to join Usdaw in sponsoring a
conference on trading hours legislation.
Earlier, the union reaffirmed its support for wages councils, the bodies
that set minimum statutory pay levels for about 2.5m workers, of which more
than 1m are shop workers.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, told the conference he would
fight the abolition of wages councils line by line and comma by comma in the
House of Commons. He said the government had no mandate to abolish wages
councils because the Conservative manifesto did not refer to that.

Most of the inhabited Arctic islands are included in Nunavut, but the

Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, is returning to the constitutional
negotiating table with a four-day visit to western Canada and direct talks

He wants to put a federal constitutional offer before Quebec voters this

He is now trying to ensure the offer will be at least as generous to Quebec
as Ottawa's Meech Lake proposals, which failed to get unanimous provincial
consent in 1990.

<TEXT>
DEN NORSKE Bank, the troubled Norwegian bank, has reduced its first-quarter
net losses to NKr601m (Dollars 93.6m) from NKr798m in the same period last
year. It attributed the improvement to lower credit losses, growth in net
interest income and a reduction in operating costs.
Group operating profit, before credit losses and taxes, rose by NKr17m to
NKr424m. The bank said a NKr45m charge was made against accounts to cover
write-downs and losses arising from the sale of fixed assets.
Credit losses were reduced by NKr172m to NKr1.02bn but non-performing loans
rose by NKr105m from the end of last year to NKr10.27bn.
Group net interest income increased NKr113m to NKr1.14bn but other operating
income fell by NKr117m to NKr545m.
A reduction of NKr28m to NKr13m in income from securities trading
contributed to the decline, as trading in foreign exchange and other
financial instruments fell NKr92m to NKr70m.
DnB said that results of Realkreditt, a mortgage company acquired last year,
were included for the first time in the group's accounts. Realkreditt
contributed NKr58m to total net interest income.
The bank said that, as a percentage of total assets, first-quarter net
interest income rose to 2.28 per cent from 2.04 per cent a year earlier.
DnB said that the previously announced preferential share issue to raise
NKr2.38bn will be launched in late May or early June, and that shareholders
would soon receive a subscription offer.

The group's results include the turnover, profit and equity capital figures
for 18 associated companies. These include: Maersk Air, the airline; a big
supermarket chain; and the Odense Steel Shipyard.
Turnover in the associated companies totalled DKr23.26bn, which includes
DKr13.71bn in the supermarket chain.
While the core companies made a net profit last year of DKr1.92bn, the
associated companies, four of which incurred losses, reported combined
profits of DKr173m.
Equity capital in the core companies at the end of last year was DKr16.52bn,
while equity in the core companies was DKr4.06bn.
The Moller Group's figures are still incomplete as they do not reveal
turnover in the group's foreign subsidiaries. Neither does the group make it
clear which of the associated companies are wholly or partly owned by the

FT  06 MAY 92 / Campaign to swap debt for drugs aid gathers pace: The third
world has told UN it cannot afford the fight against narcotics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE group of third world countries has told the United Nations they
cannot afford to fund the fight against drugs. They want to swap some of
their international debt to help pay for combating illicit drug growing,
production, trafficking and abuse.
The move is being opposed by most developed nations, particularly the US and
Britain, which regard third world debt as a bilateral matter between
individual borrowers and lenders, not as something on which the UN can act
collectively.
They also say the global fight against drugs and drug-related crime is
embedded in international treaties which all nations have a duty to
implement. Their efforts cannot be made conditional.
Nevertheless, the UN is being forced to investigate and develop the
'debt-for-drugs' concept after Bolivia, Colombia, Egypt, Nigeria and Peru
this month forced a motion through the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in
Vienna.
Nigeria acted on behalf of the Group of 77, the third world's counterweight
to the smaller, but more powerful, grouping of developed nations.
The Group of 77 is gradually increasing its representation on the
commissions and committees that formulate UN policy, so as to have a voting
majority wherever it can.
The UN International Drug Control Programme, which gets most of its Dollars
100m-plus budget from the US, Japan Australia and east European countries,
has to report back to the commission in 12 months on making the
debt-for-drugs concept work.
One idea canvassed is for some government-to-government debt to be converted
into local currency, forgiven but frozen in place, and the former interest
payments diverted into anti-drug projects. Bolivia is being suggested for a
pilot scheme with some of its Dollars 200m debt to US agencies retired for
the purpose.
A parallel is being drawn with 'debt-for-environment' schemes which UN and
other agencies are also exploring. Here, third world countries can agree,
for example, not to clear areas of rain forest in exchange for debts being
forgiven.
However, opponents of the debt-for-drugs idea say the parallel is false. The
debt-for-environment swap would work through a value being placed on a
section of rain forest not being developed and being designated a
conservation area or international nature park. This would turn it into an
asset for the country concerned, making money-earning development, such as
tourism, possible.
Debt-for-drugs is being seen as more like blackmail because international
crime and widespread corruption are involved. At best, countries with debts
would be tempted to let their anti-drug performance deteriorate so as to
force a debt-for-drugs agreement on the international community.
Illicit drug producers could then simply transfer operations over the
nearest border, thus compounding the problem in a neighbouring country and
encouraging debt-for-drugs swaps there.
The UN already has experience of unexpected side effects from anti-drug
initiatives. When it started crop substitution programmes, some farmers
started growing opium for the first time in order to qualify for the
subsidies that then enabled them to switch back to their original crops.
The Group of 77 nations says, however, that diverting already scarce
resources into fighting drug cultivation, reduction, trafficking and abuse
strains the countries' national economies. At the same time, debt burdens
diminish their ability to promote alternative economic development to
persuade people away from the easy money drugs provide.
There is also a view in the UN that much third world debt is never going to
be repaid anyway, so debt-for-drugs would at least give the developed world
some benefit from writing off what is in effect dead money.
However, the 'blackmail' connotations have already registered strongly with
several developed nations. This is thought likely to make some of them wary
of channelling money to UN agencies, using instead bilateral agreements with
individual third world countries, with close monitoring of the anti-drug
projects involved.

WASHINGTON has stepped up talks with its Gulf war allies on a proposal to
appropriate frozen Iraqi assets to pay for humanitarian needs and United
Nations programmes in the country.
The US is pressing Britain and France to consider framing a Security Council
resolution to enable the spending of some of the Dollars 5bn in Iraqi
overseas assets frozen since the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Washington's renewed vigour in pursuit of a proposal which has been in the
air for some weeks is aimed at forcing Baghdad into accepting the terms of a
UN-permitted sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of Iraqi oil to buy food and
medicines. A western diplomat in New York said: 'Iraq is being told, either
do a deal with the UN, or we'll spend your assets.'
Talks between Iraq and the UN on a limited sale of oil have remained
deadlocked, with Iraq maintaining that the UN supervised terms for the sale,
and for spending the revenues, are an unacceptable abrogation of its
sovereignty.
Mr Abdul Razzak al-Hiti, Iraq's oil minister, said at the Opec summit last
month that an agreement on the oil sale could take only 'a few days' to work
out, but no date has been set for further talks and oil analysts believe
Iraq is unlikely to resume any oil sales before the end of this year.
Mr Abdul Amir al-Abnari, Iraq's representative at the UN who has led
negotiations over the permitted oil sale, has flown to Baghdad for talks
with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, and is expected to escort
him on a trip within the next few days to non-aligned UN member countries.
Mr Aziz is expected first to visit Rabat, capital of Morocco, the sole Arab
country presently on the UN Security Council.
US officials say an appropriation of frozen Iraqi assets could easily be
enacted. However, Britain and France have been less enthusiastic about the
possible legal ramifications of such a move.
Bankers and lawyers in London say an assets appropriation would have to be
backed up by passage of domestic legislation to protect banks against
potential future Iraqi claims on the seized assets. Just over Dollars 530m
of frozen Iraqi money lies in London banks.
Bankers also say that they would be unhappy about the effect any such
appropriation would have on the view of London as a financial centre: 'It's
Iraq this time - but who might it be later? That would be the thinking,'
said one banker.
The US treasury is also understood to be worried that any Iraqi assets spent
on humanitarian needs would not then be available to offset claims by US
companies against Iraq. 'The problem is we have more claims against Iraq
than we have money,' said one US official.
More than Dollars 1.4bn of Iraqi assets are locked in US banks.
Money secured, either through an oil sale or appropriation of assets would
be spent largely on food and medicine, with 30 per cent used to pay for
compensation to victims of the invasion of Kuwait and for UN programmes in
the country. Syria denied a report that it was importing Iraqi oil, which is
under a UN embargo, and exporting it mixed with its own crude, Reuter
reports from Damascus. Dadoud Hido, president of Sytrol, the body
responsible for marketing Syrian oil, said the increase in his country's oil
exports was a result of newly discovered oilfields coming onstream. He
denied a report in Petroleum Intelligence Weekly last month that Syria was
mixing its oil with Iraqi crude.

Taiwan's exports last month totalled a record Dollars 7.25bn, bringing the
value of exports so far this year to Dollars 26.3bn, according to finance
ministry figures released on Monday, Luisetta Mudie reports in Taipei. The
March figure represents an increase of about 29 per cent on the same month
last year. The US remained the largest importer of Taiwanese exports,
accounting for 26.4 per cent of the total and running a Dollars 700m trade
deficit which increased by 135 per cent year-on-year.

Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, announced yesterday
that it had secured a Dollars 210m contract from the German company VEAG to
design and supply two turbosets with a total output of 1,600MW for a power
plant to be built at Boxberg in Saxony, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The first turboset is scheduled to supply electricity from mid-1996 and the
second from six months later. The order for ABB follows one worth Dollars
50m a few weeks ago for the same Saxon plant. The contract will be carried
out with ABB Bergman Borsig of Berlin.

GPA, the Irish-based aircraft leasing company, is negotiating a Dollars 400m
deal with the new Ukrainian government to re-equip its national airline with
between five and seven modern narrow and wide-bodied jets, reports Tim Coone
from Dublin. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, met senior GPA
executives at the company's Shannon headquarters yesterday during a stopover
en route to the US. Negotiations are apparently at an advanced stage with
two other republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States to supply one
Boeing 757 and one 737 on leasing contracts. Lithuania and Hungary have
already received nine jet aircraft from GPA.

FT  06 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie falters on brink of record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION of the widely expected half-point cut in UK interest rates saw
the FT-SE 100-share Index burst through its previous all-time closing high
but fail by less than one point to penetrate its record intraday high.
After failing to push through the peak, the market quickly ran out of steam
and saw an early strong rise turn into a minor loss, before closing
moderately higher.
Dealers kicked off the shortened trading week by pushing share prices up
sharply, anticipating another flurry of institutional buying interest after
the rate reduction.
Further impetus to the London market came from Wall Street, which had raced
up to record levels during London's bank holiday period.
The Footsie topped its previous closing high  - 2,679.6 reached on September
2 last year  - opening some 20 points stronger at 2,679.8 and quickly moving
up to 2,683.0, or 23.2 ahead, within minutes of the start.
But the market was unable to build on this, as profit-taking from
institutions anxious to lock in big profits achieved on the general election
result saw equities retreat for most of the remaining session.
Specialists said the market's reversal stemmed from a general feeling of
anti-climax and worries that the market may well need to consolidate before
launching another attempt at piercing its all-time high. There was also
widespread concern about the German economy and the possibility that Wall
Street may have run too far too quickly. The US stock market opened easier
yesterday and continued to drift off as London closed.
Dealers also spoke of at least two programme trades in London, both weighted
on the sell side, and lingering worries about the possibility of sizeable
rights issues.
Selling pressure in London reached its peak just before Wall Street opened.
At that time the Footsie fell into negative territory, reaching the day's
low of 2,658.4, or down 1.4. Thereafter it managed to claw its way back to
end a busy session a net 2.4 higher at 2,662.2.
The trading session was spiced by another big placing. Smith New Court, the
London market's bought deal specialist, acting in conjunction with Panmure
Gordon, acquired and easily placed Sir Ron Brierley's 29.7 per cent stake in
BSG International. The placing of the BSG stake, comprising some 60m shares,
accounted for 120m of the market's turnover, which reached 638.1m shares.
Pharmaceuticals were in the spotlight, with Glaxo delivering another
sparkling performance as the UK authorities granted approval for the group's
Zofran anti-nausea drug. SmithKline Beecham moved higher in sympathy with
Glaxo, but Fisons was aggressively sold late in the session following news
that the group had failed so far to win US approval for its Opticrom drug.
Most senior dealers said the market had already factored in the rate cut and
was seeking further stimulation. 'We have had the good news for the time
being; short of some bid activity we are due a period of consolidation,'
said one.

FT  06 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Zofran boost for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER feeling the wrath of American investors on Friday, Glaxo returned to
favour yesterday as encouraging weekend press comment in the US restored the
reputation of the group's leading drug, Zantac. In fact, it was Glaxo's new
drug Zofran which took centre stage yesterday as UK approval  - the first in
the world  - was received for the post-operative anti-nausea product.
Analysts estimate that Zofran could generate sales of around Pounds 400m a
year by 1995.
Glaxo was also boosted by a series of institutional meetings in London
arranged by Canadian group Biochem Pharma, which is developing an anti-Aids
drug on behalf of the UK company. The new drug, 3TC, is seen as a potential
market threat to Wellcome, which declined 8 to 1058p. Glaxo surged ahead 31
to 751p in busy turnover of 4.5m.
SmithKline Beecham rose in sympathy with Glaxo to end 15 stronger at 870p.
Expected approval by the US Food and Drugs Administration of Fisons'
Opticrom facility failed to materialise, the drugs group merely announcing
that the inspection had been completed. The shares receded 11 to 379p.
Williams weak
Conglomerate Williams Holdings lost more than 4 per cent of its equity value
as the market responded to suggestions that the company may launch a white
knight bid for Dowty Group, the aerospace concern currently under attack
from TI Group.
The shares tumbled 15 to 329p on turnover of 3.1m, with the market
particularly concerned about the cash underwriting in the event of a bid
from Williams. Mr Matthew Sutherland at County NatWest said: 'I would not
rule out the fact that Williams may be looking to do a white knight deal
with Dowty. But it is unlikely that they will make an acquisition that will
dilute earnings.'
Shares in leading retailers failed to respond favourably to yesterday's  1/2
point cut in bank base rates, the Bank of England's endorsement of lower
rates having been widely forecast.
Trading in Sears was fairly active, at 6m shares, and the stock dipped 4 to
101p ahead of tomorrow's results. Turnover in other leading stores was not
heavy, although the recent disappointment at retail sales performance tended
to push prices lower.
WH Smith 'A' slipped 6 to 476p, while Boots gave up 7 to 465p and Dixons 7
to 249p. Ratners eased a penny to 20 1/2 p on lower turnover of 4.4m shares
as bid speculation faded.
Technical factors tended to weaken Tesco, on completion of the buying in of
shares for its employee profit sharing scheme. BZW's recent advice to switch
into J. Sainsbury also weighed on Tesco, as well as adverse comment from
Credit Lyonnais Laing about the sector's policy on property valuations.
Tesco shed 4 to 274p.
Shoprite, whose shares were valued at under 400p a month ago, climbed a
further 33 to 504p, following recent visits from securities houses. The
shares have risen on optimism about a proposed store opening programme.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was the day's second most busiest stock with 30m traded,
the shares easing  1/2 to 22 3/4 p. US and continental European buyers were
most evident on expectations of a recovery in advertising revenue.
Turnover in PowerGen was a hefty 4.1m shares, with the price falling 6 to
228p, and National Power lost 5 to 221p on trade of 2.1m shares, amid
reports that overseas investors were selling shares in the power generators.
Scottish generating companies were steady, however, responding to a positive
note from Smith New Court. The Electricity Package gave up Pounds 15 to
Pounds 3178,
Friday's rumour that MEPC had let the remainder of its Alban Gate office
block continued to lift the shares, in a generally positive property sector.
MEPC, which touched 369p, was finally 3 up at 361p.
British Fittings plunged 48 to 105p after the building group announced
losses, trading difficulties and the need for a new chairman.
Broker Hoare Govett decided that Thorn EMI was undervalued, citing the
potential for expansion in the music market, and in particular new music
formats such as Digital Compact Cassette. The shares rose 6 to 857p.
Lehman Brothers' downgrading of Allied-Lyons continued to weigh on the
drinks and food giant, pushing the shares 9 lower to 630p. Speculation about
a possible takeover bid has also faded of late.
BAT Industries, which reports first-quarter figures today, was wanted, the
shares advancing 14 to 781p as turnover rose to 2.8m on speculation that
profits may be higher than anticipated.
P &amp; O moved ahead 10 to 515p after Smith New Court reiterated its buy
recommendation on the stock. Mr Clive Anderson at Smith said the company has
'an undemanding multiple for a recovery play and an attractive yield'.
Motor components manufacturer BSG International closed 1 1/2 firmer at 64p
after Smith New Court and Panmure Gordon successfully placed the 29.7 per
cent stake held by Sir Ron Brierley with institutions. The majority of the
60m-share holding, which was bought by the brokers at 61 1/2 p, was placed
at 62p, while a block of 13.5m was placed in ex-dividend form at 59 1/2 p.

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program selling causes
Dow to recede
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US EQUITIES moved in a narrow range in quiet trading throughout most of the
day, before a late round of program selling pushed the Dow Jones Industrial
Average lower after closing at a record high on Monday, writes Karen Zagor
in New York.
The Dow ended 18.78 off at 3,359.35, but advances led declines at the close
by 934 to 779 after NYSE volume of 200m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
edged down 0.07 to 417.40, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks gained 4.53 at 588.07.
Blue chip issues dominated the actives list on the NYSE, with PepsiCo
slipping Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 1/8 , American Express rising Dollars
1/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 and Sears Roebuck losing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43
3/4
Transportation issues were strong, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average
up 13.46 to 1,394.25.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, added Dollars 2 at Dollars 68 7/8 and UAL,
parent of United Airlines, rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 126 1/4 .
Delta Air Lines lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 . Shortly before the
close of trading, Moody's Investors Service said it was reviewing Delta for
a possible downgrade.
Cigna put on Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 1/2 . The insurance company's
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.48 a share, against 67 cents a year
earlier, were released after the close of trade on Monday.
Glaxo Holding's American Depositary Receipts rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 27
in heavy trading. The company's Zofran drug received marketing approval in
the UK for use in preventing and treating post-operative nausea.
The approval comes only days after UK regulators approved marketing of
Glaxo's migraine drug.
April car sales figures from Ford and Chrysler spurred active trading in
both issues. Chrysler turned in a 38 per cent jump in truck sales for the
month while car sales rose 5 per cent. The company said April was its best
month for total vehicle sales in nearly two years.
Ford's car sales advanced 5.5 per cent while truck sales rose 19.2 per cent.
Shares in Ford eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 and Chrysler dipped
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 .
ITT climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 in active trading on news that
it is planning a new share repurchase programme for common and convertible
preferred for up to 25m equivalent common shares. The repurchase plan is
intended to help the company achieve a 15 per cent return on equity by 1996.
Santa Fe Pacific slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 7/8 on news that it had
filed for a secondary offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to allow beleaguered Canadian property developer Olympia &amp; York to sell its
18 per cent stake in the railway company.
Technology issues performed well on both the big board and in
over-the-counter trading. On the NYSE, IBM climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
93 7/8 and Hewlett Packard Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 . In
over-the-counter trading, Microsoft moved ahead Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 116
1/2 but Apple Computer held steady at Dollars 60 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks retraced early gains to end flat. An analyst said the market
is waiting for results from Olympia &amp; York's meeting in London with its
bankers, the end to the US Treasury refunding tomorrow, and Friday's US and
Canada unemployment figures for April.
The composite index closed just a point up at 3,364.5, while falls finally
outnumbered rises by 282 to 262. Volume was 23m shares. The gold group stood
out with a 2.7 per cent rise.
Ipsco fell CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 18 7/8 . The company said it will sell
2.4m common shares to a group of underwriters for CDollars 18.75 a share.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling slips after rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING held most attention in the foreign currency markets yesterday,
after the Bank of England signalled a  1/2 percentage point cut in UK base
rates, writes James Blitz.
The UK currency dipped below DM2.92 shortly after lunch as investors who had
bought sterling at around DM2.88 after the April general election took
profits. However, traders reported a large amount of corporate buying of the
currency shortly afterwards to help sterling finish at DM2.9250, half a
pfennig down from its previous close.
It also ended down against the dollar, at Dollars 1.7825, off  1/4 cent.
Against its trade weighted index, the pound closed at 92.2 after opening at
92.4. In New York, sterling rallied to end at Dollars 1.7863.
Analysts believe that, in spite of its late recovery yesterday, the rate
reduction carries some downside risk for the UK currency. 'The gap between
German and UK rates is now wafer thin,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief
economist of Yamaichi International, 'and leaves sterling with little by way
of support. The move has also shown the market that the UK authorities are
prepared to use any chance they can to lower interest rates.'
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International, also believes that
the cut carries risks. 'It showed that the authorities are more worried
about the weakness of the economy than anything else,' he said.
High German rates were yesterday unsettling the US dollar as well. In
European and North American trading, the US currency eased against the
D-Mark, partly due to renewed hopes of a solution to the German labour
strike. But the interest rate differentials between German and American
rates were irresistible.
As one dealer said: 'Germany may have its industrial problems. But it is
hard to ignore that you can get 9 3/4 per cent interest on the D-Mark
compared to about 3 3/4 per cent with the dollar.' In Europe, the dollar
finished at DM1.6405, against DM1.6410. In New York it closed at DM1.6370.
The only major currency not to lose out to the D-Mark yesterday was the
French franc, which still enjoys investor popularity. An article in Le
Monde, the French daily paper, suggested that there could be an impending
revaluation of the currency. The D-Mark ended at around FFr3.3690, after
opening at FFr3.3696.
The dollar's difficulties stemmed mostly from last week's indifferent
economic indicators. Analysts believe that employment data due at the end of
this week should show a modest but positive improvement, but that investors
will have to wait until further into the month of May before seeing clear
signs of a recovery. The US unit closed at Y133.10, against a previous
Y132.70. It was finally Y132.85 in New York.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Bank cuts base rate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England signalled a  1/2 percentage point cut in UK interest
rates yesterday by offering lower rates at the short end of its dealing
operations in the discount market. The base rate reduction to 10 per cent
was the first rate cut for nine months, but the market appeared unsure as to
what time scale to put on money at this level of interest.
After signalling a shortage of around Pounds 900m, the Bank purchased Pounds
10m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 659m of Band-1 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 5m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per
cent.
That interest rate compared with a rate of 10 3/8 per cent offered for
short-term bills in Bands-1 and 2 last week.
The forecast was later revised to a shortage of around Pounds 950m before
taking account of the early operations.
The bank subsequently purchased Pounds 300m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8
per cent.
The overnight rate fell in line with the rate cuts, reaching a low on the
day of 7 3/4 per cent and finishing at around 9 7/8 per cent.
Other period rates, however, indicated, if anything, that the market expects
this to be the last rate cut for some time. The rate for three-month money
finished at 10 3/16 - 1/8 per cent, compared with 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent one
week ago. Further out, the rates ended at 10 3/16 - 1/16 per cent for
everything from four-month money to one year.
In the futures market, volumes were high in the wake of the base rate cut.
After trading in a 12-tick range, the June short sterling contract finished
at 89.92, after a high of 89.99. The closing price indicates an implied
interest rate in June of 10.08 per cent, roughly in line with a 10 per cent
base rate.
The market's eyes are now fixed on whether the German Bundesbank might raise
rates, a move that would put pressure on sterling following yesterday's
reduction.
Close attention will be paid to Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank's
general council. 'Nobody in the market expects the Bundesbank to raise rates
on Thursday,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International.
'But there is a fear that German money supply figures for April will ratchet
up again.'
As a result, the market's focus is even more firmly set on the Bundesbank
meeting in two week's time, after the M3 figures have come out.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Reduction in lending rates prompts selling
of gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market gave a cool reaction to yesterday's easing in
monetary conditions, with cash bond and futures prices closing lower.
Dealers said trading was dominated by investors taking profits following the
strong performance of the gilts market since the Conservative election
victory.
The Bank of England signalled a  1/2 -point cut in base lending rates in
morning money-market operations, supplying short-term liquidity to the
banking system just below 10 per cent. The move was widely anticipated in
the gilts market, but caused significant selling.
The long-gilt futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, opened at
99.00 but quickly fell to 97 15/16 following the rate cut. Through the
afternoon session sentiment improved and the contract stood at 98 7/32 in
late afternoon. Volume was heavy at 51,000 contracts.
In the cash market, selling was concentrated at the longer maturities. The 9
per cent gilt maturing 2011, the benchmark long-dated government stock,
opened at 99 31/32 and closed at 99 13/32 for a yield of 9.06 per cent.
Shorter-dated stocks fared better. The 10 per cent gilt maturing 1994 closed
down  1/16 of a point on the day at 101 1/8 , for a yield of 9.44 per cent.
In addition to profit-taking, the market was unsettled by uncertainty over
the outlook for UK inflation as the economy pulls out of recession.
Analysts' forecasts for the annual rate of inflation during April range from
4.2 per cent to around 5 per cent. Official data is due to be released on
May 15. Lower interest rates were also seen as threatening the position of
sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK currency fell
from DM2.93 before the easing was signalled to just above DM2.92 by late
afternoon.
Moreover, yesterday's interest rate reduction may be the last for some time.
Most economists are forecasting one more rate cut before the year-end.
'There is not much good news on the horizon now,' said Mr Phillip Tyson,
gilt market analysts at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'There is no incentive now to
chase yields lower.'
Another factor depressing gilts prices at the medium maturities is a
partially unsold tap issue announced by the Bank of England on Friday.
Dealers estimated yesterday that only around half of the Pounds 800m issue
of 8 3/4 per cent gilts maturing 1997 had been sold.
GERMAN government bonds moved lower yesterday with investors concerned over
continued public sector strikes and plans to introduce withholding tax on
interest income from bond market investments.
The 8 per cent Unity fund bond maturing 2002 was trading at 99.64 in late
afternoon, for a yield of 8.06 per cent, from around 99.68 at the opening.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe opened at 87.11 but moved down to
86.70 during the day, before recovering to close at 86.86. Volume was very
heavy at 83,000 contracts.
Analysts said the government was likely to increase its 4.6 per cent pay
offer to striking public sector workers at talks this week. A final
settlement much above this level would increase fears of wage inflation,
driving up prices throughout the economy and higher interest rates.
The Bundesbank council holds its bi-weekly meeting on Thursday, although few
analysts are expecting an immediate rate increase.
The market was unsettled by indications that the opposition Social
Democratic party, which controls the lower house of parliament, would vote
against the government's compromise withholding tax proposals. If the
current package of measures is rejected, more stringent measures may be
applied.
US TREASURY prices firmed slightly yesterday afternoon, on the back of a
satisfactory three-year note auction in the first leg of the Treasury's
Dollars 36bn refunding auction.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  3/16 higher at
99 15/16 , yielding 8.00 per cent while the two-year note was up  1/32 to
yield 5.26 per cent.
The Federal Reserve added liquidity to the banking system by arranging
Dollars 1.5bn in customer repurchase agreements in the open market when Fed
funds were trading at 3 3/4 per cent. The move was widely expected.
The Treasury sold Dollars 15bn of three-year notes at an average yield of
5.96 per cent with a coupon of 5.875 per cent.
Before the auction there was some concern that the recent urban unrest in
the US would discourage Japanese investors from participating.
The market was also preoccupied with the employment numbers due for release
on Friday, which will give the first important evidence about the state of
the US economy in April.

prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, yesterday blamed weak metal
prices for a 12 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 46m (Dollars 34.8m)
for the nine months to April 5, on sales down 12.6 per cent to ADollars
1.2bn.
The result represents a significant improvement over the first six months,
when MIM reported a 76 per cent cut in net profits to ADollars 16m, on sales
down 10 per cent to ADollars 840m.
After including a second-quarter abnormal profit of ADollars 45.7m from the
sale of its interest in Teck Corporation, net profits rose to ADollars
91.8m, from ADollars 52.8m the previous comparable period.
Net profits fell to ADollars 70m after including foreign exchange losses and
minority equity interests. The equivalent profit in the first nine months of
last year was ADollars 30m.
MIM said profits were affected in the third quarter by weak metals prices,
but reported excellent results from the Porgera gold mine in Papua New
Guinea, which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, an MIM subsidiary.

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sappi buys 90% of Hannover
Papier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAPPI, the South African pulp and paper company, is to pay DM400m (Dollars
242.4m in US dollars and R825m in financial rand) for control of Hannover
Papier, one of Germany's leading producers of coated woodfree paper.
The deal is a considerable breakthrough for South African companies, being
the first occasion since the implementation of financial sanctions in the
mid-1980s that a SA company has used its own paper to finance a large
acquisition.
It also consolidates the position of Sappi, a member of the Gencor group, in
the speciality paper market in Europe. In June 1990, it bought control of
five paper mills in the UK, from which a new company, Sappi Europe, was
formed.
Sappi will acquire 90 per cent of Hannover Papier's share capital - 80 per
cent from Swedish company Ncb Aktiebolag, the state-owned forestry group,
and 10 per cent from Commerzbank of Germany.
Sappi will issue new ordinary shares to Commerzbank and convertible
debentures for the Ncb shares. Ncb will receive cash and Sappi will assume
Hannover Papier's borrowings of DM370m.
Sappi will seek a listing on London, Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges. Mr
Eugene van As, executive chairman of Sappi, said the deal made Sappi one of
the world's 15 largest paper groups.
He said Hannover had been extensively modernised so about 40 per cent of its
capacity (430,000 tonnes of paper and 190,000 tonnes of sulphite pulp a
year) was new. Hannover was regarded as an environmental leader in Germany;
meeting environmental standards would not be an issue.
The German company was put up for sale late last year when Ncb, Hannover
Papier's owner, announced it would have to realise assets because of heavy
losses. Ncb made a loss of SKr178m (Dollars 30m) in 1991.
Ncb's SKr1.25bn sale of its 80 per cent stake in Hannover Papier is a vital
part of the Swedish state-owned forestry group's preparation for early
privatisation, adds Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
Mr Lars Henrik Forssblad, Ncb's managing director, said yesterday the
group's liquidity would 'improve dramatically' and the deal would have a
'positive effect on its profit ability this year'.
Ncb calculates the divestment of Hannover Papier will reduce its
interest-bearing liabilities to SKr1.75bn from SKr3.27bn last year.

<TEXT>
A RECOVERY in earnings in the second half of 1992 was forecast yesterday by
Mr Daniel Burke, president and chief executive of Capital Cities/ABC, the US
television and newspapers group.
Mr Burke told shareholders the second-half results would benefit from an
improvement in advertising demand in the broadcasting division. The
company's shares reacted with a rise of Dollars 8 3/4 to close at Dollars
449.
'We cannot make predictions beyond that for the balance of the year,
although we expect the company's expense growth to be modest,' he said.
The media group's 1991 net income declined by 28.1 per cent to Dollars
343.5m, on revenues of Dollars 5.4bn. In the first quarter of 1992 net
profits at Capital Cities/ABC plunged by 45 per cent, to Dollars 58.6m, on
unchanged revenues of Dollars 1.26bn.
Mr Burke promised that ABC would remain 'a player of consequence' in the
global television market, having established partnerships in seven
media-based ventures.

MOODY'S, one of the largest US rating agencies, said yesterday that it was

Its review was prompted by 'the outlook for continued losses in the

European routes 'have fallen short of Moody's expectations, and Delta's
domestic business has reflected weak conditions in the US'.

in quarter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETRO-CANADA posted a modest first-quarter profit after inventory accounting
changes. In 1991, it incurred a CDollars 598m loss including special
charges.
The profit of CDollars 32m (USDollars 26.8m), or 15 cents a share, including
proceeds from asset sales, compares with a net loss of Dollars 52m a year
earlier. Revenues were Dollars 1.1bn against Dollars 1.3bn. Cash flow from
operations doubled to Dollars 124m, or 58 cents a share. Capital spending
was halved to Dollars 97m.
The upstream division was under pressure from low oil and gas prices and
lower production. The downstream side increased sales of refined products
and reduced overheads.
The change in inventory accounting for 1992, being followed by all Canadian
integrated oil companies, inflated first-quarter earnings by 12 cents a
share.
The upstream business is being re-structured. Investment is being
concentrated in western Canada and in the east coast off-shore light oil.
Producing assets in the west will be rationalised, resulting in greater
control of core properties.
However, the net impact on production volume would be small, the company
said. But staff cuts will total 1,200 by the end of 1993.
The re-structuring will require a special charge in the second quarter.
Petro-Canada, 80 per cent state-owned, is closing nearly 1,000 retail
outlets and reducing refining capacity in the next year.
The company remains 80 per cent owned by the federal government after the
first stage of privatisation two years ago. It is trying to become more
competitive in preparation for a further privatisation step.

North America.
The food manufacturer said that the cuts would take effect over the next few

offer and natural wastage.
It added that if enough workers did not accept this offer, it would make
lay-offs.
The reductions will come at the Kraft General Foods USA, Kraft USA and Kraft

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fisons suffers setback over drug relaunch

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday received a setback in its
efforts to have Opticrom, an allergic eye treatment, relicensed in the US.
The company said inspectors from the US Food and Drug Administration had
completed their visit of its Holmes Chapel plant in Cheshire, but had made
several observations.
Mr Peter Woods, director of corporate affairs, refused to give details of
the observations, adding that he did not want to jeopardise future
discussions with the FDA. He said Fisons is responding to them and will
continue a dialogue with the FDA. He insisted the FDA had not yet made a
decision about whether to relicense the drug or not.
The FDA inspectors will not return to the US for another two weeks after
which they will make their report, according to Mr Woods. Opticrom was
withdrawn last year, after the FDA complained about the quality of
manufacture at Holmes Chapel.
The company must have permission to relaunch the product soon, if it is not
to miss the rag-weed season in the US which starts in September. So far the
withdrawal of Opticrom and another drug, Imferon, has cost the company
Pounds 65m.
Glaxo, the international pharmaceutical company, has won UK approval to
market its Zofran drug for a new indication, the prevention and treatment of
post-operative nausea and vomiting. At present it is used to control nausea
caused by cancer chemotherapy.
A licence to market Zofran, the first approval for the indication, helped
the company's share price rise in both London and New York.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL go-ahead for the flotation of GPA, the world's largest aviation
leasing company, cannot be given without a lock-in agreement with existing
main shareholders, according to Mr Maurice Foley, vice-chairman and
president.
Speaking at the company's headquarters at Shannon, Mr Foley said: 'If any
major shareholder does not agree to a lock-in there will not be a public
offering . . . the US underwriters will not underwrite the issue without
it.' He insisted that such an agreement is now in place, although he
admitted that it is not yet 'signed and sealed'. The flotation is scheduled
for mid-June and the pathfinder prospectus is due to released within the
next two weeks.
Under the terms of the lock-in, leading shareholders would not be able to
dispose of more than 15-20 per cent of their shares in the first year after
flotation.
Both Air Canada and Aer Lingus, which between them hold 21 per cent of the
company, are known to want to dispose of substantial parts of their holdings
in order to finance new investment in their own companies. However, GPA and
its underwriters are concerned that any sizeable disposals alongside the
flotation would depress the share price and possibly leave the underwriters
holding stock.
Aer Lingus said yesterday that its position had not changed since last week
in that agreement had been reached 'in principle' on the lock-in, but that
'some details still remain to be finalised' with GPA.
Other substantial shareholders include Mitsubishi Trust and Banking
Corporation (13.48 per cent), Prudential Assurance Co of America (8.1 per
cent), Irish Life (6.71 per cent), Investment Bank of Ireland (4.25 per
cent) and Allied Irish Investment Bank (3.43 per cent). Irish Life declined
to comment saying that GPA had asked for the negotiations on the lock-in to
be treated in confidence.
GPA is expected to float about 30m shares at a price in the Dollars
20-Dollars 25 range. There are currently 95m called up and fully paid
ordinary shares, plus a further 9.3m A shares held by the Mr Tony Ryan,
founder and executive chairman.
Mr Ryan said that all the directors had agreed to a lock-in for their own
shareholdings, although he declined to say whether these are signed or
verbal agreements. 'I can tell you I have signed mine' he said.

Williams Holdings, the conglomerate, again refused to comment on market
rumour that it was about to play the white knight to Dowty.
Williams said it never commented on rumours. Its shares fell 15p to 329p
following a report in the weekend press that it had held meetings with Dowty
concerning a friendly merger. However, sources close to Dowty and Williams
said no meetings or contact had taken place between the two companies and
that a friendly bid was unlikely.
Williams last week sold its holding of 9.9 per cent in Racal Electronics for

Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, said last week that Williams would
probably concentrate on buying large businesses from big companies that were
refocusing on core businesses rather than undertake hostile bids in the

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Honeymoon accounting offers financial
advantages - The controversy surrounding past TI acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH last week of TI Group's hostile bid for Dowty, the aerospace
company, raised familiar questions about how Mr Christopher Lewinton, the TI
chairman, accounts for acquisitions in his rapidly growing engineering
group.
Although within accounting standards, TI's past treatment of acquisitions is
almost certain to figure prominently in Dowty's defence this month.
The ensuing debate will again highlight current accounting rules which grant
acquiring companies a financial honeymoon during which to reorganise their
prize, a luxury not available to the same degree to incumbent managements.
Ironically Mr Michael Garner, TI's finance director, is a member of the
Accounting Standards Board which later this year will produce a draft
standard covering the treatment of fair value adjustments on acquisitions.
This well-established practice allows the cost of reorganising an
acquisition to be defrayed without impacting on profits. It has been widely
criticised as a way in which ordinary operating costs can be 'lost',
boosting reported profits and earnings.
The acquisition accounting issue looms particularly large for TI. Its rapid
transformation since 1986 from Tube Investments has involved a heavy
acquisition programme and an equally heavy use of fair value adjustments.
Over the period it spent about Pounds 500m on acquisitions and another
Pounds 100m on reorganisation.
Almost all acquisitive companies make use of the practice. At its simplest
it allows an acquiring company to identify costs of reorganisation,
redundancies and plant closures and to set up provisions in the balance
sheet against which future costs can be charged.
But in 1990, TI was widely criticised in the City for taking the practice to
the limits of what was acceptable.
Fair value provisions are usually set up soon after an acquisition and
released over 18 months. In its 1989 accounts TI made Pounds 92m of fair
value provisions, some Pounds 59m of which related to 'additional' goodwill
write-offs relating to its 1988 acquisitions. The 'additional' provision was
more than half that year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 112m.
Critics said these costs, referred to as a major rationalisation of
manufacturing facilities, systems and organisational structures in the 1989
accounts, might have been better treated as exceptionals or operating costs
in what was by than an on-going busi-ness.
Mr Lewinton and Mr Garner insist there was nothing wrong with this treatment
 - and indeed Price Waterhouse, TI's auditors, did not qualify the accounts.
'We had always had an agreement with our auditors that we would not rush to
finalise provisions in one balance sheet,' said Mr Garner. The reasoning
behind this 'second bite' at the provisions had, however, been poorly
communicated to the City.
Some analysts have argued there is more to TI's second bite.
First of all, TI had 11 months after the acquisition of Bundy, in April
1988, before the auditors signed off the 1988 accounts during which to
identify potential write-offs. It also had an opportunity before the bid,
which was agreed, and allowed TI to do full due diligence on Bundy.
Mr Garner said that the opportunity for further restructuring, and therefore
additional provisions, only came to light once senior members of the Bundy
board left nearly a year after the acquisition and fresh ideas from more
junior executives surfaced.
The debate is not academic as it has implications for TI's cash flow. TI's
unbroken record of strongly positive funds generation since 1986 would be
severely dented if some of its past provisions were treated as on-going
operating costs. In 1989, for instance, a tougher accounting treatment of
the second Bundy provision would have meant TI's operations were actually a
drain on funds.
TI argues that debate about its accounting practices is of limited value. It
now communicated properly with the City and in any case it the Dowty offer
included a full cash alternative, Mr Garner said. Furthermore if TI were
successful it said it would make only one set of provisions which would be
clearly identified against what they would be applied.
But Dowty shareholders contemplating the share offer, like TI's own
shareholders, have considerable interest in the value of the predator's
paper.
Few would question Mr Lewinton's achievement in transforming TI since 1986
or the quality of the company he has created.
However there is also no doubt that acquisition accounting has helped TI
maintain the kind of earnings per share growth which fund managers 'in the
1980s . . . wanted companies to deliver . . . above all else', in the words
of Mr Terry Smith, head of UK research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in his
introduction to a study of the art, which was published last year.
For the moment, however, the market appears content with TI's accounting,
signalling its continued love affair with the promise of further earnings
growth, which Mr Lewinton said would resume after 1993 following a
successful bid.
Supporting this view of the quality of TI, Moody's Investors Service, the US
credit rating agency, yesterday confirmed TI's A1 rating.

Clarke Hooper, the UK's only quoted sales promotion company, has sold
Schmidt-Cannon, a US subsidiary, to its management for Pounds 1.12m.
The group said the disposal was part of its rationalisation programme.
Proceeds will be used to reduce debt of some Pounds 6m with its two banks,
Robert Fleming and National Westminster.
The buy-out was concluded on April 30 without prior shareholder approval.
The company said that as the deadline for the disposal was April 30,
contacting shareholders in advance and the resulting delay 'would have put
the transaction in jeopardy and would have a serious impact on the group'.

FT  06 MAY 92 / End of the road for a dream ride: Japan's second-tier
brokerages face cuts and losses in the wake of the Nikkei's fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Tokyo stock market surged in the late 1980s, Japan's 10 second-tier
brokerages went along for the ride. They christened huge dealing rooms,
invested in next-generation technology and employed the services of Pee Wee
Herman and other celebrities in the confidence that the Big Four houses
would become the Big 14.
Those dreams went down with the Nikkei stock average. Nine of the 10 brokers
are forecasting losses for the fiscal year just ended, and nearly all are
cutting staff, closing domestic branches, and trimming their recently
expanded international operations.
Last week, Sanyo Securities closed three domestic branches, while New Japan
Securities closed four, and plans to close its Sydney and Paris offices by
the end of June. Kankaku Securities is closing offices in Milan and Bahrain,
and 'five or six domestic branches'.
The Big Four  - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and
Yamaichi Securities  - have suffered in the market collapse, but the
second-division brokers have been harder hit. These companies are generally
less skilled in new product areas, more reliant on equity commissions, less
successful in generating profits on their own accounts, and rely on a
smaller pile of still-shrinking unrealised gains on their securities
holdings.
Mr Brian Waterhouse, financial industry specialist at James Capel Pacific,
says the leading four houses need a daily market turnover of about Y450bn
(Pounds 2bn) to make money, while the second-tier houses need Y600bn.
However, the daily Tokyo average has recently been around Y250bn, well below
the 1989 average of Y1,308bn.
'These companies have been over-optimistic. We have seen a few branches
closed, but they are really yet to bite the bullet. They have thought that
the market would come good. There is a lot more pain ahead,' Mr Waterhouse
said.
That pain has its origins in the excesses of the late 1980s. Most
second-tier companies were determined to expand, and the bull market fuelled
unsustainable ambitions, resulting in a 41.6 per cent increase in securities
industry personnel in the four years until December 1989, when the market
peaked.
Just before the peak, companies were still growing. Personnel at Cosmo
Securities rose 12 per cent from fiscal 1988 to 1989, at Wako Securities by
7 per cent, and at Sanyo Securities by 11 per cent. Sanyo distinguished
itself by opening an Y8bn, high-tech dealing room, which was the largest of
its kind in the world.
But, for the year to end March, Sanyo is forecasting a net loss of Y27.5bn,
Cosmo Y29bn, and Wako Y17bn. Only Kokusai Securities, part of the Nomura
group, expects a modest Y1bn profit, having developed business in bonds and
derivatives, and focused on small company clients.
Other second-tier brokers have not had Kokusai's success in developing niche
markets, having presumed that revenue from underwriting, share trading, and
investment trust sales would continue to rise.
However, underwriting fees rose only about 5 per cent last year, and
investment trust income is forecast to fall an average 51 per cent. The
brokers' over-dependence on stock commissions has been highlighted  -
commissions account for 79 per cent of revenue at Dai-ichi Securities and 80
per cent at Kankaku Securities, compared with 52 per cent at Daiwa.
Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse Japan, said
medium-sized brokers 'have overheads just as high' as the Big Four, but
'they don't make the same money from commissions and don't have a big enough
capital base to be strong in arbitrage'. There is, she says, 'great excess
capacity in the industry'.
Most brokers now concede there will not be a quick end to the market's woes,
and agree they must become more focused and cost-conscious. New Japan
Securities, the fifth largest broker, has a four-stage plan to reduce costs:
closing and merging branches; reducing floor space; cutting executive
salaries; and transferring staff from administration to sales.
'We are hoping to increase our sales of foreign stocks to Japanese
customers, especially stocks in high-growth Asian countries. We also want to
improve our business in derivatives,' New Japan said.
New Japan and other companies cut their annual intake of graduates last
month. At Kokusai, the intake was down from 301 to 216, and at Dai-ichi from
450 to 200. Like New Japan, most brokers are bolstering sales staffs, and
pruning research divisions which expanded during the 1980s, and had been a
source of pride.
Advertising campaigns to create first-tier images for second-tier brokers
have also been shelved. Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising company, reports
that advertising by the securities industry last year fell 43.8 per cent.
The scandals prompted individual investors, on whom medium and smaller
brokers are more dependent, to shun the market. Second-tier companies
admitted compensating favoured corporate clients, and Cosmo and Yamatane
Securities were involved in disputes over tobashi  - the transfer of
loss-making securities from one client account to another to take advantage
of different book-closing dates and to avoid the reporting of losses.
Cost-cutting may not be enough. The prospect of continuing losses has raised
the possibility that second-tier companies will have to merge, although
links between these companies and other Japanese financial institutions
would provide opportunities and complications.
For example, Sanyo and Kokusai have links with Nomura, Yamatane has ties
with Sakura Bank, Cosmo is linked to Nippon Life Insurance and Daiwa Bank,
and Wako is close to the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ). National Securities
is an affiliate of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics company.
The Ministry of Finance is reported to have told the friendly banks to keep
watch over troubled brokers. Under financial reforms which may be introduced
as early as next year, Japanese banks will be able to enter the stock
business, although the banks' past enthusiasm for share trading has waned.
The troubles of Japanese brokers could present opportunities for a foreign
securities house looking to expand its retail operations in Japan. No deals
have surfaced, but rumours of partnerships and distress sales are already
doing the rounds.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Deutsche Bank to expand in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK is planning to restructure and expand its North American
operations to strength-en its presence in US capital markets and private
banking.
Since 1990, Deutsche Bank has more than trebled its US assets to Dollars
14bn (Pounds 7.9bn). It now plans to increase these assets by 20 per cent to
30 per cent over the next one to two years.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, board member responsible for the region, said the bank's
aim was to 'become a leading player in key wholesale sectors' in the US. He
stressed that the bank hopes to expand by internal growth rather than
acquisition. To accomplish this, the bank is creating a holding company
structure to bring together US, Canadian and Mexican activities.
Mr Schmitz said that over the next two years Deutsche Bank planned to commit
additional capital to the New York-based business in order to enter new
areas. The specific areas to be developed were domestic corporate finance,
capital markets and trading, swap transactions, foreign exchange and
derivative products. The bank will also focus on asset management for
institutions and private clients.
Deutsche Bank employs 1,200 people in North America and this is expected to
rise over the medium term.
Last year Deutsche Bank's US securities subsidiary was allowed by the New
York Federal Reserve to act as a primary dealer. Mr Schmitz said Deutsche
Bank was holding talks with the Federal Reserve over the relationship it has
with C. J. Lawrence, its US equity research and brokerage subsidiary, which
was acquired along with Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank.
The bank's overall aim is to catch US corporate clients who place an
emphasis on dealing with strongly capitalised banks. Mr Schmitz said
Deutsche Bank had relations with 69 of America's 100 largest industrial
companies and wanted to build its US corporate finance business well beyond
just servicing US offshoots of German companies.
Mr Schmitz said the bank had been 'largely untouched' by problem lending in
the US commercial property sector. However, the bank is understood to have
almost Dollars 50m of loans to Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group
undergoing debt restructuring.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Waigel tightens screw to cut German budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, yesterday called for new limits
on unemployment benefits and cancellation of all subsidies next year for the
Federal Labour Office, in a drive to reduce the state budget deficit.
His call, condemned as 'antisocial' by the country's trade union federation,
came as German public sector unions responded to the approach of pay talks
today with the biggest show of force in their nine-day strike. Some 330,000
workers were brought out on strike, and Frankfurt airport, continental
Europe's busiest, was closed for the day.
Mr Waigel's drastic proposal, which would cut next year's state spending by
DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in comparison with the current year, was the only
substantial saving put forward by the finance minister in a gloomy review of
planned spending for the next four years.
Instead he insisted that any new projects  - including reform of the
railways, old age care, and new family and housing allowances  - must be
self-financing in the coming years. He said a promised reform of corporate
taxation must be neutral in its effect on the budget, and that all public
spending would be kept to a maximum 3 per cent growth rate until 1996.
He failed to answer fears that the costs of subsidising and rebuilding east
Germany would lead to a steadily rising budget deficit, but simply insisted
that the present medium-term financial strategy must be maintained. That
calls for a cut in the budget deficit from around DM45bn this year to just
DM25bn in 1995.
His presentation to the parliamentary groups of the ruling coalition parties
suggested there will be little if any new cash in the public sector pay
offer expected to be put on the table in talks with the unions today.
The limit of 3 per cent growth on spending for the public sector  - and 2.5
per cent for the central government  - is only half the expected nominal
growth rate over the next four years.
The Federal Labour Office is responsible for all unemployment benefits in
Germany, as well as training and job-creation schemes which have been
critical to the maintenance of income levels in the collapsed east German
economy. This year's federal subsidy amounted to DM5bn, Mr Waigel said.
Unofficial estimates suggested that up to DM6bn would be needed in 1993,
without substantial savings.
Mr Waigel rejected suggestions, from Germany's economic institutes and from
his Cabinet colleague, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, that he
was underestimating the real strains on his budget.
At the same time he called for 'iron savings' to reduce the budget deficit,
admitting the pressures from the 'national and international financial
markets for our contribution to a fall in interest rates'.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Amersham clinches Russian deal: British company to sell
radioactive materials for non-military purposes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE troubled Russian nuclear industry today will announce its first
significant deal to supply radioactive materials to the west.
The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry is setting up a joint
venture with Amersham International of the UK. Mayak, its production centre
at Chelyabinsk in the Ural mountains, will manufacture radioactive isotopes
for Amersham to sell worldwide for non-military applications, including
nuclear medicine, scientific research and industrial irradiation.
Mr Bruce Beharrell, the Amersham director in charge of the negotiations,
expects Mayak initially to receive Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.4m) a year in hard
currency for the isotopes. Their final value after incorporation into
Amersham products is likely to be about Dollars 100m a year. Mayak's income
from the agreement 'will grow rapidly as we work more closely together', Mr
Beharrell said.
Mr Dewi Lewis, group strategy manager, says the joint venture will adopt
Amersham's existing procedures to ensure the import and export of isotopes
comply with national and international regulations for nuclear trade.
Last year the company was cleared by the UK Trade and Industry Department of
any wrongdoing when it was revealed as a supplier of tiny quantities of
plutonium solution to Iraq in the 1980s. The shipments 'were in accordance
with the export licences,' the DTI said.
Mayak, Russia's largest nuclear complex, includes civil reactors, weapons
production and fuel reprocessing facilities. Until the Soviet Union started
to collapse last year, it was a top-secret facility whose very existence
officially was denied. The whole Chelyabinsk region  - blighted by
radioactive pollution  - was closed to outsiders. Now the Ministry of Atomic
Energy is desperately short of funds and keen to seize any opportunity to
commercialise its work.
'This co-operation with Amersham is going to be very useful to improve the
financial situation of Mayak,' said Mr Victor Fetisov, director general of
Mayak.
'It will help our conversion programme (from military to civil work) and
also improve our capability to solve the environmental problems of the
region.'
With the average salary of a nuclear scientist in Russia below Dollars 100 a
year at current exchange rates, the initial income of Dollars 15m a year
from Amersham will give Mayak a huge boost.
Amersham scientists and engineers who visited Mayak were surprised by the
good condition of its technical and production facilities. 'We have looked
at the plant and we are fully satisfied that the standards match the quality
demands of our customers,' said Mr Bill Castell, Amersham chief executive.
He expects a reliable flow of material from Mayak to boost Amersham's sales.
These have been held back by a shortage of isotopes since 1990, when the UK
government closed two research reactors  - Pluto and Dido - at Harwell in
Oxfordshire which had been Amersham's main source of radioactive materials.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Arab banks' objections may put BCCI deal in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OBJECTIONS from a number of Arab creditor banks that are together owed
Dollars 800m (Pounds 452m) by the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International could jeopardise the proposed Dollars 1.7bn settlement
agreement worked out by the liquidator and majority shareholder of BCCI.
The objections have come to light ahead of a High Court hearing in London,
due on Monday, which is intended to examine the proposed compensation deal
for BCCI creditors.
In a letter last month to the BCCI creditors' committee, Mr Ahmed Hassan,
deputy governor of Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt, said the majority
shareholder of BCCI, which is the government of Abu Dhabi, had 'a moral (and
possibly a legal) responsibility to ensure that creditors receive full
compensation for the losses they have suffered'.
Mr Hassan  - who stated in the letter that he was also writing on behalf of
Dubai Islamic Bank, Tadamon Islamic Bank of Khartoum and Islamic
International Bank for Investment and Development of Egypt  - dismissed as
inadequate the present compensation offer to BCCI creditors of 30 to 40
cents in the dollar.
The agreement with Abu Dhabi was announced in February by Mr Brian Smouha,
the Touche Ross partner overseeing the worldwide winding up of BCCI. The
deal proposes a flat payment of Dollars 1.7bn in compensation based on the
current estimated liabilities of about Dollars 10bn. The figure could rise
to Dollars 2.2bn if claims exceed Dollars 10bn or fall to Dollars 1.2bn if
claims are below that amount.
In return, the majority shareholders and liquidators are supposed to drop
all claims and counter-claims, and creditors are supposed to sign over a
number of legal rights.
Faisal Islamic Bank's objections follow the more explicit rejection of the
compensation package by the Depositors' Protection Association, a group of
300 individual BCCI creditors which is owed about Dollars 1bn.
The letter from Faisal Islamic Bank, a copy of which has been obtained by
the Financial Times, says the bank creditors have insufficient information
to decide whether the settlement proposal is in the best interest of
creditors.
In London, a Touche Ross official said he had not seen the letter and could
offer no comment. Mr Smouha could not be reached.
Next week's London court hearing is only one part of a complex series of
steps to be taken before the creditors' package can go forward. The deal is
also dependent on agreement from creditors owed 70 per cent of the bank's
Dollars 10bn of liabilities and requires court approval in Luxembourg and
the Cayman Islands as well as the UK.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Dip below the German line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TURBULENT times, human beings naturally cling to apparent certainties.
That no member of the European exchange rate mechanism shall have lower
interest rates than Germany appears to have assumed law-like status in UK
government circles, unchallenged save by the foolhardy. But there is no
necessary connection between the ERM and a German interest rate floor;
merely, as the philosopher David Hume might have remarked, an impression
created by recent history. The UK should put this point to the test.
Yesterday's welcome half a percentage point interest rate cut still leaves
UK rates in double figures and there are few signs that anything other than
a very half-hearted recovery is under way. The easing of UK monetary policy
over the past 18 months has been modest compared with that in the US, Canada
or Australia, which have had similar recessions.
Yet the discipline of the ERM appears to rule out further cuts. The UK
short-term interest rate differential with Germany has now narrowed to a
mere quarter of a percentage point. No ERM country has managed to sustain
lower rates than Germany without its exchange rate breaking through the
bottom of its permitted bands and so requiring higher interest rates. The
UK, if the Treasury is to be believed, is not about to follow the French
example of last year and cut rates below Germany's only to beat a hasty and
ignominious retreat. The outbreak of pay-related strikes in Germany, and the
rapid growth of the Bundesbank's treasured monetary aggregates, suggest that
German interest rates will keep the floor high for some months yet.
Claim undermined
But is it not possible that the very events which are keeping German
interest rates high are also undermining Germany's claim to be Europe's
model of anti-inflationary rectitude? Germany has maintained lower interest
rates in the past because of the Bundesbank's impressive record. But the
inflationary hang-over from German unification has dented Germany's
credibility. West German workers do not want to pay for the reconstruction
of east Germany by moderating their pay claims, hence last year's rise in
wage inflation, and this year's strikes.
The Bundesbank's credibility depends on whether it, and the government, are
willing to stand firm against these wage demands. If the government does
yield in the face of popular unrest, as it may, and the Bundesbank
accommodates the pay increases by permitting a burst of inflation, which it
just might, then its reputation will be damaged. Mr Major's finest hour
might be at hand: with five years of Conservative government in store, and
lower headline inflation than in Germany, what better government to lead a
cut in European interest rates?
Superficial arguments
The UK Treasury will be right to resist these superficial arguments. The
anti-inflation constituency in Germany remains strong, and the Bundesbank
Council may well sanction a further rise in rates, however internationally
embarrassing for Mr Kohl or, indeed, Mr Schlesinger. Even at the top of its
boom, Germany still has lower underlying inflation than post-recession
Britain. UK wage inflation must fall, and soon, before the UK can style
itself a low-inflation country.
Yet there is another reason, unrelated to Germany's current troubles, why
the UK could cut its interest rates again: its wide ERM bands. If the UK
were to cut its short rates below those in Germany, sterling might slip
towards the bottom of its bands. But the fact that sterling could
conceivably appreciate by 12.7 per cent, from the bottom to the top, might
well be enough to persuade investors that lower UK rates were worth the
gamble. The UK could not maintain this expectation indefinitely, and it
would do nothing to ease long interest rates, but it might keep short rates
lower for a while.
In short, the UK should cut interest rates again soon and enjoy its wide ERM
bands rather than ditching them in some misplaced act of Eurocommitment
ahead of its presidency of the EC. So long as inflation remains on a
downward path, this will be the right approach, even if it does raise the
risk of having to raise interest rates again if sterling plummets. The rest
of northern Europe will just have to wait.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A strategy for UK education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Patten, Britain's new education secretary, faces an embarras de
richesses in implementing the Conservative manifesto pledge to increase the
number of grant maintained schools opting out of local education authority
control. Half a dozen education authorities are encouraging their schools to
opt out en bloc, to avoid a two-tier system with some opted-out and others
not. Given the generous funding available to grant-maintained schools, this
is a very real danger.
Mr Patten has condemned such mass opt-outs as attempts by town hall
bureaucrats to manage the process to their own advantage. Ministers believe
that education authorities are trying to structure the terms of
disengagement to foist town hall services on opted-out schools. More
validly, they say that opting out can work only if the parents, governors,
head and teachers work as a team to make the new arrangements work.
But the response from these  - often Conservative  - authorities reflects
nothing more than a recognition that opting out is here to stay. While only
just over 200 of the 23,000 schools in England and Wales have so far opted
out, the return of a Conservative government has accelerated the process.
More than 2,000 schools have asked for details of the procedures, and most
secondary schools are likely to make the jump during the next five years.
Legislation is promised to allow smaller primary schools to opt out in
groups.
Weak mechanism
This raises fundamental questions about the future of education in England
and Wales. One is how such schools are to be managed: the mechanism of
control appears to be weak, as the experience of Stratford school, east
London shows. Its school governors have been at loggerheads with the head
teacher for some months, throwing the school - and the education of its
children  - into turmoil. The former education secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke
attempted to intervene three times, largely without success.
If thousands of schools are to opt out, the Education Department will have
to create a decentralised administration to manage and fund them, not to
mention an authority representing the views of the wider community beyond
parent-dominated boards of governors. This task could be fulfilled by
modified local education authorities acting as purchasers of education
services; if the government has some other idea in mind, the time has come
to explain it.
Efficiency questions
Then there are questions of efficiency and economy. Eliminating 1.5m surplus
school places cannot be done other than by closing schools, yet schools
threatened by closure can often avoid this fate by opting out. Similar
problems arise with plans to re-organise post-16 education into sixth-form
colleges: schools which wish to retain sixth forms can opt out to thwart
rationalisation.
With additional resources needed in many parts of the education system, the
profligacy which this anarchy permits cannot be tolerated. Some way of
closing surplus capacity and avoiding wasteful duplication must be found;
schools cannot do this on their own.
Finally, there is the question of selection. Increasingly opted-out schools
will specialise and provide for special needs, creating 'centres of
excellence'. This is commendable, but there are signs that specialisation is
becoming an excuse for re-introducing selection. The London borough of
Wandsworth, for example, last night voted to abandon comprehensive education
and make all its secondary schools selective.
Supporters say this will increase diversity and improve choice for parents.
But the unpalatable truth is that such a process is likely to recreate a
two-tier education system, with selective schools creaming off the most able
and motivated, reducing choice and probably resources for the rest. Genuine
choice requires well-funded technical and vocational schools enjoying parity
of esteem with more academic schools.
A stable institutional and policy framework is essential if managerial
reforms such as opting out are to be successful. Before encouraging a
stampede of opt outs, Mr Patten should produce a medium-term educational
strategy which encompasses such a framework and offers a vision for the
future.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Another cautious cut for growth: Yesterday's reduction in UK
base rates was overdue, but may not be enough to spur a quick recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont's decision to cut bank base rates yesterday by 0.5
percentage points to 10 per cent is a moderate gamble with sterling's
international standing that will not translate into a perceptibly strong
recovery in the UK economy for some time.
The rate cut will clearly do no harm to the Conservative party in tomorrow's
local elections. But it was overdue on economic grounds, as the government's
provisional figures for Britain's gross domestic product in the first
quarter of this year are likely to show when published later this month.
These could well indicate a continuing decline in output in a recession that
has already become the longest since the 1930s. Although there has since
been a marked recovery in consumer and business confidence, especially since
the Conservatives' election victory on April 9, hard evidence of economic
revival has been patchy.
On the other hand, the government's decision means Britain's officially
inspired interest rates are now only 0.25 percentage points higher than the
comparable German Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent. The differential between UK
and German short-term rates has not been so low since 1981, when UK rates
briefly dipped below those of Germany after a period of two years when
sterling, then a petro-currency, had been exceptionally strong.
Since he became chancellor nearly 18 months ago, Mr Lamont has pursued a
cautious but successful policy of reducing interest rates in response to
falling inflation in the UK. Although the differential between UK and German
rates has narrowed from about 7 percentage points in October 1990, when
Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System,
yesterday's rate cut  - the first in eight months  - falls into this
cautious category.
It came after careful testing of the money and foreign exchange market
conditions late last week by the Bank of England. Also fed into the judgment
of the Treasury and the Bank of England were the impressions of future
German policy moves and dilemmas garnered by the chancellor and Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, at last week's meeting of the
Group of Seven leading industrialised countries in Washington.
The cut should help to turn the UK's so far elusive economic recovery into
reality. But there are doubts whether the upturn can be strong enough to
meet the Treasury's target of 1 per cent growth in GDP this year. This fact
alone implies that the UK economy could take advantage of further rate cuts
to return to steady growth while avoiding the risk of higher inflation. But,
despite the recent recovery of sterling in the EMS and the economic and
social problems currently wracking Germany, yesterday's rate cut looks as if
it will be the last for some months.
This is bad news, given that Britain's policymakers are not dealing with a
conventional recovery. High levels of debt in the corporate and personal
sectors have weakened the usual levers of policy by dissuading businesses
from investment and households from new purchases.
Initial returns from leading high street traders suggest that there has been
no significant increase in retail sales since the election result lifted the
threat of increased income tax burdens from higher-income earners.
Motor traders, whose fortunes were boosted in Mr Lamont's March Budget by
the halving of the special car tax and tax incentives for company fleet
buyers, appear to have experienced some recovery. It is expected that
official figures tomorrow will show that UK car sales in April recorded the
first year-on-year rise since October 1989.
But in the vitally important housing market there is little sign of an
upturn. Although mortgage rates followed base rates downwards and the
government decided last December to give housing a further boost through a
temporary suspension of stamp duty on most house purchases, sales of houses
fell to a seasonally adjusted 87,000 a month in the first quarter of this
year from 102,000 in the previous quarter. The decline took place against a
grim background of still rising unemployment, falling house prices and a
continuing, albeit diminishing, wave of house repossessions.
Expectations were high that the housing market would revive once
pre-election uncertainties were dispelled by the return of Mr John Major's
government. But yesterday, senior UK officials admitted that it was hard to
find any trace of 'animal spirits' in the housing market in recent weeks.
The dilemma facing Britain's policymakers was highlighted by the building
societies' response to yesterday's base rate cut. The biggest lender, the
Halifax building society, responded with a reduction in mortgage rates. But
the scale of the cut  - 0.3 percentage points to 10.65 per cent for new
borrowers  - was less than the base rate reduction, reflecting the decision
of the societies and other mortgage lenders to cut rates by 0.5 percentage
points earlier this year in anticipation of a pre-election base rate cut
that never materialised.
The new Halifax rates will mean that the average borrower with an
endowment-linked mortgage of Pounds 60,000 will save just Pounds 13.13 a
month. Although such a saving will be augmented by the effects of the modest
tax cuts in Mr Lamont's March budget, it is unclear whether they will untie
consumers' purse strings.
Indeed, the mortgage rate and tax cuts may do little more than offset an
overall drop in real personal disposable incomes. According to Salomon
Brothers, the US securities house, real incomes may have fallen by 0.5 per
cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months
of 1991, as rising unemployment counteracted the effect of wage settlements.
Although the UK's inflation performance has been mildly disappointing in
recent months, with the annual rate of increase in the retail prices index
and the so-called underlying rate of RPI, which excludes mortgage interest
payments, both higher in March than in October last year, the Treasury and
Bank felt no qualms in sanctioning a base rate cut yesterday on domestic
economic grounds.
Where they did pause for thought was on the international front. Last week
in Washington, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, tried to
assure Germany's leading trading partners that a further rise in short-term
German interest rates was improbable.
But a week is a long time in German monetary politics. When the UK
authorities took the plunge yesterday, they were aware that the Bonn
government might be about to make concessions in the bruising public sector
wage dispute and conscious that tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting would
have the wage round and the inflationary pressures besetting Germany high on
its agenda.
The Frankfurt-based Bundesbank directorate might oppose a rate increase,
partly out of consideration for Germany's allies. But would the hardline
counter-inflationists among the state central bank governors take a similar
line? And would they, as they have done in the past, steamroller an interest
rate hike through the council?
That Mr Lamont decided to cut base rates partly reflects the enhanced
standing that the UK and sterling have enjoyed in financial markets since
the election. Mr Major's new government, armed with a working majority that
should be good for a full five-year term, has suddenly made Britain appear
an island of political stability compared with Germany, France or the US.
Also important has been a gradual reappraisal of Germany's problems in
financial markets and foreign finance ministries. When the Bundesbank pushed
up its key interest rates in December to the highest levels since the 1930s,
the D-Mark's function as the anchor currency in the ERM was unquestioned.
All Germany's ERM partners, except Britain, followed suit with interest
increases of their own. The UK response was to let the sterling exchange
rate take the strain by allowing it to fall within the pound's wider 6 per
cent fluctuation margins.
Now nobody is quite so sure that a German rate increase would trigger the
same response. British policymakers, for example, argue that a German rate
rise would be more readily accepted by the markets as a sign of Germany's
own serious problems, ranging from the difficulty of absorbing eastern
Germany and the strain that this entails for public sector budgets, to the
current public service workers' strike which could boost already high German
wages to uncompetitive levels.
In short, Germany's problems pose a risk for the UK government's interest
rate policy. But it appears a risk worth taking.
This is particularly the case if future inflation and productivity trends
are taken into account. Although the course of the annual rate of RPI may be
uneven, there is little doubt in the Treasury and the Bank that inflation in
Britain is on a downwards course. Similarly, UK productivity is growing,
partly because of the labour shake-out that accompanied the recession.
So why are the UK authorities not considering a faster reduction in interest
rates? One reason is that to bring UK rates below German levels would really
be a step into the unknown. Britain's inflation rate, as measured by the
RPI, may be below Germany's. But this does not mean that the UK's low
inflation credentials are well established. Seared on the corporate memory
of European finance ministries is the French experience at the end of last
year, when the authorities in Paris were forced to move their rates upwards
following the Bundesbank's December move. This was despite France having an
inflation rate that was markedly below that of Germany and a tighter, more
credible fiscal policy.
UK domestic politics are a further spur to monetary caution. The last
election was a very risky venture for Mr Major and his team because the
economic and political cycles had been allowed to become unsynchronised. The
prime minister defied traditional wisdom by winning an election while the
economy was gripped by recession.
At the start of a new five-year term, Mr Lamont has no interest in
accelerating the recovery at the risk of reigniting inflation. Depending on
events in Germany a further very small rate cut may be in the pipeline, but
it is highly unlikely until late in the year.

<TEXT>
Anyone who has ever worked for The Times or Punch has had to grow used to
the comment 'Ah, yes, a great institution, but not what it was, of course'.
The same is often said of British television comedy and the right response
is the one that was first coined for The Times as long ago as the 19th
century: 'True, but then it never was'. The thought is prompted by the
appearance of two new situation comedies  - Side By Side and Don't Tell
Father  - in a week that also brought repeat episodes of George And The
Dragon (1966), Please Sir] (1968) and On The Buses (1970).
Those last three date from the period which is often identified as the
golden age of British television comedy, but this seems to owe more to rose
tinted spectacles than to reality. There are probably three reasons for the
period's inflated reputation. First, at almost all times there has been one
outstanding comedy on British television (Blackadder Goes Forth, Fawlty
Towers, The Good Life, Dad's Army and so on) but during the 1960s there were
two: Steptoe And Son and Till Death Us Do Part, and somehow two seemed much
more than twice as many as one. Secondly, there was much less television in
those days and far fewer sitcoms around, a dozen perhaps. Two as a
proportion of 12 is much more impressive than two would be today as a
proportion of 40 or 50. Thirdly, both series were sold under format deals to
the Americans and became highly successful in the US. This more than
anything has caused those in the industry to shake their heads ruefully and
tell stories to newcomers of what it was like in the good old days when
British comedy was top.
Yet judging from George And The Dragon, Please Sir] and On The Buses they
must have felt like the bad old days much of the time to any moderately
intelligent viewer. In George And The Dragon Sid James played a butler (old
fashioned, surely, even 30 years ago) and Peggy Mount a housekeeper, working
for an old buffer played by John le Mesurier. Unfortunately he appeared very
little in the episode shown in the penultimate edition of Channel 4's
fascinating TV Heaven season, and the dialogue and business between James
and Mount was dire. She said things like 'Would you like to see my
credentials?' at which he did a slow double-take and said 'Eh?' before
asking ''Ow are yer dumplings?' All this was inundated, of course, with
gallons of canned laughter.
The long, slow pilot episode of Please Sir] shown in the ultimate edition of
TV Heaven was, if anything, even worse, with a boyish John Alderton as the
newly arrived naive school teacher being asked 'Hedges, what would you say
to tapioca four times on the trot?' and mispronouncing the name of his Greek
pupil. At least On The Buses had a bit of physical farce with Stan (Reg
Varney) trying to sell an old motorcycle combination to Stephen Lewis's bus
inspector and getting him jammed inside the sidecar. Yet this served chiefly
as a reminder of the memorable Harpo/Groucho sidecar sequence which was so
much funnier.
The lines in On The Buses were as feeble as those in the other two. When
Stan drafts a small ad for Arthur to sell the motorbike and writes 'Must
sell, owner going abroad' Arthur says 'But I'm not going abroad' to which
the punchline is 'If you sell this you might have to'. No self-respecting
American comedy producer would accept such a puny gag, but in Britain it is
shoved in and garnished with the usual dollop of artificial laughter in the
hope of making us think it is funny.
So if it was not such a golden age, if the small quantity of truly funny
sitcoms was even at that period outweighed by a much larger amount of dull
dross, are we perhaps more fortunate today than we realise, given that there
are now so many more comedies on offer? The answer, surely, is no. However
many we may have to choose from, the standard is uniformly low and, what is
worse, there is now not even one series which is generally recognised as
being outstanding. Some would argue that Drop The Dead Donkey should be
allowed into the pantheon, and I would go some way towards agreeing, but  -
having recently watched the repeat series  - would need to see more evidence
of staying power before being sure. At least this series has the sort of
joke frequency which we expect from the Americans, and jokes and character
development go hand in hand as in Cheers and The Golden Girls.
It is a little early to be certain, but it does not look as though it will
be possible to say the same of either Don't Tell Father (Sundays BBC1) or
Side By Side (Mondays BBC1). After watching these it scarcely seems any
wonder that the rest of the world continues to believe  - despite the rigid
pecking order in Arab states, despite the position of blacks in the US,
despite the caste system in India  - that class consciousness is somehow
peculiarly English. Both series seem obsessed with the minutiae of class
distinction.
The title Side By Side is a reference to the semi-detached proximity of
middle class Gilly Bell who went to art school, drives a scarlet Citroen
2CV, and has been condemned to genteel poverty by widowhood, and Vince
Tulley, a cockney plumber with loadsamoney but no taste who wants to build
an extension, my dear, with Greek columns. Script sample: 'I sat at Swami
Boojar's feet for five years'  - 'That must have been uncomfortable'  -
riotous canned laughter.
Don't Tell Father, which stars Tony Britton as a rich thespian paterfamilias
on his fifth wife (Susan Hampshire, who gets few lines, but the same bit of
business each week where she drags on a cigarette and then frantically
sprays mouth and room with breath freshener) inhabits an even more
old-fashioned world not far removed from that of Lord Snooty And His Pals.
In tones which recall Dame Edith Evans saying 'A handbag?' Britton has to
say things such as 'How is it going to look if my daughter marries a
manipulator of motor vehicles?'
The central idea of the grand actor is based upon popular assumptions which
were going out of date at about the time Donald Wolfit was moving up from
juvenile leads, and although the plot has so far concentrated on the desire
of the fat daughter to marry a driving instructor called Marvin Whipple
(canned laughter) instead of a member of the county set, there is on the
reserve bench a Marxist-Leninist daughter (black leather, blonde and
gorgeous) who talks only of the downtrodden workers, and a hippy son who is
forever tripping out and practising transcendental meditation. Perhaps Roy
Clarke delivered the script in 1962 and the BBC has only just found it.
At this juncture, if I were in charge of situation comedy for a British
television company, I would continue with the traditional British 'fragile
genius' system: high quality comedy from fragile geniuses left alone in
their garrets (or later their penthouses) to produce polished masterpieces
in glorious isolation, a fact established for all time by Fawlty Towers  -
just so long as they proved they were geniuses. Otherwise I would start
experimenting with the American joke-or-door team system: more jokes in the
places I say or you leave by that door.
Something certainly needs to be done if British television comedy is to
avoid going the way of Punch (hollow canned laughter).

FT  06 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Wiping out pollution from the
ground up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the industrialised world is a dirty place. In recent years, western
governments have forced companies to cut drastically their emissions of
gases, chemicals and other pollutants into the air and water.
But what happens to the mess left in the ground when a company moves, closes
down, or decides to change its ways after operating on the same site for
years? The area is often unfit for industrial or other use and a costly,
time-consuming, clean-up process is needed.
Although the extreme environmental problems of eastern Europe have received
most recent attention  - these range from fetid air to unsafe nuclear power
stations  - there are plenty of problem sites in the west. One company which
specialises in cleaning them up is Lurgi Umwelt-Beteiligung (LUB), though it
has plenty of competition from other companies.
LUB can draw on the depth of experience in ore processing of its Lurgi
parent company, part of the Metallgesellschaft group. As yet,
decontamination is an industry in its infancy, but the scale of the problem
and the tightening up of regulations across Europe is likely to bring about
an escalation of business. LUB reckons some 130,000 former industrial sites
probably need cleaning up in Germany alone. In perhaps 10 per cent, this
should be done quickly to avert potential health risks.
About 30,000 of these areas are in east Germany, which has some of the most
notorious pollution in Europe. But more than 90,000 are in west Germany;
causing the contamination has been a variety of industries such as smelting,
chemicals and power generation.
LUB's process is called Deconterra. It works by running the soil though a
big rotating drum filled only with water. Through the vigorous scrubbing
process, the contaminant materials fall off the large particles and become
attached to the small ones. The unpurified particles are sent through
further attrition and flotation processes, ending up in a foam discharge
which is drawn off in concentrated form.
Lurgi says between 65 and 85 per cent of contaminated soil on a given site
can be cleaned in this way. Apart from continuing work near its own
headquarters at the edge of Frankfurt, formerly a copper processing plant,
it is also cleaning up a coking coal site in Bochum in the Ruhr and an area
in Bavaria contaminated with mercury.
Perhaps its most exciting project is the reclamation of areas in the Hesse
town of Stadtallendorf, the location of Germany's biggest explosives plant
in the Second World War and where much of the ground contains
trinitrotoluene (TNT). Yet mechanical soil-washing processes like
Deconterra, which deals mainly with organic chemicals, cannot cope with all
problems. Biological and thermal treatment, which LUB does not do, is also
needed for some types of contamination such as heavy metals and fuel-oils.
In east Germany, the scope for decontamination seems boundless. 'There is a
huge need,' says Hartmut Witte, the head of LUB. 'but there is no money.'
The states there do not have the funds for a wholescale clean-up. The
situation is worse in the rest of east Europe, which has even less money
available. Thus Witte is looking elsewhere for immediate foreign expansion.
As EC and national rules are stiffened, dumping charges will become
prohibitive and most companies wanting to prepare sites for future use will
prefer to clean them up. Denmark and the Netherlands, which have even
tougher laws than Germany on ground contamination, are likely markets, as
are France and the UK.
But he also has his sights set on the US, where LUB is operating test sites
for eventual acceptance of Deconterra by the Environmental Protection
Agency. Its partner there is Horsehead Resources, in which
Metallgesellschaft has a large minority stake.
To make its process more manageable, LUB has developed mobile units for
areas with small soil volumes. These would be suitable not only for Europe
but also the US. Moreover, several west German states want to set up
regional decontamination centres which would need mobile units to transport
the soil. LUB is keen to help operate these.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Stuck with the bill - Europe's
insurers could learn from US experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers at Lloyd's of London breathed a sigh of relief last month after a
New Jersey court ruled that they were not liable for the costs of a Dollars
100m (Pounds 56m) environmental clean-up. Market leaders believe that the
case  - involving the chemical company Diamond Shamrock, which manufactured
herbicides including agent orange at its Newark plant  - could reflect a
change in US legal opinion.
John Wetherell, chairman of the Lloyd's non-marine underwriters association,
says he senses that the complex and drawn-out legal battle between insurers
and US industry about who should pay the bill to clean up America could be
moving in favour of insurers.
The issue is crucial for Lloyd's  - which is among dozens of US and European
insurers which face potentially crippling losses if the US courts order
insurers to pay costs estimated by Tillinghast, Nelson &amp; Warren, the US
actuarial consultants, at between Dollars 41bn and Dollars 1trillion
(million million).
But many observers are less sanguine than Wetherell. Specialist
environmental lawyers and insurers point out that the underlying trend of
legal settlements in the US is favouring policyholders. Worse still,
European insurers also face potentially heavy exposures nearer home as the
cost of European industrial clean-up becomes clearer.
Dawn Enright, a US lawyer working with London-based Cameron Markby Hewitt,
says British insurers in particular are 'not doing enough to protect
themselves. They have a chance to look and learn from the US experience.
They have been lucky so far but this could change'.
Since 1980, when the US government introduced the so-called 'Superfund' laws
to make the 'polluter pay' for environmental clean-up, the US industry has
been attempting to offload the cost on to its insurers. The trend of rulings
on a number of basic issues gives the insurance industry little cause for
comfort.
The majority of legal opinions have favoured policy holders on one
fundamental issue: whether government-ordered clean-ups constitute insured
damages under the terms of comprehensive general liability (CGL) policies.
Six out of eight state high courts  - California, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
North Carolina, Washington and most recently Iowa  - have said that
government-mandated costs are covered under the CGL policies. High Courts in
Maine and New Hampshire have ruled that the costs are not covered.
In addition, four federal appeals courts have found they are covered. Only
two have said that they are not.
wording in the early 1970s, restricting coverage to 'sudden and accidental
pollution'. But even in cases involving these policies the courts have
sometimes ruled in favour of policyholders. Enright points out that the
terms 'sudden and accidental' are ambiguous. While insurers were intending
to offer cover for sudden discharges of pollutants, courts have often tended
to support policyholder interpretations in which the term 'sudden' has meant
sudden discovery of gradual pollution.
Insurers have also lost out on a third issue: whether a company being sued
for the cost of cleaning up hazardous waste sites can claim on all its
policies from the time the pollution begins to the point at which liability
is known, the so-called 'continuous trigger'.
Lawyers and specialists believe that increasingly the insurance industry
will need to focus its energy not on defence of general issues but on the
facts of particular cases of pollution, where it can prove - as in the
Diamond Shamrock case  - that pollution was deliberate.
'Courts are becoming sensitised to the factual circumstances of each case.
Where the pollution can be shown to be expected or intended, insurers can be
let off the hook,' says Peter Burgin, a lawyer with LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby &amp;
MacRae in New York.
However, insurers will see legal costs rise as they step up their defences.
Increasingly, environmental litigation will be on a case-by-case basis. 'It
will be like trench warfare. Costly and long drawn out,' says Burgin.
In Europe there is little doubt that the cost of the environmental clean-up
will be considerable: UK consultants Ecotec estimate that the UK has between
50,000 and 100,000 contaminated sites, with a total area of 100,000
hectares. Germany has 130,000 contaminated sites and the Netherlands has
100,000.
Although the shape of European legal framework is still unclear  - with
initiatives at national and European level creating a complicated patchwork
of laws  - in several countries a much tougher regime of pollution control
and remediation is at hand.
Section 61 of Britain's Environmental Protection Act of November 1990
permits local authorities to recover the costs incurred in site clean-ups
from the site owner, for example.
A draft European Commission green paper prepared this year starts from the
recognition that something must be done to clean up what it calls 'the
legacy of environmental damage from the past'.
In addition, several features of both national and EC legislation could
encourage litigation. For example, in the UK the Environmental Protection
Act of 1990 has introduced a more rigorous regime of pollution control in
which local authorities will be forced to build up detailed registers of
polluted sites.
Brian Street, an environmental insurance specialist with Reliance National
in the UK, says this new legislation 'will greatly increase the power of
pressure groups to bring civil proceedings.' Moreover, some critics believe
that insurers are complacent about the problem.
Many UK companies, for example, have continued to underwrite public
liability policies which, by not excluding pollution, in effect offer the
broadest possible insurance coverage.
Except for installations where there was a perceived risk of pollution, such
as a chemical plant, restrictions of coverage to sudden and accidental
damage have been generally introduced only since 1990, a delay which
Randolph Fields, a American lawyer specialising in environmental law,
describes as 'inexplicable'.
Both Street and Fields believe UK insurers could face potentially massive
losses. Fields says liability claims deriving from 'carte blanche
underwriting of unrestricted pollution liability insurance in the UK between
1930 and 1990' are of potentially 'catastrophic proportions'.
What seems certain is that what one Lloyd's underwriter calls the 'sins of
the past' will haunt insurers for some time to come.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Jobs: Where the real fat cats are to be found - Survey
figures show that most public argument about executive pay in Britain misses
the point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREDIBLE though it must seem to anyone who has met the Jobs column, there
have been times when it has been unable to get a word in edgeways. The prime
instance in recent months came when it was invited to contribute from the
floor to a 45-minute televised 'debate' on executive pay.
The tone was set by the opening speakers from the platform. The first
denounced the monstrous greed of capitalism, making much play with the
published salaries of selected heads of big industrial companies. The second
responded that the cited sums were necessary to engender enterprise.
Those same basic credos, with the same focus on salaries of chiefs of well
known outfits, were then hurled back and forth until time ran out. On
balance, unashamed proponents of enterprise were far outweighed by equally
unashamed opponents of avarice, but they grabbed the floor from one another
so swiftly and peremptorily that the Jobs column, despite sticking its hand
up sporadically, never uttered a syllable.
It still seems a pity to me, at any rate  - not least because, to judge from
the typical media reaction to last week's publication of the British
Institute of Management's pay survey, the same dialogue of the deluded still
rages on. For what I'd hoped to point out on the televised occasion was that
the focus of the exchanges was unrealistic, and for two main reasons.
First, salaries alone provide an almost ludicrously short measure of
executive-pay levels because they take no account of perks. According to the
studies of the Noble Lowndes consultancy, which include valuations of
benefits such as pension entitlements and company cars as well as bonus
payments, salaries make up only about 70 per cent of the average British
manager's rewards.
Secondly, to suggest that a minority of prominent industrial chieftains are
representative of executives in general is not only to do severe injustice
to the great bulk of same, but also to overlook the place where Britain's
real fat cats largely lurk. That place is the City finance sector, and those
doubting it need only look at the table alongside drawn from Day Associates'
survey of pay in banks in London's famous square mile.
The latest check covers 105 of them, giving data on some 230 jobs high to
low. But anyone wanting full information will need to obtain the survey
report, price Pounds 200, from Joe Clark of Day at Suite 2.31, 75
Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel 071-375 1397, fax 071-375 1723. My
figures are limited to 17 posts of senior level, albeit not the highest.
In each case, the table starts with salaries  - the lower quartile referring
to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same
type of job, the median refers to the person mid-way in the ranking, and the
upper quartile to the one a quarter way down from the top. Next comes the
average salary, followed by the percentage of it typically received as a
bonus. The last two columns show the proportion of job-holders whose perks
include a company car, and its average price.
Of course, being confined to banking staff in the City, Day's check cannot
show how their rewards compare with those of executives elsewhere. But a
rough idea, although no more than that, is given by the following table
compiled from the British Institute of Management's figures. It gives
average salaries, the percentage of same received as bonus, and the
proportion with cars for chief executives, other directors, and five
descending ranks of managers:
Rank of         Salary   Bonus    Car
employee        Pounds     %       %

So in spite of the dangers that lie in drawing comparisons from different
studies, it seems to be abundantly clear that managers in Britain as a whole
are underpaid by the standards of their counterparts in City banks.
The sole compensation I can offer the majority is that Day's survey shows
the square mile's levels are now edging down. Even so, it looks likely to be
an eon or two before the reward-gap between the City of London and the rest
of Britain is closed.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Two face Pounds 30m cheque trick charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO businessmen were yesterday alleged to have used a solvent to remove the
details on two cheques and to have inserted the names of new payees and
inflated their value from Pounds 10 and Pounds 15 to Pounds 15m each.
Southwark Crown Court in London was told that Mr Jabinder Singh Bedesha and
Mr Gurvinder Chopra planned to present the drafts at the Saudi Arabian Bank
in Saudi Arabia.
Mr John Mcguinness, prosecuting, said the two thought they had recruited a
crooked manager at the bank, a Mr Nazeem, for a promised Pounds 6m cut. In
the event, Mr Nazeem turned out to be an undercover police officer.
Mr Bedesha, a director of a clothing wholesalers, from Ilford, Essex, denies
conspiring to use a false instrument. The court was told that Mr Chopra, a
property dealer, from Edgbaston, Birmingham, admitted the offence.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Thatcher unlikely to accept hereditary peerage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS

<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, is unlikely to accept a
hereditary peerage in the dissolution honours next month, sources at
Westminster said last night, Philip Stephens writes.
They suggested she had told Mr John Major she would prefer to avoid
controversy by accepting a life peerage, which would confer no title on her
children.
Peerages are also expected for cabinet ministers under Mrs Thatcher  -
possibly Mr Norman Tebbit, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mr Cecil Parkinson and Mr
Nicholas Ridley.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Major wants to end automatic honours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR wants to overhaul the honours system with the aim of ending
automatic rewards for civil servants and others who reach a particular rank
or length of service, it emerged yesterday.
The prime minister is sympathetic to the growing criticism of the civil and
military honours, which many mandarins, MPs and members of the armed forces
receive almost by right  - rather than for their contribution to society.
Downing Street officials emphasised, however, that 'nothing is going to
happen in the immediate future'.
Mr Major believes he made a start in changing the priorities for awards in
last June's Gulf war honours list, when he deliberately put emphasis on
rewarding meritorious service regardless of rank. Reforming the honours
system would fit Mr Major's pledge to push for a 'classless' society.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, reinstituted political
honours, including hereditary peerages, for long-serving politicians.
Changes to the system would, however, be supported by many Tory MPs.
Sir Peter Emery, chairman of the Commons procedure committee, said: 'The
honours system has a role to play in British society but it should be based
on merit and the individual contribution of a person  - rather than the
length of time they have served in a particular job.'
Mr Richard Shepherd, Conservative MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, said on BBC
Radio: 'The automatic assumption that you get knighthoods or gongs is, I
think, very out of date.'
Other senior backbench Conservative MPs would also back reform of the
honours system but, perhaps looking at their own prospects, refused
yesterday to comment publicly.

On Monday, Unionists and the SDLP were at loggerheads over the SDLP's

FT  06 MAY 92 / Doctor seeks political cure for Belfast's ills: The
difficult task facing Dr Joe Hendron in Gerry Adams' former constituency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political landscape has changed in West Belfast, where the predominant
Roman Catholic population lives in gritty red-brick houses, in a physical
landscape not helped by bomb damage and metal grilles on traffic lights and
pub windows.
Dr Joe Hendron, the freshly elected Social Democratic and Labour party MP,
is a moderate nationalist who cheerfully provokes republican hardliners
after narrowly winning the seat on April 9. 'They are extremely hostile to
me because they were beaten in the election,' he says.
Dr Hendron, who will work within the UK political system, has replaced Mr
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, who would
not. Because it supports violence, Mr Adams' party is excluded from
round-table talks on the province's future which began again yesterday.
Dr Hendron estimates that he was helped by about 1,500 Protestants in
Unionist enclaves who voted tactically. Sinn Fein said those voters
supported loyalist paramilitaries; Dr Hendron says that is 'an extreme
insult'.
Smouldering tensions in his constituency flared with the murder by loyalist
terrorists last week of a 26-year-old mother, Mrs Philomena Hanna, at a
chemist's shop on Springfield Road. Dr Hendron was jostled by Sinn Fein
supporters as he visited the site. 'Hendron's voters killed Philomena,' read
posters.
If Dr Hendron, aged 59 and a GP since the 'troubles' began, was supposed to
be a conciliator, his first action, prompted by Mrs Hanna's death, was
regressive. After urgent consultations with the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
the gates along the 'peace line'  - a spiked barrier that rises as high as
bedroom windows on houses along the Protestant and Roman Catholic divide  -
were closed.
In justification, the loquacious MP shows a card he was given at an
interdenominational service after the killing. 'This was handed out to all
the people. 'The walls of separation do not reach to Heaven.' That is what I
would say.
'So many politicians are screaming 'These gates must be kept open', but they
are not living on the peace line. People are very frightened.'
A greater test will be Dr Hendron's performance over coming years.
Non-participation in the Westminster system has been ingrained among radical
Irish nationalists for decades. Dr Hendron wants to work with Northern
Ireland Office ministers to encourage investment in West Belfast, drumming
up interest in the US, Canada and elsewhere. He also wants to talk with the
police and Army about ending harassment. Mr Adams did nothing, he says.
Mr Richard McAuley, Sinn Fein's spokesman, responds: 'We have a very
well-run constituency service which provides a useful service in West
Belfast. Unlike Joe Hendron, we did not engage in making promises we could
not keep.'
Dr Hendron is also part of the SDLP delegation at the round-table talks  -
hoping to deliver a deal by which local politicians can be given real
political control.
When he canvassed on Unionist housing estates, the 1985 Anglo-Irish
Agreement  - supported by the SDLP but despised by Unionists because of the
role it gives the Irish republic  - was top of the agenda. 'I said, 'But
isn't that what the talks are about?' I said that the Anglo-Irish Agreement
is not a sacred cow.'
Success in the talks would require huge compromises with the Unionist
community. West Belfast would need much convincing.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Mortgage lenders to follow lead: Immediate response to base
rate cut IoD welcomes 'stimulus' Retail confidence encouraged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX, the largest UK building society, cut its standard mortgage interest
rate by 0.3 percentage points to 10.65 per cent within an hour of the base
rate cut being announced.
Mr Jim Birrell, Halifax chief executive, described the latest base rate cut
as good news for home buyers.
The reduced rate applies immediately to new borrowers but the society
declined to say yesterday when the 0.3 point cut would be applied to
existing mortgage customers.
The reduction means a saving of Pounds 10.63 a month on a Pounds 50,000
endowment mortgage and Pounds 8.91 on a repayment mortgage of the same size.
Halifax's move took the rest of the mortgage industry by surprise. Mr John
Bayliss, managing director of Abbey National, the second-largest UK mortgage
lender, said later in the day that Abbey National would also reduce its
rates by 0.3 of a point.
Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, said it would lower its rates
later this week.
The other societies have little option but to follow Halifax and Abbey
National, but they will do so with serious misgivings about the effect on
their balance sheets.
Although most mortgage lenders agree that some sort of stimulus is needed to
encourage the housing market to revive, many building societies are under
strong market pressure on both the lending and the savings sides.
In January, following Abbey National's lead, Halifax and the other building
societies cut their rates to borrowers to about 10.95 per cent, less than
0.5 of a point above the base rate. Some societies have said privately that
they would like to put up mortgage rates to be able to pay savers more.
Halifax's move means that this will not now be possible.
The flow of retail savings into building societies accounts been
disappointing for several months, partly because of competition from
National Savings. By cutting their rates to mortgage customers now, building
societies will also have to reduce their rates to savers.
Mr Dick Spellman, general manager for marketing at Halifax, said yesterday
that it was too early to say how the savings market would settle down. He
said Halifax and other societies were experiencing a reduced inflow of
savings because they were having to compete against 'overpriced' one-year
and two-year offers from National Savings.
Mr John Simson, chairman of Connell, the estate agency chain owned by
Scottish Widows, said he was uncertain how much difference the latest
interest rate cut would make to the housing market.
He said there had been no sign of a recovery in April.
The clearing banks yesterday said that they had their mortgage rates under
review, but the centralised lenders are likely to have more difficulty in
making a reduction.
Mortgage lending was very subdued in the first quarter of the year, growing
by only 1.5 per cent over the previous, the Council for Mortgage Lenders
said yesterday. New lending during the quarter was Pounds 4.6bn, down from
Pounds 5.4bn during the final quarter of 1991.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Pay fall lends hope for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAY of young adults aged between 18 and 20 has fallen sharply as a
proportion of adult wages since 1979, according to data collected by the Low
Pay Unit, the research group.
The fall, from 61 per cent of adult wages to 53 per cent, has been greeted
by some economists and employers as an important step towards increasing the
number of training places for young people.
Ms Vivien Marshall, head of education and training at the Engineering
Employers Federation, said: 'This is an encouraging sign, which could lead
to more, and better-quality, training places.'
She said there was a widely accepted correlation between young people's pay
and the training opportunities employers offered. Youth pay in Germany used
to be almost half the UK rate, which was one reason for some German
employers overtraining, to the benefit of the economy as a whole, she added.
The Low Pay Unit, which backs moves to restore income support for people
aged 16 to 19, cut in 1988, also found that pay for those aged 16 and 17 had
fallen from 43 per cent of adult pay in 1979 to 33 per cent.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Wary traders see signs of modest recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL, PHILIP RAWSTORNE and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HESITANT twitchings of life in high streets across the country since the
general election have been encouraged by yesterday's cut in interest rates.
Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, which
represents nine tenths of the retail sector, sees modest recovery in most
sectors.
He says: 'It is hard to say what the figures are with certainty but there
does seem to have been a sustained pick-up in demand over the past two to
three weeks.'
Special factors cloud the picture: last April's increase in VAT to 17.5 per
cent from April 1, this year's late Easter, the uncertainty caused by the
election, and the recent fine weather.
Yet confidence is recovering, although no one expects a rapid switch in
mood.
Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing,
retail and leisure group, said: 'As yet, we have seen only spasmodic signs
of recovery and I do not think anyone should expect a sudden surge in
consumer confidence and spending  - but this is a positive and timely move.'
Mr Terry Maher, chief executive of Pentos, which runs Dillons bookshops and
Ryman stationery shops, predicts only an 'anaemic' recovery.
'People's confidence has been shattered and that does not change suddenly or
dramatically,' he says. 'In my view there is nothing more important than
that interest rates are now brought down as rapidly as possible. There will
be no sustained improvement in consumer demand unless and until that
happens.'
Other voices still urge restraint. Mr May, of the BRC, says: 'Many retailers
would like to see a bigger and quicker reductions in interest rates, but the
cautious approach is right in the long run. It is vitally important that
interest rate cuts are sustainable and sustained.'
That largely depends on what happens elsewhere in Europe. As Mr Derek
Bowden, media director at the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising agency, says:
'Until the German economy has fully resolved its problems, this does not
herald a significant move for the UK economy.'

FT  06 MAY 92 / Industry faults size of cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL reaction to the cut in interest rates yesterday was mixed. All
sectors welcomed the cut but there were complaints about its timing and
size. Many said the real impact would be in terms of confidence rather than
immediate cash.
The Institute of Directors was most bullish, saying that it was the 'best
possible stimulus' for British business to pull the economy out of
recession.
The Confederation of British Industry said the base rate cut was 'not before
time'. Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said the move reflected the
underlying strength of the economy as well as the progress on inflation.
'It will provide a useful boost to business confidence at an important
time,' he said. 'But real interest rates remain very high for manufacturers
especially. It is important the downward trend is maintained.'
In the construction sector, Mr Peter Parkin, chief executive of Raine, said:
'A slow thaw appears to have begun in the housing market. The latest cut in
base rates can only help this progress.'
Mr Colin Hope, chairman of motor components group T&amp;N and president of the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, emphasised the psychological
importance of the cut.
He said: 'It's a question of confidence, not cash. I detect a sense among
business people that we're moving in the right direction. People are more
optimistic. But perhaps most helpful is the extent to which we are winning
business in Germany, whose costs are going out of control. This latest cut
will help further.'
Mr Ian Coomber, Vauxhall's director of sales, said the reduction should
serve a useful role 'in transforming already reviving customer interest into
customer orders'. As a result of slowly reviving confidence, the company now
believes the UK market for new cars might reach about 1.7m units, up from
1.59m last year.
Many companies felt the impact would be negligible, however. Some have built
up exports to such an extent that a cut in domestic rates would have little
impact on demand. Others have long fixed-term loans and are unaffected in
the short term.
Many were more interested in the effect of the cut on the strength of
sterling. Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil,
the UK oil exploration and production company, welcomed an interest rate cut
that would stimulate demand for oil, but said a weakening in sterling
against the US dollar would have a more meaningful effect on his business.
Alps Electric, the Japanese electric and electronics group, said the rate
cut affected it inasmuch as it affected the strength of sterling, since the
group directly or indirectly exported about 80 per cent of products it
manufactured in the UK.
Courtaulds, the chemicals and materials group, said the effect of the cut
would be negligible. It was simply too little.
Mr Martin Smith, finance director at Witton, a small speciality chemicals
company, agreed that the cut was too little, too late. Although the company
was not heavily borrowed, he argued the real problem was the D-Mark, which
was keeping real interest rates far too high.
Electronics manufacturers expressed limited hope that the rate cut would
have a significant positive effect by encouraging business investment and
consumer spending.
Canon, the Japanese camera and office equipment maker, has suffered from a
tendency among business to postpone investment decisions during the
recession. It said: 'Obviously it's good in that hopefully it will stimulate
some kind of recovery.'
Many electronics manufacturers do not think the 0.5-percentage-point rate
cut is large enough to boost spending significantly at once. Panasonic said:
'It means (the UK economy) is moving in the right direction.' But the cut
was not big enough to have a significant effect because people still felt
the economy was depressed and would take more time to recover.
Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of Yorkshire Electricity, said the cut
would have little impact on the regional electricity companies, which are
typically long-term investors.

NATIONAL Savings is cutting the returns on most of its products. The
government department said the rates it offered had diverged from the rest
of the savings market.
The main changes are:
The 36th issue of certificates (which paid 8.5 per cent a year tax-free if
held for five years) has been withdrawn from sale and will be replaced by
the 37th issue on May 13. The new issue will pay 8 per cent. The return on
the yearly plan will also fall from 8.5 per cent to 8 per cent.
The series C capital bonds (which paid a taxable 11.5 per cent a year if
held for five years) have been withdrawn. They will be replaced by series D
bonds paying 10.75 per cent. The rate on income bonds will be reduced from a
taxable 10.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent from June 18.
The rate on the investment account will be reduced from 9.5 per cent to 8.5
per cent from May 18.

<TEXT>
THE SHOP WORKERS' union, Usdaw, has moved to counter government proposals
for legislation to expand Sunday trading, expected in today's Queen's
speech.
Delegates at the union's annual conference unanimously backed their
executive committee's call to move the focus of the anti-Sunday trading
campaign to influencing new legislation and away from simple condemnation of
shops trading illegally.
Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary, said the union would continue to
call for law enforcement, but delegates had to realise that large stores
would continue to trade illegally.
The union gave qualified support for the so-called 'rest' proposals, of the
Keep Sunday Special, the anti-Sunday-trading lobby. It will also press
Euro-Fiet, the body that represents the interests of shop workers at
European community level, to join Usdaw in sponsoring a conference on
trading hours legislation.
Earlier, the union reaffirmed its support for wages councils, the bodies
that set minimum statutory pay levels for about 2.5m workers, of which more
than 1m are shop workers.

FT  06 MAY 92 / PowerGen workers balloted on wages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS at PowerGen, one of the privatised electricity companies, are
balloting their members on the first local pay package in the electricity
industry.
The 6,500 employees are expected to accept the package, which has been
negotiated over the past year with the five unions representing the majority
of employees.
The last national pay settlement in the electricity supply industry was
negotiated this year, with a 5.5 per cent settlement for 1992-93. Employers
then gave 12 months' notice of their intention to negotiate locally next
year.
PowerGen is believed to be the first of the 19 main employers to have drawn
up an offer.
According to Personnel Today, the specialist magazine, a single document has
been drawn up to replace the three existing agreements for industrial,
engineering and administrative workers.
PowerGen said yesterday the deal proposed harmonisation of terms and
conditions for all employees, with a single pay structure for all staff.
Holiday entitlement, for example, would be harmonised so that entitlement
would be related to the grade an individual was on within a job category. In
addition flexible working and single-table bargaining with the unions were
proposed.
The electricity companies are likely to pursue widely differing strategies
because of their local situations.

<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of large companies with a written ethical code is rising
sharply and stands at nearly 30 per cent, according to a survey published
yesterday.
Policies on relations with employees and customers and on sexual harassment
dominate ethical codes, says the study by the Institute of Business Ethics,
a think tank.
There has also been a sharp growth in statements on environmental policy in
the past two years, said Mr Simon Webley, author of the report.
Twenty-nine per cent of the replies from 164 leading companies said that
they had a statement of business ethics in 1991. That compared with 18 per
cent when the survey was last conducted in 1987.
A fifth of companies with codes were UK subsidiaries of foreign-owned
corporations, most of which were American. Those had more detailed and
lengthy codes than British parent companies, and discussed staff involvement
in the community more frequently.
Most companies with written codes commented on their obligations to
employees, including equal opportunities, remuneration and development, and
listening to staff. By contrast, very few mentioned duties to shareholders.
Some discussed obligations to customers, such as the provision of
high-quality products. A smaller number mentioned their responsibilities to
suppliers, such as prompt payment or policies on giving and receiving gifts.
In 37 per cent of cases, the chief executive or chairman was the person who
felt responsible for the company's ethics.
Lord Laing, institute president and former chairman of United Biscuits,
urged all companies to produce a code and said that shareholders should call
for the introduction of codes at companies' annual meeting.
Eleven per cent of companies gave reasons why they did not have written
codes, including a belief that it was unnecessary because they always acted
ethically, or that policies should be determined by individual subsidiaries.
Business ethics and company codes. Institute of Business Ethics, 12 Palace
Street, London SW1E 5JA. Pounds 15.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Outhwaite action is stepped up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NAMES ON Lloyd's troubled Outhwaite syndicate who missed out from February's
Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement yesterday agreed to step up their own
legal action to recover losses.
Writs alleging negligence by the Outhwaite Underwriting Agency and 81 other
members' agencies, were issued last week on behalf of 393 Names - the
individuals who provide backing for the insurance market.
Mr Eddie Kulukundis, yesterday elected chairman of the 1992 Outhwaite Names'
Association, said the group would now aim to enlist as many as possible of
the 627 non-litigants to the February action before serving the writs.

BANK OF Scotland said last night that it could not explain how 20 envelopes
containing cheques for payment for the second instalment of ScottishPower
shares had come to be dumped in a rubbish skip in Edinburgh last week.
According to the Edinburgh Evening News, a refuse worker opened some of the
envelopes and saw cheques, including one for Pounds 26,000. Bank of Scotland
is handling the payment of the second instalment of 70p on shares in
ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric, which was due by April 29.
Bank of Scotland said shareholders who did not receive certificates by May
15 should contact the bank.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Channel 5 writ against TV-am
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE TV, one of the companies planning to bid for the Channel 5 licence,
yesterday issued a writ against TV-am, the breakfast television company, for
alleged breach of contract.
Last week TV-am signed an agreement to bid for the franchise in a consortium
that included Time Warner, the world's largest media organisation, and Mr
Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group. Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am chairman, was
to be chairman of the consortium, to be called The Entertainment Channel.
Yesterday Five TV, whose investors include Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City
TV in Toronto, said TV-am had signed a document in January agreeing not to
invest in any other applicant for the Channel 5 licence other than Five TV.
TV-am  - which lost its ITV franchise in last year's competitive tenders  -
last night conceded that it had signed what appeared to be such an
undertaking, but by mistake.
The company said Mr Stratis Zographos, the TV-am finance director, had
signed what he thought was a normal confidentiality agreement in order to be
able to see the proposed Five TV business plan. It had then discovered a
line about not investing in a rival Channel 5 bid. It said it would defend
any legal action.
Mr Gyngell said: 'We signed what we thought was a normal confidentiality
agreement. We regard that line (about a rival bid) as a restraint of trade
and that is also senior counsel's opinion.'
TV-am is surprised at the timing of the legal action because both Mr Jeremy
Fox, the chief executive of The Entertainment Channel, and Mr David Frost,
the broadcaster and TV-am founder, have been in Toronto for talks with Mr
Znaimer about a possible merger between the two bidders.
The main choice for the Channel 5 licence may turn out to be between Five
TV, which plans a mainly city-based service, and something like The
Entertainment Channel, offering a largely national service.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Wandsworth set to axe comprehensives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN MCGOOKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY-controlled Wandsworth council in south-west London last night voted to
abandon comprehensive education and make its secondary schools selective.
The council endorsed a decision by its education committee which will allow
three of the borough's schools to organise their own admissions, with
11-plus-style entry tests, possibly by September 1993.
Under the controversial plan, drawn up by director of education Mr Donald
Naismith, Wandsworth hopes its schools will become 'centres of excellence'
specialising in subjects such as languages or design.
Mr Naismith denied, however, that the change represented a return to
secondary-modern and grammar schools. The proposals will allow schools to
select pupils on the grounds of aptitude and compatibility with the school.
Parents whose children are unsuccessful in obtaining a place at their chosen
school would be able to appeal to the council, which will keep a register of
unfilled places. But the Department of Education and Science has advised
against the council being able to nominate pupils for 10 per cent of the
places at each school.
Mr Edward Lister, chairman of the council education committee, said
Wandsworth was 'turning its back on 30 years of centralised planning because
it doesn't work'.
The National Union of Teachers said the plan failed to recognise that
comprehensive schools brought wider opportunities for all children  - not
just expanded opportunities for the selected few.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Prince Charming finds his Cinderella: Michael Heseltine
outlines his strategy for the trade and industry department
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Michael Heseltine was offered the job of trade and industry
secretary three weeks ago he chose to revive the title of president of the
board of trade.
It is a potent symbol of the political clout he has brought to a job that
had become one of the Cinderellas of successive Conservative
administrations. Already his staff refer to him simply as 'the president'.
But Mr Heseltine is also a political realist. If he is to deliver a
partnership between government and industry  - mapped out during his
political exile under Mrs Margaret Thatcher  - there will be battles to be
fought, not least with the Treasury.
So yesterday it took 30 minutes to prise from him a phrase to encapsulate
his new role in Mr John Major's government: 'My job is to help British
industry to win . . . commerce and industry to win.'
Speaking to the FT in his first interview since his appointment, Mr
Heseltine was concerned to damp speculation that he had arrived with a
bagful of instant solutions. 'I know that industrial success, commercial
success is essentially a long-term phenomenon,' he said. 'The great danger
is to try to adopt the psychology of the fairy godmother.'
He intends to build a closer relationship between government and industry  -
to establish over time what he calls an industrial strategy. Yet he is not
in the business of raising expectations that he cannot meet.
His starting point is that his advocacy of such a strategy is still
misunderstood. For others it conjures up images of 'picking winners' or
subsidies for sunset industries. He said: 'What I have always meant by an
industrial strategy is an awareness in government of the impact that
government can have on industry as a consequence of the many interfaces
between the role of government and the wealth-creating process.'
That rather long-winded explanation can be condensed as follows: since
government decisions are constantly impinging on the nation's businesses, it
is up to the DTI to introduce some coherence into the process.
Mr Heseltine promises to be a sympathetic listener. His predecessors  - Mr
Peter Lilley and Mr Nicholas Ridley  - never managed to persuade industrial
leaders that they particularly cared about anything beyond deregulation.
Their successor likes dialogue. 'I've always believed in all government
departments, including this one, that you should talk and listen carefully
to the industries, to the companies, which you sponsor.'
It was such dialogue, he added, that led to the creation of the European
Space Agency and brought lucrative contracts for British industry from the
European Fighter Aircraft project. 'Some people believe that talking to
people is a sign of weakness,' he said. 'I've never believed that.'
What about action? In his books, Mr Heseltine had after all set out in some
detail how the DTI should co-ordinate government industrial strategy. It
should replace the Treasury in the lead role at a strengthened National
Economic Development Office. A cabinet committee should be established to
take a broad view of departmental decisions which affect business.
Mergers policy should be less tightly drawn to include a wider judgment of
the national interest as well as the impact on competition of proposed
mergers and takeovers.
Here Mr Heseltine became distinctly cagey. He did not disavow completely
such ambitions but was careful to stress that they were not prerequisites.
A new cabinet committee under his direction was a matter 'for the prime
minister'. It was perfectly possible to take a strategic view of
government's relations with industry within existing cabinet committees.
On mergers policy  - perhaps the most sensitive of his responsibilities  -
he will say practically nothing. His approach to the battle for Midland Bank
between Lloyds Bank and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation should
reveal some of his thinking. For now, though, he insists that any change in
the so-called Tebbit doctrine would require a collective decision by the
cabinet. 'I have inherited a set of (merger) policies, Until and unless any
announcements are made those policies prevail.'
So what were his immediate priorities?
Some set themselves. Britain's forthcoming presidency of the European
Community will put Mr Heseltine in the driving seat of efforts to complete
the single market. His concern was that the regulations that gave force to
that market did not end up representing a 'cloying intervention in the
marketplace'.
The legal framework had to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to a
fast-moving competitive environment. Completion of the stalled Uruguay round
of trade talks was also essential if British industry was to take full
advantage of the opportunities on the international horizon.
Closer to home, Mr Heseltine was unsure whether industry appreciated the
scale of the opportunities that were already there to be taken. His
suspicion was that the government's advice had too often been getting
through to only a 'relatively thin strata'. He would be looking closely at
improvements in the 'delivery' of advice from Whitehall.
He then came up with a phrase that is likely to figure prominently in his
public pronouncements - 'incremental excellence'. Instead of looking for
instant solutions, the government needed to look constantly and
comprehensively at all its policies to ensure that they helped to foster
wealth creation.
On one level, that meant sticking with macro-economic policies that provided
stability and fostered enterprise. On another, it meant ensuring that
policies such as those for education and training provided industry with the
quality of recruits they needed. He would also be constantly on the alert to
ensure that government decisions did not inadvertently impede industrial
success.
It was, he concluded, 'the aggregation of all these policies that adds up to
an industrial strategy'.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Parties rely on traditional voters in local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE main political parties sought to portray themselves as efficient
providers of services yesterday as the local-election campaign entered its
final stretch.
At the end of a low-key election campaign, marked by the parties'
determination to get their supporters to vote, rather than to make mass
converts, each re-emphasised its traditional areas of appeal.
Mr John Redwood, the local-government minister, illustrated the Tories'
central message, that Conservative councils cost less, with figures showing
that most of the Labour and Liberal Democrat-controlled councils up for
election were spending above standard spending assessments (SSAs)  -
government estimates of what councils need to spend to provide services  -
while most of the Tory ones were budgeting below SSAs.
Labour countered by highlighting the provision in areas such as personal
social services by Labour-controlled authorities, and warning that some Tory
councils chose not to provide a service in, for example, nursery education.
Both opposition parties insist that the political complexion of councils
still matters because they can act as 'buffers' against the decisions of
central government.
In a signal that ministers intend to maintain their tight controls on
local-government spending, Mr Redwood also emphasised the importance of
local authorities' discretion in deciding how to allocate the funds within
the total spent.
The parties also clashed over the defection to the Conservatives of Mr Alan
Winmill, leader of the Labour group on Wiltshire County Council. Mr Chris
Patten, Tory party chairman, welcomed Mr Winmill's decision, but Mr John
Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, dismissed him as 'a somewhat
obscure Labour councillor', and said his decision was of little consequence.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, spoke of 'restrained optimism' as
the party repeated its claims of low morale among Labour workers. The
Liberal Democrats predict, however, that they will make more gains from the
Tories, as they hold more of the seats being contested this time.
Mr Cunningham referred to potential demoralisation among Liberal Democrats,
saying that the party 'spent the (general election) campaign boasting about
how well it was going to do, and actually lost ground significantly'.
Mr Jim Wallace, MP for Orkney and Shetland, is to become leader of the
Scottish Liberal Democrats, it was announced yesterday. Mr Wallace takes
over from Mr Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon.

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: North America free trade deal could be
initialled next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGREEMENT on a North American free trade area (Nafta) could be initialled as
early as next month as a result of significant headway made by negotiators
last week in Mexico City.
'It is within the art of the possible to have an agreement this summer,' Mrs
Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said in Washington yesterday. 'But
I'm not betting my next paycheck on it.'
It is understood that several chapters of the negotiating text were 'locked
up' last week. These include customs regulations, standards, principles for
services, intellectual property, textiles food safety regulations, and land
transport.
Close to agreement were tariffs, rules of origin, safeguards, and financial
services and insurance and telecommunications. There appears to have been a
breakthrough on Canadian reservations concerning local-content rules for car
production.
The main problem areas remain farm trade, especially Canada's supply
management and subsidy regimes, government procurement and energy. On the
question of Mexico's reluctance to open its energy sector to foreign
investment, advisers to the negotiators say Mexico has signalled a
willingness to compromise by opening its petrochemical sector, pipelines and
petrol stations to foreign investment.
Last week's surge in progress came after a disappointing ministerial meeting
in Montreal in early April, when some participants said talks had moved
backwards. A visit to Washington by Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's commerce
secretary, after Easter apparently revived the momentum.
'It was a very productive week,' said Mr Jules Katz, deputy trade
representative. He predicted a ministerial meeting would be scheduled later
this month 'depending on progress made'.

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Israel extends its arm to tie up central
Asian links - Following success elsewhere, the Jewish state finds open doors
in unlikely places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY and Iran attract most of the headlines in the battle for influence in
the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. But Israel has
wasted little time in establishing links it hopes will blossom into
lucrative trade.
The Jewish state is anxious that the Moslem republics should not line up
against it with fellow-Moslem Arab states and Iran, the most strongly
anti-Israel state in the region. It has moved quickly to establish official
relations with five of the six republics  - Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Kirghizia  - but not Turkmenistan, and may soon
have representative offices in the first two.
To underpin the diplomatic relationship  - and establish a foothold in what
is seen as a big potential export market  - there are efforts to build trade
links. It is a pattern Israel has followed in the past in regions such as
South America and Africa and recently in China.
As many as 18 Israeli companies are said to have visited Kazakhstan, with at
least three 'doing serious business'. Israel was one of the first countries
to be put on a direct-dial telephone link by Kazakhstan.
Several Kazakh government delegations have been to Israel in recent weeks,
including one led by the agriculture minister which held talks with Mr
Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, and was given lavish treatment. The
Kazakh prime minister is expected this month.
Similar links have been established with Tadjikistan, Azerbaijan and
Uzbekistan. In a typical Israeli scheme, cotton yields at a farm in
Uzbekistan were reported to have increased by 40 per cent on one-third of
previous water consumption in one season through improved irrigation
techniques.
Mr David Kimche, a former director general of the foreign ministry who
specialises in fostering delicate relationships such as that with China, has
been building contacts in the central Asian republics in recent months. He
says he has found 'no hesitation' among them in forging links with Israel.
In South America, Africa and China, much of what Israel has offered has been
military supplies. In public at least, the emphasis in central Asia has been
on the republics' outmoded agriculture and communications systems  - both
areas Israel reckons it is ideally placed to upgrade.
'They believe we have a lot to offer in agricultural technology and food
production,' said Mr Kimche. He said there was interest also in studying the
experience of Israel's collective  - but independent  - Moshavim farms.
Although these farms have been in difficulties, the Asian republics are said
to be thinking of using the Moshav model in scaling down their huge
collective farms left over from the Soviet era.
The risk for Israel is that the current secular-oriented regimes it is now
getting close to will be replaced later, perhaps by more militantly Islamic
governments. But that has not deterred the drive into the republics.
One Israeli company which has signed agreements for four projects in
Kazakhstan is Merhav, part of an Israeli-owned international private group
Metropolitan Investments Corporation. With widespread experience in debt
settlement, project development and trading in regions such as South America
and Africa, it has taken the plunge in central Asia enthusiastically.
The four turnkey projects to refurbish outdated agricultural systems signed
in January  - one in cotton and one in tomato production are already
underway  - have a total value of Dollars 35m. But, as Mr Yosef Maiman, the
company chief, admits, the deal is a calculated risk. It was concluded with
the Kazakh government in three days in mid-February, barely a month after
first contacts were made.
'You have to take decisions on the spot. A lot goes on intuition and you
have to be fast to implement. We started ordering millions of dollars worth
of equipment before the deal was finalised,' said Mr Maiman.
Merhav has had to spend a lot up front to get the projects moving. It has
established a 25-person office in Alma Ata in Kazakhstan. Getting equipment
shipments to the distant, land-locked republic has been a logistical
nightmare. The company uses its own private jet and charter flights to speed
things up. In early April, a 14-truck convoy was sent back to Turkey from
Iran causing a 20-day delivery delay.
Only a 'small part' of the price is paid in hard cash. For the rest, Merhav
gets to pick from a Kazakh list of commodities which, like a menu in a
flagging restaurant, has fewer items available than it first appears. Cotton
and tomato paste will make up some of the payment, says Mr Maiman.
But he insists Merhav will make money on these initial projects and foresees
future business for Merhav in Kazakhstan of up to Dollars 100m a year.
'Yes, there is a particular value for Israel to be in a predominantly Moslem
republic which has natural resources Israel may need over time,' Mr Maiman
says. 'But we are a business operation aiming to penetrate a market and to
be profitable doing it. We wouldn't have got into it otherwise.'

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK-led group likely to win HK bridge deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government is expected to announce tomorrow that a British-led
consortium has won an HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 583m) contract to build one of
the world's biggest suspension bridges. An Anglo-Japanese consortium, led by
Trafalgar House, is believed to be the successful bidder to build a 1,377m
bridge to connect Tsing Yi and Ma Wan Islands as part of the HKDollars 114bn
(in March 1991 prices) airport and related infrastructure programme.
The contract will be the biggest single one awarded so far for the colonial
government's infrastructure development of Hong Kong. As well as the
Anglo-Japanese consortium, three others were in the bidding: an all-Japanese
group and one led by the French construction company Dragages et Travaux
Publics; the third, a South Korean grouping led by Hyundai, was some
HKDollars 2bn cheaper than the Trafalgar House bid.
The HK government is expecting to be criticised by local politicians and
probably China, which had an interest in the Hyundai consortium, if it
awards the contract to Trafalgar House. Hyundai's troubles in South Korea,
where some senior executives have been accused over taxes, and the
highly-geared nature of Hyundai Construction and Engineering, the main
bidder, are understood to have concerned the HK government. It raised doubts
about the company's ability to enter into a long-term commitment to build
the bridge. The government's critics say it should never have pre-qualified
Hyundai.
UK consulting firms have done well in bidding for consultancy contracts for
the airport programme. They have done less well in previous building
contracts, but the award of the bridge to a predominantly British consortium
will be seen as favouritism in some quarters. The Anglo-Japanese group would
be asked to build one of the world's longest suspension bridges in the
shortest possible time. It will have to be completed by mid-1997, at the
latest, when the airport is expected to be opened.

OLIVETTI, the Italian computer and office equipment group, is to supply
point-of-sales computer technology to the McDonald's fast food group in the
US in an agreement worth over Dollars 300m (Pounds 169.4m).
The order, won against competition from IBM, Panasonic and NCR, is
Olivetti's biggest contract from the the US and one of the largest deals in
its history.
Under the plan, eight or nine Olivetti personal computers will be installed
in each of McDonald's 8,800 US outlets, which will be linked via local area
networks. The deal envisages the installation of over 50,000 computer
workstations, along with a variety of peripheral equipment.
The system will allow full automation both for customers, who will be served
by staff using new touch-screen terminals, and for back-office uses.
Computers in each McDonald's outlet will handle accounting, administration

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Southern EC states fight move to end tied
aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTHERN EC states have opposed a European Commission proposal, backed by
the Dutch, for the EC to remove curbs tying much of their national
development aid to purchase of goods and service within their own countries.
The first serious debate for years by EC aid ministers on the issue of
'untying' development aid ended on Monday night, with France, Spain and
Italy opposing any weakening of 'national procurement' restrictions still
attached to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) aid that EC states give the Third
World each year. The southern three argued that, while untying aid might
give developing countries better value for money if they could shop around
the EC for the best deal, it would cut overall aid because taxpayers in one
EC state would not want to see aid-related contracts going to the industry
of another EC state.
The Commission proposal won full backing only from Mr Jan Pronck, Dutch aid
minister, who had commissioned it when the Dutch held the EC Council
presidency last autumn. Lady Chalker, UK aid minister, with some German and
Danish support, suggested a gradual untying of aid. Ministers asked the
Commission to make a further study, but the EC executive seems unlikely to
produce a formal draft directive to abolish tied aid, as Mr Pronck has
urged. This week's debate showed France, Italy and Spain form a blocking
minority in the EC Council.
EC aid, via the Community and national budgets, amounted to Dollars 26.7bn
in 1988, (not including small amounts from Greece, Luxembourg, Spain and
Portugal which do not belong to the OECD's Development Aid Committee). Some
60 per cent is untied, including money channelled through Brussels to some
70 developing country members of the EC's Lome Convention. The remaining aid
from EC states is totally tied (requiring all contracts be placed with
companies, or contain a minimum national content, from the donor country),
or partially tied.

Delays in the UN's troop deployment in Cambodia could have a negative effect
on its peace-keeping operation unless they were soon remedied, Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, secretary-general, warned last night, writes Michael
Littlejohns.
In a report to the Security Council, he mentioned the slow pace of
recruiting and deploying civilian administrators, which could impair the

FT  06 MAY 92 / ADB considers its first loan to Cambodia for 21 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Asian Development Bank is discussing its first loan to Cambodia for 21
years, marking the country's return to the international financial community
after the ravages of the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s and the subsequent
13-year civil war.
Officials said the bank is considering a special rehabilitation loan of
Dollars 50m to Dollars 70m (Pounds 28m to Pounds 39m) for emergency support
for transport, irrigation, fertiliser and health care.
The financing will go before the ADB board within two months if legal and
bureaucratic obstacles can be overcome. Cambodia must still repay a small
amount of arrears, and the legal entity receiving the loan must be
determined, as the country still has an interim government structure.
New loans would also depend on continuation of the UN-sponsored peace
process. Yesterday, Khmer Rouge guerrillas launched attacks on
government-held positions in the worst violations yet of the ceasefire begun
last autumn.
The scale of the rebuilding task awaiting Cambodia's new government is
revealed in a report by the ADB released at its annual meeting in Hong Kong.
Production of most goods, such as rice, rubber and fish, though they
recovered in the 1980s under the Vietnamese-installed government, is below
1969 levels.
By 1979, after the genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge in which 1m people
died, life expectancy was down to 31. By 1989, it was still only up to 48.
Annual per capita income is guessed to be between Dollars 150 and Dollars
200, though even this low figure masks wide disparities between relative
prosperity in Phnom Penh, the capital, and poverty elsewhere.
What the ADB does not mention is the need for successful UN-monitored
elections of a new government, rehabilitation of over 300,000 refugees, and
clearing of land-mines.
Mr Ou Orhat, vice-minister of planning and head of the Cambodian delegation
to the ADB meeting, said yesterday: 'After twenty years of destructive war,
the reconstruction needs are enormous.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 5,000 Thais rallied in Bangkok yesterday in support of a popular
politician who has pledged to starve himself to death unless Prime Minister
Suchinda Kraprayoon resigns.
His hunger strike increased tensions in the city on the eve of a
parliamentary session in which Gen Suchinda is due to set out his
government's policies.
Pressure on the government of Gen Suchinda, the former army commander and
leader of last year's coup d'etat, has increased steadily since his
appointment was announced on April 7.
It escalated on Monday when 50,000 Thais protested against the appointment
of an unelected prime minister and Major General Chamlong Srimuang, former
governor of Bangkok, started his hunger strike .
Business leaders expect stocks to fall sharply when the market reopens this
morning, accelerating a steady decline in the stock exchange's share price
index. The index has lost 71.41 points or 8.6 per cent since Gen Suchinda's
appointment.
Businessmen say Gen Suchinda should never have appointed to his cabinet
allegedly corrupt MPs who were in the government which the military
overthrew last year.
Gen Chamlong's threat to die if the premier does not stand down is being
taken seriously. He has gained popularity because of his near-ascetic way of
life and his reputed hon-esty.
The party he leads won 32 out of 35 seats in Bangkok in the general
elections which took place on March 22.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Russia, India face US action over missile deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA and India faced the possibility of sanctions by the US after they
decided yesterday to go ahead with a Dollars 250m (Pounds 141m) contract for
the sale of Russian rocket technology for India's space programme.
The Russian decision was announced yesterday by Mr Gennady Burbulis, Russian
secretary of state, after three days of bilateral talks.
Mr Burbulis ridiculed US attempts to assume the role of global lawmaker on
missile technology and said Russia would go ahead with its contract with
India. The Bush administration warned both countries they risk US sanctions
if the deal goes through.
Ms Margaret Tutwiler, state department spokeswoman, said the US would decide
soon on its response to the rocket deal, which she said was inconsistent
with guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime, an accord among
western states to limit the spread of missile technology. Russia did not
sign the pact, but has agreed to abide by its provisions.
Penalties could involve suspension of access to US government contracts and
to US technology requiring export licences.
A Russian foreign ministry spokesman yesterday called for international
experts to examine the deal to show that it should not incur sanctions.
'We insist on an international expert examination of the contract to prove
that it doesn't undermine the Missile Technology Control Regime in any way,'
Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters.
Under the deal, the Russian space agency is to sell India technology needed
to build rocket booster engines for launching communications satellites. The
US apparently feels the Indian space programme has military objectives but
Russia has rejected this view.
Russia has been collaborating with India on its space programme for a long
time. With the help of the then Soviet Union, India has launched several
satellites. Russia has now openly resisted US pressure to revise the accord.
Mr Burbulis's visit was the first by a Russian leader since the political
changes in that country. It has laid the basis for a visit to India by Mr
Boris Yeltsin later this year.
India has very close ties with the former Soviet Union and faced the
possibility of losing an important ally because Indian officials misjudged
events that led to the break-up of the Union. They have been busy ever since
trying to restore Indo-Russian relations to their former level.
Mr Burbulis's remarks at the end of his visit are reassuring to India's
ears. As well as defying the US over rocket technology, Mr Burbulis said
Russia would continue to supply defence equipment spares.
Mr Burbulis said Russia has confirmed its intention to continue defence
co-operation that the former Soviet Union had with India. He also said that
disruption of Russian crude oil supplies would end soon.
During his visit, Mr Burbulis signed a five-year trade agreement with India
which envisages payments in hard currency instead of rupees. He also offered
India a Rbs2.5bn (Pounds 14.3m) credit for supply of defence equipment and
paper.

FT  06 MAY 92 / US stance rattles Asian Development Bank consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Asian Development Bank, with its president and many senior officials
coming from Japan, is traditionally run by consensus and without open
confrontation.
These qualities were difficult to find yesterday, however, with officials of
shareholding countries, speaking at the bank's annual meeting in Hong Kong,
advancing deeply contrasting views of the bank's future role as a regional
development institution.
Mr Olin L. Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs in the
US Treasury, said bluntly that the US, as equal largest shareholder with
Japan, would not countenance a replenishment of the ADB's capital resources
until it had radically altered its lending policies.
The opposing view was provided by Mr J B Sumarlin, finance minister of
Indonesia, by far the largest borrower from the ADB. He urged rapid approval
of the bank's request for a capital increase, arguing that its loans
'represent the most cost-effective way of delivering development financing'.
The ADB will not in fact need new money  - it is seeking a 110 per cent
capital increase representing new commitments of Dollars 25bn  - (Pounds
14bn) until 1994 and the approval process is likely to take at least a year.
However, the opening arguments appeared to signal a fundamental debate about
the role of development institutions in fostering growth, and about the role
of the state, which remains significant in most Asian economies despite
their dynamic growth and healthy private sectors.
The ADB has begun to direct financing at the private sector and has carried
out numerous studies on the issue. But the bulk of its lending continues to
finance public sector works.
The US has lost patience. 'Any new capital increase should await the
formulation of a clear and effective strategy for encouraging private sector
development,' Mr Wethington said.
The US also wants:
loans to be conditional on adherence to policy reforms, for example to
support reforms which opened up financial markets;
an end to co-financing deals with commercial banks which could threaten the
ADB's credit standing;
and a re-assessment of which countries should get loans.
The arguments stem partly from Asia's remarkable growth, which has pushed
the four 'dragons'  - Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea  - beyond
the point where they can borrow from the ADB. Thailand and Malaysia are
approaching that stage. This leaves a concentration of loans outstanding to
a few countries: Indonesia (34 per cent), India (17), Philippines (14),
Pakistan (14), Malaysia (6), China (5) and Thailand (4).
A 46 per cent rise in new loans last year was largely because of increased
borrowing by India and China. The US says, however, China's large current
account surplus should enable it to borrow more from commercial sources and
less from the ADB.
The US attitude to the ADB is viewed as dogmatic and blinkered by many
regional countries which see Washington as increasingly out of step with
Asia and isolated on issues such as financing for Vietnam, which it blocks.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA yesterday claimed to have won US support for proposals to
strengthen the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) process by
establishing regular meetings of regional heads of government, writes Kevin
Brown in Sydney.
Australian officials said US president George Bush endorsed the plans in a
letter to Mr Paul Keating, prime minister and also supported the
establishment of a permanent Apec secretariat.
Mr Keating proposed upgrading Apec on a visit to Indonesia last month. The
plan was received cautiously by President Suharto, and is thought to be
regarded with suspicion by other south-east Asian nations.
Malaysia, in particular, has opposed Australian attempts to strengthen Apec
because of concerns that it might undermine the Association of South-East
Asian Nations (Asean).
Asean, grouping Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the
Philippines, is planning a south-east Asian free trade zone in response to
the emergence of trading blocs in Europe and North America.
Apec, launched two years ago by Mr Bob Hawke, former Australian prime
minister, was envisaged as a forum for informal discussion of regional trade
and development. However, the process has become an symbol of Australia's
increasing trade and foreign policy focus on the Asia/Pacific region since
Mr Keating replaced Mr Hawke last year.
Mr Keating has increased pressure on the US to keep a security presence in
the region. In recent talks with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, Mr
Keating supported continuation of US facilities in Australia, and offered
use of a bombing range when the US leaves the Philippines this year.

<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton yesterday took another step towards the Democratic
party's presidential nomination, winning more delegates in primary voting
and gaining the support of the US trade union movement, writes George
Graham.
Early returns and exit polls showed Mr Clinton soundly defeating former
Californian Governor Jerry Brown in Democratic primaries in Indiana and
North Carolina. He was also expected to win by substantial margins in the
District of Columbia, where polls closed later.
In Republican party primaries President George Bush was projected to have
won in Indiana and to have scored a three-to-one victory over Mr Patrick
Buchanan in North Carolina.
With Mr Bush now mathematically assured of his party's nomination, and Mr
Clinton more than 80 per cent of the way towards becoming the Democratic
candidate, yesterday's primaries were fought with little fire.
The endorsement of the AFL-CIO, the US trade union confederation, came as
little surprise as the labour movement has endorsed every recent Democratic
candidate except Mr George McGovern.
But Mr Clinton has had his differences with the trade unions, notably over
his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement which labour leaders
believe will lead to US jobs being transferred to Mexico.

<TEXT>
TWO LEADING figures in the Italian construction industry were yesterday
added to the lengthening list of those charged in connection with the
two-month-old Milan corruption scandal.
Magistrates ordered the arrest on corruption charges of Mr Mario Lodigiani,
vice-president of the construction company of the same name, one of the
country's best known, and Mr Roberto Schellino, formerly technical manager
of Cogefar Impresit and chief executive of Iacorossi, a Milan general
contractor.
Six prominent people involved with the Milan construction business have
already been charged on various counts of corruption. The latest arrests
confirm that Milan magistrates are beginning to allege a direct link between
the large number of public works contracts awarded in the city over the past
decade and an elaborate system of pay-offs also involving the funnelling of
funds to political parties.
Italy's overall balance of payments deteriorated sharply in the first
quarter, according to official figures.
The L737bn (Pounds 333m) deficit compares with a L7,778bn surplus during the
same period last year. The deficit has been blamed on a big rise in capital
outflows and a decline in the level of inflows, especially in March, the
month before the general election.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday made an impassioned appeal for
more US help for the crumbling economies of eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
'If the new democracies are left to cope alone with their difficulties, then
there could be a new flood of refugees to the west and other uncontrollable
political developments,' he warned in a speech prepared for the annual
congress of the American Newspaper Publishers' Association in New York.
'The west has no choice. There is no rational alternative to comprehensive
and continuous support,' Mr Kohl added. Germany, meanwhile, was already
committed to DM105bn (Pounds 35.7bn) in aid and had reached the limits of
its ability to help.
The issue would be 'right at the top' of his agenda at the Group of Seven
world economic summit planned for Munich in July.
The chancellor, who will chair the summit, had been concerned that his plan
to focus the meeting on what he considers Germany's greatest foreign policy
issues would be marred by top-level wrangling over the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Now, he indicated, there was reason to hope the negotiations would be over
by the end of June.
The current situation in eastern Europe was comparable with the 'great
upheavals' which followed the First and Second World Wars, he said, pointing
to the 'dangerous expansionist tendencies' in countries like the former
Yugoslavia.
By 1945 the US government had learnt from the mistakes of President Woodrow
Wilson, who withdrew from Europe after the First World War.
America's success story in post-war Germany should now be a model for its
policies towards former Cold War enemies in the east, the chancellor said.
'We Germans are experiencing in our country just how difficult the task is.
In spite of enormous transfers to the former GDR the process of growing
together is not progressing either as quickly or as free of friction as we
would wish,' Mr Kohl said.
George Graham adds: Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is seeking to
enter the US presidential elections as an independent candidate, complained
yesterday of a dirty tricks campaign by the Republican party to discredit
him, and said he would stop most of his public appearances over the next few
weeks so he could work out where he stood on policy issues.
Mr Perot, who is best known for his Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) fortune, was
speaking at the American Newspaper Publishers' Association congress in New
York.

THE FRENCH government yesterday postponed debate in the national assembly on
constitutional amendments required for ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, yielded to opposition demands for more
time and sent the bill back to committee. The debate, which had been set to
end on Thursday, will now resume next Tuesday.
Opening yesterday's session, Mr Beregovoy called for a 'great movement of
national agreement'. Amid catcalls from right-wing Gaullist members, he
promised the government would be receptive to detailed amendments and said
the assembly would in future be fully consulted throughout the transition
towards economic and monetary union, scheduled towards the end of this
decade.
But he made clear that there could be no question of renegotiating the
Maastricht treaty, warning that if parliament seemed likely to obstruct the
necessary constitutional revisions the president would put the revisions
before the electorate in a referendum.
'If there is any risk that the reform might be buried,' he said, 'we shall
go to a referendum. I should regret it; but if a referendum is necessary,
neither the president nor the government fears the result of an appeal to
the people'.
Mr Beregovoy rejected opposition arguments that the single European currency
would mean the abandonment of French independence. On the contrary, he said,
the Emu system would strengthen French influence over economic policy.
Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, followed the prime minister at the
rostrum of the National Assembly, with a strong plea for a more politically
united Europe.

US banking and law enforcement authorities yesterday set in motion the
procedures needed to transfer control of First American Bankshares  - the
troubled Washington bank that was secretly controlled by the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International (BCCI)  - to an independent government-approved
trustee, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Once the trustee is appointed he will work to facilitate the sale of First
American. The nominee as trustee is Mr Harry Albright, a former New York
State banking superintendent and former special counsel to the late
Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller.
The Washington bank has been co-operating with the Federal Reserve, the New
York district-attorney, the BCCI liquidators and the Justice Department to
achieve the trustee plan in order to sever all ownership links between BCCI
and First American.
To approve the trusteeship plan, First American has called a special
shareholders' meeting of Credit and Commerce American Holdings NV (CCAH),
the offshore vehicle controlling First American and featuring several
nominees described by the Fed last year as 'front men' for BCCI.
Among the BCCI figures being called to the meeting, to be held on May 12 in
Curacao, is Sheikh Kemal Adham, a key shareholder and the US-trained former
head of Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency.
Mr Albright will be named as the sole trustee  - enabled by a court order to
exercise the powers of an owner of all the shares of First American  - once
the plan is approved by CCAH shareholders.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush will fly to Los Angeles today to visit the devastated
South Central area where riots killed 58 people last week.
Mr Bush met cabinet advisers and congressional leaders yesterday to work out
his administration's plans for rebuilding the shattered city, where he is
expected to stay until Thursday night.
In the wake of the riots, Mr Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban
development and the administration's enfant terrible, has been given more
leeway to press his free-market solutions to the nation's urban problems.
Mr Kemp advocates  - with little support from Mr Bush until now  -
programmes to reform the welfare system and help the inner-city poor
accumulate capital and buy their own homes. 'People do not trash their own
property,' he said.
Los Angeles remained calm yesterday after three days and nights of burning
and looting, and schools and businesses returned to near normality.
No serious incidents were reported on Monday night despite Mayor Tom
Bradley's decision to lift the dusk to dawn curfew that he had imposed last
Thursday. Soldiers in battle dress continued to patrol the streets, however.
Police said many of those who took part in the pillaging of shops last week
were now returning their booty or leaving it out on the street.
Cardinal Roger Mahoney's appeal for looters to return goods to Roman
Catholic churches has found a strong response, and police indicated they
were offering an informal amnesty to those who voluntarily returned their
loot.
'If they tell us, they get a free ride. If we find them, they get arrested,'
said one police officer.
Arrests are limited, however, for the city's jails are already overflowing
and its police courts working overtime to deal with the 13,379 people
arrested during the rioting.
The costs of containing the rioting and cleaning up afterwards have put a
new burden on the already strained finances of Californian state and city
authorities.
Besides damage to its own property, the city of Los Angeles is estimated to
face a bill in excess of Dollars 12m (Pounds 6.7m) for police and
firefighters' overtime pay. The greatest cost, however, is likely to come in
the shape of falling revenues from property taxes levied on the damaged
areas.

and around the capital of the former Soviet republic yesterday and at least
four people were believed to have been killed, Reuter reports from Dushanbe.
But after several hours of violence, the first in a month of political
confrontation, the two sides in the republic concluded a truce. They agreed
to talks and called for the withdrawal or disarming of militia units.
President Rakhmon Nabiyev declared a state of emergency, imposing a 9pm-5am
curfew, putting troops on alert and banning rallies, political activity and
strikes. But neither he nor the speaker of parliament, Mr Safarali Kenjayev,
the main target of opposition anger, appeared in public.
Moslem and liberal opponents of the conservative government have been
demonstrating for five weeks in different parts of Dushanbe.
But yesterday's shooting, amid pouring rain in and near the capital, was the
first serious violence in what has been largely a standoff.
Opposition groups demanded, and secured, several concessions, including the
resignation as speaker of Mr Kenjayev, seen as the power behind President
Nabiyev's leadership. But he was appointed to the post of security chief
last week, sparking fresh protests, and was given back his job as speaker at
the weekend, enraging anti-government protesters.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Gunfire greets Bosnian truce: Mortars land close to United
Nations envoy in Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTENSE gun and mortar fire was heard around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital,
last night within minutes of the signing of a truce between the Bosnian
presidency and representatives of the Yugoslav army.
The accord, which came only hours after heavy shelling hit the city, was
reached at the United Nations headquarters there in the presence of the
European Community envoy, Mr Colm Doyle. It said both sides would be able to
recover their dead and wounded with International Red Cross help, and the
free flow of food and medicines to military installations would be
guaranteed.
Earlier, two mortar shells landed close to the building as UN special envoy
Marrack Goulding arrived after a seven-hour delay in Pale, a Serb stronghold
outside the city. A third shell landed near his car as he was driving away
in a UN convoy to see President Alija Izetbegovic. He was not hurt and there
appeared to be no injuries.
Mr Goulding was escorted into Sarajevo late yesterday afternoon by General
Satish Nambiar, commander of UN peace-keeping forces, after being blocked in
Pale. The first UN convoy which tried to meet him had to turn back because
of fighting. A second convoy, with Gen Nambiar, got through but with further
delay.
'The first convoy came under fire up close and had to turn back. The second
expedition was held up for three hours at a Serbian road block and this is
really not acceptable behaviour,' said Mr Goulding.
'Terrible things have been happening in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia. It
is a tense and dangerous situation with the risk it might spread. There are
strong feelings. . . . that the international community must do something
about this.'
Mr Goulding's mission to assess the feasibility of sending a peace-keeping
force to the republic coincided with an ultimatum from the largely Moslem
Bosnian militias to the Yugoslav federal army to withdraw from the capital
by midnight tonight.
The continuing violence forced 25 monitors to pull out of Sarajevo, leaving
a nine-member crew. Responsibility for the killing of a Belgian EC monitor
last Saturday was denied yesterday by the federal army, which implied that
Croatians had done it.
In an apparent effort to stave off international criticism, the presidency
of the new Serb-dominated Yugoslavia yesterday ordered its citizens  - Serb
and Montenegrin soldiers and officers  - to withdraw from Bosnia within 15
days. However, the call was rhetorical since more than 80 per cent of 80,000
federal soldiers stationed in Bosnia are Bosnian Serbs.
The republic's Moslems are backed by Croats who have joined forces against
the Serbs and the federal army in a battle for control of strategic parts of
Sarajevo. However, the Moslem-Croat coalition which supports Bosnian
independence looks fragile. Serb leaders hinted yesterday that Serbia and
Croatia could reach agreement on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina, leaving
Moslems without a homeland.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Base rates cut to 4-year low of 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government yesterday cut interest rates to their lowest level for
four years in an effort to strengthen the so far fragile signs of recovery.
Commercial bank base rates fell from 10.5 per cent to 10 per cent  - the
first fall since September  - after the Bank of England reduced its
short-term money market rates in a move widely welcomed by industry.
The cut, which may help the Conservative party in tomorrow's local council
elections, is expected to boost consumer confidence. It cuts the margin
between borrowing rates in Britain and Germany to the lowest level for 11
years and underlines the perception among UK policy makers that Germany's
anchor role within the European exchange rate mechanism may be less
important than it was.
The cut led to some mortgage cost reductions. Halifax Building Society, the
market leader, cut its rate for new borrowers to 10.65 per cent from 10.95
per cent.
The Halifax's move will shave Pounds 13.13p a month off the cost of a Pounds
60,000 endowment-linked mortgage.
Other lenders will probably follow suit. They are also likely to follow
Halifax's lead and not pass on the full reduction in base rates to
mortgage-holders.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said the cut was good
news for the economy and that Britain was 'well placed' for recovery. The
Institute of Directors said that it would be the 'best possible stimulus'
for a revival.
However, Sir John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, underscored widespread business unease at the high level of real
interest rates  - nominal rates minus inflation.
He said that, while the government's action would 'provide a useful boost to
business confidence', high real interest rates were damaging prospects for
many companies, particularly those in manufacturing.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said the drop in borrowing costs was
'much needed and long overdue'.
Sentiment that Britain still has some way to go before climbing out of
recession in spite of the rate cut led to a subdued stock market reaction.
The FT-SE 100 index closed below the day's high at 2,662.2, up 2.4.
On currency markets, the pound weathered some selling pressure against a
stronger D-Mark, closing in London half a pfennig down at DM2.925 and within
3 pfennigs of sterling's central DM2.95 rate in the European exchange rate
mechanism. It later held steady in New York.
The rate cut  - which Mr Lamont signalled last week via Bank of England
money market operations  - brought UK base rates to within a quarter of a
point of the comparableGerman Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent.
That underlines the UK's gamble that the German Bundesbank council  - which
meets tomorrow  - will refrain from increasing its rates in the next few
months.
Such a move could strain the pound within the ERM. However, the Treasury and
the Bank are thought to have been confident enough that the pound would
retain its recent strength to have found the risk worth taking.
Even so, the threat that the Bundesbank may increase rates  - or at least
not bring them down quickly  - in an effort to curb German inflation is
expected to make the latest UK base rate cut the last for some months.
As for mortgage costs, several mortgage lenders said they would follow the
Halifax lead but wanted more time to digest the change. They will probably
not give details until later in the week. Abbey National, Britain's
second-biggest lender, said it would reduce rates by about 0.3 of a
percentage point, but gave no further details.
It appears that many mortgage-holders will be deprived of the full benefit
of the half-point cut in base rates because many banks and building
societies shaved their rates by half a point earlier this year, in
anticipation of a base rate change.

FT  06 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y set to sell stake in Santa Fe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled property developer, yesterday unveiled plans to
alleviate its cash shortage by selling its 18 per cent stake in Santa Fe
Pacific, the Chicago-based railway, mining and pipeline group, for an
estimated Dollars 400m (Pounds 225m).
O&amp;Y announced its plans for a public offering of Sante Fe shares while 11
banks were meeting in London to decide whether to put the company's UK
subsidiary, O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings, into administration under British
insolvency procedures.
The alternative to administration is a proposal, backed by the UK banks
Lloyds and Barclays, for the banks to lend Pounds 30m to allow work to
continue over the coming month at O&amp;Y's property development at Canary Wharf
in London's Docklands. Banks could not agree on the way forward but set
themselves a deadline of Thursday to resolve the matter. A banker said 'a
couple of banks are still refusing to support the proposal to put in new
money'.
Separately, O&amp;Y said it had called a meeting for Thursday with
representatives of its 15 largest creditor banks to outline long-term plans
to restructure its Dollars 12bn debt. At this meeting, to be held in London,
O&amp;Y will for the first time present a five-year business plan.
The Santa Fe deal, which is likely to raise about Dollars 400m, is meant as
a signal to O&amp;Y's banks that it is willing to make some sacrifices in its
debt restructuring by selling assets.
O&amp;Y also disclosed that it has withdrawn plans for four real estate
financings this year totalling USDollars 1.4bn.
As a result, the company said it would not pay interest totalling CDollars
17m on publicly traded bonds secured by First Canadian Place, its 72-storey
flagship building in downtown Toronto. The interest payments were due on
Monday.
Trust indentures on several of the North American buildings, including First
Canadian Place, require O&amp;Y to reserve rental income for running expenses
and debt-service payments. The company said it was preparing proposals for
the First Canadian Place bondholders which 'it hopes will be satisfactory'
to them and to their trustee.
O&amp;Y has also failed to make a smaller interest payment due on floating rates
notes secured by three Manhattan office buildings. A Dollars 6m payment on
these notes was made in April, several weeks after O&amp;Y's liquidity crisis
first surfaced.
O&amp;Y built up its stake in the original Santa Fe Pacific from mid-1987 when
it sought to diversify its real estate business. Santa Fe has since been
split into three public companies. O&amp;Y still has substantial minority
interests in the two other groups: Catellus Development, a west coast
housing developer; and Santa Fe Energy, an oil and gas producer. Meanwhile,
O&amp;Y's failure to pay interest on its publicly traded bonds is certain to
complicate its debt-restructuring efforts.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Russia plans to make rouble fully convertible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and REUTERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government yes-terday outlined a bold timetable which, in
theory, would allow the rouble to trade freely against other currencies this
summer.
Under the plan the rouble, would have a single floating exchange rate for
all current account transactions from July.
Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, Russia's representative in talks with the
International Monetary Fund, said that from August 1, the government
intended to introduce what he described as a fixed rate. He hoped it would
emerge at Rbs80 to the dollar, compared with its present rate of about
Rbs140.
However, the currency would be allowed to fluctuate within a wide band - 7.5
per cent up or down from that fixed central rate with the help of a proposed
Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund from the west.
The plan to make the rouble convertible is a vital part of integrating
Russia into the market-based economic system of the industrialised world.
A convertible rouble would expose Russian businesses to competitive forces
from abroad and should encourage foreign investment in Russia's economy.
The rouble, which was legal tender in the former Soviet Union, has not been
fully convertible on world markets since the Russian revolution. Since the
start of the year many banks and companies have been allowed to buy and sell
the currency within the country at small-scale trading sessions organised by
the Russian central bank.
The stated goal of the Russian authorities is to make the rouble tradable on
current account and to allow foreign investors in Russia to repatriate
profits. Arrangements on capital account transactions, however, are still
unclear.
Western experts warned that it was probably too early to say exactly how, or
when the stabilisation fund would be used. Several issues, as Russian
officials admitted, have yet to be settled.
These range from controlling the monetary policy of other republics which
would be part of a rouble zone to liberalising the domestic price of oil.
The issue of monetary policy control will be discussed at a meeting of
central bank chairmen of former Soviet republics in mid-May.
The government plans to abolish from July 1 remaining quotas and licences on
all exports except energy, arms and areas such as textiles on which foreign
countries have import restrictions.
Mr Kagalovsky declined to set a date for liberalising the price of oil paid
by domestic users.
One western official said it could take three or four months for the
stabilisation fund promised by western governments to be implemented once
the rouble had been floated. This was because it would take more than a
month for it to find a rate at which it could be stabilised.
Reuters reports from Washington: US Federal Reserve governor Mr Wayne Angell
said he was pessimistic that the rouble stabilisation fund to be established
by western governments would work and said it could become a 'bottomless
pit'.
In a speech to the National Economists Club, Mr Angell said it was very
difficult to stabilise one currency against other currencies without totally
devoting monetary policy to that purpose.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (8): The focus is on world
markets - Cincinnati Milacron in the UK plans economies of scale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTSIDE looks like an art deco palace. The inside is less decorative,
more practical, subject to change as new production comes in and old
production fades away. This is Cincinnati Milacron on the north-east side of
Birmingham, the first overseas plant the US group set up in 1934.
With a turnover of about Pounds 30m a year, it contributes some seven per
cent of group turnover. Although the parent returned to profit in the 1991
final quarter, it recorded an annual net loss of Dollars 100.2m.
The British part of the operation had its problems too. Its largest market
is, in fact, the US and 80 per cent of its production is exported, so it
cannot remain immune to international economic sluggishness.
Mr John Bloxham, managing director in the UK, is encouraged by what he
called 'decent signs' in the US market. 'We're expecting recovery later this
year. We are on budget.'
What is certain is that the Birmingham company cannot, and has not, relied
on the UK market: the level of manufacturing investment is too low,
especially compared with competitors like Germany and Japan.
Since the recession started, Cincinnati Milacron has reduced its Birmingham
workforce from 500 to 400. This is partly the result of lower orders, but it
is also a result of the rationalisation of production.
In this last respect, the UK plant is deeply involved in a re-alignment of
how the group as a whole conducts its machine tool business - 'we are trying
to design world products and maximise economies of scale,' says Mr Bloxham.
This has taken Cincinnati Milacron into the marvellous world of 'focus
factories' and 'wolfpacks' - the jargon for factories which are dedicated to
a single product or series of products, designed, engineered, produced and
financed by a multi-disciplinary team of executives. The background to this
approach is the acceptance in the group of a number of fundamental factors:
First, to obtain economies of scale, a product has to be developed with
reference not to regional markets, as was the case until the late 1980s, but
to the world market.
Second, because the product cycle has changed from roughly 20 years to more
like three or five, it is necessary to bring products to the market at
greater speed. The traditional and leisurely sequential programme of market
research-engineering prototype-production is not a recipe for profit.
Third, the way machine tools are operated has changed. The tendency now is
to run them for 24 hours a day, not just one shift. So, while this makes
their life shorter, it also puts a premium on greater reliability, speedier
installation, low service requirements and short warranties.
The Cincinnati Milacron technique for dealing with these factors is team
engineering - 'what we try to do is to define an opportunity in a given
marketplace,' explains Mr Bloxham. The opportunity becomes a project and for
every project there is a special team.
Suppliers could be involved - the metal fabricators, for example, especially
when they have facilities Cincinnati Milacron itself does not have.
Across the group there are 20 projects under way. To avoid duplication of
effort and resources, the individual factories are providing, to a
co-ordinator in the US, quarterly reviews of progress, including data on
costs and margins. For its part, Birmingham is concentrating on the Sabre
line of products - by the middle of this year the effect of Cincinnati
Milacron's strategy will be that, in Birmingham, all products being made in
1988 will have been phased out and replaced by a concentration on Sabre -
the brand name for a series of vertical and horizontal machining centres.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (6): Strong emphasis on new
product development - The UK is still the world's seventh biggest producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two years of hard times and a steadily increasing sense of
exasperation in the British machine tool industry, producers will view
today's opening of the Mach '92 Show as a chance to put the past behind them
and look to the future.
The outlook, however, is tinged more by hope than expectation. After
production sunk last year by 22 per cent to about Pounds 730m, 1992 has been
a year of uncertainty - about the economy, then the Budget, and more
recently the General Election. As a tonic for an industry that badly needs
to remind people that it still exists - last year's output may have been the
lowest in real terms since 1984, but the UK is still the world's seventh
biggest producer - Mach '92 could not have been better timed.
It comes within weeks of the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as Trade
and Industry Secretary, a move viewed with considerable anticipation by an
industry whose quiet campaign for short-term stimuli to manufacturing
investment fell on deaf ears when the unlamented Mr Peter Lilley ran the
DtI. With the political uncertainty resolved, machine tool builders now
sense faint stirrings in the economy, and among manufacturing customers in
the UK and overseas.
Mr Stan Vaughan, managing director of Hahn &amp; Kolb (GB), the German owned
manufacturer and importer, says inquiries from potential customers have been
rising since December.
Mr Vaughan, chairman of the Mach '92 Exhibition Committee, expects almost as
many exhibitors - about 500  - as at Mach '88, a time of buoyant conditions
virtually worldwide. Some of the stands this time are smaller and less
lavish, he says, but exhibitors' will share a common aim: to turn the
current flickers of customer interest into real orders.
Their strategy will be simple: to emphasise through machines launched at the
exhibition that new product development has not taken a back seat in the
fight for survival and that the UK can still make some claims to global
technology leadership, albeit in niches such as laser-cutting machines and
probes.
For the longer this recession has continued, the more it has become a battle
for survival for many UK machine tool builders, scattered across 120
manufacturing sites.
'A lot of manufacturers are at a very critical stage,' says Mr Ron Bull,
president of the Machine Tool Technologies' Association.
He warns that some UK producers could collapse if business conditions do not
improve by the end of the year.
Given the many disasters in British machine tool history, it is, perhaps,
surprising that the latest recession has not produced any big corporate
casualties. This partly reflects a dogged determination to survive against
all the odds, coupled with the industry's ability to learn from previous
recessions and to act firmly to survive.
At Leicester-based Bridgeport Machines, the big US owned producer, there has
been no pay award for two years, labour has been halved and costs reduced
costs.
Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director, contrasts the company's approach with
the slower response of German competitors more recently hit by a market
downturn.
Exports have also provided a cushion against recession. Last year, exports
of UK machine tools fell 16 per cent to Pounds 411.1m, but would have fallen
a lot further if European Community markets had suffered as deep or
prolonged recession as that in the UK.
The jobs picture is less happy, with total employment falling to 18,200 in
September from 20,800 a year earlier. In the past six months it has sunk
further, to about 17,000, due to closures such as 600 Group's Colchester
lathe plant, Bridgeport's Bridlington plant, and Matrix-Churchill's
Fletchamstead Highway, Coventry plant.
And there is almost certainly more to come. B Elliott, one of the UK's last
three publicly-quoted machine tool builders, is undergoing a restructuring
which could lead to the divestment, rationalisation or closure of its
machine tool division, which includes Butler Newall and Addison.
On the bright side, the job cuts that have been announced this year involve
a prudent concentration of manufacturing rather than a wild swipe at
research and development budgets.
The evidence suggests that UK machine tool companies have realised this is
one option they cannot consider if they wish to remain competitive
long-term.
For example, FMT Holdings, the Brighton-based machine tool group, is
launching new products for Mach '92 at all three group companies, including
a new cutting head for Noble &amp; Lund's aerospace profiling machines.
This comes despite heavy job cuts overall and the decision last month to
turn Noble &amp; Lund's Gateshead plant into an assembly operation, shedding 60
manufacturing jobs.
On the other hand, a reduction of employment of 3,000-4,000 over the course
of a recession, on such a small base, raises the inevitable question about
whether the industry is losing its 'critical mass.'
The loss of expensively-trained skilled workers could affect the ability of
UK producers to exploit fully the upturn, says Mr Bull.
With many companies now relying on the good will of their banks to continue
in business, the recession has clearly exposed the financial weakness of a
highly-fragmented industrial sector.
To avoid bankruptcy next time demand declines for British machine tools,
producers should now be looking to step up the hitherto pedestrian pace of
mergers, joint ventures and bilateral co-operation, especially in Europe.
The recent marketing agreement between Bridgeport and Maho, the big German
milling machine company, was beneficial for both companies, but more
full-blown mergers among UK machine tool companies might be a step towards
greater financial strength while avoiding the cultural problems of
cross-border takeovers.
Mr Bull is right, however, to stress that this is a problem for the industry
to sort out itself. Precedents suggest that absorption by conglomerates or
government-imposed rescue plans do not work in an industry withan
entrepreneurial, owner-manager tradition.
The development of larger companies might also help the UK machine tool
industry take advantage of the new approach at the Department of Trade and
Industry, simply by generating some clout.
The industry has maintained a united approach in its lobbying of government,
but insiders describe meetings with the DtI as 'like talking to a brick
wall.'
Over time, relations between the government and the industry could be very
different. Machine tool builders are naturally hopeful that Mr Heseltine
will have the influence to move the Treasury on subjects such as capital
allowances to spur investment by manufacturing industry.
But Mr Taylor points out that 'even if Mr Heseltine does no more than say a
lot of the right things, it will increase the confidence of the
manufacturing sector.'
If the machine tool industry can sort out its internal structural problems
and gain the ear of government to ensure a 'level playing field' on
manufacturing investment compared with other countries, notably Japan,
British machine tool makers can flourish in the rest of the 1990s.
It is a big 'if', of course, but Mr Bull says the reason reason why
companies have worked so hard to survive is precisely that they think they
do have a future.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (7): UK export success
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE high-accuracy probe, pictured above, can achieve measurements within
two-hundredths of the width of a human hair. The TP7 probe provides a large
measuring machine with a sense of touch by sending signals to a computer.
The probe, developed by Renishaw Metrology of Wotton-under-Edge,
Gloucestershire, has attracted significant export orders. It has
applications in many aspects of engineering and quality control - ranging
from the measurement of engine blocks for Concorde aircraft and Jaguar cars
to the inspection of moulds for ice-cream lolly-makers.
The original concept was developed in 1973 by David McMurty, Renishaw's
group chairman. Since then, the group has won seven Queen's Awards, mainly
for probe-related products - five for export achievement and two for
technology.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (9): Now the grinding wheel
comes full circle - Manufacturer's profile: Jones &amp; Shipman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS conditions have been as tough for Jones &amp; Shipman as any other UK
machine tool maker, but the Leicester-based grinding machine manufacturer
can hardly be accused of twiddling its thumbs during the recession.
The 40-strong engineering department has been working harder than ever
before over the past 12 months, says Dr John Liverton, director of
engineering.
Since September, a small group of engineers have been working on a project
of considerable strategic significance for J&amp;S, one of the UK's three
remaining publicly-quoted machine tool builders.
Through an acquisition last year from Brown &amp; Sharpe, the venerable US
machine tool builder which invented the grinding machine, Jones &amp; Shipman
has become the first British machine tool builder to make CNC creep-feed
grinders, one of the most promising product areas in the industry.
In a sense, therefore, J&amp;S has now brought the grinding wheel full circle
for creep-feed, on which much of the pioneering work was done at the
University of Bristol in the 1970s, before commercial exploitation moved to
the US and Europe.
As the name suggests, creep-feed grinding involves passing the workpiece
under the grinding wheel at a slow pace, allowing greater metal removal in
one pass, and thus increasing the customer's productivity.
Until now, creep-feed has been used mainly in the aerospace sector for
producing turbine blades and other parts. However, many users are now
contemplating replacing their original machines to take advantage of recent
developments in CNC systems.
At the same time, new markets are opening up for grinding materials such as
ceramics and composites, while creep-feed technology can also be applied to
the manufacture of such humdrum articles as scissor-blades, currently
produced on milling and other machines.
J&amp;S is keen to exploit these opportunities, as part of a strategy to expand
its presence in the production grinding market, where the machines are
bigger, and the prospects more promising, than in the toolroom grinding
business.
The need for speed of action coincided neatly with Brown &amp; Sharpe's decision
last year to withdraw from machine tool manufacture, says Mr Eddie Gee, J&amp;S
sales director.
The result, among other things, was the purchase of the full intellectual
property rights to the US company's Hi-Tech creep feed grinding product
line, and its Techmaster surface grinder range.
For J&amp;S, the Hi-Tech range was a solid springboard for moving into
creep-feed. The machine, based on an epoxy granite bed to absorb the
vibrations from the high-powered grinding process, was mechanically
advanced, but the control systems needed to be re-engineered if J&amp;S was to
take full advantage of business prospects.
This has involved a combination of in-house and external computer expertise.
The latest GE Fanuc 16 Series CNC system with an LCD flat screen display has
replaced an older Allen-Bradley system, while Jones and Shipman has also
installed its own PC-based software for solving problems such as the
'flight-path' of the grinding wheel when cutting difficult contours.
Manufacturing has been brought back to Leicester from Rhode Island, making
more efficient use of spare capacity caused by the recession.
Outside the US, the machine is being relaunched as the Techmat 400.
The Techmaster is also to be re-engineered, as a smaller creep-feed grinder,
and will be launched later this year as the Techmat 200.
Technically, says Dr Liverton, the new Techmat 400 is equal or superior to
its European rivals, but the control system is superior - the machine is the
first creep-feed grinder in Europe to have the new GE Fanuc control.
Jones &amp; Shipman now faces the challenge of developing its presence in
creep-feed grinding against entrenched European rivals such as Magerle of
Switzerland and Germany's Hauni-
Blohm. The British company is already talking to Rolls-Royce, a big user of
creep-feed technology, and wants two or three good installations in the home
market before tackling Europe.
Today, at the Mach 92 Show, will see the start of a drive to persuade
customers from outside aerospace to switch to creep-feed. Much will depend
on business conditions - the Techmat 400 is a big investment for many
companies at around Pounds 220,000.
'People have their installed capacity and you have to get over this
obstacle,' says Mr Gee.
J&amp;S is now hoping that a recent upturn in its small tools business will, as
has happened in the past, herald better conditions in machine tools.
Late last month, Jones &amp; Shipman announced machine tool orders worth more
than Pounds 1.4m, evidence that a quickening pace in order inquiries is
beginning to be converted into orders.
Whatever happens, says Dr Liverton, 'I think we will get a lot of interested
German and Swiss on the stand at Mach '92.'

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (2): First signs of recovery
for Japanese suppliers - After a slump in orders in every sector of the
industry, brighter indicators have begun to appear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE machine tool industry, the world's largest, has entered a
precipitous slump since production and orders peaked at record levels near
the end of 1990.
The industry, which produces over a fifth of all machine tools, was hit by
the Japanese economic slowdown earlier than most, and 1991 orders dropped 19
per cent. Declines spiralled rapidly toward year's end, with orders for the
final three months toppling 35 per cent, including a 38 per cent plunge in
domestic orders to Y159.3 bn. The Japanese industry is no more immune to
'boom and bust' cycles than machine tool makers elsewhere, but the current
trough appears especially deep in the wake of the all-time high tide that
preceded it. In the three years to 1990, production and orders consistently
grew at double-digit rates and the Japanese industry emerged as the world's
pre-eminent machine tool maker. Its output the final year was valued at
about Dollars 10.8 bn - 20 per cent higher than Germany's. However, the now
over one-year-old recession has deepened in early 1992, with first-quarter
orders were down an estimated 39 per cent to around Y200 bn - 'often, even
in bad years, there are some strong sectors in the industry, but this time
they're all bad,' says an official at the Japan Machine Tool Builders'
Association (JMTBA). The auto industry, which accounted for 21 per cent of
1990 demand, has been among the most aggressive in cutting orders.
Ironically, the first bright news appeared in February. Although orders were
down 40.3 per cent from one year earlier, they rose 3 per cent from January
to mark the first month-on-month increase since the previous May.
With the US economy beginning to stir and Japan's own growth rate expected
to begin recovering, the rebound is likely to build up steam later in the
year, according to industry sources - 'at the beginning of this year, it was
hard to say how far orders would fall, but they've been up a bit since
January and it now looks like they will be increasing slowly
(month-on-month), though not sharply,' says the JMTBA official. He points to
three catalysts for a machine tool industry rebound: the government's
so-called emergency economic package designed to stimulate demand through
quickened infrastructure spending; manufacturers' responsiveness to
declining interest rates since the Bank of Japan's 0.75 percentage point
official discount rate cut April 1; and ongoing rationalisation and
labour-saving initiatives.
Orders in 1992 are still likely to decline at a double-digit rate the
previous year, but just as the downturn hit machine tool makers early they
are expected by autumn to be in the vanguard of the recovery.
Unlike many Japanese industries which have reached a relatively stable
oligopolistic equilibrium, the machine tool sector still includes dozens of
small, flexible competitors as well as some of the world's largest.
'Concentrated, single-minded, highly competitive and cut-throat,' is how Mr
Michael Remington, an analyst at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, describes
the industry.
Despite such characteristics, machine tool makers have refrained from the
debilitating price wars that have characterized previous downturns.
Indeed, JMTBA figures show prices remained flat even as orders plunged early
this year. The industry may have learned a few lessons from past experience.
This time around, its order backlogs have remained consistent at around six
months, suggesting makers did not over-burden themselves with excessive
production capacity, as did many of their clients during the Japan's 1980s
capital spending frenzy, says Mr Remington. Exports also have helped
somewhat in steadying demand as the domestic slump has worsened and
accounted for about a third of orders in the last quarter of 1991.
US domestic orders have increased year-on-year every month since last
November. This includes four consecutive months of double-digit gains
through February, when they were up 21.5 per cent to Dollars 200.6m - 'the
export side is not bad. Contact with US machine tool manufacturers shows the
pickup is going to continue,' says Mr Remington.
Sales to south-east Asia are also holding up well, despite a slowdown in
Japanese direct investment there. Exports to the region increased
year-on-year for five consecutive months through February, when they jumped
49 per cent to Y7.46 bn and surpassed shipment value to the US.
The problem is Europe - 'the market is completely awful,' says an official
of Toshiba Machine Company, one of the world's leading makers of large
machine tools.
In the first two months of 1992, Japanese machine tool exports to the
European Community ran at only about half the previous year's pace, with the
February total at Y5.29 bn.
Overseas, Japanese machine tool makers face political problems as well as
mixed demand. In the US, a so-called voluntary restraint agreement (VRA) was
recently extended to give the domestic industry more time to take on foreign
competitors.
The head of Germany's machine tool association also warned recently that if
Japanese makers persist with what he termed 'unfair competitive practices,'
or if his own industry falls into the same state as America's, pressure will
build for similar measures.
However, Japan's own importance to the world machine tool market could help
limit political damage.
In the US, for example, the VRA works on a sliding scale so Japanese machine
tool makers automatically receive larger quotas as demand rises. A blanket
ban would likely hurt US industry most of all since Japanese machine tool
makers are its only source for a number of vital products.
'The key to Japanese makers increasing sales in the US is not the VRA. The
US economy's performance is more important,' says Salomon Brothers Tokyo
analyst, Mr Fumihiko Nakazawa.
Although Japanese machine tool makers' profits will fall by about 50 per
cent during the current recession, the industry remains fundamentally
healthy, has weathered downturns before and is undergoing few structural
changes this time around, says the JMTBA official.
If anything, it is shifting to higher value added equipment and
manufacturing consultancy, says Mr Remington. As manufacturing equipment
becomes increasingly complex and the debate heats up at home over whether it
is really a cost-effective substitute for scarce workers, machine tool
makers are finding niches helping clients decide what equipment they really
need, he says.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (3): Germany still top
exporter - Orders have improved slightly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<TEXT>
THESE are tough times for German machine tool manufacturers. As the world's
second largest producing country and the largest exporter in the industry,
Germany's manufacturers are heavily dependent on the health of the world
economy.
At the same time, their own domestic market, which totals around DM 11bn a
year, has become increasingly attractive to foreign companies. Thus Germany
is now also the world's champion importer of machine tools, many of them
supplied by Japanese companies which have set up plants in countries like
the UK.
With two important trade fairs now absorbing the industry's attention - Mach
92 in the UK and Metav 92 in Germany - machine tool makers hope that signs
of an upturn from last year's poor performance will gradually emerge. They
do not like talk of a crisis.
The German machine tool industry association (VDW) is encouraged by the fact
that there are slightly more exhibitors at Metav in Dusseldorf (May 5-9)
than two years ago. The foreign companies come mainly from Switzerland, the
main exporter to the German machine tool market, Italy, Japan, Spain, and
France. Attendance at the Meba exhibition in Leipzig, east Germany, this
October, also promises to be high.
The VDW expects 1992 to be another uninspiring year, but not quite as dismal
as 1991 when production fell by 8.4 per cent in real terms to DM15.8bn
(Dollars 9.6bn). This gave Germany a share of just over 20 per cent in world
output compared with nearly 30 per cent for Japan and 9 per cent for Italy.
German machine tool exports were a real 6 per cent lower at DM9.3bn, with
imports 2 per cent higher at DM4.7bn.
But the real shocker was the order inflow. Last year's incoming new business
fell by 23 per cent in real terms to DM14.2bn, with declines of more than 20
per cent in both domestic and foreign business. The nominal fall (excluding
price rises) was 19 per cent. The VDW hopes this year's slide can be kept to
around 15 per cent, with foreign markets expected to pick up later in the
year; it expects a further 18 per cent nominal drop in domestic orders, but
a milder decline of 9 per cent from abroad.
IT is also marginally more optimistic on production, foreseeing a real drop
of around 7 per cent in 1992. Its forecasts were drawn up with the help of
the Ifo economic research institute in Munich. Mr Gerhard Hein, an economist
with VDW, points out that the figures for last year were not actually as bad
as they appeared, especially on the order side.
Suffering most were the producers of standard machine tools who experienced
collapses of 30 per cent or more in orders. But makers of special tools such
as those used to grind metal and make gears, and of automated production
systems for the car, aerospace and other industries, fared less poorly. The
average order backlog in the industry had dropped to 6.6 months at the start
of this year from an average of 7.8 months in 1991; for standard machines,
the figure was a much more depressing four months. In past years, downturns
in one part of the world could usually be made up somewhere else. But weak
demand in the western industrialised countries has combined with the slump
in the former Soviet and eastern European economies to cause a drop in
business on all sides for German producers.
Last year, the Soviet Union was actually the biggest market for German
machine tools, but this reflected earlier orders. Today, says Mr Hein,
'business with the countries of the former Soviet Union is dead and there is
no future perspective'. Of the near DM1.2bn of Soviet business in 1991,
roughly two-thirds was attributable to exports by west German companies and
a third to those in east Germany whose economy has suffered badly from the
Comecon trading bloc's collapse.
However, even without the east German contribution, the Soviet Union has
been traditionally an important market. In 1988 and 1989, it was the biggest
customer for west German machine tools ahead of France, the US, and Italy.
Thus the virtual disappearance of this market, at last for a time, is a
serious matter for German producers. While there is obviously a great
potential demand for imported machine tools to help in economic
reconstruction, financing is a critical problem.
German companies have a further difficulty: because of the Bonn government's
firm approach to the sale abroad of products that could be used for military
purposes, exports of some German goods have been held up. The government's
list of sensitive countries for which exports have to go through a special
approval process covered some 15 per cent of foreign sales, though this has
been modified.
This strict policy towards so-called 'dual-use' products can cause costly
delays - 'lots of firms say officials don't realise that the competition is
ready to jump in and profit from any delivery delays,' says Mr Hein. 'Around
60 per cent of (the machine tool industry's) turnover consists of exports,
so it's a serious problem.'
In the domestic market, west German producers have benefitted partly from
the economic upsurge caused by re-unification and the need to reconstruct
east Germany. So far, however, it has been mainly the car and other consumer
industries that have felt the post-unity impulses.
Since statistics on internal German trade in this area are sketchy - some
orders placed by west German customers are for use in the east - Mr Hein
regards this figure as a minimum. It shows, Mr Hein says, that the west
German industry is close to achieving again the DM500m or so of annual sales
which were transacted with the former East Germany in 1989, its last full
year of existence.
But economic progress is proving painfully slow in Germany's new eastern
states. It is to the important markets of western Europe and the US,
therefore, that machine tool producers are mainly looking for signs of an
end to the malaise.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (4): Swiss sales fall again
 -There is very little optimism among producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MACHINE tool builders in Switzerland hoped that they had seen the worst last
year, but it was not to be.
The performance of the country's largest export industry - and the world's
third ranked machine tool exporter after Germany and Japan - slumped in 1991
following the boom years of the late 1980s.
Swiss machine tool sales tumbled 10.7 per cent to an estimated SFr3.6bn and
the all important exports fell slightly more to SFr3.2bn.
So far this year, things are even worse. Machine tool exports in the first
quarter plunged a staggering 21 per cent to SFr614.2m, according to the
latest statistics from the Swiss Association of Machinery Manufacturers
(VSM).
'Nobody is doing well,' says Mr Urs Bleuler, secretary-general of the VSM.
He estimates that about half the companies in the industry are in loss, the
rest making meagre profits.
Mikron, the leading producer, reported a SFr90m loss last year compared with
a SFr4.6m profit in 1990.
In Decemeber, the group eliminated 40 of 650 jobs at its main production
site in Biel (Bienne), having already put 270 on short time working earlier
in the year.
In March, Agie, the second largest group, said it would shed 120 jobs,
mostly at its headquarters in Losone in southern Switzerland.
The Agie group, which specialises in spark erosion technology, has been
selling off loss-making subsidiaries and in the first half of last year
suffered a slump in turnover from SFr192m to SFr145m.
The one consolation is that international statistics indicate that the
difficulties of the Swiss builders are mirrored in the other great machine
tool producing countries: Japan and Germany.
The main problem is that capital spending by the industry's three leading
customer groups - machinery makers, automotive manufacturers and armaments
companies - has slumped in the past year and, in the case of the armaments
industry, in particular, the slump may be a structural one.
The Swiss machine tool makers have some special problems; the eastern
European and former Soviet Union markets were very important, but their
orders have collapsed because of a lack of liquidity. For example, in the
first quarter of this year, exports of Swiss machine tools to the
Commonwealth of Independent States plunged by 73 per cent to only SFr14.9m.
The all-important German market, which takes about a third of Swiss machine
tool exports, has also turned down sharply in the first quarter.
After a 17.6 per cent gain in sales to Germany last year to SFr1.04bn, there
was a 19 per cent drop in the first quarter of this year to SFr203.2m.
Swiss makers also have to contend with a new set of export control
regulations introduced in February to try to prevent a repeat of the
embarrassing revelations last year that a couple of Swiss companies supplied
specialised machine tools to Iraq for use in that country's nuclear weapon
development programme.
'We cannot close our eyes to the problems of trading with some countries,'
Mr Bleuler says.
'But sometimes we know that our government applies export-control mechanisms
more severely than, say, the US government does, especially in highly
accurate machine tools.'
Until a few months ago, the Swiss also chafed under the old COCOM
regulations that were aimed at preventing transfers of high technology to
the former Soviet Union and east European countries. Switzerland was not a
member of COCOM but it followed their guidelines.
'COCOM would still be a big problem if the old Comecon countries had any
money,' Mr Bleuler adds.
The Swiss machine tool industry, like its counterparts in other countries,
has had its difficulties adjusting to the upheavals caused by the widespread
application of computer numerical controls in the past decade.
However, as Swiss makers tend to specialise in high precision, high
repeatability and special purpose machines, they have been less jolted than
those in some countries, notably the US and the UK, that make more high
volume, standard products.
The fact that Switzerland has maintained its trade surplus in machine tools
with Japan speaks for itself.
Thus, the profile of the industry today is not vastly different from what it
was 10 years ago, that is, a collection of small, entrepreneur-based,
specialist companies.
The vast majority of businesses employ about 100 people, with only a few
having over 600 employees and only three having more than 1,200.
The overall numbers have declined significantly - from 170 companies in
1980, employing 19,000 people, to only 115 today employing 13,000 - but that
is a function of improved productivity and some rationalisation as well as
fading fortunes, in some cases.
Still, there have been some significant changes in the industry in recent
years. George Fischer, a once-famous name in lathes, has sold out. Oerlikon
Buhrle, once a major producer, now makes only specialised gear cutting
machines.
On the other hand, Mikron has tried to build up a diversified group through
acquisitions, last year adding the Italian gear cutting maker, Cima, and the
French specialised machine producer, Somex, to its interests.
But suggestions similar to those heard in other countries that Swiss machine
tool builders should join forces for marketing and distribution abroad are
dismissed by the VMS as unrealistic - 'we feel there are a few well-defined
fields where closer co-operation in distribution and service could be
meaningful, but not a general arrangement.'
As for the outlook, no-one seems to be very optimistic. The industry's order
backlog had slid to only 4.8 months by the end of last year, down by 2.7
months since the end of 1990.
Mr Theodor Fassler, head of the machine tools division of VMS and president
of Mikron, said earlier this year that restructuring and capacity
adjustments had at least led to
decreased pressure on prices. However, he predicted that an upturn would not
be felt until 1993.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (5): Fighting to reverse
decline - Big US producers continue to restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AFTER a long slumber, the US machine tool industry
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the world's fourth largest in 1991 with output of Dollars 2.74bn - has woken
up over the past two years.
In the middle of a deep recession, it is attempting with some success to
reverse a decline in the 1970s and 1980s that surrendered too many markets
too easily to Japanese competition.
The decline - as so often in the machine tool industry  - was due to a
combination of internal and external factors. As recently as 1982, there
were 1,400 active US machine toolmakers, most of which were happy to serve
the domestic market with a single product that faced little foreign
competition.
These companies were completely ill-prepared for the onslaught of Japanese
imports from companies with active product development programmes, and to a
lesser extent, European suppliers.
Last year imports were worth Dollars 2.16bn, accounting for more than half
of the Dollars 3.8bn market, according to the magazine American Machinist.
In percentage terms, imports have more than doubled their market share in
the past decade.
The external factor, which is largely outside the industry's control, is the
relative decline of the US manufacturing sector on which it relied too
heavily. The US now accounts for less than 10 per cent of world machine tool
consumption, compared with 20 per cent a decade ago.
The continued recession last year reduced machine tool consumption by 19 per
cent, while US machine tool production fell 20 per cent.
Behind these figures lies the unpleasant fact that US machine-tool buyers
were more likely to give up buying domestic machines than to forego
purchasing imports.
On a brighter note, US machine-tool exports set a new record last year,
rising marginally to Dollars 1.08bn - a creditable performance given world
market conditions.
This suggests that Mr Albert Moore, president of the Association for
Manufacturing Technology, was speaking with some justification when he told
American Machinist that 'for many US machine-tool builders, exporting has
become an integral part of their overall business plan, not just an
alternative to the still-weak domestic market.'
Fortunately in many respects, the recession of the early 1980s had begun a
winnowing-out process that has reduced the number of active US machine tool
builders to less than 600.
Proportionately, this is a much heavier restructuring than has occurred in
Europe, but many of the remaining companies are still too small to invest
sufficiently in long-term development.
At the top end of the business, however, a handful of companies have
realised that the demands of customers for multiple product lines and a more
closer working relationship with the machine tool supplier, along with the
trend towards machining centres and flexible manufacturing cells, can best
be served by large companies with big, integrated product ranges and a
commitment to spending on new product development.
THE TWO companies leading the fightback, Giddings &amp; Lewis and Cincinnati
Milacron, share at least one thing in common: a size that dwarfs most other
US machine tool builders. Beyond that, their backgrounds and strategies are
somewhat different.
The resurgence at Giddings &amp; Lewis began in 1987 with the appointment of Mr
William Fife, a former steelworks sweeper who joined the Wisconsin-based
company after a spell at Cross &amp; Trecker, another US machine tool builder.
Mr Fife removed artificial divisions between product lines, invested heavily
in a computer-aided design system, and boosted research spending to 10 per
cent of sales.
The company went public in a 1989 spin-off from AMCA International - now
United Dominion Industries - and after three years of sharply rising sales
and profits Mr Fife launched his big move last June.
For just Dollars 70m, Mr Fife turned Giddings &amp; Lewis into the world's
fourth largest machine tool company by agreeing to buy the heavily
loss-making Cross &amp; Trecker.
The attraction of the deal, concluded late last year, was the chance to
create a much-expanded product line.
It also gave a much stronger presence in Europe - a market that is now more
than four times bigger than its US counterpart.
Mr Fife now has a tough job integrating the much larger Cross &amp; Trecker into
Giddings &amp; Lewis, and producing 'one-stop shopping' for factory automation.
Cincinnati Milacron is also undergoing a profound change of emphasis that
could be of immense significance to the future of the US machine tool
industry.
The company lost its way in the 1980s after moving away from producing
standard machine tools such as machining centres and turning centres to
concentrate on highly-engineered, custom-built machines.
With Milacron working on long-lead time orders in an era of high inflation,
imported product got the chance to move onshore, according to Mr Daniel
Meyer, chairman and chief executive.
'Now we are going back to where we were very strong,' he says.
The renewed emphasis on standard products, taking on Japanese competition
directly, is a key element of Milacron's much-vaunted Wolfpack programme.
This is a more ambitious sequel to the company's mid-80s revival in its
plastic injection moulding machine business.
The programme has involved considerable restructuring to ensure that
Milacron remains competitive manufacturing in the US, and a reversal of some
earlier diversification moves. Hence, in 1990, the sale of Milacron's
industrial robot business to ABB Robotics.
Already, Wolfpack has resulted in a much stronger new product development
programme, backed up by a big effort, says Mr Meyer, to 'get more people out
knocking on doors to sell our products.'
However, if the long-term outlook for both companies looks encouraging,
neither has completed its reshaping efforts. This explains why both Mr Meyer
and Mr Fife are relieved that the US government is extending for two years
the voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) on the import of certain CNC
machine tools from Japan and Taiwan.
'This goes right to the heart of the Wolfpack programme. We need another two
years to complete it,' says Mr Meyer. Mr Fife has also welcomed the
breathing space offered by the VRA extension.
The extensions - which were opposed by some other US machine tool builders -
are still being negotiated, and will be backdated to the beginning of the
year once agreement is reached.
But the Bush Admistration has made it clear they will not be renewed again.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (1): Hard-pressed suppliers
seek signs of upturn - More than 3,000 manufacturers worldwide are hungry
for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWIN grinding wheels of world recession and political upheaval have worn
down the Dollars 41bn world machine tool industry over the past two years,
punching large holes into the optimism and self-confidence of the largest
producers.
Many of the estimated 3,000 builders of a huge variety of metal-cutting and
metal-forming machines used in manufacturing - from the simplest lathes to
the most sophisticated multi-function flexible manufacturing systems - have
been feeling the pinch. According to the US magazine American Machinist,
which annually collates global production and consumption figures, world
output of machine tools fell 10 per cent last year to Dollars 40.9bn.
The main culprits were downturns of varying length and intensity in leading
western markets, which continue this year, and the collapse of markets in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union following the downfall of
communism.
Although the machine tool industry can always produce examples of companies
flourishing in niche markets, the outlook can only get better for the bulk
of producers.
This is why manufacturers are attaching considerable importance to two
leading machine tool exhibitions this month, Mach '92 from today until May
15 at the Birmingham National Exhibition Centre, and Metav, the German
machine tool show at Dusseldorf, which runs from May 5 to 9. The shows are a
chance, especially for British and German manufacturers, to show that new
product development has continued despite market conditions which have
exacerbated the European industry's chronic financial weakness - a result of
its fragmented industrial structure.
All the larger worldwide producers are aware, after all, that the demands of
leading manufacturing customers for faster, more accurate and more flexible
production techniques are increasing as they pursue their own global
strategies.
Big clients, with the exception of Japanese companies manufacturing in
Japan, are no respecters of national boundaries when it comes to the
purchase of machine tools.
Reports abound in the industry of stockpiles of unsold equipment at dealers
and distributors, especially in Europe. Even the Japanese manufacturers,
which over the past 20 years have developed the strongest position in the
market through a combination of high-volume, high quality production and
marketing muscle, have been affected.
Individual markets and industries have been hit in different ways by varying
combinations of the current problems. In the UK, machine tool output fell
last year to its lowest level in real terms since 1984, but producers are
determined to survive and thus avoid wasting the improvements in product
quality and delivery times forced on them after the 1980/81 recession.
Although the UK producers have improved their export position strongly over
the past decade, and particularly in the European community, their problems
begin at home with a market that misses out on the financial incentives for
manufacturing investment made elsewhere.
This is compounded by the industry's lack of visibility and political clout,
relatively less supportive banks and higher real interest rates - 'British
producers tend to feel they have been left out to wither on the vine in a
situation that was not of their own making,' says Mr Ron Bull, president of
the UK Machine Tool Technologies Association.
In the US, production fell about 20 per cent last year, in line with a 19
per cent decline in domestic consumption. Here too, though, the domestic
producers are approaching export markets more systematically.
Also, the position of the top two producers, Giddings &amp; Lewis and Cincinnati
Milacron, has been strengthened over the past two years, raising hopes that
the rise in import penetration by Japanese and European producers can be
stemmed.
THE mood in Germany, the largest producer in Europe, could almost be
described as shell-shocked. Larger producers such as Maho, the big
Bavarian-based milling machine builder, have been in the almost
unprecedented situation of reporting losses.
German producers are simply the victims of their own success. Germany is the
world's biggest exporter in absolute terms, and along with the downturn in
western markets, machine tool builders have had to cope with re-unification
at home, which has not brought the bonanza seen in other sectors of
mechanical engineering, such as construction equipment. On top of that comes
tough new export restrictions introduced on militarily-sensitive industrial
exports.
But the biggest problem for the German producers has been the collapse of
the eastern European and Soviet markets, where German machine tools financed
by German banks dominated purchases of western equipment.
For Japanese producers, too, the immediate outlook is gloomy. At the end of
last year, monthly orders received were running about 40 per cent down on
the previous year's levels, and output has been reduced since last summer
due largely to the weakness of the domestic market.
The downturn is a test of the financial strength of leading companies such
as Amada, Yamazaki Mazak and Okuma, but also vindicates the big producers'
strategy of expanding manufacturing overseas both to anticipate the European
Single Market reforms and to forestall the trade friction that is inevitably
fuelled by weak business conditions. And there is little evidence to suggest
the big Japanese producers will emerge from the recession with their
competitiveness damaged. Elsewhere, the Swiss machine tool industry,
proportionately the world's biggest exporter with 88 per cent of output sold
abroad, has been indirectly hit by the German downturn, while the large but
technically unexciting Soviet industry is in disarray following collapse of
the old purchasing networks.
The near-disintegration of the Soviet industry, along with declines in
output by east European countries which formerly relied heavily on trading
within Comecon, has altered the global balance of power within the machine
tool industry.
According to American Machinist, both western Europe and the Pacific Rim
countries were able to gain in share of the world's total output last year.
The 12-nation Cecimo grouping in Europe raised its share of output from 45
per cent in 1990 to 48 per cent, while the Pacific Rim countries, headed by
Japan but followed by Taiwan, China and South Korea, lifted their share from
29 per cent to 35 per cent.
The question for the machine tool industry in the 1990s is whether further
changes in the power balance are likely.
The downturn in the Japanese market could encourage domestic producers
either to try exporting more, or to step up overseas manufacturing, where
the pace of investment has slowed in the past two years.
At the same time, the ambitions of other Far Eastern producers - and, in
particular, Taiwan which exports two-thirds of its production - may add to
the pressure on producers in the US and Europe.
ALTHOUGH the Taiwanese have not quite reached European or US levels of
technical sophistication, their low labour costs give them a potential
advantage on pricing.
For European producers, that makes it all the more important to reduce
manufacturing costs and increase the industry's financial strength.
Most observers believe the pace of co-operation agreements and mergers
between machine tool companies needs to be increased, and there is talk in
Germany of bank-led initiatives to bring the bigger producers together. In
the UK, 3,000 to 4,000 job-cuts in the current recession have widened the
industry's relative cost advantage over German rivals, but raised a question
over whether the industry can take advantage of the upturn - when it
happens.
On a brighter note, the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as the UK's
Trade and Industry Secretary has raised the hopes of machine tool builders
on new financial stimuli for manufacturing investment.
The future of the US industry will also depend partly on solutions to a
similar problem in the domestic manufacturing base, according to Mr Daniel
Meyer, Cincinnati Milacron's chairman and chief executive: 'Government can
play an influencing role in incentives for investment. That's the underlying
problem for US manufacturing.'
The immediate question for virtually all machine tool-makers, however, is
the timing of a recovery.
All the evidence so far is sketchy, but there are signs that the US could be
the first market to recover - Mr Meyer sees a recovery this year to 1990
levels but admits that was 'no great shakes.'
There is less optimism about an immediate upturn on the continent, however,
and in the UK a slight increase in order inquiries has yet to be matched by
orders. Maybe Mach '92 will be the turning point.

FT  06 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in stock index futures rose sharply as the June contract on the
FT-SE closed above the 2,700 level after a volatile session, writes Joel
Kibazo.
A positive mood was much in evidence early in the session as June opened at
2,712, up 15 on Friday's close. A squeeze pushed the contract higher, buoyed
by speculation about a cut in UK base rates.
The announcement of a cut at around 10am, however, led to a sell-off in
June, as the weakness in gilts and the nervous trading in sterling both
played their part in dampening the initially positive mood. Consequently,
June hit a low of 2,683 at around 1pm, but recovered some of the lost ground
as dealers moved to cover short positions just before the official close.
June finished at 2,702, around 22 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 18. Turnover at 11,074 was high, with dealers
reporting many trades done in large lots.
In traded options, volume at 34,698 was up on Friday's poor levels. The
FT-SE option traded a total of 9,104 lots. British Steel was the busiest
stock option, with a day's total of 3,923 contracts. It was followed by BP,
in which 1,517 contracts were transacted.

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong runs into
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET'S record close overnight had only a limited effect on the
Pacific Rim yesterday, as Tokyo remained shut for the Golden Week holidays.
Seoul was closed for Children's Day, while Bombay was closed to enable
brokers to complete business done in the last two weeks.
Bangkok was also shut for a public holiday. Dealers feared that an
anti-government protest, planned to coincide with Prime Minister Suchinda
Kraprayoon's policy speech to parliament, could prompt a fall in share
prices when the market reopens today.
HONG KONG ran into profit-taking after its recent record-breaking run. The
Hang Seng index climbed more than 60 points in the first 15 minutes of
trading, but was then pushed into negative territory before closing a net
17.43 up at 5,631.21. Turnover was still heavy, at HKDollars 4.3bn, after
HKDollars 4.8bn.
Among utilities, Hong Kong Electric put on 10 cents to HKDollars 17.10 and
Hong Kong Telecom rose 25 cents to HKDollars 9.70.
Jardine Matheson slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 52.50, Sun Hung Kai
Properties shed 50 cents to HKDollars 31.50, and Hang Seng Bank lost 25
cents to HKDollars 43.75.
AUSTRALIA ended firmer but after retreating from the day's high in the wake
of comments by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, suggesting that interest
rates would only be cut by a half-point rather than the full point the
market had been expecting. The All Ordinaries index ended just 1.1 ahead at
1,665.5, after reaching 1,678.4, in turnover of ADollars 228m, against
ADollars 166m.
BHP slipped 6 cents to ADollars 14.06, but News Corp gained a further 56
cents to end at the day's best of ADollars 20.50.
NEW ZEALAND gained ground but slipped from the day's high following light
profit-taking in Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey, which have both
advanced strongly in recent weeks. The NZSE-40 index moved forward to
1,478.37 before finishing at 1,470.12, up 2.58 on balance. Turnover expanded
to NZDollars 28.4m from NZDollars 20.3m.
Fletcher touched NZDollars 3.58 before ending down 2 cents at NZDollars
3.50, while Carter Holt reached NZDollars 2.58 before closing 2 cents off at
NZDollars 2.55.
Telecom benefited from the rally on Wall Street, recovering 4 cents to
NZDollars 1.99.
KUALA LUMPUR closed broadly higher as smaller investors joined the recent
rally, concentrating on stocks in the second and third tiers. Dealers also
attributed the market's buoyancy to the publicity ahead of listing of power
company Tenaga Nasional at the end of this month. The composite index rose
5.55 to 603.02 in turnover of MDollars 145m, up from MDollars 103m.
Telekom was active, rising 20 cents to MDollars 12.40.
TAIWAN finished mixed in light activity, after early gains were eroded. The
weighted index opened more than 30 points higher but closed a net 2.94 off
at 4,536.53 after buy-ing interest faded. Turnover came to TDollars 16.8bn
(TDollars 17.3bn).
Cement shares rose on reports that demand for cement would soar because of
Taiwan's huge infrastructure building plans. Chia Hsin Cement rose TDollars
3.50 to TDollars 59.
MANILA lost early gains on profit-taking. The composite index shed 0.31 to
1,245.52 as turnover rose to 169m pesos from 143m. Philippine Long Distance
Telephone bucked the trend, rising 15 pesos to 970 pesos.
JAKARTA's index ended 3.08 up at 283.12 in moderate volume of 7.7m shares.
Cigarette shares rose on expectations that a monopoly supplying the industry
with cloves, an essential ingredient in local cigarettes, would soon
collapse.

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Pacific Rim puts Japan in the shade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pacific Rim markets, with the exception of Japan, were strong last week as
Hong Kong attained an all-time high and Singapore attracted institutional
buying.
However, weakness in Europe, and a listless Tokyo ahead of the Golden Week
holidays, restricted the gain in the FT-Actuaries World index to 0.57 per
cent in local currency terms.
Hong Kong was initially boosted after a leading Chinese politician
reiterated the already widely publicised view that economic reforms in China
would continue. This was followed by the announcement by Lloyds Bank that it
was to challenge HSBC's bid for Midland Bank, of the UK.
Any signal that HSBC's bid might fail is being welcomed, says Mr David Bates
of Asia Equity in London. 'The view in Hong Kong is that they would prefer
HSBC to invest in China,' he added.
This was demonstrated last Wednesday when rumours that HSBC might increase
its Pounds 3.3bn offer knocked 50 points off the Hang Seng index in 15
minutes.
However, the market rallied in the last two days of the week, on Friday
climbing 2 per cent to a record level as investors anticipated the
half-point cut in interest rates that was announced after the close.
A buy program worth Dollars 100m by a US index fund on Thursday boosted
Singapore. The program was the equivalent of an average day's turnover.
Speculation that this week's first-quarter GDP figures would reveal growth
of some 5 per cent, better than expectations, also helped to lift sentiment
later in the week.
After last Thursday's 2 per cent advance was equalled on Monday (the market
was closed on Friday) the Straits Times Industrial index fell back
yesterday, closing 10.32 off at 1,488.65.
South Africa was lifted by the return of institutional investors, who opted
for industrial and mining shares. A rise in the price of gold and platinum
gave additional buoyancy to the market.
A presentation by De Beers, at which the group forecast sales for the first
half of 1992 15 per cent below those of the corresponding 1991 period, was
seen as positive. An earlier prediction had put the fall at between 25 to 35
per cent.
Some analysts, however, expect the South African market to consolidate this
year after the 40 per cent rise in the industrial index last year.
Mexico was depressed by Telmex's first-quarter figures showing an
unspectacular 13 per cent increase in net earnings. Some analysts also noted
that investors were taking profits ahead of the utility's Dollars 1.5bn
offering of American Depositary Shares.
The release of better than expected inflation figures gave a boost to the
Australian market in the second half of the week, the index rising to a
three-month high. A flat inflation figure for the March quarter has fanned
expectations that the government would cut interest rates.
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest listed company, gave a fillip to that market
with the news that it returned to profits in the first quarter after a net
loss of NKr498m for 1991. Another positive signal was given by Elkem, the
metals producer, whose first-quarter results exceeded expectations. The
company also forecast rising demand throughout the rest of 1992.

FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich at 1992 high as Milan
sinks to new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZURICH closed at a new high for the year, while Milan hit a 1992 low, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, anticipating an early end to the public sector strikes, recorded
its first gains in the DAX since April 22. The index advanced 4.35 to
1,732.64 although the FAZ index was 1.29 lower at 698.00. Turnover rose to
DM4.3bn from DM3.8bn.
Retailers were stronger on hopes that a resolution to the strike would mean
a return to normal levels of consumer spending. Estimates have suggested
that sales have fallen by between 20-50 per cent over the last two weeks.
Asko rose DM13 to DM821, Karstadt gained DM11.50 or 1.9 per cent to DM620
and Kaufhof was DM9 firmer at DM495.
Escada, the fashion house, saw the sharpest fall of the day, losing DM81 or
10 per cent to DM430 after forecasting lower 1992 profits.
Schering fell DM5.80 to DM813.70 after reporting a 2 per cent fall in first
quarter profits, due to weaker earnings at its pesticide division. Henkel
shed DM1.50 to DM613 in spite of forecasting a rise in turnover this year.
Lufthansa fell another DM1 to DM146.50, as the strike shut down Frankfurt.
Volkswagen gained DM1.70 to DM380.50 ahead of today's annual report and
Degussa closed at a year's high, up DM9.30 at DM356.50.
PARIS was boosted by Wall Street's overnight record close and hopes of lower
interest rates following the cut in the UK. The CAC-40 index closed up 5.31
at 2,046.93 but turnover was modest at FFr2.4bn ahead of the holiday on
Friday.
Eurotunnel added 70 centimes or 1.8 per cent to FFr39.40 with 1.1m shares
traded on expectations that it would fill the vacancy in the CAC-40 index
following the merger of Hachette and Matra. The packaging companies CMB and
Pechiney International are also contenders for inclusion in the index.
Pechiney International added FFr4.20 or 2 per cent to FFr211.70, while CMB
rose FFr3.50 or 1.9 per cent to FFr188.80.
Hachette and Matra could fall when they resume trading today, on
disappointment at the lack of details on the exchange of existing shares
into shares of the future Matra-Hachette SA.
ZURICH advanced to a new high for the year, with Roche taking the limelight.
The SMI index gained 12.8 to 1,920.5, but off an intra-day high of 1,926.4.
Roche, which reported a 26 per cent rise in first quarter group sales, saw
its certificates gain SFr50 to SFr3,300 while its bearers shed SFr70 to
SFr4,380. The group said it intends to issue American Depositary Receipts
for its certificates.
Swissair bearers advanced SFr8 to SFr750 after reporting a 5 per cent
increase in first quarter earnings, while Baloise certificates advanced
SFr165 to SFr2,120 after Monday's announcement that it was to swap
certificates for shares. Its registered shares fell SFr90 to SFr2,200.
MILAN closed at a new 1992 low as hopes for a technical correction came to
nothing. The Comit index fell 4.03 to 492.18 in turnover estimated at near
Tuesday's L129bn.
Analysts said that while a temporary recovery was still likely, the outlook
for the market was far from encouraging. The increased political and
economic risks had not yet been discounted, and there were also fears that
the market would sink under the weight of new paper if the state holding
company, Iri, continued to sell off stakes in state-controlled companies.
Generali dropped L360 to L29,140 ahead of its 1991 results. After the close,
the insurer reported a rise of 8.1 per cent in its parent net profit to
L381bn, which appeared slightly better than expectations. But analysts were
disappointed that Generali had again decided to pay part of the dividend
with Alleanza savings shares.
Stet recovered L28 to L1,927 after its recent slump while Italcementi showed
signs of stabilising, closing L101 lower at L14,822.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index closed 0.6 lower at 129.3.
DSM shed 50 cents to Fl 113.80 in spite of its first quarter profits falling
in line with market expectations. Akzo, which reported strong first quarter
growth last week, gained Fl 1.90 to Fl 161.90.
Nedlloyd advanced Fl 1.90 to Fl 58.20 on a buy note from County NatWest,
while Philips, which reports first quarter results today, weakened 40 cents
to Fl 38.60.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index added 8.2 to 993.7 in turnover of
SKr746m after SKr549m.
Procordia B-restricted shares closed SKr3 higher at SKr196 and Volvo's
B-restricted climbed SKr2 to SKr412, after last night's announcement that
Procordia had called off its bid to take over the vehicle group.
MADRID was stronger in moderate turnover of some Pta11bn. The general index
rose 0.12 to 249.17.
Tubacex gained Pta39 or 14.6 per cent to Pta305 on news that Paribas, the
French bank, was to take a stake in the steel manufacturer.
OSLO gained ground on renewed hopes of economic recovery. The all-share
index closed up 5.64 at 455.12 in turnover of NKr708m.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine lock-out to hit Canadian
coal exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S BIGGEST coal mine will halt export shipments later this week after
locking out 1,100 members of the United Mine Workers of America trade union.
Westar Mining, which owns the Balmer mine in south-east British Columbia,
closed the mine at the end of last week within hours of a vote by union
members to reject a management contract offer.
A Westar official said that the mine had low stocks at the time of the
lock-out. A shipment of coal for Korea, expected to be loaded in Vancouver
by the end of this week, will be the last until the mine reopens. The
official said, however, that shipments from Westar's Greenhills mine will
continue without interruption.
Balmer exports almost its entire output of 6m tonnes a year. About
two-thirds of the total is sold to steel mills in Korea, Japan and Taiwan,
but the mine has customers in about a dozen other countries as well.
Workers at the mine have been without a contract since the end of last year.
Westar has demanded a two-year wage freeze and numerous changes in work
practices to bring down costs as part of efforts to tackle its severe
financial problems.
Westar, which suffered a CDollars 6.4m (Pounds 3m) first-quarter loss, has
been talking to lenders about rescheduling its CDollars 330m debt. It missed
an interest payment due last week, and has warned that the Balmer mine
cannot survive without concessions from banks and workers.
The British Columbian government earlier this week sent an industrial
relations mediator to Balmer. Even if his efforts are successful however,
the mine is expected to remain closed for at least another two weeks.

TURKEY IS considering a project to pipe natural gas from the impoverished
Central Asian republic of Turkmenistan for domestic use and exports to
Europe, reports Reuter from Ankara.
Turkish businessmen voiced enthusiasm for the scheme.
'A gas pipeline is the most important project to improve our trade relations
with Turkmenistan because it would create huge off-set possibilities,' said
Mr Nihat Gokyigit, head of Tekfen Holding, a big engineering and contracting
group.
Turkish officials said there would be further talks about possible gas and
oil pipelines at a summit meeting of ex-Soviet Moslem republics, Iran and
Turkey in Ashkhabad, capital of Turkmenistan, on Sunday.
Ankara and Tehran have been discussing a pipeline to export Iranian gas
through Turkey for years, but have not gone ahead.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, said in Ashkhabad last week
that Turkmenistan had massive gas reserves. 'Its prosperity depends on
producing and selling it.' He has offered Turkmenistan export credits worth
Dollars 75m and soft loans for food purchases.

London robusta COFFEE showed no sign of any major reversal in the downward
trend, with charts pointing towards lower values. Sentiment on fundamentals
is bearish - heavy sales are expected from producers such as Indonesia
during the next few weeks. The nearby July contract recovered to Dollars 716
a tonne after falling to a fresh 22-year low of Dollars 712 in early
trading. The premium for cash ZINC widened further on the LME, reflecting
the tightness of nearby supplies. The increasing tightness helped to reverse
the early downward drift in forward prices, with three-month metal
recovering from a Dollars 1,281 low to close at Dollars 1,290.50 a tonne,
down just Dollars 2. Generally base metals business has been slow to pick up
after the holiday weekend, dealers said. However, May option declarations
today could spark interest in copper and aluminium. SILVER moved ahead on
the London bullion market on positive technicals and renewed confidence in
the pace of US economic recovery. On Comex analysts felt that silver was
gearing up for another upward run after breaking key resistance levels at
midday.

pulp project

NORTH BROKEN Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, yesterday shelved
plans for a major pulp mill in Tasmania after legislation guaranteeing
access to timber was defeated in Parliament.
Mr Peter Wade, managing director, said the mill would not proceed without
acceptable resource security legislation and the strong and active support
of both major political parties. 'In the apparent absence of these
assurances, no expenditure will take place towards furthering the
development of our project or associated activities,' he said.
Mr Wade said the failure of the project would send a clear signal to the
international investment community about the increasing difficulties faced
by resource development companies in Australia. The proposed paper mill is
the first casualty of the Labor government's failure to win sufficient
opposition support in the federal senate for its controversial Forest
Conservation and Development Bill. The Bill, which would have guaranteed
conditional access to native growth forests for timber industry projects
valued at a minimum of ADollars 100m, was strongly opposed by a coalition of
environmental organisations. However, it was also heavily criticised by many
timber companies for failing to provide guaranteed access to resources for
smaller projects, which are responsible for the majority of timber industry
activity.
As a result, the Bill was opposed by the conservative Liberal/National Party
coalition for offering insufficient assistance to industry, and by the
environmentalist Australian Democrats for offering too much.
The opposition parties combined to defeat the Bill after the failure of
tortuous negotiations with Mr Alan Griffiths, the resources minister and
chief government supporter of resource security. However, the defeat
appeared not to concern Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, who is believed
to have shared environmentalist concerns that the Bill would promote the
destruction of old growth native forests.
Mr Phillip Toyne, executive director of the Australian Conservation
Foundation, said the defeat of the Bill would clear the way for the timber
industry to be placed on an 'ecologically sustainable footing', which would
mean concentrating on plantation timber rather than native forests.

THE GERMAN company Stolberg Ingenierberatung, in association with the
British-based Commodities Research Unit, has won the international tender
for the delicate task of valuing Mineroperu, the Peruvian state-owned
minerals and metals company, writes Sally Bowen in Lima.
The valuation process is expected to take four months after a late May
start, according to Mineroperu officials. Only the company's four sites
which have fixed assets are included in the valuation - the copper refinery
at Ilo, the Cerro Verde copper mines and plant near Arequipa, the
Cajamarquilla electrolytic zinc refinery in the province of Lima and the
vast gold deposits of San Antonio de Poto, Peru's largest. Mineroperu's many
deposits with development projects attached are at present not included in
any valuation. But Mineroperu will be promoting international interest in
all of them, with special emphasis on a scaled-down development project for
the Antamina copper deposits, at next week's mining fair, Expomin, in
Santiago.
The Bayovar phosphates deposits with a 1m-tonne capacity plant are also a
Mineroperu promotion priority. 'Although theoretically the deposits have
passed to the region, Mineroperu has the know-how to contact interested
foreign investors,' said Mr Luis Cohello, Mineroperu's projects manager.
Joint ventures with Mineroperu are a distinct possibility in some cases  -
with San Antonio de Poto, there has been 'much interest and several
preliminary conversations', according to Mr Cohello. There are also Peruvian
mining sector rumours that US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation is
interested in acquiring the Ilo refinery, which processes much of its copper
blister.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian phosphates offer rich
pickings - A plan to let foreign investors take charge of exploitation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE uncompromisingly barren Sechura desert of northern Peru, where the
only relief from moonscape scenery is provided by an occasional scrubby
carob tree, lie potentially rich pickings for the astute and adventurous
investor. Bayovar, discovered by the International Petroleum Corporation way
back in 1964, is one of the world's three principal phosphate-bearing
regions - and for the first time in 20 years, Peru is prepared to let
foreigners take charge of its exploitation.
The investor should not get too excited about the installations - like the
scenery, they look unpromising. The road leading to the principal deposit,
with reserves estimated at 273m tonnes by Kaiser, the American mining
company, was largely washed away in 1983's unprecedented flooding and there
has never been the money to repair it. Any one following a map to the site
marked 'Bayovar mine' is likely to end up digging his jeep out of drifting
sands.
The processing plant, more accessibly situated at the water's edge close by
Petroperu's northern oil pipeline terminal, looks irremediably obsolete and
rusty. Yet the machinery, valued at Dollars 2m, keeps clanking and whirring
away to produce some 75,000 tonnes of simple concentrate a year.
The mining process is uncomplicated. Bulldozers scoop the 'rock' (in fact it
looks more like compressed sand and crumbles easily) from the
still-operational smaller quarry while 15-tonne trucks line up to transport
it the 20 km (12 miles) to the plant. Basic sorting, crushing, filtration
and drying produces a concentrate with up to 31 per cent PO (in the mine the
phosphate concentration is between 17 and 22 per cent).
Phosphate is an environmentally-friendly fossil-based fertiliser, much used
in New Zealand for enriching pasture-land. Bayovar has exported to New
Zealand for the past three years - last year's record shipments totalled
28,000 tonnes and 60,000 tonnes are ordered for this year. Another 35,000
tonnes will go to Chile and Australia, while Brazil is, as yet, a promising
but largely unexplored potential purchaser.
Bayovar's production costs are about Dollars 26 a tonne. Currently transport
to the port of Paita, 170 km to the north, for export shipment adds an
uneconomic Dollars 14 to the fob price. But a contract signed in late
February between the Grau region (now owners of the deposits) and Cefoisa, a
Lima-based construction company, will provide within months a loading quay
cutting plant-to-ship costs to Dollars 1.85 a tonne. That is when the
phosphates export business becomes profitable.
Cefoisa signed in late February a novel contract with the regional
authorities that could be a model for future semi-privatised exploitation
arrangements. Effectively, the Lima company is leasing the plant and
deposits initially for a two-year period. In return, the region will receive
13 per cent of gross sales and 43 per cent of the profits. Together this
should provide in excess of Dollars 2.3m over two years for the
cash-strapped regional government.
The major advantage to the company is that there is almost no capital
outlay. Cefoisa takes over the plant and the 44 workers and engineers
currently on Bayovar's books, adding a couple of its own people to watch
over company interests. Bulldozers and trucks for shifting and transporting
phosphates are contracted from outside companies.
Cefoisa's confidence about the prospects for making money is illustrated by
the fact that it was prepared to take a loss of Dollars 1.22 on each tonne
exported from Paita in March so as not to lose its New Zealand and Chilean
customers.
Yet more attractive, however, is the prospect of superphosphate production.
Addition of sulphuric acid to the phosphoric rock - in a ratio of 1: 1 for
triple superphosphates, 0.65: 1 for single) enables plants to absorb the
fertiliser more easily.
Triple superphosphates sell internationally at between Dollars 300 and
Dollars 350 a tonne, a handsome profit margin over estimated costs of
Dollars 56.
A typically grandiose Mineroperu scheme to attract the large investor
envisages extraction of 7m tonnes of phosphoric rock a year to produce 1.3m
tonnes of single superphosphate, or 870,000 tonnes of triple. This would,
according to an estimate by officials of the state minerals' company,
involve investment of Dollars 180m or Dollars 300m respectively.
But the canny investor might prefer to start on a smaller scale. Last year
Bayovar sold some 24,000 tonnes of concentrates to three Lima chemicals
companies for transformation to superphosphates. Company production director
Mr Cristobal Velazquez, who has 18 years experience at Bayovar, says that he
could start producing superphosphates on site with investment not exceeding
Dollars 5m.
Inadequate supply of sulphuric acid has traditionally been a major deterrent
to the move into value-added domestically-produced fertiliser  - in addition
to the disincentive of constantly shifting government policies on subsidies
for imported fertilisers. But alongside the excess sulphuric acid production
of the state-owned refineries at Cajamarquilla and La Oroya, there is now
the prospect of additional production from Southern Peru Copper Corporation.
Under a recent agreement with the Peruvian government, SPCC is committed to
the swift installation of a partial capture acid plant to cut pollution at
the company's smelter in the southern port of Ilo. SPCC complains that the
project is a financial loss-maker all the way - but its planned production
of 155,000 tonnes annually could provide the basis for an interesting foray
into superphosphates.
According to the Peruvian ministry of mines, President Fujimori discussed
the future of Bayovar with potential investors on his mid-March trip to
Japan. Local rumours say that Kaiser may also be interested in
re-establishing its links with Bayovar and attempting exploitation of
currently abandoned Area II - if the flooding problems caused by its
position 23 metres below sea level can be resolved.

A gold prospecting scheme developed by the Brazilian government will use
funds from a group of domestic and multinational mining companies to
undertake a study in the state of Minas Gerais, writes Bill Hinchberger.
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce will spearhead the Dollars 1.2m effort through
its prospecting subsidiary Docegeo. CVRD will contribute Dollars 675,000 to
the project and RTZ of the UK another Dollars 200,000. Other participants
are West Mining, Morro Velho, Comig and Mineracao Sao Bento. The study,
called the Rio das Velhas Project, was developed by the National Department
of Mineral Production.
According to Mr Armando Alvares de Campos Cordeiro, general manager of the
southern region for Docegeo, this will be the first such joint
government/private prospecting effort.

Salobo copper joint venture
</HEADLINE>

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANHIA VALE do Rio Doce, Brazil's state controlled mining company, is in
the final stages of negotiations on a joint venture to exploit the
1.2m-tonne copper deposit at Salobo, in the Carajas region, in the state of
Para, in the Amazon.
The partnership is likely to include one foreign company, a private
Brazilian mining company and CVRD. The goal is to establish an operation
that would both be privately controlled and leave a majority of capital in
Brazilian hands, said Mr Rubens Lima Bandeira, general manager for project
development at CVRD.
The official declined to name the companies involved in the negotiations but
said that a hypothetical arrangement would give a 30 per cent share to the
foreign partner and 30 per cent to a private Brazilian company. CVRD would
retain 30 per cent, and the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) 10
per cent. Under the terms of a 1985 agreement, CVRD now has the rights to
two-thirds of Salobo's minerals and BNDES the other third.
Mr Bandeira said the mine should be in operation by the end of 1995. 'The
copper market isn't very favourable right now,' he admitted, 'but in the
second half of the decade it will be. So we have to begin implementation
this year.'
CVRD estimates that open pit operations for the first 15 years will result
in an annual yield of 242,000 tonnes of concentrate with a 38 per cent
copper content, or 92,000 tonnes of metal. Salobo's gold and silver deposits
are also significant. CVRD expects to extract four to five tonnes of gold
and 15 tonnes of silver annually.
An investment of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 425m will be needed to
initiate production. New spending can be kept to a minimum because the mine
will have access to infrastructure, including a railway and electricity
capacity, already installed for CVRD's iron ore operations in Carajas.
The Salobo copper deposit was discovered in 1976. In addition to normal
viability studies, CVRD was forced to undertake additional research to
address concerns expressed by potential buyers about the material's peculiar
characteristics. In particular, many were worried about its low sulphur
content, which they believed would hinder its heat generating capacity in
furnaces.
A study by Mr Paulo Mazoni, co-ordinator of research and development
projects for CVRD, found that the unusually high carbon content of the
Salobo material can compensate for the lack of sulphur.

   THE FIRST Taiwanese privatisation
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
offering the first opportunity for foreign investors to invest direct in a
Taiwanese company, rather than through a mutual fund - gets into full swing
this week, with early indications that much of the stock on offer
internationally has already found buyers.
The privatisation of China Steel has been keenly awaited internationally all
year, and there seems little sign at this stage that the transaction will
disappoint its supporters. In all, 18m depository receipts, each
representing 20 shares, have been put on offer to foreign investors, of
which 10.5m receipts have been offered outside the US.
According to one adviser close to the transaction, this non-US portion has
already been fully subscribed, with the roadshow to promote the flotation
only just getting into gear in Europe. The US promotion is due next week.
In all, just over 1bn shares are on offer, 680m of them domestically. At a
current market price of around TDollars 24 each, the privatisation is set to
raise almost USDollars 1bn.
The flow of transactions from Asia looks set to continue in the weeks ahead:
Grasim, an Indian cement and fibre producer, is queueing up to follow in the
wake of Reliance Industries, which is on the brink of pioneering a move by
Indian companies to attract international equity capital, while Kia Steel is
set to join the growing stream of Korean companies with a Dollars 40m
convertible offering.
Not that all the news from Asia has been positive in recent days: political
uncertainty in Thailand led to the suspension last week of the first
international share sale from that country, a Dollars 40m offer of global
depository receipts from Shinawatra, a computer company.
The rating on the long-term debt of Ontario and Ontario Hydro, two of the
international bond market's most active borrowers, was cut by US rating
agency Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday in reaction to its budget announcement
last week. The ratings of both entities - which between them borrowed about
CDollars 10bn last year - was lowered from AA+ to AA.

PIONEER GROUP, the US based investment fund, is to launch Poland's first

Mr John Cogan, Pioneer's president, said the venture will be investing
Poles' savings in local equities on the country's fledgling stock exchange

Pioneer has also applied for permission from the NBP, the central bank, to
invest 10 per cent of the fund's assets abroad.
Poland's state owned PKO bank will be responsible for the distribution of
the units for the fund which is called the Pioneer 1st Polish Trust Fund.
Mr Cogan is looking for Poles to deposit some Dollars 50m in the fund within
the first 12 months but he admits that demand at the moment is 'absolutely
unknown'. Pioneer will limit its investments in any one company on the stock
exchange to 10 per cent.
At present the Warsaw bourse trades in stocks of 13 companies with a capital

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Citicorp turns to dollar floating-rate
note sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUPINE body of the dollar floating-rate note market gave another twitch
yesterday as Citicorp became the second US bank holding company this year to
raise funds - a clear sign, according to some, that the market was coming
back to life.
Citicorp itself, coming on the heels of BankAmerica in February, had not
been to the market for five years. Indeed, it had not been to any public
debt market for five years, thanks to the credit concerns that had hit the
US banking sector in general, and Citicorp (which has an A2 rating from
Moody's) in particular.
The signs of a recovery in the US banking sector, though, have brought the
banks back to the public markets, with Citicorp this year already having
raised Dollars 150m through a domestic subordinated debt issue and Dollars
175m in preference share capital. It's arrival yesterday in the Euromarkets
signalled a further return to acceptability in the eyes of the investing
public, with the  7/8 percentage point spread over Libor offered on its
two-year, Dollars 150m deal generally regarded as fair.
At that level, Citicorp offers a higher yield pick-up than BankAmerica's
Dollars 200m issue earlier this year. That five-year transaction came with a
50 basis point spread over 3-month Libor, a level at which it is still
trading, though BankAmerica is considered a more attractive name in the
market.
Despite Citicorp's disappearance from the public market, it has maintained
an almost permanent presence in the medium-term note market. Its reason now
for going public: the tighter yield spread, thanks to the perceived
marketability of a public issue (though much of the two-year paper is
expected to be locked up until maturity by investors looking for the higher
yield). According to one estimate, it would have had to pay 95-100 basis
points over Libor by issuing MTNs. Despite the favourable reaction to
Citicorp yesterday, though, it will take rather longer for the floating-rate
note market to be declared fully open once again to US banks.
A floater of a different kind emerged yesterday from HMC, the UK mortgage
lender. Its Pounds 140m asset-backed issue is only the second this year from
a UK mortgage company, thanks to the depressed state of the housing market.
At a spread of 58 basis points over Libor for investors, the HMC deal -
expected to get a AAA rating, thanks to the structured nature of the
transaction - was also considered fairly priced and was said to have met
firm demand from UK and continental European investors.
The Republic of Turkey is set to come to the international bond market later
this week with its first Ecu transaction, led by Paribas Capital Markets.
The Ecu150m, three-year deal is expected to offer a spread of 180-200 basis
points over Libor when swapped.

AMERADA HESS, the independent US oil and gas group, is hoping to raise more
than Dollars 400m by way of a share issue to finance projects including its
share in a North Sea oil field.
The company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) that it will offer 10m common shares, of which 8m will be available in
the US. Goldman Sachs will manage the US offer and the international
portion.
Based on yesterday's share price of Dollars 41 7/8 , the issue of 10m shares
would raise Dollars 418.75m.
In the SEC filing the company said it would use proceeds from the issue to
repay part of debt related to major projects. Among these projects is Hess's
commitment to develop its share of the Scott Field in the North Sea.

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank, is planning to launch an issue of
profit-participating certificates with options attached.
These 'Optionsgenusscheine' will have a nominal value of DM1.5bn (Dollars
937m) and the pricing and other details will be announced later this month.
The bank said yesterday that the proceeds would be used to refinance the
bank's long-term business at the same time as strengthening its capital
base, already the strongest in Germany with pure equity capital standing at
around 6 per cent of total assets.
Each new Genusscheine will have a nominal value of DM1,000. The issue will
have a maturity of 12 years and a coupon of 8.75 per cent, and the option
will entitle the holder to buy two new Deutsche Bank shares.
Genusscheine are a hybrid between debt and equity which are treated as Tier
Two Capital by the Bank for International Settlements and Regular Liable
Capital by German regulatory authorities.
They are a popular with German banks as no tax has to be paid on the
interest, and Commerzbank said last month that is planning a similar issue
as well as a full equity rights issue later in the year.

ITT, the US conglomerate, said yesterday it had authorised a new share
buyback programme, covering up to 25m shares.
The company started the previous repurchase programme in 1987, and has
bought in 20.3m ordinary shares and 1.2m preferred shares to date.
Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman, told the annual meeting that shareholders
would 'see a good deal of action intended to accomplish our goal of a better
share price'. According to agency reports, he said the restructuring moves
should simplify the company and improve its focus.
Shares in ITT rallied earlier this year after it announced it was selling
its remaining 30 per cent stake in Alcatel, the French telecommunications
group, to partner Alcatel Alsthom, and following publication of an interview
with Mr Araskog in the Financial Times.
This quoted Mr Araskog as saying the company wanted to make itself more
exciting to investors. ITT later denied that spinning off its Hartford
insurance company as a separate unit was a likely option.

NET profits at STET, the holding company for Italy's state-owned
telecommunications interests, increased by 3.4 per cent last year to
L1,413bn (Dollars 1.14bn).
Group sales rose by 15 per cent to L22,946bn thanks to continuing
improvements at most subsidiaries. Among the companies STET controls are
SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, and Italcable, which handles most
international telephone traffic.
The group is paying an unchanged dividend of L100 for ordinary shares and
L120 for savings shares.
STET's good results may have helped to arrest the apparent free fall in its
share price following the announcement late last week that IRI, the state
holding company which controls the group, was planning to dilute its stake.
The secondary sale of stock could raise up to L1,800bn. Shares in STET
staged a mixed recovery yesterday, with ordinary stock rising by L28 to
L1,927, while savings shares fell by L25 to L1,745.
STET has signed an agreement with Bell Atlantic of the US to set up a joint
venture in Italy to develop software for telecommunications for both
companies.

FOUR European futures and options exchanges yesterday signed a co-operation
agreement which could lead to wider international distribution of listed
derivative financial products.
The Amsterdam-based European Options Exchange, OM Group, which has exchanges
in both London and Stockholm, and the Swiss Options and Financial Futures
Exchange (Soffex) signed the agreement in London. The members of the
alliance, known as First European Exchanges (Fex), hope to offer local
access to derivative financial products developed in other countries. For
example, the OMX index of Swedish equities could be traded from Amsterdam.
A number of cross-listing agreements between national exchanges are already
in place. For example, EOE has co-operation agreements on the cross-listing
of products with the American Stock Exchange in New York and with several
other European exchanges. Its biggest 'exported' product is the Eurotop 100
share index, which tracks equity prices across the continent.
However, until now such deals have stopped short of full fungibility:
although futures or options contracts have the same specifications on each
exchange, trading is separate and prices can differ between exchanges. The
Fex alliance hopes to offer fully fungible access to contracts by developing
technology links and sharing market information.
The three exchanges together attract an average daily trading volume of
around 140,000 contracts, similar to the turnover of the London
International Financial Futures Exchange or the Matif, the Paris exchange,
which are Europe's biggest derivatives markets. However, there is a trend
for business to become concentrated in the larger exchanges. The
participants in Fex said yesterday they expected more European exchanges to
join the alliance.
The agreement is the first step towards a fully fledged alliance. The
individual exchanges will research local demand for each other's financial
products and examine the potential for developing common dealing systems.

<TEXT>
GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance group, raised net profits by 8.4 per
cent to L380.6bn (Dollars 308.4m) last year, despite the continuing
difficulties in the domestic insurance industry.
Premium income went up by 15.5 per cent to L7,222bn in 1991. Premiums from
Italy rose by 13.4 per cent to L4,483bn, while those generated abroad rose
19.2 per cent to L2,740bn.
Preliminary figures at group level suggested earnings would be 'appreciably'
over the L467.8bn made in 1990, according to the company. Group premiums
rose by 16.4 per cent to reach L18,000bn. Allowing for inter-group
re-insurance business, group premiums rose 17.2 per cent to L16,023bn.
Generali disappointed the stock market by announcing it would once again be
paying its dividend in a mixture of shares in its Alleanza life insurance
subsidiary and cash. This year's pay-out comprises a cash element of L190 a
shares, up from L160 the previous year, and one non-convertible savings
share in Alleanza for every 75 Generali shares currently held. In 1991, the
company gave away one Alleanza share for every 250 Generali shares already
held.
Generali claimed the dividend marked a substantial improvement on the
previous year's pay-out. Based on the value of Alleanza stock on Generali's
balance sheet, the dividend is worth L201 a share, against L177 the previous
year, it said. Calculated using market prices, and adjusted for last year's
big rights issue by Generali, the company claimed the dividend marked an
improvement of almost 25 per cent.
Generali confirmed the continuing expansion in the Italian life insurance
market, while growth on the non-life side had been more contained. Moreover,
claims continued to rise alarmingly, although costs had been kept down, it
said.

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Inco battens down the financial
hatches - The various pressures facing the Canadian nickel producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management upheaval has propelled Mr Michael Sopko to the top of Inco, the
western world's biggest nickel producer, several years ahead of schedule. It
has also put new management in charge of every one of the Canadian group's
primary metal operations.
'These were the middle managers who got us through the recession in the
early 1980s, when some analysts suggested Inco might go belly-up,' Mr Sopko
points out.
Inco is back under financial pressure today. Low metal prices and
uncertainties about the intentions of the Russian nickel producers - the
biggest in the world - are just part of the picture. Inco has also seen its
operating costs rise steeply in the past four years.
Mr Ray Goldie, analyst at Richardson Greenshields, a Canadian stockbroker,
estimates that, whereas in 1989 it cost Inco only USDollars 81 to mine a
tonne or ore, last year it cost Dollars 105 and in 1992 it will be Dollars
116.
Meanwhile, the price Inco realised on its nickel has fallen from Dollars
5.61 a lb to Dollars 2.72.
There is little Inco can do about the nickel price. So Mr Sopko sees as his
top priority 'our urgent need to lower the cost of production.'
He was appointed president of Inco only a year ago. In normal circumstances
an Inco president would expect to spend some years in that role before
getting a stab at the top job. But in December Mr Don Phillips surprisingly
announced he was to retire in April this year and Mr Sopko was named as his
successor as chairman and chief executive.
During his brief term as president, Mr Sopko restructured the management at
Inco's Ontario division in Canada, its biggest, replacing four
vice-presidents with three new ones. He also reduced the number of managers
to five fromseven and three of the five are new appointees. The new
management team was instructed to cut costs by 20 per cent in the next three
to four years.
Mr Sopko is the first Canadian-born chairman of Inco in the history of the
Toronto-based company which celebrated its ninetieth anniversary in March.
He is the son of Czechoslovakian immigrants and a metallurgical engineer who
graduated from McGill University in 1960. Now 53, he has spent all his
28-year working life with Inco. He says he was given some opportunities to
shine along the way and took them wholeheartedly. But he suggests there are
half a dozen other managers at Inco who could do his job 'and the important
thing is to be the right person in the right place at the right time.
'I replace a marketing man. Having a production person in place now that
production costs have to be cut makes sense. People are selected according
to the corporation's needs at the time.'
Since his appointment was announced, Inco has been battening down the
hatches. At present nickel prices it is breaking-even at best. It has cut
planned capital expenditure this year to the bare minimum - only Dollars
280m compared with the Dollars 350m scheduled last autumn and the Dollars
440m spent in 1991.
The group, which had a cash shortfall of Dollars 172m last year, has also
saved money by issuing shares in part payment of its contribution to the
employee pension scheme.
Debt at the end of last year was Dollars 1.26m, giving Inco a debt-equity
ratio of 42-58. Mr Sopko says he does not want it to rise further and aims
to return it to the 35-65 level as quickly as possible. He and other members
of the Inco board have been talking to the credit rating agencies because
Inco treasures its investment-grade rating. Which explains why the dividend
has not been cut - but neither has it been lifted since 1989.
Mr Sopko insists Inco's financial pressures have to be seen in perspective.
Although the company was criticised in some quarters for giving away too
much during recent past pay negotiations, production costs since 1987 have
risen only 15 to 16 per cent because of employment costs. Fully one third of
the rise was caused by lower ore grades (less recoverable metal in the ore)
and lower tonnage because some Inco mines are nearing the end of their lives
and their replacements are not yet ready. A strong Canadian dollar also made
an impact and, because Inco's capital spending has been very high,
depreciation and amortisation costs have risen sharply.
As the group's investment in new mines begins to pay off, costs will fall
when tonnages metal yields improve, he points out. Inco's biggest investment
 -a Dollars 520m, six-year project to reduce dramatically sulphur dioxide
emissions at its Sudbury metallurgical complex - is nearly complete. This
investment will bring savings of about Dollars 20m this year and by 1994 an
annual Dollars 80m.
Mr Sopko suggests demand for nickel will grow at least by an annual 2 to 3
per cent, so nickel will remain Inco's core business. 'We intend to be the
lowest-cost producer and maintain our one-third market share.'
That share makes Inco market leader, 'and enables us to do things others
can't - better research and better products'. It also gives Inco credibility
with customers who are therefore more likely to 'join us in our long-term
plans'. Already 80 per cent of Inco's annual nickel output is spoken for by
long-term contracts and sales to its downstream operations.
And, even with a production person in charge, Inco's financial goal remains
a 15 per cent return on equity averaged out over the economic cycle.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FERNANDO Collor, president of Brazil, yesterday appointed a new head at
Petrobras, the state oil monopoly and one of Latin America's largest
companies. Mr Benedito Moreira will be the company's fifth president in just
over two years and 27th in its 39-year history.
The dismissal of his predecessor, Mr Ernesto Weber, has been expected ever
since a cabinet reshuffle last month and the launch of a police
investigation into the company for alleged manipulation of contract bids and
misuse of its pension fund. Three directors were sacked last month.
In an interview with foreign correspondents last Thursday Mr Weber joked: 'I
am already getting old in the job - I have held it for eight months.'
The news of Mr Weber's sacking came as he prepared to fly to Houston to
receive the oil industry's top offshore technology award for the company's
deep sea drilling operations. His trip was cancelled.
Five new directors were appointed yesterday along with the 61-year-old Mr
Moreira who is the former head of the extinct Export Registration Bureau.
The new minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Marcus Pratini de Moraes, said
that Mr Moreira's appointment would mark a new phase in Petrobras
operations.
The company, which has long been subject to heavy political interference, is
expected to be given more autonomy as it prepares to confront possible
competition.
In an interview with Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's leading financial journal,
Mr Moreira described Petrobras as 'rather worn-out' and said he would give
more priority to increasing the company's international operations.

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Group that likes to take the
plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement that Sappi will pay DM400m to buy a 90 per cent stake in
Hannover Papier, the German pulp and paper company, is the latest in a
series of deals by the South African paper group.
Coming on top of a R1.1bn (Dollars 380m) rights issue last October, the
equity financing of the Hannover transaction will increase Sappi's equity
base by 50 per cent in the course of a year. However, the company, part of
the Gencor group, has a history of taking deep breathes and plunging in.
The Ngodwana mill, built in 1982 for R1.3bn, remains the largest industrial
investment undertaken by a private company in South Africa.
It then cost 50 per cent more than the company's total assets. In July 1988,
Sappi paid over R1bn to buy Saiccor, the world's single largest dissolving
pulp producer, and the Usutu pulp mill, from Courtaulds. The purchase of
five UK mills in 1990 was, at R500m, a large deal.
Mr Eugene Van As, executive chairman of Sappi, concedes the Hannover deal
was larger than what Sappi was looking for, but he says it was too good to
walk away from. He adds that with the industry at the bottom of the
commodity cycle, there are many assets for sale, but none of comparable
quality to Hannover.
The deal is certainly a watershed for Sappi. As Mr Van As comments: 'Sappi
becomes quite an interesting animal in South Africa. We're no longer a South
African company with a bit of exports.'
After the Hannover deal roughly two thirds of Sappi's revenues and profits
will come from exports and the activities of Sappi's non-South African
subsidiaries. Few other South African industrial companies can make this
claim. About 60 per cent of Hannover's sales are D-Mark denominated, the
balance is sales into Europe.
This should make Sappi attractive for local investors who attach a premium
to rand hedge shares - those where a portion of earnings is non-Rand
denominated, thus offering protection from a depreciating currency.
Even better, Mr Van As notes, is that Sappi will also offer an assets hedge.
Sappi consolidates all its controlled subsidiaries outside of South Africa,
and the Hannover transaction appears not only to be cheap, but to offer
considerable synergies. Mr Van As says they are acquiring a plant with the
latest technology at an estimated 40 per cent discount to the replacement
value of the assets.
The transaction comes fairly heavily geared, with borrowings of DM370m.
Sappi is confident this will be reduced to zero by 1996, assisted by
Hanover's powerful cash flow.
Sappi is not sitting still on the local front. The Saiccor plant is being
expanded at a cost of about R900m, while the group is considering
investments of R500m at the Tugela and Enstra operations.
While Sappi's earnings performance in recent years has not been spectacular
 -in the last economic cycle, from 1983 to 1990, compound growth in earnings
per share was 18 per cent - management is confident the group will perform
strongly in the next upturn.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROSSINGTON Holdings, Sir Ron Brierley's vehicle for a bid for Australian
Consolidated Investments (Acil) yesterday increased its offer to 23.5 cents
a share from 23 cents, and dropped a series of conditions.
Rossington, jointly owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand and GPG,
Sir Ron's UK company, extended the bid to May 22 in a statement filed with
the Australian Stock Exchange.
The revised offer values Acil at ADollars 130.17m, (USDollars 98.6m) but is
still well below the valuation of 33 cents a share placed on the company by
Acil directors, who have urged shareholders to reject the bid.
Rossington's decision to make the bid unconditional follows claims by Acil
that shareholders controlling about 60 per cent of Acil stock would reject
the bid unless the conditions were dropped.
However, Rossington has begun legal proceedings to block Acil's proposed
flotation of its 95.6 per cent holding in Weeks Petroleum, an Australian oil
company.
Rossington's initial bid was conditional on the abandonment of Acil's plans
to sell its 50 per cent holding in National Brewing Holdings, formerly Bond
Brewing, to Lion Nathan of New Zealand.
Acil and Lion Nathan said on Monday the New Zealand brewer had exercised a
call option to acquire the stake, and indicated the transaction would be
completed by the end of the month.
About 40 per cent of Acil is owned by companies formerly controlled by Mr
Alan Bond, the bankrupt entrepreneur. A further 19.9 per cent is owned by
the Adelaide Steamship group, which is being reconstructed by its banks.
Sir Ron said the real value of Acil shares was about 25 cents, depending on
'the ultimate wash up of (Acil's) many messy legacies from the Bond and
Adsteam eras'.
He said shareholders were unlikely to receive a better offer than the
Rossington proposal, and warned they could do 'a lot worse if the company's
legal wrangles continue to proliferate as rapidly as in the past few
months'.

<TEXT>
EDGARS, the clothing and footwear group in the South African Breweries
chain, unveiled an increase in earnings in the year to March, but
significantly underperformed management forecasts.
Sales rose by 11 per cent to R2.75bn (Dollars 950m) but tighter margins saw
operating profit rise by only 6 per cent to R373.2m. Attributable earnings
rose by 5 per cent to R157.5m.
The figures compare with management forecasts, made in July last year, that
sales would rise by 19 per cent and profits by 17 per cent.
Mr Mark Bower, financial director, said that management had not foreseen the
continued stagnation of the gold price, the drought, and continued high
interest rates, all of which hurt consumer spending.
Mr Bower said sales had risen by 17 per cent in the first three months, but
a precipitate decline had set in in September when official figures
indicated sectoral sales dropped by 3.4 per cent. He added that sales in the
first quarter of 1992 had been 'disastrous'.
He forecast sales and earnings growth for the year of about 12 per cent  -
in line with inflation.
Earnings and dividends per share rose 5 per cent, to 310 cents and 119 cents
respectively.

bankers on Thursday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the troubled property developer, is to meet on Thursday with
representatives of its 15 largest creditor banks to outline long-term plans
to restructure its Dollars 12bn debt.
At the meeting, to be held in London, O&amp;Y will for the first time give the
banks details of how much interest it would like them to defer and how long
it would like them to wait for interest and principal payments.
O&amp;Y said it would provide the banks with a five-year business plan. It said
it expected banks would find 'the plans reasonable' and a basis for further
negotiation.
Until now, O&amp;Y has only provided banks with details of how much money it
needs to borrow to keep operating for the next 90 days.
The company has been finding it difficult to raise funds for its short-term
requirements in Canada and at Canary Wharf, the office development in east
London.
Providers of around Dollars 5bn of loans to O&amp;Y's parent company and close
subsidiaries are expected to be asked to make the biggest sacrifices.
Interest and principal could be deferred to the end of the decade.
Of the Dollars 5bn, the main facility is a Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to
Olympia &amp; York Resources Credit Corporation which is split into four
portions:
a Dollars 1.25m European tranche, arranged by Credit Lyonnais of France and
Germany's Commerzbank, each of which are thought to hold Dollars 250m;
a Dollars 750m Asian portion, all of which is said by bankers to have been
provided by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation;
Dollars 250m provided by Royal Bank of Canada;
Dollars 250m provided by Daichi Kangyo Bank, the biggest Japanese bank.
All these banks are expected to be represented at Thursday's meeting. Also
expected to attend are Citicorp of the US, Barclays of the UK, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Nova Scotia. They will act as
representatives of all 100 of O&amp;Y's banks.
The disclosure of the size of Hongkong Bank's exposure will embarrass that
bank, given that it is in the middle of a battle with the UK's Lloyds Bank
for control of Midland Bank. Yesterday Hongkong Bank refused to confirm or
deny that it was holding all Dollars 750m.
The meeting will be addressed by Mr Steve Miller, the investment banker from
James D Wolfenson Inc in charge of O&amp;Y's bank negotiations, and by Mr Gerald
Greenwald, who was recently made president and deputy chief executive of
O&amp;Y.
Bankers said they hoped Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's founder, would attend the
meeting. However, an O&amp;Y spokesman said he did not know whether Mr Reichmann
would be there.

CONSOLIDATED sales of Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, rose 26 per
cent in the first quarter, to SFr3.3bn (Dollars 2.17bn), Mr Fritz Gerber,
chairman, said yesterday.
However he warned that the growth rate was inflated by a sharp decline in
the Swiss franc against the dollar, and by the abnormally weak performance
during the comparative period because of the Gulf war.
In local currencies, the sales growth rate was 17 per cent.
Roche revealed detailed accounts for 1991 showing that financial gains
contributed almost all of the 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
SFr2.04bn.
Mr Gerber said growth in operating profits was so strong that the group
decided to spend heavily on pre-marketing of new drugs. Marketing and
selling expenses jumped 20 per cent to SFr2.5bn. The group's research and
development costs also rose 20 per cent, partly reflecting the higher level
of research spending of Genentech, the US biotechnology group in which Roche
bought a 60 per cent stake in 1990.
Roche also charged to expenses SFr200m for intangible assets acquired last
year, and SFr62m for the merger costs of its two fragrance subsidiaries,
Givaudan and Roure.
Mr Henri Meier, finance director, said Roche would be in no hurry to change
its capital structure following changes in Swiss law in July making it
illegal to raise capital through dividend right certificates. Roche has
issued 7m such certificates. Mr Meier said he foresaw no need to raise more
capital.
Swissair, Switzerland's national airline, said first-quarter revenues rose
5.3 per cent, while costs increased 4.9 per cent. The load factor dropped
visibly because of the deployment of new aircraft, and budget targets were
not met. Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive, said the group was prepared to cut
costs further.

DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit tumbled 43.8 per cent in the
1992 first quarter, reflecting lower profit margins in hydrocarbons and
polymers, its biggest division.
Net profit fell sharply to Fl 100m (Dollars 54m) from Fl 178m a year
earlier, when business was already weak because of the Gulf war. The
first-quarter result was, however, up 12 per cent from the second half of
1991.
Turnover declined 6 per cent to Fl 2.43bn, with a 9 per cent increase in
volume sales only partially compensating for the average 15 per cent drop in
selling prices. Acquisitions accounted for about half the increase in volume
sales.
The first-quarter downturn, in line with company's expectations, was due to
narrowing profit margins, particularly in hydrocarbons and polymers. DSM
said it could not predict full-year profits because of uncertainty in
worldwide economic recovery and currency movements.
Group operating profit mirrored the development in net profit, falling 43
per cent to Fl 140m from Fl 245m.
DSM's financial charges almost trebled to Fl 32m from Fl 11m a year earlier,
due to an unspecified increase in borrowing. However, the company's tax bill
fell to just Fl 11m from Fl 61m, reflecting a higher percentage of
tax-exempt income in the total result.

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hachette unveils FFr2.8bn rescue
package

HACHETTE, the troubled French publishing and media group, yesterday unveiled
a FFr2.8bn (Dollars 500m) rescue plan and announced it would merge with
Matra, its electronics-to-transport sister company, by the end of the year.
The merger has been a long-held project of Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, who
controls and manages both companies, and has always argued they would be
financially stronger if united. The project, to be completed by the end of
the year or early next, was hastened by Hachette's FFr3.55bn loss on La
Cinq, its television station, which filed for bankruptcy last month, leaving
the media group with debts of FFr8.3bn.
The new group, to be called Matra-Hachette, will be quoted and have annual
sales of FFr53bn spread across nine unquoted majority-owned subsidiaries.
Mr Lagardere said the merger would help both its components by allowing cash
to flow easily between them. Stockbroking analysts saw little industrial
logic in the deal, and feared Hachette would draw on Matra's cash-flow to
pay its interest bills, a suggestion strongly denied by Mr Lagardere
yesterday.
Daimler-Benz, the German aerospace and automotive group, and GEC, the
British electronic company, which both hold 4.9 per cent stakes in Matra,
had both been consulted. Their reactions were 'interested and friendly' said
a senior Matra executive.
Hachette's refinancing, which will take place before the Matra merger, will
be handled by Mr Lagardere's main French institutional investors, the
state-owned banks Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais and the state
insurer GAN.
Of the FFr2.8bn package, Hachette is to issue FFr1.3bn of perpetual
subordinated paper - an equity-like instrument popular in France  - ,
FFr600m of convertible bonds, and FFr900m of new ordinary shares. This will
reduce Hachette's debts to FFr5.8bn, said Mr Lagardere.
On top of this, Hachette is planning between FFr1.3bn and FFr1.6bn of asset
sales by the end of the year. It has already begun, with the FFr412m sale,
announced yesterday, of a stake in Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera, the Italian
publisher. Mr Lagardere said Matra was also planning to sell its stake in
Ufim, a car electronics joint venture with Fiat, and was within weeks of
striking an alliance in telecommunications with a 'leading world group'.
Mr Lagardere will simplify the sprawl of holding companies that now exercise
control over the two groups, to arrive at a simple two-step structure. MMB
Holding, a quoted holding group to be headed by Mr Lagardere, will own 40
per cent of Matra-Hachette's equity capital and have 51 per cent of the
voting rights. Mr Lagardere will hold around 10 per cent of MMB's shares.
Although Mr Lagardere's direct stake in Matra-Hachette will be small,
control will be sealed by setting up MMB Holding as a societe en commandite
par actions, a practically takeover-proof partnership in which the partners
have unlimited liability for corporate debts. However, stockbroking analysts
believe the banks will, in practice, exert firm control over the financial
management of the new group.
Among other French-incorporated companies to use the commandite structure
are Michelin, the tyre-maker, Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion and perfumes
group and EuroDisney, the theme park operator.

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Bruised, but back to battle for
a dream - The changing fortunes of Hachette controller Jean-Luc Lagardere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For someone who admitted yesterday he had suffered the worst setback in his
career, the 64-year-old Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, French media and technology
magnate, has bounced back surprisingly well.
A visibly relieved Mr Lagardere announced that his big institutional backers
had agreed to bail out Hachette, the leading French publishing group he
controls, paving the way for him to realise a long-held dream: to merge
Hachette with Matra, the defence, space, telecommunications and transport
combine which he also controls.
The merger will create a powerful FFr53bn diversified group, to be called
Matra-Hachette. It will have 50,000 staff, and be among the French top 20 in
turnover terms.
Mr Lagardere likened it to General Electric, the US group whose interests
range from aerospace to media and banking. The sales split will work out at
57 per cent from Hachette activities, and the remaining 43 per cent from
Matra. There will be nine divisions: distribution, press, book publishing,
audiovisual, telecommunications, defence, space, cars and transport.
Mr Lagardere has persuaded his bankers to save Hachette from what must have
been one of the most expensive peccadilloes in French corporate history.
Moreover, he has - at a price  - gained secure control over the new group.
Matra-Hachette will be controlled by a holding group, MMB Holding, which
will have two managing partners: Mr Lagardere himself, plus Arjil, a
family-controlled holding group managed by senior Hachette and Matra
executives.
Of course, he has paid heavily for the rescue. Mr Lagardere's direct and
indirect stakes in the holding group will nearly halve from 19 per cent to
around 10 per cent as a result of the deal. It is likely that from now on,
the institutions involved will exert strong control over at least the
financial management.
'They could have put Hachette into bankruptcy three months ago, so they
really have strong negotiating power. Now they will want to see some
repayments, and if they want that, they will have to change the way the
group is managed,' says Mr Francois Langlade Demoyen, head of research at
Credit Suisse First Boston France.
Mr Lagardere insists that a commandite structure is quite compatible with
modern demands for quoted companies to be open and transparent, and that the
partners are kept under the pressure of market forces by knowing they are
personally liable for all the group's debts. 'It is the only opportunity for
us to remain independent,' he admits. 'But it's not a blank cheque.'
Mr Lagardere, a perpetually tanned sports enthusiast, turned to a boxing
metaphor to describe his position. 'I have been forced to put my knee to the
ground and people have said that I am KO'd. I say 'no'. I am lifting myself
up quickly to attack the 12th round, not just to finish the match, but to go
on the offensive, to win.' This would, he admitted, be his final bout, but
he would at least be able to pass on the fight with 'complete success'.
Who the new boss will be, when Mr Lagardere hangs up his gloves, is still a
mystery. Mr Lagardere made no secret yesterday of the fact that he would
like to hand on to his only son, Arnaud, 30, who is currently running a
small venture capital unit attached to a bank in the Lagardere empire.
However, the banks will of course have a strong influence on the succession.
Whether the merger will make any practical difference to the fortunes of
Matra and Hachette is a matter of intense scepticism among stockbroking
analysts, who do not understand how a successful company can be born by
shunting together two troubled ones. Indeed, the initial reaction from
brokers in Paris yesterday was that Matra would, if anything, suffer from
being hitched to its cash-hungry partner, and that Hachette would benefit
from tighter management imposed by the banks.
Hachette, the world's fifth largest communications group and the largest
newspaper distributor, lost FFr1.9bn last year - its first deficit in a
decade - because of La Cinq's collapse, and will still have FFr5.8bn of
debts after the refinancing. Matra, which has no debts, saw its net profits
collapse from FFr605m to FFr252m in 1991. Mr Lagardere argues that together
they will be stronger than alone: that cash will be able to circulate freely
where needed; greater diversification will even out sharp swings in
earnings; and administrative economies will be possible.
The greater size and stability of the new group should also make it more
appealing to foreign partners, who in recent years have been an important
part of Mr Lagardere's strategy in defence and electronics. Matra's
telecommunications division is, for example, within weeks of sealing an
alliance with a 'leading world group', he said.
So the initial picture is that Mr Lagardere's banking friends have helped
him save face. Yet just how much control he personally will have over
Matra-Hachette will depend on the highly sensitive negotiations between him
and the banks over the next few months.

FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: SSAB sell-off expected to raise
SKr1.85bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government hopes to raise about SKr1.85bn (Dollars 312.5m) next
month by selling off its controlling stake in SSAB, the state steel company.
The divestment of the 48 per cent of equity, along with 60 per cent of
voting rights, is the first stage in the government's ambitious
privatisation programme which will include 35 Swedish companies.
The SSAB sell-off, which will run between May 19 and June 4, involves an
offer of 126,666 units to buyers. Units will consist of
government-guaranteed risk-free bonds priced at SKr14,800, including
commission, which will be redeemable in January 1994 at a value of
SKr17,000. The units also include warrants entitling the holder to purchase
100 SSAB shares at SKr170 each from January 1993 to February 15 1994. The
bond is expected to generate a guaranteed yield of at least 10 per cent,
less commission.
The Swedish government said that 55,000 of the 126,666 units would be
offered to the general public, with a further 12,000 reserved for SSAB's
employees. The remaining 60,000 units are intended for institutional
investors but foreign interests will only be able to acquire up to a quarter
of those units.
Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, said the offer sought to broaden
private ownership in Sweden. 'The offer should be attractive to private
individuals,' he argued. 'The state offers a risk-free saving with a good
rate of interest with the opportunity of gradually going over from saving in
bonds to saving in shares.'
However, Mr Westerberg added that the method of selling off the state's
stake in SSAB would not necessarily be used in subsequent privatisations.
'Each sale must be assessed according to its own conditions and needs. This
means that each privatisation will be unique as its practical implementation
is concerned,' he said.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Anglian appoints its advisers for flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN GROUP, the double-glazing combine bought out for Pounds 84.5m from
BET in December 1990, has appointed advisers for its planned stock market
flotation which could value it at some Pounds 200m.
NM Rothschild is the merchant bank and James Capel the stockbroker.
The flotation, likely to take place in the summer, comes much sooner after
the buy-out than expected, as the group has achieved record profits despite
the recession.
Anglian is the leading retail double glazing company in the UK with 7-8 per
cent of the market.
The prospectus is expected to show that Anglian made operating profits of
Pounds 22.5m for the year to end-March, compared with about Pounds 15m
When BET sold Anglian it was expected to make trading profits of Pounds 10m
in the 1990-91 financial year. At the time BET bought a Pounds 30m 12 per
cent loan note from Anglian to help finance the buy-out. This was refinanced
in March.
Proceeds of the float will repay the Pounds 30m debt, and Pounds 23m of
preference capital and probably leave the company with some net cash.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jarvis improves in second half but cuts
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME MEASURE of improvement was achieved by Jarvis in the second half, and
for 1991 overall this contracting, construction and property group made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 238,000.
However, that compared with Pounds 1m previously, and the final dividend is
cut to 0.325p for a total of 0.575p, against 2p. Earnings per share were
0.8p (4.2p).
Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, said the construction division did not produce a
satisfactory result. There was a poor performance from the building side,
offset to some extent by a good result from civil engineering and a
reasonable show in products and services.
The building side had to suffer a material reduction in staffing and
overheads to shape it to meet the available opportunities. The substantial
cost of such had been included in the accounts.
The property division made a continuing improvement following further rent
reviews.
At the year-end net borrowings were equivalent to 24 per cent (34 per cent)
of shareholders' funds.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two executive directors of Greenwich Resources, the UK gold mining company,
have resigned because, according to Mr David Quick, managing director, the
company could no longer afford them.
Mr Jan Szymanski, 38, finance director, and Mr Roger Davey, 46, operations
director, would receive compensation payments but 'they will not be huge.'
Mr Quick said full details of the company's financial position would be
given with the interim results in mid-June but he emphasised that Greenwich
was well-funded. 'However, we have been carrying a relatively high office
overhead with four executive directors for a small range of projects.'
Since Mr Quick and Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, took over at Greenwich at the
end of 1988 to sort out a liquidity crisis, the company has dropped projects
in Egypt and the Sudan but continued with some in Venezuela and, on a modest
scale, Greece.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: An institution central to Hong Kong's
existence - The colony's reaction to HSBC's bid for Midland Bank / The
Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank bestrides the colony in a way few institutions of
its type or size could hope to in other parts of the world. It is simply the
single most important financial institution in Hong Kong.
But Hongkong Bank's bid for Midland has divided the colony of which the bank
is uncrowned king. Many of its investors do not like the offer and shudder
at the thought of a higher bid; possible confrontation with China also looms
if the bank is forced to offer more than the one share plus a Pounds 1 bond
for each Midland share it has already offered.
Hong Kong without Hongkong Bank is unthinkable; the Hongkong Bank without
Hong Kong is even more so. Last year, the bank earned 86 per cent, or Pounds
761m, of its pre-tax profits in Hong Kong; the colony accounts for 45 per
cent of its assets.
The bank's chairman, Mr William Purves, sits on the governor's executive
council, the highest policy-making body in the colony. Moreover, Mr Purves
is chairman of the Jockey Club - the focal point for the local Chinese
passion for gambling and the expatriate desire for social position.
Hongkong Bank is also the centre of the banking system in Hong Kong. As an
agent of government it issues banknotes and it also operates the clearing
system. It is the government's chief banker and its position within the Hong
Kong Bankers' Association - the group that sets interest rates and qualifies
new-entrant banks - is pre-eminent.
But the bank is the ultimate power broker where it counts most: the
ownership of assets in Hong Kong.
It delivered Hutchison Whampoa, Hong Kong's first registered company (1866)
and oldest 'hong', to Mr Li Ka Shing in 1979; it bailed out the colony's
shipping magnates during the world shipping crisis of the mid-1980s; and it
is the institution which has done most to support local businessmen such as
Mr Gordon Wu, the principle shareholder of Hopewell Holdings, the large
developer and builder.
Hongkong Bank is a quintessentially management institution. Mr Purves is
all-powerful; he dominates the bank's board and senior management. His
temper is legendary and few risk challenging him, but he displays an unusual
common touch which inspires respect.
Last Tuesday, the day Lloyds said it would bid for Midland, and in between
meetings that went well into the night, he spent 20 minutes with an
executive who was being posted to the Middle East.
In Mr Purves, 61, the bank has a man of extraordinary energy and purpose. He
and his deputy Mr John Grey are highly rated in Hong Kong for their business
acumen. But critics do question whether the bank has the depth in management
to pull off the Midland merger. The bank prides itself on running a 'lean'
operation; its critics say management is thinly spread.
The bank is used to being powerful and it is unaccustomed to having its
views questioned. Locally, its conduct during the bid for Midland has been
criticised for being lacklustre and complacent. The appointment of former
Tory minister, Mr Francis Maude, and a public relations guru, Mr Steven
Sherbourne, was welcomed by its supporters in the colony but seen as coming
a little late in the day.
Given the bank's position in Hong Kong it is not surprising that although
many investors in the colony are deeply disappointed with its bid for
Midland, none will speak out against it. Unlike London, where investor
dissatisfaction with the bid has been aired publicly, no investor who says
privately that he will vote his stock against the bid is willing to declare
himself publicly.
As one long-time head of a large securities and fund management house noted:
'No-one in this town wants to make a permanent enemy of the Hongkong Bank.
Hong Kong is a financial village and sooner or later you are going to bump
up against the bank.'
An FT straw poll of leading fund managers found that about two thirds
thought the bank was making a mistake by buying Midland. These investors
criticise it for embracing the 'flawed' idea of global banking when the
1980s showed that that strategy failed; and, they also criticise it for
diluting high growth north Asia earnings with low growth European earnings.
The remaining investors were positive. They see the deal as a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a cheap entry into European banking.
Midland is at the bottom of its earnings cycle and due for a big recovery.
They believe the bank is also acting in the prudent interests of its
shareholders by diluting the 'China' risk inherent in its current business,
thereby safeguarding shareholders' future interests.
But the bank's restrictions on investors being able to own only 1 per cent
of its equity - something which will change if its bid for Midland succeeds
 -means that many investors feel impotent in the face of what its management
wants to do. Therefore many investors have simply voted with their feet.
The bank's share price fell sharply when it announced its bid for Midland
and has remained below it's pre-bid high of HKDollars 45.50. On the
announcement of its bid terms Hongkong Bank's share price fell to below
HKDollars 38. Subsequently it has risen to about HKDollars 42, but mainly,
investors say, because the entry of Lloyds into the bidding from Midland has
raised shareholders' hopes that Hongkong Bank might fail.
By contrast, Hang Seng Bank, its listed subsidiary, has risen sharply since
its true financial position was revealed at the same time Hongkong Bank
announced the details of its Midland offer. Hang Seng's share price has
doubled since the beginning of March - to about HKDollars 44 - as investors
have switched to it from Hongkong Bank.
All investors were, however, concerned about the possibility that Hongkong
Bank might engage in a bidding war with Lloyds. They forecast widespread
dissatisfaction with such a move. China could also be a problem, they said.
'If the bank raises its bid for Midland, China will not like it,' says one
institutional investor. 'It may speak out against it and it might even
encourage people to vote against it.'
The importance of China to Hongkong Bank is underlined by the bank's
reticence in talking about its dealings with Beijing. It takes pains to keep
China abreast of what it is doing. It even tipped off Beijing to the
possibility of a bid for Midland before Mr Purves made his presentation to
the Midland board on March 13.
Mr Purves usually travels to Beijing three or four times a year, each time
touching base with the People's Bank, China's central bank, and senior
officials of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council -
the arm of the Chinese government most centrally involved with the
transition of the colony to China's rule.
To date China has been neutral-to-positive on the bid for Midland. But it
has urged the bank not to pay more for the British clearer and to safeguard
the interests of its Hong Kong shareholders and customers.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Banks force Betacom to plan rights for up
to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETACOM, the loss-making telephone and answering machine supplier, is
planning a Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m rights issue following pressure from its
bankers who are refusing to provide further capital without a strengthening
of the equity base.
The company, which also announced reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 515,000
(Pounds 2.44m) after exceptionals for the 1991 year, is likely to launch the
cash call before the end of June.
Mr Roger Rowland, who took over as non-executive chairman last year
following the resignation of founder Mr Dennis Baylin, said the rights issue
was crucial to the company's long-term survival.
The share of associates moved from a Pounds 67,000 deficit to a profit of
Pounds 144,000.
The UK division continued to suffer from what Mr Rowland called 'high street
deal-making . . . We had no option but to knock prices down,' he said.
However, losses had been reduced and margins protected through cost-cutting,
he said.
Turnover in the UK dropped by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 11.2m. Including
overseas operations sales increased from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 19.3m.
Interest charges were marginally lower at Pounds 480,000 (Pounds 489,000),
while debt was about Pounds 3m just after the year-end, Mr Rowland said.
Losses per share were reduced from 7.05p to 1.16p.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: WPP still in talks on financial structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in WPP Group, the marketing services combine, fell 5p to 63p
yesterday when the company said it was continuing talks about strengthening
its capital structure and improving liquidity. Analysts feared either a
share issue or sales of assets at prices too low to offset the loss of their
earnings.
The group's shares fell during April to a low of 54p by the end of the month
as rumours about the company's financial position circulated around the
stock market. Last week they bounced to 68p.
WPP, which owns J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, had warned in
mid-March that discussions were continuing with bankers about ways of
improving its capital structure. It said then that it might float its market
research business and its Far Eastern operations or sell Scali McCabe
Sloves, its US advertising agency.
At the end of 1991 WPP's balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 334m and
negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 268m. In April last year the group
agreed a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 560m) debt rescheduling with its banks, under
which Dollars 400m of debt would be repaid in June 1993.
However, WPP's refinancing did not involve issuing shares, unlike that of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi where existing shareholders found their interests heavily
diluted.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ptarmigan shares resume trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ptarmigan Holdings, the hotels and food distribution group, began
trading again yesterday as the company announced its results for the year to
June 30 1991 and for the first half of the current year.
The shares were suspended on January 31 this year as negotiations on a
substantial acquisition reached an advanced stage.
It proved impossible to complete these negotiations and talks have ceased.
The group is now in talks with other parties.
Ptarmigan reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 719,567 in the 1991 year,
against Pounds 11,636 previously. Turnover fell slightly from Pounds 4.94m
to Pounds 4.52m.
But in the six months ended December 31 1991, the loss had been reduced to
Pounds 104,000 on sales of Pounds 2.14m.
Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said the year had again proved difficult for
the group, particularly in the hotel sector.
The company incurred considerable cost as talks related to withdrawal from
the hotels sector failed. This had an unsettling effect on the staff, the
chairman said, but changes had since taken place to remotivate them.
The loss-making fish hatchery business had been closed during the year but
the remaining businesses had been profitable, Mr Wilbraham added.

Wyko Group is selling the business and certain assets and liabilities of its
Wyko Power Plant Gears division to David Brown Engineering for about Pounds
2.25m cash.
The proceeds will strengthen the balance sheet and enable the group to

concentrate resources on UK and overseas distribution which accounts for
some 70 per cent of turnover.
In the year ended April 30 1991, the division reported a profit before

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: SB to co-develop arthritis treatment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, has signed an agreement to co-develop and market arthritis and cancer
treatments with British Bio-technology, an unlisted biotechnology group.
Under the agreement, SB will develop anti-arthritic therapies from the
joint-research and enjoy exclusive marketing rights in the US and Japan, and
co-development rights in Europe. British Bio-technology will develop cancer
therapies arising from the joint-research.
Dr George Poste, SB's chairman of research and development, has argued in
the past that such collaborative basic research would become more important
given its increasing cost. The two groups have already collaborated on an
earlier anti-cancer product which is about to enter clinical trials.
British Bio-technology, based in Oxford, is hoping to be floated later this
year.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern losses doubled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the Cleveland-based department store and property
group, saw its loss double to Pounds 2.86m in the year to January 25,
although turnover rose to Pounds 13.6m.
The retailing business showed a satisfactory increase in sales from
department stores, but margins were depressed and overall profitability
showed a small decline.
To reduce bank borrowings the group sold property developments at Newbury
and Richmond and its investment unit in Congleton. The loss on disposals and
trading deficit led to the group having a negative net worth of some Pounds
500,000, as indicated last November.
Losses per share came to 31.69p. Previously they were 15.76p, when the
pre-tax deficit was Pounds 1.43m from turnover of Pounds 11.7m.
The auditors have qualified the accounts in respect of work-in-progress of
Pounds 979,000 (Pounds 3.83m). They are unable to determine whether the
provisions made are sufficient to reduce the book value of work to net
realisable value.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unitech, the electronic components group, has sold Rathdown Industries, the
payphone manufacturer, for Pounds 10.8m. The buyer is GN Investments, a
subsidiary of Great Nordic, the Danish telecommunications company.
Mr Peter Curry, chairman of Unitech, said Rathdown did not fit into
Unitech's strategy of focusing on three areas: power supplies, connectors
and control products.
He said the cash from the disposal would be used to strengthen the balance
sheet, bringing gearing to below 50 per cent.
It would also free resources to put into the other three areas, possibly
through acquisitions.
Rathdown made pre-tax profits of Pounds 843,000 in the year to end-May 1991
and had net assets of Pounds 2.5m.
Unitech acquired the company in 1973.

Lasmo, the independent oil and gas explorer, has sold its US upstream
interests and Ultramar's Australian exploration blocks for about Dollars 78m
(Pounds 44m) as part of a rationalisation plan.
The company acquired Ultramar in a Pounds 1.4bn takeover last year and said
then that it would streamline the operations by selling its peripheral
interests.
Most of the US business has been sold to Torch Energy and other purchasers
for Dollars 72m.
The sale excluded its interest in the Bright Star Gas Gathering system in
east Texas and the Willow Bayou gas discovery in Louisiana, on which two new
wells will be drilled later this year.
Ultramar's Australian interests, including the Katnook gas field, were sold
to Sagasco Resources for ADollars 8m (Pounds 3.4m).
Lasmo said it continues to explore for oil in Western Australia and in
particular on the north west shelf.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES of Sanderson Electronics yesterday rose 49p to 191p as the group
announced a lift of 20 per cent in pre-tax profit for the half year to March
31.
The international computing services group made Pounds 1.8m, against Pounds
1.5m, achieved on turnover maintained at Pounds 10.6m. Earnings per share
were 16p (11p).
The second interim dividend is 3.6p to make 9p (8.7p) for the year.
Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said revenues from maintenance, software licence
fees and support contracts were currently providing turnover of some Pounds
20m annually.
During the period the company acquired the outstanding 45 per cent of
General Automation Limited from General Automation Inc and 51 per cent of
Astralogic, which supplies systems for the travel industry, for a total of
Pounds 1m.
Sanderson operates in the UK through seven trading subsidiaries and overseas
via its 49 per cent holding in General Automation Inc, which is quoted on
the American stock exchange.
It specialises in open systems software based on the Unix and Pick operating
systems, but is broadly based with interests in maintenance and support
services.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Wound management helps Smith &amp; Nephew rise
9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the international healthcare and consumer products group,
yesterday reported a 9 per cent increase in first quarter profits after
sales continued to grow rapidly in its orthopaedic and wound management
divisions.
Pre-tax profits rose from a restated Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 31.1m on sales
ahead 11 per cent at Pounds 201.1m. This represented a 0.1p rise in earnings
per share to 2p.
The UK consumer business, which held the group back in 1991, continued to be
adversely affected by recession.
The healthcare businesses had, however, maintained margins. The sales
increase was equivalent to an underlying growth rate of 8 per cent after
adjusting for acquisitions, disposals and exchange differences.
S&amp;N's tax rate rose from 27 per cent to 29 per cent, reflecting the greater
proportion of profits derived outside the UK.
The results were in line with market expectations and 'confirmed progress in
the core healthcare businesses', said Mr Eric Kinder, chairman.
S&amp;N is best known in the UK for its branded consumer goods, such as Nivea
and Elastoplast, but this division has been badly mauled by recession.
The group also suffered last year from a one-off Pounds 7m fall in profits
connected with its Ioptex intraocular lens business after the US government
slashed the level of reimbursements that it would pay.
Last year, the new management's focus on areas such as hip and knee implants
and its wound dressings began to show through in higher margins. The group
has also emerged from under the weight of some acquisitions made in the
1980's drive for international coverage, which were less than totally
successful.
As a result S&amp;N's share price over the last year has risen by more than 50
per cent to 160 1/2 p.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brierley Invs sells BSG stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand investment company, has raised about
Pounds 37m by selling its 29.5 per cent stake in BSG International, the
motor components, distribution and consumer products group.
Some 60m shares were placed with institutions at 62p apiece.
Brierley made a book profit on selling the stake thanks to writing down its
value last year. It probably made an actual loss after holdings costs.
The group said it sold the shares because it did not have much to add to BSG
and the price had reached a reasonable level.
It was looking for new opportunities in the UK and the realisation of Pounds
37m cash would help that process.
The switch to an investment phase followed the sale of a series of stakes in
UK companies, including Vickers and Wm Low, early last year. This was to
raise cash after the acquisition of Mount Charlotte Investments, the UK
hotel group, for Pounds 644m.
Brierley said the gearing reduction phase was concluded with last May's sale
of a 30 per cent holding in Mount Charlotte to the Singapore government.
BSG welcomed the divestment. 'We never knew IEP's ultimate objective' and it
might have been predatory, it said.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Lloyds could face Midland tax penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF LLOYDS Bank succeeds in buying Midland, the combined banks will be forced
to pay Pounds 246m in tax which would not be paid if Midland is bought by
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, it was claimed yesterday.
The allegation was made by Hongkong Bank's merchant bank adviser, Schroders,
in the escalating war for control of Midland.
However, Lloyds last night issued a strong assurance that the matter had
been considered and it does not believe it will incur this penalty, while
other independent tax experts said the question of whether the tax would be
paid was open to doubt.
Hongkong Bank launched an offer for Midland last month, while Lloyds has
proposed a rival bid at a higher value if certain conditions are met.
Midland's most recent accounts show that the company has tax credits worth
Pounds 207m against trading losses and Pounds 39m in advance corporation tax
for the last financial year. These losses could be offset against future
profits of nearly Pounds 740m under UK corporate tax rates. However, tax
legislation states a 'major change in the nature or conduct of a trade'
within three years of a change of ownership would lead to these tax benefits
being disallowed.
Schroders suggests that the public documents released on the proposed bid by
Lloyds appeared to commit the bank to rapid and fundamental restructuring of
Midland within three years.
'Lloyds' proposals represent a major change in trade,' it said. 'It would be
very difficult to imagine even an optimistic broker thinking the tax losses
would survive.'
Schroders also stressed that Hongkong Bank's proposals would be unlikely to
incur the same penalties as Lloyds, because it intended to maintain the bank
virtually intact as a separate business.
Lloyds is believed to have already consulted the Inland Revenue on the
issue. A source involved in the discussions said: 'The markets are the same
and the changes are pretty mundane. We have looked at this fully.'
David Barchard writes: Midland Bank's shareholders were told yesterday by
Sir Peter Walters, chairman, the bank's board believes a merger with
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is the right strategy for the bank's future,
while a merger with Lloyds Bank would result in a combined group narrowly
focused on UK banking and involving retrenchment rather than growth.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Hongkong Bank to argue its case in letter to MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG BANK will shortly open a new front in its bid for control of
Midland by writing to members of parliament to argue its case.
According to one of its advisers, the bank will keep its message 'fairly
simple' and is likely to stage follow-up meetings with MPs 'in due course'.
It is expected to argue that the interests of the UK banking sector could
best be served by an injection of new blood and the continuing presence of
four strong clearers.
The struggle for control of Midland is increasingly being conducted in the
political arena.
A week ago, MPs received a letter from Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds
Bank - Hongkong's rival for Midland  - arguing that the foreign bank's offer
failed to address 'the fundamental problems in the UK banking sector' and
suggesting they contact a 'Helpline' for further information.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, has already written to the
heads of relevant ministries including Mr Michael Heseltine, President of
the Board of Trade, setting out the bank's case.
Meanwhile, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour frontbench spokeswoman on City and
corporate affairs, has written to both Mr Purves and Mr Brian Pitman, the
Lloyds chief executive, asking about their proposals.
She yesterday criticised the role of Mr Keith Hampson, the Conservative MP
with close links to Mr Heseltine, in offering advice to Lloyds. This showed
why it was 'difficult for politicians to take consultancies'.

FT  06 MAY 92 / British Fittings surprised by pre-tax loss of Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of British Fittings Group, distributor of pipelines and
maker of water pumps, fell 31 per cent yesterday, from 153p to 105p, as the
company announced a surprise pre-tax loss of nearly Pounds 3m and senior
management changes.
The company also took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.18m to cover last
year's theft of brass and copper bar and plate from a subsidiary, which is
being investigated by the police.
Announcing the figures yesterday, Mr Brian Stanton, who is about to drop the
role of chairman while continuing as managing director, said: 'A month ago I
was still working on a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. Two and a
half weeks ago I had a phone call to tell me what had happened. It was the
first I knew that the profit we were talking about had turned into a
terrific loss.'
The Birmingham-based company had put out a warning to the stock market in
February that its 1991 pre-tax profit would be less than the Pounds 5.7m
predicted at the time of a Pounds 7.1m rights issue last July. This was
already below the Pounds 6.21m made in 1990.
A new finance director - Mr Cecil Buckett, formerly of Newman Tonks  - took
up office on May 1. He replaced Mr Brian Smith whose position on the board
is under review.
Yesterday's figures showed that operating profit slid from Pounds 9.41m to
Pounds 3.15m on turnover of Pounds 82.2m, down from Pounds 88.7m. The
biggest division, pipeline equipment, limited its fall to less than 50 per
cent, while water pumps made less than a quarter of the previous year's
figure and non-ferrous metal distribution fell into the red.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 3.19m were incurred. The main causes were the
transfer of water pump manufacture to one site, redundancies, a write-down
in the value of the pump hire fleet, and an adjustment for errors in a
subsidiary's 1990 balance sheet which were being investigated by the Fraud
Squad.
As part of the process of tightening up financial controls, Mr Stanton said
seven subsidiary directors had been replaced by four new appointments.
Net debt was reduced by about Pounds 4m to Pounds 21.3m, gearing of 61 per
cent.
The loss per share amounted to 12.95p, against earnings of 20.09p. The final
dividend was cut to 4p making a total of 5.375p (7.35p).

FT  06 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hachette/Matra
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By comparing his fledgling magazines-to-missiles group with General Electric
and Siemens, Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere can at least be applauded for aiming
high. But the logic of combining Hachette and Matra seemed no more
compelling yesterday than it was when first mooted. Bankers will doubtless
be attracted by the merger of a cash-positive defence supplier with a
heavily indebted publishing company. Shareholders not in Mr Lagardere's
orbit may be rather less convinced by vague arguments about extra
international clout and increased management efficiency.
Hachette, of course, is being rescued from financial disaster, while Matra
can argue that the publishing group might yet prove a profitable partner at
this stage in the cycle and with the La Cinq episode behind it. Both sets of
shareholders, though, should bear in mind that if the new holding company
runs according to form it will trade at a minimum 20-25 per cent discount to
net assets. They might also ask themselves if the proposed unlimited
partnership, which provides extra financial incentive but more protection
for incumbents, is an appropriate management structure given the errors of
the past.
As for the capital structure, Mr Lagardere's continued control appears to
come at a price. Almost half the banks' support is in the form of non-voting
perpetual subordinated notes, which the more cautious count as debt. On this
basis, Hachette's pre-merger gearing would be 160 per cent, even after the
proposed injection of capital.

FT  06 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Smith &amp; Nephew
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith &amp; Nephew has grown used to revealing indifferent quarterly figures of
late, so the mere 5 per cent rise in earnings yesterday was no surprise. But
the decision to abandon quarterly reporting suggests the contrast with the
days when it could show regular earnings growth of 20 per cent has been more
painful than the market realised. While UK companies in general are
shuffling gradually towards more disclosure, Smith is taking a retrograde
and slightly worrying step.
The company argues that in future it will be less restricted by regular
closed periods and can thus be more forthcoming to its institutional
investors. But in its good times, Smith's management offended investor
etiquette by its penchant for secrecy. Its latest report and accounts
further reduce the group's level of disclosure by lumping profits into two
divisions where once there were four. Yesterday's bald statement by the
chairman positively discouraged questions from outsiders. The impression is
of a management suspicious of and uncomfortable with external scrutiny.
Whatever one thinks of the gradual improvement in the group's businesses,
its shares deserve to be treated with matching suspicion until such a worry
is dispelled.

<TEXT>
Whatever else, the cut represents a gamble on German interest rates. Not
only is the differential with Germany reduced to only a quarter of a
percentage point but the Frankfurt money market is also tight, with call
money approaching the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. It can be argued that in
the short term the UK may get away with it, if only because the Bundesbank
is unlikely to raise rates while the strikes last. But in the slightly
longer run, the bank may be forced to act if money supply growth continues
close to 10 per cent. Then the UK would be in a similar position to France
last year in trying to buck the German trend. True, the UK can now claim the
attraction of political stability while the Kohl government appears to be
losing its grip. But France's past inability to sustain lower rates is still
sobering given its outstanding inflation record.
Even without a German rate rise, sterling is sailing close to the wind.
Yesterday's move must cast at least some doubt on the urgency with which the
government hopes to move to narrow bands within the ERM, and by extension on
the expectation of currency stability which has underpinned the gilts market
since the election. No doubt the UK government will do its utmost to prevent
sterling falling below its narrow band floor of DM2.8844. But to fund its
deficit, it may now need to rely more heavily on expectations of lower
inflation and on Mr John Major's new image as the strong man of Europe. The
danger is that a half-point rate cut might prove insufficient to yield the
non-inflationary growth that such a leadership role requires, while still
deviating too far from the German norm.

FT  06 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: A question of motive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market reaction to yesterday's cut in UK interest rates was notable for
its scepticism. Though sterling held up fairly well, gilts dropped by more
than half a point. The equity market, despite Monday's record close on Wall
Street, was barely changed. Three-month money, far from moving to discount
the next cut as usual, stayed slightly above the new rate of 10 per cent.
Rather than accepting the cut in a spirit of gratitude, the markets are
asking themselves what the government is worried about.
The immediate suspect is economic recovery. Independent evidence suggests
that retail sales may not after all be enjoying a post-election blip, even
though spending in March was supposedly depressed by the election's
approach. Sales at John Lewis, for instance, were down 4 per cent in the
week to April 25 and unchanged over 13 weeks. But the pattern of consumer
spending is still too murky to permit conclusions. Nor is it obvious why a
newly re-elected government would bother to take risks on sterling and
inflation merely to bring recovery forward a month or two.
It may be that the pressure to cut rates comes more from the fragility of
the UK financial system. If so, the market was wrong to mark down the stores
sector yesterday. It should have concentrated instead on property and the
banks. But the authorities might argue that the risk in cutting rates is not
as great as it looks. The amount of spare productive capacity in the economy
perhaps argues against inflationary pressure for a while yet. But in
currency terms, the risk remains palpable. The market may not be quite sure
what bothers it about yesterday's move. It may be right to be slightly
bothered just the same.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: UK engineers' dull image no bar to growth in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEAL HATTERSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ron Kirby (Letters, April 24) and A V Drew (Letters, April 29) raise
important, but infrequently debated issues about the contribution of civil
engineering to UK commerce.
Despite the public's perception of our industry, epitomised by the (true)
joke that if you look up the word 'boring' in Yellow Pages you are directed
to 'see Civil Engineers', revenues of the top 10 UK consulting firms grew by
14 per cent in 1991's recession-ridden business environment. Indeed, no
fewer than six of Europe's top 10 civil engineering firms are British. My
firm has grown 80 per cent in the last two years to rank in the top five and
has recruited actively in that period.
Last March we bought control of a firm located in former East Germany with
the full support of the employees. Our management capability and technical
excellence led them to favour us in preference to offers from other European
countries and the US.
British engineering is as strong now as it has ever been; why else, for
example, would a Japanese organisation have come to us to design a telescope
in Hawaii? However, recently, when the City of London rightly decided to
celebrate the centenary of Tower Bridge in 1994, it chose to create a theme
based on London in 1894, ignoring our pleas to mention other great river
crossings designed by British engineers in Sydney, Hong Kong, across the
Bosporus in Turkey and even in Hull.
The 500,000 foreign visitors expected to visit the bridge will thus leave
thinking Britain's engineering talent dried up in 1894. Would such a state
of affairs be allowed to happen in Germany? I think not, but then our firm
in Germany, which though large is not unrepresentative, has women in over
half its technical positions while in the UK annual job applications from
female engineers to Acer can be counted on the fingers of one hand. In
Germany, engineering is recognised as a foundation for the country's wealth.
In the UK, it is undervalued and misunderstood. 'Design' is viewed as
glamorous; engineering as dull.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: BT idea of level playing field a bar to new
competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM J MATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I support the recent call to Oftel from the National Consumer
Council and the Consumers' Association to impose a price cut on BT ('Oftel
is urged to order BT price cut', April 30), it raises a more fundamental
issue.
The Telecommunications Act 1984 places upon the secretary of state and the
director-general duties, among others, to 'promote the interest of
consumers' and 'to maintain and promote effective competition'.
As the director of a company that has recently submitted an application to
the Department of Trade and Industry for a public telecommunications licence
to operate in competition with BT, I too have an interest in seeing that BT
reduces its prices now.
Left to itself, BT will not do so until forced by competition. Not only is
such a delay against consumers' interests, but given BT's market dominance,
it will, by definition, have an impact on new competitors at the very point
when they are vulnerable to being still-born or ineffective in quickly
eroding market share.
For too long BT has argued that 'promotion of competition' involves the
creation of a level playing field on which it and new market entrants should
compete on equal terms. This is a beguiling but fallacious argument that has
permitted BT to pursue a corporate policy broadly aimed at preserving its
dominant position.
The director-general of Oftel should abandon his attempts to control the
increase in price of BT's services in favour of accelerating the
availability of services to consumers at reduced prices, from whatever
supplier. He should afford BT the opportunity of immediately increasing or
reducing the price of any of its services during this current price review,
but prohibit it from making any further price changes until it has lost a
substantial share of the relevant market sector.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: Share not worthless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN ALLDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor's article ('How to put a value on a share of the
action', April 28) suggests that a shareholding of 25 per cent or less in a
private company is 'practically worthless, particularly if no dividends are
paid and majority shareholder(s) are ready to faze the minority out'. I
wonder whether the many small minority shareholders who have benefited from
their companies exploring the opportunities of an exit route would agree
with this generalisation. Valuation is indeed more of an art than a science.
It should always reflect the possibility of shareholders being able to reap
the benefit of unlocking several years' undistributed profits from an
apparent illiquid and risky investment. Subjective, yes, but 'practically
worthless', no.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: Polyester not an ICI invention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LEONARD DOWSETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your story, 'Raw materials of a promising deal' (April 24), refers to
ICI's 'difficult decision to stop making polyester, which the company
invented. . .' I am aware that this myth originated from ICI's PR department
during the Hanson-ICI polemics. But I would have thought by now that someone
at ICI would have corrected this error.
Polyester was invented and patented by the late Dr Rex Whinfield and his
co-workers at Calico Printers Association. Dr Whinfield told me that CPA
decided the project was too big and so he was instructed to approach ICI.
ICI fibre scientists eventually declared that the fibre had 'no future'  - a
severe blow to Whinfield and CPA. The CPA board decided to send Whinfield to
see Du Pont US, even though it knew that in those days ICI and Du Pont had a
technical and commercial information exchange agreement and Du Pont would
know of the ICI rejection.
Whinfield was told to try to at least get his research outlay back - which,
if my memory is correct, was Pounds 66,000. Du Pont decided to buy the US
version of the patent, and Whinfield was delighted to sell for that sum.
When ICI learned of Du Pont's purchase it tried to buy the UK and other
country patents. Whinfield, though, realised they might have a winner after
all and CPA refused to sell to ICI for a lump sum and demanded royalties.
Whinfield joined ICI and was responsible for the development of the fibre. I
believe in the end ICI paid many millions of pounds in royalties.

<TEXT>
It is more than a little ironic that the Far Eastern Economic Review, which
has fought so ferociously over the years for the freedom of the press in
totalitarian places like Singapore, should spike its editor's last leading
article.
The reason why Philip Bowring's rather self-indulgent trip down memory lane
has been replaced by a couple of ads is not hard to understand. After taking
a few side swipes at such prestige US editorial products as the Readers
Digest and Time Warner, Bowring proceeds to pen what seems like a thinly
veiled obituary to all that he was proud of during his 20-years at the
Review.
However, it says something about the editorial insecurity of the Review's US
owners, Dow Jones, that they would not permit Bowring to have his final say,
however misguided it might be.

At first sight the battle for Midland Bank seems to be getting ever so cosy.
Lloyds Bank has hired GJW to do its political lobbying, while its rival, the
Hongkong Bank,
has now engaged Lowe Bell Communications to fight its corner.
Once upon a time GJW and Lowe Bell were all part of the same Frank Lowe
media empire. And although Sir Tim Bell, Mrs Thatcher's favourite spin
doctor, has bought out Lowe Bell, Lowe Group still retains a 20 per cent
stake and so benefits both ways.
Nevertheless, one wonders what happened to that no-
compete clause whereby GJW and Lowe Bell are supposed to work together
rather than against each other. This is the first time that Sir Tim has
challenged his old partners.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an increasing end of an era ring about the recent non-stop
festivities in the Associated Newspapers' stable. The Mail on Sunday had its
tenth birthday and great fuss was made of the 21st anniversary of the Daily
Mail going 'compact'.
It is also the 21st anniversary of Sir David English's time at the Daily
Mail's editorial helm, and the din of champagne corks popping cannot subdue
the growing speculation that Britain's longest serving national newspaper
editor may be preparing to sign off his day-to day editorial
responsibilities.
One possible clue is that Sir David is starting to add to his non-daily work
load. Associated has just won the new 10-year teletext licence and Sir David
will be the chairman. He already chairs two of Viscount Rothermere's other
media ventures - a magazine publishing company and an independent television
producer. If Sir David steps down as editor - he would almost certainly
remain editor-in-chief - the smart money is on his replacement being Paul
Dacre who has piled on sales at London's Evening Standard while driving it
firmly to the political right.

Unilever employees are so fiercely loyal to their company's products that
some even carry around packets of Flora margarine which they produce at
outside business lunches.
Imagine the scene then, when an FT colleague was invited to lunch yesterday
with Mike Perry, Unilever's chairman-elect, in his private dining room and
spotted on the table several pots of fruit yoghurt made by Muller, a German
company unconnected with Unilever.
Perry's consternation could hardly have been greater if a cockroach had
crawled across his plate. An immediate investigation was ordered, which
revealed that the catering department had decided to offer a wider range of
fare at directors' lunches. Observer predicts that culinary experiments of
this kind will not survive for long after Perry takes over the chair at
Unilever today.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Observer: Accountants in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While singing the praises of its profession, the annual report of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales suggests it might do
well to learn some of the business skills its members are expected to
possess.
Glowing words describing its activities nestle among colour photos of its
London edifice at Moorgate Place. The figures at the back are rather more
disappointing: the Institute is in the red for the second year running, with
a pre-tax operating deficit of Pounds 241,000.
Income rose slightly faster than expenditure, but even with a Pounds 117,000
tax offset the growing number of bureaucratic bean-counters (up from 386 to
415 staff) were forced to knock Pounds 124,000 off their reserves.
Accountancy, its glossy magazine, and courses and conferences were among the
loss-makers.
To be fair, the losses are lower than last year, at a time when the
Institute has had additional statutory obligations. It has also launched an
ambitious campaign to persuade its members to vote to raise subscriptions.
Still, the Institute is certainly not selling off the family silver to make
up the shortfall. It purchased another Pounds 15,000 worth of silver and
antiques to add to its revalued Pounds 2.4m collection. Readers may
doubtless also be gratified to know that the value of wine held as stock has
increased to no less than Pounds 59,000.
In the meantime, members should perhaps be grateful that their Institute
refrained from merger discussions last year - and hope that it does not
indulge again for a while.
The 1990 accounts show a remarkable extraordinary item of Pounds 240,000
incurred in relation to the 'joint consultation process' for the failed
merger with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy - in
part payable, no doubt, to accountants acting as advisers.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Foreign Affairs: Nations in glass houses - On an
international yardstick, it is difficult to uphold the charge of racism
against the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The predictable effect of last week's riots in Los Angeles has been an
outbreak of smug comments on the US in the rest of the world. Early off the
mark was President Francois Mitterrand of France. 'It's very nice,' he said
in a radio interview on Friday, 'to promote capital, profits and investment
in business, but these riots show that the social needs of any country must
not be neglected . . . George Bush is a generous man, who embodies an
extremely conservative political ideology, and American society is
conservative and economically capitalist. Here are some of the results of
that.'
Well, I suppose that was just too tempting an opportunity for a Socialist
president with his back to the wall to pass up. But Americans are not likely
to be much impressed by homilies from that quarter. 'We haven't just had a
14 per cent vote for a neo-fascist party,' was one comment I heard from an
American conservative analyst. 'You should see the riots they'd have in
Paris if 35 per cent of the population belonged to minorities,' was another,
from a Francophile middle-of-the-road lawyer.
Nor will Americans be unduly worried by the Egyptian newspaper, Al-Ahram,
which asked whether the Libyan Lockerbie suspects could expect a fair trial
in the US, in the light of the Rodney King verdict.
But Mr Roger Wilkins, the distinguished black historian who helped shape the
Johnson administration's response to the Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965,
is happy to endorse the remark of a Japanese official quoted in the
Washington Post: 'There are black people who really have no future, who are
completely left over . . . The trend of US society was almost to forget
about them.' And a thoughtful political analyst like Mr Norman Ornstein of
the American Enterprise Institute foresees that the image of itself that
America has just projected will be seized on by Third World dictators who
are the targets of American criticism. 'There are going to be a lot of
potshots at the US,' he said, 'and Americans will not take kindly to that.'
Two main charges can be levelled at the US on the basis of last week's
events. The first is a very specific one of racism, reflected in the
unwillingness of a white jury to convict four white policemen whom the
entire nation had seen savagely beating and kicking a prostrate black man,
in an amateur video repeatedly shown on television.
The second is a more general one, of being a callous, socially divisive and
violence-prone society, in which such an incident can set a whole city on
fire, causing 55 deaths and billions of dollars worth of damage.
Both charges are true, but if an international yardstick is used, the charge
of racism is the harder of the two to sustain. Most black Americans clearly
believe, no doubt with reason, that they are consistently targeted for
harassment and maltreatment by the police. But so do most members of racial
minorities in western Europe, and no doubt in Japan as well. What is
striking to a British visitor is how many of the police, including police
chiefs in many of the big cities, are themselves black - as indeed are many
of the mayors.
Of course the fact that Mayor Tom Bradley is black did not prevent what
happened in Los Angeles, but much of the blame has been laid at the door of
its white police chief, Mr Daryl Gates, both for the general atmosphere
prevailing in the Los Angeles police department, and for the specific
failures which occurred last week.
Mr Gates had in fact been fired from his job before the acquittals were
announced (he is to be replaced by a black from Philadelphia with a liberal
reputation), and appears to have been virtually on strike. Perhaps he was as
surprised as everyone else by the trial verdict, but surely contingency
plans should have been made.
Some of the anger might have been blunted if all the accused had been
dismissed from the force as soon as the verdict was announced - even if
their conduct was not criminal, it has been repeatedly and officially
declared a gross violation of proper professional procedures; and prompt
deployment of police in the right places might have deterred many of the
rioters. Instead, Mr Gates went off to a fund-raising event for a movement
to oppose police reform.
Anyway, it was striking that the riots did not spread to many other cities,
and particularly not to New York and Washington where it might have been
expected. Both cities have black mayors who issued firm and clear statements
deploring the verdicts but warning against any violence.
None of this implies, of course, that racism is not widespread or even
endemic in American society. My point is that, unfortunately, this is true
of almost all industrialised societies with large ethnic minorities, and
that the US since the 1960s has done more than most to combat it. Urban
poverty and squalor are not unique to America either. The problems of
homelessness, drug addiction and chronic unemployment are all too familiar
in Europe's large cities.
Where America sadly does lead the industrialised world is in the level of
violence, and in the enormous disparity between rich and poor. No doubt the
absence of gun control and President Reagan's tax policies respectively go
far to explain those two points.
'Most Americans,' writes Prof Mohamed Rabie in a recently published book*,
'claim and honestly believe that they are living today in the most civilised
society ever when, in fact, living in the United States probably means
living in one of the most violent and least secure societies in modern
times.'
Part of the explanation is that much of the crime and violence is confined
to the inner cities, or to certain districts of them, from which the middle
class (including middle-class blacks) has completely removed itself. Mr
Rabie recounts the telling case of the director of the budget office of a
big city, who not only lived outside the city jurisdiction but in 30 years'
service had never even made a telephone call to the district where drugs and
crime were most prevalent.
What can be done? Liberals urge social programmes to provide jobs, better
health care, better schools and pre-school Head Start programmes for
disadvantaged children. Conservatives, led by Mr Jack Kemp, the housing and
urban development secretary, urge a package of tax breaks and other measures
to encourage investment in inner cities and give incentives to the urban
poor to take jobs, save money and acquire their own homes.
President Bush instinctively distrusts the former approach (held to have
been tried and failed in the 1960s and 1970s), and gives only lukewarm
support to the latter, which is bogged down in the general wrangle with
Congress over the budget. Both remedies are victims of the US's political
and fiscal impasse, and last week's shock may not be enough to give either
of them high enough priority to make much difference.
What can be safely predicted, though, is the reinforcement of the already
strong feeling that America needs to look after its own, and that the rest
of the world can now look after itself.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Lombard: Bolivia's latin lesson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Audits and accountants are hardly the stuff of high stakes political
intrigue. But in Bolivia, bean counting is becoming a high-risk profession.
Last year, Bolivia approved a law introducing financial controls, snap
inspections and audits throughout the government in a bid to reduce
corruption and make public administration more efficient. The aim is to make
government more accountable, strengthening Bolivia's fragile democracy. The
clampdown threatens powerful people, principally the politicians,
businessmen, unions, generals and bureaucrats who for generations have
plundered the state with impunity.
The architect of the law is Mr Antonio Sanchez de Lozada, a choleric
60-year-old businessman who was appointed Bolivia's comptroller-general in
1982. He has dedicated his 10-year term, which has six months left to run,
to the seemingly hopeless task of making his department - a sort of
turbocharged audit bureau - effective for the first time since its creation
in 1928.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada realised that many of Bolivia's problems stemmed from a
powerful, but ineffective and corrupt state: Until recently, it dominated
the economy and incurred unsustainable deficits financed with crushing
foreign debts and inflation; the result was permanent instability; and as
state-controlled institutions became increasingly discredited and ceased to
function, so the edifice of the state began to crumble.
No other country in Latin America is a better example of this institutional
paralysis: Bolivia has had more coups d'etat than any other state; poverty
is widespread; and hyperinflation, having reached a peak of 24,000 per cent
in 1985, forcing the government to introduce radical economic reforms, has
now been brought under control, and the economy is growing modestly. Yet
government remains as ineffective and discredited as ever because corruption
and incompetence have not been satisfactorily attacked.
The free-market reforms sweeping Latin America remain tenuous, in part
because few countries have established sound institutions as the bedrock of
democracy and a capitalist economy. In February, Venezuela was shaken by an
army uprising. Last month, President Alberto Fujimori seized dictatorial
powers in Peru. Shortly after, Bolivia's President Jaime Paz Zamora
threatened to close congress.
Yet there are some encouraging trends. Argentina is now emulating Bolivia's
reforms. This is significant, given that Argentina's recent past is as
unenviable as Bolivia's. Buenos Aires is introducing free-market reforms in
addition to auditing and control mechanisms similar to Bolivia's.
Bolivia's legislation on auditing controls will introduce a framework of
modern management principles underpinned by clear policy objectives and
budgets. The comptroller-general is in charge of enforcing targets,
authorising snap inspections of bureaucracies and conducting routine audits.
He also has the power to prosecute. The auditors will check all departments
of the executive branch - including sensitive areas such as the armed
forces. Monopolies and companies or organisations that receive state support
must also be monitored.
Besides tackling corruption and boosting efficiency, the legislation is
designed to make government accountable.
The system has yet to be fully introduced and so it is too early to draw any
conclusions. Yet nobody doubts Mr Sanchez de Lozada's personal commitment.
Much of his work has been low-level and routine, although several cases have
brought him face to face with the biggest names in Bolivian politics. He and
his staff have received death threats.
Few people really believed congress would approve the reforms. But Mr
Sanchez de Lozada says: 'After 1985, people were willing to listen.
Hyperinflation opened their minds. Everyone was fed up with extortion.
People are demanding institutions that are beyond the grasp of politicians.'
Nonetheless, he has few illusions about the challenge he faces. Many of the
concepts underlying the legislation (like the rule of law and
accountability) are recent developments in Latin America.
Countries with a history of authoritarianism can hardly be expected to
change overnight. Any reforms in Bolivia will remain largely ineffective
without the development of a professional civil service and judiciary
independent of the government of the day.
There are considerable misgivings about the government's motives for
approving the audit law. Many dismiss it as a public relations exercise and
doubt it will ever confront big business, the ruling party or the army.
Until now, these groups were beyond effective control.
Equally, no Latin country has shown it can resist the international drug
trade's recourse to bribery and intimidation.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada's investigations into corrupt practices are now being
criticised as likely to provoke another coup. His term of office expires in
November. If his successor is a cypher, the doubters will be vindicated. But
if the government appoints a respected and effective replacement, Latin
America's weakest democracy will have taken another big step forward. It
would be a step its neighbours would do well to copy.

The play from which this musical was taken featured the young Katharine
Hepburn making an eye-catching entrance running down stairs dressed in an
armoured breastplate and short skirt and carrying a dead stag over her
shoulder. No wonder Rodgers and Hart thought they had a winner.
The musical that they made was By Jupiter. On Sundays between now and
mid-October in the Barbican's Cinema 1 a series of 'lost musicals' is being
given in concert performance and By Jupiter at the weekend was the first.
Four other shows by Schwartz, Porter, Weill and Rodgers again (Do I hear a
Waltz?) will follow, each hopefully with the same musical zest, even if
there is only a near honky-tonk piano for accompaniment.
Written in 1942, By Jupiter was the last collaboration of the Rodgers and
Hart partnership. It was completed while Hart was in hospital, with Rodgers
at his bedside whistling tunes until the lyricist had no option but to find
some words to fit them. It ran for 427 performances and, although a war-time
show, is a comedy with few serious political overtones, except perhaps the
scene where the Amazonians are exhorted to 'give, give, give' to raise money
for arms.
The scene is set in ancient times, but the point is to mock modern
attitudes. With the Greek army of men facing the Amazonian women across the
battlefield there is also plenty of scope for jokes on the reversal of the
sexes - men who knit socks for their women at war, and so on.
Rodgers's music is mostly rhythmic, snappy, not especially memorable. The
most humable number is a sentimental waltz, 'Wait till you see her', sung by
Theseus, who has come to claim the goddess Diana's girdle, but ends up with
rather more. The Greek camp also includes a cowardly Hercules and Homer, a
'war correspondent and writer of travel books', just two from a cast-list
that relishes a good classical caricature when it sees one.
In this workshop performance the show went with a zing, the women taking the
honours over the men, Louise Gold and Briony Glassco as the ruling Amazonian
sisters in particular. Further performances of By Jupiter follow on Sundays
in May.
Discover the Lost Musicals 1992 season runs most Sunday afternoons until

FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: The Rake's Progress - Brighton Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brighton's Festival, large and popular, owes a debt to New Sussex Opera for
its imaginative productions in the Dome in past years of Benvenuto Cellini
and Tannhauser. NSO opened the musical part of this year's programme with
Stravinsky's Rake's Progress, quite unsuitable for the Dome and given in the
Gardner Centre. With no orchestra pit, limited stage possibilities and total
absence of theatrical atmosphere that building has its own kind of
unsuitability, underlining how inadequately Brighton, in spite of cultural
pretensions, houses the arts.
The likely outcome was that Stravinsky's prickly, glinting orchestral score
would play havoc with the voices. Mercifully, thanks to devotedly careful
playing from the NSO orchestra and to the watchful and understanding
conducting of Lionel Friend, that did not happen. There was some toning down
of sharp edges, and at favourite moments like the saraband for Baba's entry
into Tom's house, there was more sound than bite. But given the
circumstances the results were honourable.
Among the leading soloists, Mary Hegarty's Anne Trulove was a delight. One
does not often find a soprano who can look like a country girl and give such
an accomplished account of both the big aria at the end of act one and the
lullaby in act three. Tom Rakewell was Mark Curtis, a polished tenor without
quite the full lyricism the difficult solos need. Adrian Clarke, the Nick
Shadow, has an incisive, tenorish baritone, not black enough for this role,
but as effective as the producer allowed.
And so to the staging. John Lloyd-Davies may well have been anxious to avoid
comparisons with the Cox-Hockney Glyndebourne Rake, still fresh in the
memory. He has certainly made his version as unlike as possible. The
permanent set is an outdoor jumble of drapes with a black and white cut-out
of tall modern buildings expressionistically slanted and a no-style house
for Tom. The Rake however marked a return to formal values: among other
things a sense of place (not necessarily period place) is required by Auden
and Kallman's text as well as the music. Of this there is no sign.
Whimsical contemporary references abound, making a point or two - for a
brief moment. Shadow communicates with Tom from an executive's desk by
telephone. An expanding row of Roman clock-face numerals marking the
running-out of Tom's permitted time is partly hidden by the orchestra.
Lighting of the cyclorama by changing, possibly symbolic colours, is
overdone. Moments in the score normally strongly poetic, like the trumpet
solo uncannily evoking winter in a deserted London square, go for nothing.
Were there ever whores so un-erotic (identical red ballet skirts)? The NSO
chorus sings lustily; its acting is mainly notable for rushing about.
Auctioneer Sellem was overplayed and undersung by Philip Slane, in a
pop-star jacket. Mary King's Baba the Turk was touching in her kindness to
Anne. Anthea Nayall's Mother Goose was barely audible. In the small role of
Anne's father, Stephen Richardson was absolutely right. With all its faults,
the show deserves a larger audience than it drew for the first night on
Friday. Our expiring century has not produced many operas of such high
quality.
Performances tonight and tomorrow. Festival Box Office (0273) 676747.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: Purcell's 'Fairy Queen'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 25 years ago Benjamin Britten made his arrangement of The Fairy Queen
because it was thought 'impractical' to stage Purcell's music together with
the Shakespeare play for which it was written and pretty difficult even to
persuade an audience to sit through the whole of the musical score. How
quickly attitudes change.
One of the hits of the Aix-en-Provence festival in recent years was just
that: a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with the play suitably
shortened, that incorporated all of Purcell's music performed by Les Arts
Florissants under William Christie. That production spawned a successful
recording and on Saturday the musical performance arrived in concert at the
Barbican, with just a lacing of dramatic high spirits.
This group plays the music as though each performer knows it inside out and
loves every note. With only ten musicians (a string quartet plus a few each
of wind and brass) this was essentially chamber music in style and the
performers' intimate understanding of what each other are doing was half the
joy of the evening. A piece like the famous air 'Ye gentle spirits' became
liquid and flexible, seemingly freed from its bar-lines.
There are those who find this aspect of Christie's Purcell too French in
flavour, as though niceties of nuance have replaced good, solid English
rhythmic impetus. The counter-argument is that his Fairy Queen takes flight
in imagination and is so full of life, magical, poetic, sensitive, that it
makes most other performances sound earthbound.
In Les Arts Florissants' previous visits to London the weakness, if there
was one, was the singing. This time Christie brought a very respectable
cast, including one outstanding singer in the soprano Veronique Gens, who
delivered the Plaint with immaculate beauty, and a pair of well-versed
English tenors in Charles Daniels and Mark Padmore. Like the
instrumentalists, they worked as a team, holding the audience spellbound
through long, cumulative sections of the score.
There was no play. Instead Jeremy Sams set the scene with a linking
narration, which Harriet Walter delivered with the aplomb of an Anna Russell
('Imagine a fairyland as conceived by Capability Brown'). And Graham Spicer,
producer or 'metteur en espace' as his task was described when rendered into
French, added a few judicious movements: just a single wink to cap Coridon
and Mopsa's lascivious duet.
Whether such additions are necessary is a matter of opinion. When Christie
and his musicians are on stage, I am inclined to think that there is more
than enough to stimulate the imagination, for Purcell's delightful and
magical world seems to lie at their fingertips.

Last time the BBC got itself involved in the 'One World' movement it left
some of us, who normally admire its journalism, wondering what had happened
to its usual balance and healthy scepticism. It appeared to embrace the
softest and most sentimental ideas of greenery rather as it has embraced
Christianity: without the rigorous testing it would apply to other subjects.
Tonight brings the first in a six-week run of programmes leading up to the
Earth Summit in Brazil, and it will be interesting to see whether a little
more clear headedness has been achieved this time. Tomorrow's World reports
on a scheme to raise the quality of the water in the Ganges to 'bathing
quality' throughout its 1,500 miles (7.30 BBC1). Clashing head on is BBC2's
Happy Families which observes five families in five countries attempting to
live greener lives for five weeks.
Paul Morley's C4 series The Thing Is .. (8.30) must be better this week than
last when the subject was boredom. Today it is motorways. Dispatches
examines the use of computers by the National Health Service and suggests
that decisions taken behind closed doors have perpetuated waste (9.00).

FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: Brecht's 'Edward II' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's more important,' said Brecht, 'for the set to tell the spectator he's
in a theatre than to tell him he's in, say, Aulis . . . the best thing is to
show the machinery.' This has been followed to the letter in Brecht's Das
Leben Edwards II von England (adapted from Marlowe's Edward II) at the
Glasgow Citizens Theatre. Philip Prowse's design and direction delivers an
exciting play, politically apt and dramatically rigorous.
The first production in Munich (1924) used titles preceding the scenes and
announcing the contents. The life of Edward II (1284-1327) became a pattern
of linked events: his infatuation with Gaveston; the consequent civil unrest
of 1311-23 and subsequent battles at Scarborough and Warwick; Edward's years
in an oubliette at Berkeley Castle; and his murder. The play's Chorus -
named Smith  - plays the part of history, binding up the past, changing with
the times.
Prowse rightly makes this a mechanical production; the design and style
inform the play. Each scene opens simply, without taking account of its
predecessor or successor but working together as components of an an ending
which resolves everything. The set is a functional tripartite black dais
which allows the actors to pop up from trench-like interstices. Brecht
thought every design should have its own climax, and this coup takes the
form of a stage drenched with water - from suspended buckets - representing
the castle sewer at Berkeley. Stark lighting and apt costumes, sumptuous
cloaks for the peers and rags for the commoners, clinch the integrated
effect.
The actors follow the difficult path cleared by Brecht's verse. Unlike
Marlowe's original, Brecht's Edward keeps itself public, leaving no room for
the comforts of intimacy. The overall style is stark, direct and pared-down,
notwithstanding Brecht's lyrical attempts at Marlovian rhetoric.
The cast's unromantic acting supports the production's minimalism. Laurance
Rudic's testy, flighty Edward becomes a neurotic ready for the worst. His
adversary, Mortimer (played by the limber Tristram Jellinek) is a mirror of
realpolitik, all strategy and purpose. Edward's wife, the Queen (tetchily
played by Julia Blalock) finds herself caught up by events beyond her
control, complaining of 'the smell of too much history.' And Edward's lover,
Gaveston (Patrick O'Kane) maintains a resolute ordinariness in face of
others' hostility.
The production's strength lies in its ability - consistent with Brecht's
ideals - to make matters of political authority bear on every relationship.
Marlowe's play dealt with power, but was also about love; Brecht's is solely
about power. The murder of Edward with the red-hot poker was excised by
Brecht; instead, Edward is suffocated, ending not with a bang but a whimper.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Management: Chewing over the fat - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is more to obesity than meets the eye. Simply being overweight does
not in itself increase the dangers of heart disease unless it is accompanied
by high blood pressure, diabetes or high levels of cholesterol. There are
different types of obesity, and some are more risky than others.
There are two main sorts of fat distribution: 'android' apple-shaped
distribution, where most of the fat is concentrated around the waist, and
'gynoid', which is more pear shaped with the fat distributed all over,
although particularly on the lower part of the body.
Evidence over the last two decades suggests that apple-shaped people are
more vulnerable to heart disease than the pear-shaped type. Some studies
conclude that an otherwise slim person with a bulging mid-drift may be in
greater danger than someone who is fat all over. Women are at less risk than
men: they can carry up to 25 kilograms more fat without increasing their
chances of heart disease because of their more pear-shaped distribution.
To find out which type you are, take your waist measurement and divide it by
the hip measurement. Men are classified as 'upper body obese' if the
waste-hip ratio (WHR) is more than 0.95, and women, if they are more than
0.85.
The best remedy, as with all weight problems, is gently to cut the number of
calories consumed, and to increase the number used up through regular
exercise. Remember that your bathroom scales will be of no help, as muscle
is heavier than fat. This means that as you exercise, you may find you gain
weight. Instead use the WHR - or attend to how tight your belt is - to gauge
your success.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Management: How the new-style hard centre was made more
digestible
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is plenty in Nestle's reorganisation from which other companies can
learn, even if at first sight the company appears to its competitors at
Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, Philip Morris and so on to be doing little that
is original - 'stepping cautiously into the 1980s', as one wag puts it.
Nestle's critics are right that the abandonment of functionalism was well
overdue; it survived so long only because it was such an enshrined part of
Nestle's custom and practice. In the 1980s Helmut Maucher, the group's
redoubtable chairman and chief executive, sometimes appeared to share the
exaggerated view of some business academics that really good managers can
make almost any structure work. Only in 1989 did he and his top colleagues
finally become so frustrated with the old structure that they called in
McKinsey, the management consultancy, to advise them how to streamline it.
In terms of organisational theory, the previous structure was considerably
more complex than the 'one single, clear line of power' that Maucher has
always believed in. It was either three- or four-dimensional, depending on
how you depict it.
A 4-D picture is probably appropriate, given the way in which two
headquarters groups (strong functions and weak 'product management') tussled
with each other for influence over the organisation's geographic side. The
latter, in turn, actually consisted not of one line of power, but of two
uneasy partners: regions and countries, which also often tussled with each
other.
Nestle's new structure is two-dimensional, with the product divisions on one
side and, on the other, regional units with much-enhanced influence over the
countries.
In the context of the food industry, which still needs to be
ultra-responsive to differences in local market habits and demands, this
change is almost as significant as the more dramatic-looking structural
shifts of multinationals in other industries. With a higher proportion of
global products than Nestle, ICI, US General Electric and others have felt
able recently to abandon their messy two-dimensional matrices in favour of
simpler, virtually one-dimensional, structures.
In such companies, regional or global businesses now have clear priority
(are 'prime', in ICI-speak), while the geographic dimension holds sway only
over services and perhaps some aspects of sales and marketing.
All the same, there is manifest pressure within Nestle, as at its
competitors, to create as many cross-border products as possible. Hence, in
part, this spring's nomination for the first time of a chief operating
officer to serve immediately under Helmut Maucher, with special
responsibility for food.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Management: Lean regime for a fitter future - The
transformation of Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company which has a reputation for Swiss conservatism, Nestle has
developed a remarkable habit of stirring things up.
Controversial takeovers in the US, UK and Italy of famous brand companies
such as Carnation, Rowntree and Buitoni have now been followed by an even
bigger cause celebre: this year's successful battle royal in France for
Perrier, against the Italian house of Agnelli.
While the outside world had its eyes glued on the Perrier saga, Nestle's
stirrers were hard at work on a much quieter but more important front:
themselves. Or, more precisely, the way their 1,600-person head office is
organised, and the methods by which it wields influence over Nestle's vast
empire in more than 100 countries.
One top manager at the normally placid corporate headquarters in Vevey, on
the banks of Lake Geneva, calls the reorganisation 'the biggest revolution
at Nestle for 30 years'. Not surprisingly, he says that 'it provoked a lot
of internal resistance when it was first announced' - both at head office
and out in the markets.
Appropriately for the manufacturer of a product line called Lean Cuisine,
the purpose of the reorganisation is to make Nestle slimmer, faster and more
coherent. From a belt and braces giant which one of its critics complains
'is rarely first with any new product', the company is trying to turn itself
into a low cost, fleet-footed innovator.
Not only that, but with the regionalisation of markets in Europe and
elsewhere - in some, though not all, product lines  - Nestle also wants to
overcome its version of the eternal 'not invented here' syndrome.
This besets companies in many industries, but nowhere more than in food,
where the phenomenon encourages managers in one country to be slow to
introduce products which have been successful in others.
To accomplish this ambitious transformation, Nestle has taken five main
actions:
It has abandoned its proud but outdated history of organising its head
office, and some of its country companies, on the basis of strong,
functional departments such as financial control and production. Instead of
allowing such specialists complete control of virtually everything that is
done out in the field, most of their empires are being cut back to the bone.
Some of their members have been transferred to seven newly-created
'strategic business units' (SBUs). Each of these has worldwide strategic
(but not operational) responsibility for a particular set of businesses; one
will deal with coffee and beverages, for example, and another with food.
With a full range of functional expertise now integrated under their
command, including research co-ordinators as well as production and
marketing staff, these SBUs will practise what is known in management
parlance as 'product management'. Though arch-rivals such as Unilever and
Procter &amp; Gamble mastered this activity decades ago, Nestle has never quite
managed to do so.
The SBUs replace Nestle's previous, half-hearted HQ effort at product
management. This took the form of units misleadingly called 'product
divisions'. In fact, they were merely advisory think tanks, mainly about
marketing. 'Their managers had a very frustrating time - they had no way of
imposing anything,' says Reto Domeniconi, Nestle's finance and
administration director, who has overseen the head office reorganisation
project.
The only functional department which is not being dismembered is research
and development, although its co-ordinators are being moved to the SBUs.
Most of its other staff are already decentralised around the world.
On the operational front, it is giving its regional management units much
greater clout than before over the country companies beneath them. In the
past, Nestle's regional managers had inadequate staff to exercise their
influence properly, even though all communications between head office and
country companies had to go through them. As a result, they were 'drowning
in paper' as one insider puts it. Caught between powerful countries and
muscular functional barons at headquarters, the various zone managements
became bottlenecks in the decision making process, rather than the weighty
players they were supposed to be. Now they, like the SBUs, will the previous
HQ functional departments. The European zone will also have special
transnational co-ordination groups for selected products, such as
confectionery and petfood.
As a result of these changes, Nestle is in the process of cutting the size
of its headquarters by more than 12 per cent from the 1,600 registered last
October. The original target was lower, but initial experience with the new
organisation has shown how many - or few  - people are actually needed. Of
the 200-job reduction, about 30 will be transferred to country managements.
It is encouraging the principle of 'business asymmetry': the idea that each
business unit can be organised differently, depending on its particular
characteristics and needs; its degree of novelty or maturity, its market
share, its technology-intensity, and so on. Previously the functional barons
at headquarters enforced a blanket 'Nestle way' of doing things.
This encouraged functional excellence, but it also landed many businesses
and countries with cost structures and decision making procedures that were
totally unsuitable. The production function, probably the most powerful in
the company, was especially at fault here. One insider complains of its
'cumbersome gold tap and bath plug mentality'.
In essence, Nestle's reorganisation is a customised variation on an eternal
organisational challenge which besets all companies of any size: constant
tension between centralisation and decentralisation. There is no single
'correct' combination of the two: it varies according to circumstances and
over time.
Nestle's reorganisation is summed up with characteristic Italianate gusto by
Camillo Pagano, its much respected former marketing chief, who has just
retired.
'We needed to find the right balance between the dogma of the Vatican and
the energy of the periphery,' he says. For the moment, anyway, Nestle may
possibly have done so.

Hamish Leslie Melville is another in a recent series of London fund managers
who are retiring from the city to take senior posts in Edinburgh in their
middle age. Leslie Melville, who is 47, yesterday joined Dunedin Fund
Managers, which is part of British Linen Bank, a subsidiary of Bank of
Scotland, and will succeed Donald Marr (61) as its chairman in July.
Until the end of last year Leslie Melville, a Scot, was chairman of Capel
Cure Myers Capital Management. Earlier in his career he had spent 15 years
with Hambros Bank (his mother was a Hambro) and was subsequently founder and
chief executive of Enskilda Securities, an international merchant bank.
Leslie Melville is following a similar path to James Dawnay, 45 and with
Scottish connections, who was chairman of Mercury Fund Managers until late
last year.
He has joined the board of Martin Currie, another Edinburgh fund management
company, where he has become director of corporate development, as well as
becoming vice-president of Martin Currie Inc, which manages the group's
North American business.

TICEHURST AND ANOTHER v BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLC (FT, April 1)
About 30,000 of the 40,000 executives employed by BT in certain grades were
represented by the Society of Telecom Executives (STE), a trade union. From
about June 1989, in order to seek a pay increase, its members took part in
industrial action short of striking, described as 'withdrawal of goodwill'.
Two managers were awarded wages after the judge at first instance found that
their refusal to sign an undertaking not to take any further industrial
action was not a breach of contract. The Court of Appeal accepted BT's
contention that if an employee was willing to perform only part of his or
her duties, or declined to carry them out properly with the object of
damaging the employer's business, the employer was not obliged to accept
performance short of full performance and was entitled to refuse to permit
the employee to work and to refuse to pay wages.
PRESIDENT OF INDIA v JADRANSKA SLOBODNA PLOVIDBA (FT, April 3)
Disputes arising between charterers and shipowners under a charterparty were
referred to arbitration in London. By an interim award, the charterers were
ordered to pay to the owners Dollars 3,142 and the arbitrators then made a
subsequent 'final award as to costs'. That award was substantially adverse
to the charterers who issued a notice of motion for an order that it be
remitted to the arbitrators on the ground of misconduct under section 22 of
the Arbitration Act 1950. The arbitrators had separately furnished the
parties with 'confidential' reasons for their decision. Refusing the
charterers' application, Mr Justice Hobhouse stated that where, as here,
there had been a separate award on costs, the parties had to follow the
procedures and requirements of section 1 of 1979 Arbitration Act and that
required satisfying stringent criteria for grant of leave (see The Nema
(1982) AC 724). The section 22 procedure might only be invoked where there
had been some actual misconduct, such as excess of jurisdiction, procedural
mishap, breach of natural justice, or failure to complete, and not simply
some alleged unjudicial exercise of the discretion.
ASHMORE AND OTHERS v CORPORATION OF LLOYD'S (FT, April 7)
The plaintiffs, who became Lloyd's Names at various times between January
1971 and December 1981, were members of syndicates managed by Oakeley
Vaughan (Underwriting) Ltd. They claimed damages from Lloyd's for losses on
insurance contracts entered into by OVU as managing agent in 1980-83. The
plaintiffs appealed against the judge's order that the preliminary points of
law be argued as to whether Lloyd's owed them the alleged duties and the
Court of Appeal set aside that order. Allowing Lloyd's appeal that the order
be restored, the House of Lords stated that there had been a tendency in
some cases for legal advisers, pressed by clients, to make every point
conceivable and inconceivable without judgment or discrimination. Where a
judge for reasons which were not plainly wrong made an interlocutory
decision in the trial courts, it should be respected by the parties and, if
challenged by them, it should be upheld by an appellate court unless the
judge was plainly wrong.
OWENS BANK LTD v BRACCO AND ANOTHER (FT, April 8)
The bank had applied to register a judgment of the St Vincent High Court
against Mr Bracco and Bracco Industria for more than SFr10m. After initial
registration, Bracco applied for an issue to be tried under section 9(2)(d)
of the Administration of Justice Act 1920 as to whether the St Vincent
judgment had been obtained by fraud. At first instance and in the Court of
Appeal, it was held that the issue should be tried. Dismissing the bank's
appeal, the House of Lords stated that an English judgment was final and
conclusive as to the issues decided and it was to preserve that finality
that any attempt to reopen litigation, even on the grounds of fraud, had to
be confined within very restrictive limits. However, under section 9(2)(d)
of the Administration of Justice Act 1920, construed as it must be, as an
adoption of the common law approach to foreign judgments, finality to a
judgment was specifically denied if it could be shown to have been obtained
by fraud.
GRAZIELLA FERRAZ (FT, April 10)
Pursuant to an arbitration clause in a charterparty, the charterers and
shipowners each appointed an arbitrator and the two arbitrators then
appointed a third one. However, since the interim final award was issued the
arbitrator appointed by the charterers died and they then nominated another
person in his stead and asked a declaration from the court that it was a
valid appointment under section 7 (a) of the Arbitration Act 1950. Refusing
the application but making an order under section 10(1)(b) of the Act
appointing the replacement, Hirst J stated that the charterers could not
invoke section 7 as that provision applied to two and not to three
arbitrators. There was a lacuna in arbitration procedure and the drawbacks
were exemplified by the present case where, in addition to the costs
incurred in relation to the originating summons itself, the charterers had
to undertake two expensive service processes out of the jurisdiction in
order to invoke section 10, rather than the very simple and inexpensive
procedure under section 7.
REGINA v PANEL ON TAKE- OVERS AND MERGERS, EX PARTE FAYED AND OTHERS (FT,
April 14)
In 1987, Lonrho issued a writ against the Fayed brothers alleging that they
had induced the secretary of state to refrain from referring the proposed
acquisition to the MMC by means of false representations about themselves,
their background and their source of finance. The writ claimed for the lost
opportunity to acquire House of Fraser and sought damages for interference
with business by unlawful means. A DTI report, of inspectors appointed to
investigate the circumstances surrounding acquisition of the shares, was
severely critical of the Fayeds. In 1991, in response to the Takeover
Panel's allegations of possible breaches of the City Code, lawyers for the
Fayeds sought an adjournment on the ground that the Panel's finding might
prejudice their clients' position in the 1987 litigation but the application
was refused. On the Fayeds' unsuccessful application to the Court of Appeal,
it was held that a court could intervene to prevent injustice where
continuation of one set of proceedings might prejudice the fair trial of
another. But it was a power which had to be exercised with great care, and
only where there was a real risk of serious prejudice which might lead to
injustice.
THE LEFTHERO (FT, April 15)
Clause 28 of a charterparty provided that neither the vessel, the owners,
master nor charterers should be responsible for any delay resulting from
'Act of God, act of war, perils of the seas . . . restraint of princes . . .
.' In the instant case, at the height of the Iran-Iraq war, the vessel was
bound for Bandar Khomeini from Bandar Abbas but had to discharge at Bushire
after two attempts to make the port. The arbitrators held that the action in
requiring the vessel to return to Bushire fell within 'restraint of princes'
clause with reference to the charterers' claim for damages for the owners'
failure to discharge at Bandar Khomeini. However, they held that the clause
did not protect the charterers on the owners' counterclaim for demurrage.
Their decision was reversed at first in stance. While on the face of it the
words of clause 28 were wide enough to cover charterers' delay in
discharging where it arose from restraint of princes, it had long been the
law that to protect a charterer against liability for demurrage, the
language of the exceptions clause had to be clearly worded to that effect.
Moreover, the Court of Appeal stated in allowing the owners' appeal and
holding that the charterers were liable to them for demurrage, the general
rule was applicable even though the vessel was not already on demurrage when
the peril operated.

David Shilson, a Bank of England veteran, is to replace Nigel Falls, as the
Bank's eyes and ears in Scotland. He takes over as agent at the Bank's
Glasgow office on 18 May.
For diplomatic reasons the Bank of England has never established a full
branch north of the border, but despite the small size of its Glasgow
outfit, Shilson will be more important than many of the Bank's other agents
around the United Kingdom. Charged with liaising with local industry, one of
his main tasks will be to help monitor the health of the local economy at a
particularly sensitive time in Scotland's political affairs.
While not a Scot, Shilson did study classics at St Andrews University. Aged
54, he is considerably older and more experienced than Aberdeen-born Nigel
Falls, 46, who spent five years as the previous agent.
Having joined the Bank in 1961, Shilson has worked in the Overseas
Department, the Economic Intelligence Department and the Industrial Finance
Division where he was an adviser responsible for the financing of small
firms. In between he was seconded to the Cabinet Office for three years and
the National Economic Development Office for two and a half years. His most
recent job at the Bank was as career development adviser.

FT  06 MAY 92 / People: Chipping away at Fortress Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
S G Warburg has hired Michael Treichl, previously a managing director at
Merrill Lynch in New York, to head up its German corporate finance
activities, initially from London.
Treichl arrived firmly on the German merger and acquisition scene a couple
of years ago with the Pirelli debacle. Merrill was one of the Italians'
advisers in the -in all but name - hostile, and unsuccessful, bid for German
tyre company Continental. Firmly identified with those chipping away at
Fortress Germany, he is well respected by anyone who advocates greater
transparency and shareholder democracy among German companies.
He joins Warburgs attracted by 'the firm's name .and its special historical
links to Germany' and will move to Munich in a year or two as the business
builds.
While competitors sniff that it has yet to make its mark as a European
rather than a UK merchant bank, Warburgs has quietly been assembling some of
the juicier mandates around. The privatisation of east German hotel chain
Interhotel for instance was a Warburg deal. Probably the most interesting
current mandate in Treichl's new stable is Aachener &amp; Munchener, which
retained the UK merchant bank after French insurer AGF assembled its 25 per
cent stake.
Viennese by birth, with an education spanning Eton, Vienna University and
Harvard, Treichl, who is now nearly 41, once turned down a job offer from
Sir Siegmund Warburg because he wanted to work in America; he joined White
Weld in New York instead. His subsequent career took him via CSFB in London
and Tokyo, and back to New York for Lazard Freres - where among a long list
of big name deals he also admits to having advised Midland on the
ill-starred Crocker purchase.
He had been at Merrill since 1988 on the international M &amp; A side, and
claims to have parted amicably. He tots up the value of completed
transactions to his name as 'nearly DM70bn' (Pounds 24bn).

water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water is hoping to benefit from tough European Community rules on
water purity by meeting the demand for cost-effective technology to remove
pesticides from drinking water supplies.
The UK water group, which operates in a largely agricultural area and has
developed particular expertise in removing contaminants, has set up a joint
venture with Humphreys &amp; Glasgow International, a subsidiary of US-based
Enserch.
The 50:50 joint venture company, Anglian H&amp;G, will market its technology in
the use and regeneration of granular activated carbon (GAC), which until now
has been used mainly to improve the taste and colour of drinking water.
But researchers have discovered that GAC is effective in absorbing
pesticides, herbicides and other contaminants in the water supply. It works
by attracting and capturing the molecules of contaminants in millions of
tiny holes.
One of the biggest challenges which Anglian and H&amp;G have addressed is how to
ensure that the GAC is replenished before it becomes saturated and stops
working. A separate research and development programme undertaken by Anglian
with Severn Trent Water has produced a reliable method for removing the
spent carbon from a filtration plant and regenerating it in a furnace for
recycling.
H&amp;G has built a pilot plant for Anglian and Severn Trent Water at Grafham
near Huntingdon which is capable of handling 10 tonnes of GAC a day. Jim
Peddie, managing director of Anglian Water Commercial Developments,
estimates that in the UK alone there is a need for 10 plants of this size.
Over the next few years drinking water throughout Europe must meet standards
laid down by the EC which set a maximum admissible concentrations (Mac) for
a range of contaminants. The new pesticide Mac requires less than 0.1
micrograms per litre compared with the old rules before 1989 which allowed
up to 30 micrograms per litre.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Fresh aid call for smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED call for incentives to help smaller companies to invest in
manufacturing technology has come from Sir Ronald Halstead, president of the
Engineering Industries Association and deputy chairman of British Steel.
The plea, coupled with strong criticism of UK banks for their attitude
towards smaller companies, echoes the campaign in the machine tool industry
for investment incentives to encourage purchases of manufacturing equipment.
The campaign, organised by the Machine Tool Technologies Association, has
been given new impetus by the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as Trade
and Industry Secretary.
Sir Ronald, speaking on a visit to Bridgeport Machines, the Leicester-based
machine tool builder, said the key to economic recovery and future
prosperity lay in the thousands of smaller companies that collectively
contribute much of industrial output.
He said it was high time that the UK, through the Department of Trade and
Industry and leading financial institutions, took a more positive approach
towards encouraging the growth and development of smaller companies, as was
the practice in most other countries.
Smaller companies' needs could often be met through specific measures.
His plea comes as the machine tool industry meets today for the start of the
Mach '92 exhibition at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre.
Yesterday Mr David Shail, managing director of Sandvik Coromant UK, the
Swedish-owned supplier of cemented carbide tooling and related systems, said
inquiries for investment-related business had increased in the past two
months, although they had yet to be converted into orders.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Staff discounts freed of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS selling discounted goods to their staff will be required to levy
VAT only on the reduced price, in a reversal of the previous position held
by Customs and Excise.
The decision - which will be announced next week  - follows vigorous
complaints from employers, particularly in the retail trade. It will come
into effect from May 15.
In the past Customs has argued that employees who receive staff discounts as
a condition of the terms of their contract or when they sell goods on to
third parties should pay VAT on the full market price.
Customs said yesterday that the existing position was 'a bit of an
absurdity' and that it had normally proved very difficult in practice to
demonstrate cases where VAT should be charged on the retail price.
The ruling will mean that, for example, where clothing with a retail price
of Pounds 100 was sold to staff at Pounds 80, staff will now always be
required to pay VAT only on Pounds 80.
Tax specialists are trying to work out whether those few companies that have
paid the full VAT on the discounts will be eligible for a refund.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Campaign for women claims growing support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPORTUNITY 2000, the business-led campaign to improve the position of women
at work, now involves 20 per cent of the workforce, according to Business in
the Community, the voluntary organisation for business initiatives, which is
running it .
The campaign was launched six months ago by Mr John Major, the prime
minister. An initial 62 organisations, most of them household names, signed
up at the launch last October. Original members of the campaign included
British Airways, the BBC, NatWest Bank and J. Sainsbury.
Business in the Community said yesterday that since the launch the
recruitment of a second wave of companies had brought total membership to
110, covering 5m employees - 20 per cent of the workforce. The total
includes 20 government departments.
Each organisation that signs up to the campaign pledges to draw up goals to
monitor and improve the position of its female employees. Measures include
the introduction of flexible working patterns, policies on sexual harassment
and women-only training.
Some companies have decided to set numerical targets for the employment and
promotion of women. Other organisations have rejected such a move because of
fears of possible discrimination against male employees. A Financial Times
survey published last month found the idea of numerical targets gaining
ground among companies.
Lady Howe, who chaired the Opportunity 2000 launch committee, said: 'What
started as a drip in terms of changing attitudes towards women at work will
swell to a stream.' She said it was expected that an increasing number of
women would be appointed to company boards in the next few months.
MSF, the general technical union, said yesterday that it welcomed the
Opportunity 2000 initiative but was sceptical about the benefits to the
majority of working women 'unless it was accompanied by direct assistance
from employers'. The very people who most needed a career break - junior
staff and single parents  - could not afford to take unpaid leave, the union
said. Similarly, flexible working patterns were undoubtedly of benefit but
might be of little use if childcare arrangements were non-existent or
unaffordable.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, advised Welsh electors yesterday to follow
the lead of the general election and return Conservative candidates at
tomorrow's local elections.
He said: 'The government has helped to transform the face of Wales, not
least through the garden festival in Ebbw Vale, which opened its doors last
Friday.
'In local government, we have sought to provide the best services at the
lowest possible cost to the taxpayer - a contrast with the Labour party's
commitment to building extravagant temples to municipal socialism at the
voters' expense.'
Mr Hunt was speaking in Newport, one of only four Welsh boroughs where
voting is being held. All are dominated by Labour. The boroughs are Swansea,
where Labour has 31 seats out of the 51 and the Conservatives nine; Port
Talbot, where Labour has 24 of the 31 seats and the Conservatives are
unrepresented; the Rhondda, where Labour has 29 of the 33 seats and the
Conservatives are also unrepresented; and Newport, where Labour has 40 seats
and the Conservatives seven.
The four boroughs are the last of the 37 in Wales that hold elections every
year, a third of the councillors retiring in rotation. All the others go to
the polls every four years, with the next elections scheduled for 1995.
There are, however, doubts over whether the counties and boroughs will go to
the polls again in their present form, as local-government reorganisation is
high on the political agenda.

<TEXT>
THE ROW between France and the US over Franco-American air capacity has come
to a head with the French government announcing it has abandoned the
55-year-old agreement on transatlantic air traffic.
France has for months been fighting the US over its proposals to increase
its transatlantic routes. Unless the two countries can strike a compromise,
there is a risk of serious disruption to flights between France and the US,
although the French transport ministry said there will be no immediate break
in services.
The reason for the dispute is a proposal by the US Trade Department to
increase the volume of traffic from eight American airlines to and from
France by 35 per cent this year.
The French government has also recently been in dispute with Washington over
other trade issues, notably the farm subsidies in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
In the air capacity dispute, France says the increase should be limited to
15 per cent. Air France has campaigned strongly to limit the increase in
transatlantic US traffic. The airline, which makes around 15 per cent of its
annual sales from transatlantic flights, is concerned that the profitability
of its routes would come under pressure if there were greater competition
from US airlines.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDRED of Lebanese demonstrators yesterday protested against the collapse
of the Lebanese pound by setting fire to the home of the country's finance
minister, beating up policemen, closing down businesses and ransacking
foreign exchange shops.
The unrest broke out after radio broadcasts announced that the pound, once
one of the strongest currencies in the region, was selling at an all-time
low of LPounds 2,100 to the dollar on the black market. It traded at LPounds
2.5 to the dollar before the 1975-90 civil war.
Protesters in the southern city of Tyre shouting 'Down with a government
that starves its people,' converged on the home of Mr Ali Al-Khalil, the
finance minister, before burning it down. Mr Khalil was in Beirut at the
time and the crowd of around 300 left when 25 soldiers arrived.
Yesterday's riots marked the first violent expressions of protest since
Lebanon's economic crisis began to worsen in February. The government sent
troops to Sidon and Tyre to reopen roads blocked by hundreds of burning
tyres, while the country's main trade union called a three-day general
strike to begin today.
However, the Confederation of Trade Unions which called the strike rejected
proposals for unlimited action because it would only increase people's
suffering. The general exhaustion which followed the end of 15 years of
civil war, along with the continued the presence in the country of 40,000
Syrian troops, make a full-scale revolt unlikely.
Since the Lebanese pound began a precipitate decline in February prices of
basic commodities have in some cases doubled or trebled. Most wage-earners
are paid in Lebanese pounds and many people say they never knew such
hardship even during the war.
Merchants - who must pay dollars for their imports  - claim they are still
making losses. Yesterday petrol stations and shops refused to accept
Lebanese pounds.
The crisis contrasts with the optimism last summer, when the Central Bank
stabilised the pound at LPounds 879 to the dollar and tens of thousands of
Lebanese emigrees returned to the country. But, disillusioned by its
shattered infrastructure, red tape and corruption, most returnees left in
the autumn and the repatriation of funds stopped.
Since the war ended in 1990, promised reconstruction aid has also failed to
materialise. The pound began to plunge in February after private sector pay
rose by more than 100 per cent and the Central Bank announced that it would
no longer deplete its limited reserves to shore up the pound.
Mr Omar Karami, the prime minister, put the present plunge in confidence
down to a 'foreign plot' against the Lebanese economy, but banking and
business sources say the the crisis has more to do with government
over-spending and mismanagement.
Nevertheless, the government has increased its revenues in the past two
months, set a ceiling on spending and limited its borrowing from the Central
Bank. But these measures have not succeeded in restoring confidence and the
crisis now appears as much political as economic.
Anger has focused on Mr Karami, who yesterday went to Damascus for talks
with Syrian officials - prompting speculation that he may resign. An Nahar,
the respected Beirut newspaper, said that the Karami government might not
last until the end of the week and predicted he would be replaced by Dr
Selim El-Hoss, the economist and former prime minister, or by Mr Rafiq
Hariri, the Lebanese-born Saudi multi-millionaire.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Islamic extremism haunts Egypt's elite: The deaths of 13
people have deepened concern about militancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISLAMIC extremists in Egypt recently called for the demolition of Cairo's
observation tower on Gezira island in the Nile on the grounds that it
resembled a giant phallus and was therefore detrimental to public morality.
Egypt's intellectuals chortle over these sorts of pronouncements and wonder
whether the country's famed Pharonic obelisks may not be the next target of
fundamentalist wrath. At the same time they worry about the restless Islamic
tide that yields such strange views.
Debate has sharpened in recent months in the dusty Nile-side salons of the
bourgeoisie and on university campuses among a frustrated elite about the
best way to combat the more irrational impulses of the Islamic tendency.
Criticism of the government's handling of the problem is pervasive.
Mr Milad Hannah, a professor of engineering at Ain Shams university in
Cairo, decries official policy which seeks to co-opt the Islamic trend by
making the government appear more Islamic than the Islamicists. Under
government sponsorship, Mr Hannah says, 'Egypt is a very good candidate for
Islamic fundamentalism. It is on the road to fundamentalism.'
Increased anxiety among the elite stems particularly from the upheavals in
Algeria after the success of an Islamic party in the polls; from the recent
case in Egypt of a novelist sentenced to prison for blasphemy against Islam
and also from a worrying incidence of Moslem attacks against Christians and
Christian property, including the sectarian violence in Upper Egypt this
week in which 13 people were killed.
Mr Hannah, like other prominent Egyptian writers on the subject, believe
that the government's information and education policies are playing into
the hands of Islamic militants by allowing the public media to be used to
'sell Islam' in the hope that 'official Islam', what he describes as 'mufti
Islam', will submerge the 'unofficial' version.
At the same time, the authorities resort to oppression, including detention
without trial under the emergency laws, to curb Islamic groups. This 'carrot
and stick' approach has enabled the government thus far to keep the lid on
Islamic militancy, but many Egyptian commentators question this strategy as
a long-term panacea.
Ms Hala Mustapha, an expert on Islam at Al Ahram Strategic Studies Centre,
believes that fewer television hours should be devoted to Islamic themes;
that the education system should be reformed to lessen emphasis on Islamic
teaching; that the great Islamic teaching university of Al Azhar should be
opened to more liberal ideas; and, perhaps most important, that real public
debate should be allowed in the mass media between the Islamicists and
secularists.
Ms Mustapha cites the recent example of a stirring discussion between the
two sides at the Cairo book fair where voices for and against the separation
of church and state were raised in a spirited and for the most part
good-natured debate; but barely a word of this discussion filtered into the
government-controlled media.
Mr Farag Foda, a participant in the book fair debate and a frequent and
outspoken critic of Islamic militancy, believes that the best way for the
government to combat the extremists is to open the air waves to debate.
'Media and education are the long-run way to avoid a confrontation,' he
says. Mr Foda and others say the importance of radio and television in a
country where the rate of illiteracy is 70 per cent cannot be
underestimated, but broadcasting policy remains rooted in the past with the
government apparently fearful of relaxing its vice-like grip on programming.
Meanwhile, disaffected youth despairing of finding work - unemployment is
above 20 per cent - seek solace in religion, but not the variety espoused
officially: rather, they gravitate towards zawyias, literally 'corners'
(rooms or areas set aside in private houses) where fundamentalists spread
their message that militant Islam is 'the solution' to the country's ills.
'The zawyias are deep in the lanes and hearts of Egyptians,' says Mr Hannah.
'There, people listen to another type of Islam, fundamentalist Islam which
preaches violence, hatred of Christians and Jihad (Holy War).'
To the perennial question: whether militant Islam in Egypt is again on one
of its periodic upswings there appears no consensus. Mr Foda believes it is
not, but he cautions that the government cannot afford to be complacent,
especially at a time when International Monetary Fund-inspired price
increases are causing widespread hardship.
Secularists have been heartened by the sterner tone adopted recently by
President Hosni Mubarak towards Islamic extremists. They hope this reveals
the beginning of an awareness of the real challenge faced by the
authorities.
The mainstream Islamic movement in Egypt, the Moslem Brotherhood, meanwhile
bides its time, apparently convinced that it remains the only alternative to
the established order.

Some of 13 Moslem fundamentalists after they were sentenced to hang at a
military court in the Algerian desert town of Ouargla on Monday. They were
convicted of an attack on a border post in which three guards were killed.
Seven more went on trial yesterday, accused of a raid on a naval post in
Algiers last February in which 10 people died. Gunfire erupted in the city's
Bab el-Oued Moslem stronghold last night as police surrounded the area.

THE European Community should have a full seat at the International Energy
Agency (IEA), one of the agency's directors said yesterday.
The European Commission is attempting to persuade the 12 EC member states
that it should be allowed to speak for them at the IEA, the Paris-based
agency co-ordinating energy crisis management policy for OECD countries.
Mr Quincey Lumsden, IEA director responsible for oil market developments,
told an oil and gas conference in Luanda, capital of Angola, he hoped the
Community would have a seat in its own right, stressing this was a personal
view. Commission officials said his comments would strengthen its hand in
talks with EC members. If the 12 agree, accession to the IEA should be a
formality.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Argentina to privatise nuclear power plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN announcement by Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that he
intends to privatise part of the country's nuclear power industry has run
into stiff opposition.
The minister has said he wants to sell two nuclear power stations next year
to raise money to fund the completion of a third nuclear generator. His plan
focuses on the 357MW Atucha I unit close to Buenos Aires and the 648MW
Embalse plant in the central province of Cordoba.
The money raised from the sale would be used to complete the 750MW Atucha II
unit, which has been delayed for almost 10 years.
It is being built largely with local technology and is already 61 per cent
over budget - the government has spent Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) on the
plant, with completion costing a further Dollars 900m.
However, Mr Eduardo Bauza, President Carlos Menem's chief of staff, has
warned that private operators could not be relied on to provide sufficient
security and safety precautions. The Atucha I plant has suffered a series of
accidents and systems failures, although the National Nuclear Energy
Commission, which operates the station, insists that safety has never been
threatened.
Staff at the plant are reported to have attacked Mr Cavallo's idea, claiming
that reducing the state's role in the industry was further evidence of
Argentina's submission to the US. Washington has voiced concern that
Argentina's nuclear technology is being leaked to 'unreliable' regimes such
as Iran.
Last month Argentina introduced new export controls, restricting the sale of
sensitive technologies.

FT  06 MAY 92 / EC agrees joint strategy for Rio Earth Summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday agreed to commit itself to a near doubling
of development aid to the third world, but it still can not agree on the
timing.
Environment and development ministers of the 12 also agreed a joint strategy
to present to next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. This would be fed
into the Convention on Climate Change and has included in it the possibility
of an energy tax to combat carbon dioxide emissions.
However, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, denounced the
latest draft of the UN-sponsored compromise on the global warming convention
as 'a sell-out' designed to accommodate the US, which is reluctant to commit
itself to emission reduction targets.
The EC has agreed to stabilise CO emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000,
and the Commission is expected next week to approve a mixed carbon-energy
tax of up to the equivalent of Dollars 10 (Pounds 5.60) on a barrel of oil.
It hopes the 12 will back the tax in principle just before the Rio summit,
although it recognises that many member states would be unwilling to risk
damaging the competitive position of their industry unless the US and Japan
were willing to use similar instruments to reduce emissions.
The Commission also wants to swing the EC behind an Argentine and Brazilian
proposal for a global carbon tax equivalent to Dollars 1 per barrel of oil,
the proceeds of which would go to developing countries to help them install
energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technology.
Only France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Italy were yesterday prepared to
commit themselves to reaching the agreed aid target, of 0.7 per cent of
gross national product, by the year 2000, the emissions stabilisation target
date. The UK, Germany and Belgium wanted a less-binding 'as soon as
possible' target, while Spain, Ireland and Greece shied away even from this.
A joint position is expected to be agreed either by finance ministers on May
19, or when environment ministers next meet, on May 26.
World Bank figures for 1989 show average EC official development aid
totalling 0.43 per cent of GNP, against 0.32 per cent for Japan and 0.15 per
cent from the US. The UK's effort was 0.31 per cent of GNP.
Neither the US nor Japan are prepared to make specific commitments to
reaching the 0.7 per cent target - recommended more than a decade ago by the
UN - by 2000. The UN believes that if all industrialised countries adopt the
target, this will provide an extra Dollars 50bn for LDCs, in addition to the
Dollars 55bn official aid now received.
The aid issue is linked to the climate convention's chances of success. As
one UK official put it, the developing countries 'want their quid for our
quo,' money and a firm commitment by the industrialised countries to reduce
the more than three quarters of global CO emissions they are responsible
for.
Mr Ripa di Meana said the latest UN draft on the convention was 'so full of
loopholes' that it was 'completely unacceptable'. Asked whether flexibility
was not an acceptable price to get the US on board, he forecast that the
draft's enumeration of possible exemptions would 'lead to a bitter
North-South clash' at Rio.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Swiss wonder if it's safe to get into the water: Some see
IMF and World Bank entry as little more than leaping in with the sharks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY FEW months, an orderly row of campaign posters appears in the main
squares of Swiss towns and cities signalling the start of campaigning for
another round of plebiscites.
Among those erected last week in preparation for votes on May 17, one stands
out from 100 paces. It features the unmistakable and terrifying image of a
shark's open mouth. 'Down with the murderous tactics of the finance sharks,'
screams the slogan beside the great beast. The reference, it turns out, is
to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Opposition to Switzerland joining those institutions is strongly felt, it
seems. And, by all accounts, the referendum result will be a close one, with
the odds slightly in favour of rejection. This would be a serious blow for
the government in view of other plebiscites due in the next few months on
whether Switzerland should move towards joining the European Community.
The campaign is also remarkable for bringing together the most unlikely
bedfellows - left-wingers and Greens who feel IMF and World Bank policies
towards third world countries are too brutal, and conservatives who think
Fund membership fees are a waste of money.
'The IMF is interested only in keeping third world countries stable so they
can pay back their huge debts to the west,' says Mr Roland Brunner, a member
of the left-Green action committee opposing membership. 'There is no
advantage for the third world in the way the IMF works, lending them money
to pay interest on the excessive debts they already have.'
On the right of the political spectrum, there is no complaint about IMF
policies. The issue is a more practical one. 'The cost of joining is money
thrown out of the window,' says Mr Jurg Scherrer, president of the
Automobile Party, a fringe group known mainly for wanting fewer controls on
cars and more on immigrants.
'At the moment, we are participants in the IMF's projects when we choose to
be,' he says. 'We can look at each project on a case-by-case basis. If we
were a member, we would have only one vote and it would make no difference.'
Mr Scherrer recoils at the suggestion that he is in league with the left in
this battle. 'We are certainly not collaborating with the Green party on
this. Our reasons for opposing membership are totally different from
theirs.'
The federal government, which strongly favours joining the IMF and World
Bank, has pulled out all the stops in advocating its case. In late March, it
trotted out the foreign, finance and economics ministers, and the central
bank president, to emphasise the importance of Switzerland playing a full
role in international institutions.
Mr Rene Felber, foreign minister, said Switzerland's observer status at the
IMF and the World Bank was proving more and more inadequate and would become
increasingly meaningless.
The president of the Swiss National Bank, Mr Markus Lusser, said IMF
membership would cost only about SFr40m (Pounds 14.8m) a year in the
interest revenue that Switzerland would lose by having to deposit money with
the fund at below market rates. 'We are one of the world's richest
countries,' he said. 'This good fortune makes us duty bound to help other
countries.'
Mr Otto Stich, finance minister, rejected arguments that the tough
conditions the IMF attached to its aid to developing countries hurt the
poorer sections of their populations. 'The IMF is not the cause of such
circumstances. It is called in as an emergency doctor,' he said.
While all four parties in the governing coalition officially support the
government's stance, there are mavericks, the most important of whom is Mr
Christoph Blocher. Charismatic leader of the conservative Swiss People's
Party in the Zurich canton, Mr Blocher shares the views of the Automobile
Party, and has nothing but disdain for federal officials' desire to join.
'They just want to be members of the club.'
Both sides admit the result of the voting is uncertain. Mr Scherrer recalled
that the voters had turned down a proposal to join the United Nations as
recently as 1986. He also pointed to the over-stretched federal budget.
A leading Zurich banker said the decisive factor would probably be the
traditional reluctance of Swiss voters to approve any spending for which
they could not see concrete results.

FT  06 MAY 92 / UN envoy delayed by snipers: Goulding reaches Sarajevo after
being trapped at military base

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS special envoy Marrack Goulding reached Sarajevo, capital of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, yesterday after after sniper fire in surrounding hills
had stranded him for several hours at a helicopter base outside the city.
He was escorted into Sarajevo by General Satish Nambiar, commander of UN
peace-keeping forces, who had driven out to try to escort him into the city
for talks with President Alija Izetbegovic.
Mr Goulding's mission to assess the feasibility of sending a peace-keeping
force to the republic coincided with an ultimatum from the largely Moslem
Bosnian militias to the Yugoslav federal army to withdraw from the capital
by midnight tonight. The ultimatum was issued after European Community
monitors appeared to have failed to arrange a meeting between army and
Bosnian leaders.
The continuing violence forced 25 monitors to withdraw from Sarajevo,
leaving a nine-member crew, including Mr Colm Doyle, an Irish army major and
the special envoy of Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC conference on
Yugoslavia. Mr Doyle called the army's bombardment of Sarajevo 'totally
unacceptable'.
Stepping up the mutual recriminations, the Bosnian Defence Force accused the
army of 'unleashing a merciless bombardment' from its barracks in the city,
and from the military hospital. The army retorted that the barracks were
under siege by Bosnian forces.
In an apparent effort to stave off international criticism, the presidency
of the new Serb-dominated Yugoslavia ordered its citizens - Serb and
Montenegrin soldiers and officers - to withdraw from Bosnia within 15 days.
However, the call was rhetorical since more than 80 per cent of 80,000
federal soldiers stationed in Bosnia are Bosnian Serbs.
In Sarajevo, palls of smoke streamed out of buildings set ablaze during 22
hours of continuing shelling by the federal army. Sarajevo radio said the
streets were littered with corpses but casualty figures could not be
confirmed. Fighting was also reported in other parts of the republic.
The Moslems are backed by Croats who have joined forces against the Serbs
and the federal army in a battle for control of strategic parts of Sarajevo.
But the Moslem-Croat coalition which supports Bosnian independence looks
fragile. Serb leaders hinted yesterday that Serbia and Croatia could reach
agreement on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina, leaving Moslems without a
homeland.
Mr Tomislav Sipovac, a member of the government of the self-proclaimed Serb
republic of Bosnia, which does not want to belong to an independent Bosnia,
was quoted by Tanjug as saying: 'There is very little difference between the
Croat and Serb positions. . . . We can very quickly make an agreement. . . .
because we have no territorial disputes.'
Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, was quoted in Polityka, the Serbian
daily, as saying Bosnia could survive as an independent state only if the
republic was divided on a confederal basis into three ethnic units.

<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday launched a scheme giving consultants free rein to sell
medium-sized state companies.
Under the 'simplified privatisation' plan, the state is devolving to private
consultanting firms responsibility for 278 of the country's 2,000 state
companies, with an estimated total book value of Ft70bn (Pounds 493m).
Each company will have to choose a consultant from a list of about 130 which
will then privatise the company as it sees fit.
The fees - a percentage of the sale price on success  - are structured to
give incentives to achieve rapid and fully-priced sales and as a deterrent
against corruption.
The scheme, announced by Mr Tamas Szabo, privatisation minister, came after
the success of 437 trial privatisations of the smallest state enterprises.
The authorities say the method will become the main vehicle of Hungarian
privatisation as ever larger state companies are included.
Simplified privatisation comes in reaction to the failure of centralised
programmes, which have been crippled by lack of staff, political infighting
and government inflexibility.
The flagship 'First Privatisation Programme', launched in 1990 to sell 20 of
Hungary's most attractive companies, has run into the ground and only two
significant transactions have been concluded.

   SIMFEROPOL, CRIMEA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE parliament of Crimea yesterday declared independence in a move which is
expected further to inflame the dispute between Ukraine and Russia over who
should have control over the peninsular and the Black sea fleet which is
based there.
Crimea's declaration of independence from Ukraine does not mention Russia,
but leading separatist politicians do not conceal their hope that the
Crimea, which has a 60 per cent ethnic Russian population and only became
part of Ukraine in 1954, will eventually join Russia.
Hundreds of jubilant demonstrators ringing the parliament cheered and waved
the Russian flag when a majority of Crimean deputies backed the declaration,
which will come into force if confirmed by a referendum scheduled for August
2.
The struggle between Ukraine and Russia over the Black Sea Fleet has been a
proxy for conflicting claims to the picturesque peninsula which was annexed
to the Russian empire by Catherine the Great but used to be home to hundreds
of thousands of Crimean Tatars. More than 200,000 were exiled by Stalin in
1944 but many are now moving back to find that their old homes and land have
been taken over by Russians and Ukrainians who have dotted the coastline
with dachas and retirement homes.
'For Crimea, this means difficult days ahead,' said Mr Nikolai Bagrov,
chairman of the Crimean parliament. Exhausted by the day's passionate and
anarchic debate, Mr Bagrov acknowledged that the decision could lead to 'a
sharpening' of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict.
The declaration's announcement of 'the creation of a sovereign state, the
republic of Crimea' is intentionally open to various interpretations.
Deputies chose the weaker of two words meaning 'independence', which can be
translated as 'self-determination', and voted to begin negotiating with
Ukraine immediately.
The referendum could thus be the first step towards eventual reunification
with Russia or simply a bargaining chip to wrest greater autonomy from
Ukraine. Whatever the interpretation, it is a defeat for the Ukrainian
government which sought to forestall a referendum by offering Crimea
extensive autonomy. Crimean MPs were not appeased and many said they feared
the Ukrainian government intended to discriminate against Russians.
Mr Volodymyr Filenko, a member of a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation which
observed the debate, said one possible response from the Ukrainian
government would be to dissolve the Crimean parliament. The Crimean decision
is likely to hasten the Russian parliament's plan to consider the legality
of the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine, a move Ukrainian politicians have said
they would view as tantamount to a declaration of war.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN public sector unions yesterday responded to the prospect of peace
with the greatest show of force so far in their nine-day national strike
over pay.
More than 330,000 workers were called out as negotiators prepared for
today's resumption of talks.
'The strike has worked,' claimed Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the
oTV union. 'The employers have returned to the negotiating table on our
terms.'
Yesterday's promise from Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and chief
negotiator for the employers, to improve his previous 'final' offer of a 4.8
per cent increase at today's talks was greeted with guarded optimism in most
quarters. He is under orders from Chancellor Helmut Kohl not to send the
wrong signals to other, private sector unions still negotiating.
Ms Wulf-Mathies warned again that the stoppages would continue until an
acceptable result was achieved. Any deal must be approved by a 50 per cent
'yes' vote in a national ballot.
Engineering employers, meanwhile, threatened to lock out workers staging
further 'warning' strikes in support of their 9.5 per cent pay claim. The
fourth round of talks for the country's 4m engineers broke down without
result yesterday and without any advance on the employers' opening 3.3 per
cent offer. About 45,000 workers - 30,000 in Bavaria alone - joined in
warning strikes.
Negotiations in the printing industry were formally broken off and token
stoppages started immediately. With 50,000 more members on strike than
yesterday, the public sector unions brought Frankfurt airport, which
normally handles about 100,000 passengers a day, to a complete stop. More
than 950 flights were cancelled after fire service workers walked out.
While the airport lost an estimated DM5m in landing and take-off charges,
the Lufthansa airline said it planned to sue for losses of up to DM40m.
Airline officials said US airforce personnel should have been drafted in to
cover.
Hundreds of buses queued at Dusseldorf airport to carry an estimated 8,000
package holiday trippers to waiting aircraft across the border in Brussels,
Maastricht and Amsterdam.
The oTV said last night that the strike would be lifted at Frankfurt today,
although action would continue at Berlin and Dusseldorf.

<TEXT>
OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, plans to cut the
production workforce at its main plant by around a third over the next five
years in order to combat high costs and remain competitive.
GM said that it could now assemble some of its cars more cheaply in the UK
than in Germany.
Opel said it intended to reduce the 18,000-strong car production workforce
in Russelsheim near Frankfurt by some 6,000 people. The cuts of 1,200 a year
would be achieved without redundancies, Mr Louis Hughes, the chief
executive, said.
Opel, highly profitable in recent years, is the latest German producer to
announce job cuts. Its main domestic rival, Volkswagen, has planned
reductions of 12,500 people over the same period. Mercedes-Benz is
considering reductions of 20,000 people in the next few years. BMW is
shedding around 3,000 people in 1992.
Opel said its mid-range Opel Vectra model cost DM750 (Pounds 260) more to
produce in Russelsheim than in the UK, where it is also assembled at GM's
Vauxhall assembly plant at Luton, Bedfordshire. (The car is sold as the Opel
Vectra in continental Europe and as the Vauxhall Cavalier in the UK). Opel
said that compared with a comparable model from Japan, the cost of the
German-produced Opel Vectra was DM2,500 higher, though the Japanese figure
included total production costs against assembly costs only for the German
plants.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Bavarian caught in a storm: Why Finance Minister Waigel is
refusing to panic
</HEADLINE>

   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPARE A thought for Mr Theo Waigel, the bluff and cheerful Bavarian who has
the thankless task of steering Germany's federal budget through the stormy
costs of reunification.
Since he took over the job just three years ago, he has seen a nice tight
budgetary ship of state, actually enjoying a marginal surplus, buffeted into
a painful deficit which is variously estimated at anything from 3.5 per cent
to 6.0 per cent of gross domestic product.
He admits the situation is uncomfortable, and calls for 'iron savings', but
he refuses to overreact to the more dire prognoses of deepening structural
deficit in the German economy, threatening to drag down the entire European
economy into a vicious high interest rate-slow growth spiral.
In the past 10 days, however, he has come under attack not only from his
colleagues in the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised states, led by the US,
but also from within his own government. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics
minister, the respected independent economic institute Ifo and the
opposition Social Democrats are all questioning his assumptions, and
therefore questioning his refusal to panic.
There are two lines of argument behind the criticism. One is that Mr Waigel
and his Finance Ministry fail to include all public borrowing needs in their
calculations, in particular the costs of the Treuhand privatisation agency
in east Germany, the funds set up to service the inherited debts of the East
German state, the German Unity Fund to subsidise the new federal states, as
well as the additional spending taken on by the German railways and
telecommunications for the east.
The other argument is that his calculations of future costs are based on
over-optimistic assumptions about compensation payments for environmental
damage, for example, and modernisation of the east German housing stock.
The criticisms also cite a failure to provide adequately for other outlays:
rising bad debts on trade with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union,
the need for more cash for east European economic stabilisation, and the
demands for significant increases in the European Community budget.
The most embarrassing leak came from the Economics Ministry last week. A
much more gloomy forecast of future costs of unification suggested that
without drastic cuts, the federal budget deficit alone would not be halved
by 1995, from around DM50bn (Pounds 17bn) to DM25bn, but would actually rise
to DM55bn.
Mr Mollemann took as his starting point Mr Waigel's medium-term financial
plan for the federal budget (excluding states and local authorities) to
1995, agreed last year, which aimed at an annual increase in spending of
just 2.3 per cent, against an income growth of 5.4 per cent per year.
First he questioned the underlying economic growth rate assumption: a real
2.5 to 3.0 per cent per year on average for 1991-95.
In actual fact the 1992 growth rate is only expected to reach 1.5 per cent
for west Germany (2.0 per cent including the east) on the basis of
relatively optimistic assumptions: a successful conclusion of the Gatt
negotiations, and moderation in the national wage negotiations, as well as
international economic recovery.
He calculated that after the tax package negotiated in February between the
federal government and the German states, the federal deficit would
deteriorate appreciably (example B in table). Then he proceeded to list the
'additional substantial risks, which are both difficult to quantify and to
fix in any clear time-frame'.
They include:
New rules for compensation and indemnity yet to be agreed (original proposal
for a fund authorised to borrow up to DM10bn);
Environmental costs beyond the financial capacity of the eastern states.
Additional cash for housing modernisation and rebuilding;
Export credit guarantee bad debts, costing an extra DM1bn in this year's
supplementary budget, and 'showing a rising tendency, especially for the
Commonwealth of Independent States.'
Costs of the Delors-II EC budget proposals, estimated by the Economics
Ministry at an additional DM1.5bn in 1993, DM2.8bn in 1994, DM4.4bn in 1995;
follow-up costs from the liquidation of the Treuhand at the end of 1994,
with estimated debts of around DM250bn - from 1995 an additional debt
service cost estimated at around DM10bn.
All of which estimated as conservatively as possible in Mr Mollemann's
ministry would more than double the 1995 federal budget deficit from DM25bn
to DM55bn.
The conclusion of the paper is that spending growth will rise by 3.7 per
cent a year to 1995, instead of 2.3 per cent as planned.
Debt service costs could total DM74bn that year, or 15.7 per cent of
spending, rather than the planned DM46.4bn, or just 11 per cent.
When the spending of the states and the local authorities is included, this
scenario puts the current deficit in 1995 at 3.2 per cent of GDP instead of
the planned 2.5 per cent - outside the qualification criteria for Germany to
join the European monetary union.
Overall public sector debt would total 55.3 per cent of GNP, against an Emu
ceiling of 60 per cent - just inside, but potentially 'critical'.
The Social Democrats have been scathing about Mr Mollemann's figures, but
only because they say he is a 'slow learner': the opposition suggested such
potential extra burdens nine months ago.
Now the worthy Ifo institute has weighed into the debate, also questioning
Mr Waigel's assumptions.
Its calculations suggest that if all sources of public borrowing are
included, then overall public sector debt will rise from the DM1,170bn at
the end of 1991 - 41.7 per cent of GNP - by some 70 per cent to around
DM2,000bn by the end of 1995: coming to the same conclusion as the Economics
Ministry, or 55 per cent of GNP.
Ifo is nevertheless confident of one thing to give Mr Waigel a little
relief: by the year 2000 overall debt burden of the German public sector may
have risen to DM2,500bn, but the proportion will be down to 50 per cent of
GNP.
With the current deficit forecast for the end of the century back below 2
per cent of GDP, the qualifications for Emu should be fulfilled - then.

FT  06 MAY 92 / Heseltine pledges to 'help British industry to win'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine pledged yesterday to respond positively to business
leaders' calls for the government to do more to champion the cause of
British industry at home and abroad.
But despite the political clout that his appointment brings to the
Department of Trade and Industry, he was careful to play down speculation of
radical changes in the government's relationship with business.
In his first public comments since his appointment last month as president
of the Board of Trade, Mr Heseltine told the Financial Times that his first
priority would be to 'help British industry to win'.
He said he would spearhead an effort across Whitehall to improve the
'delivery' to more businesses of the advice and assistance which are
available from government departments.
Speaking in his 11th floor office in London's Victoria Street, he added: 'If
industry comes to talk to us . . . they should believe that the people to
whom they talk understand their problems.'
In the past, Mr Heseltine has advocated a more prominent role for the DTI.
He has suggested that the department should take the leading role at
meetings of the National Economic Development Office and in a new cabinet
committee dealing with industrial policy.
Yesterday, however, he appeared to recognise that the Treasury would not
surrender easily its current authority.
He had not arrived in his new job with a bagful of instant solutions for the
problems faced by British companies: 'There is no tailor-made set of
policies which instantly delivers results.'
His focus would be on 'incremental excellence' - the promotion, across a
range of government responsibilities from education and training to
deregulation, of policies which encouraged wealth creation over the long
term.
He intends to develop that theme tonight in his first set-piece speech to
industrialists.
Mr Heseltine's strategy involves recognition of the 'real partnership'
between the wealth-creating and public sectors. It did not represent any
'temptation to put your hand in your pocket and pay people to do things they
should properly do themselves'.
Reinforcing that point he added: 'I know that industrial success, commercial
success, is essentially a long-term phenomenon. The great danger is to try
to adopt the psychology of the fairy godmother.'
Mr Heseltine has to decide whether to refer to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission either or both of the bids for Midland Bank from Hongkong Bank
and from Lloyds. He would give no clues about whether he is ready to broaden
the existing competition criteria for referrals.

FT  05 MAY 92 / BMW to cut jobs at sales subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW, the German carmaker, is cutting the workforce of its UK sales and
marketing subsidiary after a 30 per cent decline in BMW (GB)'s trading
profit last year, Kevin Done writes.
Mr Tom Purves, BMW (GB) managing director, said that the company's trading
profit had dropped to Pounds 25m last year from Pounds 41.1m in 1990 and a
peak of Pounds 59.7m in 1989.
Since the start of the recession the BMW (GB) workforce has been reduced by
18 per cent from 450 at the end of 1990 to 370 following a second round of
29 job cuts this week.
BMW has increased its market share during the recession, but profitability
has been affected by the deterioration in the mix of its sales in the face
of the sharp drop in luxury car sales in the UK, Mr Purves said.
While the overall UK market for new cars fell by 31 per cent from 1989 to
1991, the luxury car market plunged by 65 per cent from 18,700 in 1988 to
8,300 last year.
Mr Purves forecast that the economic recovery in the UK would be slow. He
said the the luxury car market was unlikely to recover its earlier size but
could improve to 15,000 by 1995.
BMW's overall UK sales volume has fallen by only 21 per cent in the past two
years from 49,000 in 1989 to 38,700 last year, allowing it to increase its
market share.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Argentina seeks US fighter aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   Buenos Aires
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina has said it wants to take up an offer by the US government to sell
its fighter aircraft, ending the arms embargo clamped on Argentina by
Britain and the US after the Falklands conflict 10 years ago.
The American A4M Skyhawks would replace aircraft Argentina lost in 1982.
On Friday, Brigadier Jose Julia, air force commander, announced his
'absolute conviction that before the end of the year we will see in our
skies more, and better combat aircraft, which will replace those that remain
forever in the South Atlantic.'
US officials played down the importance of the proposed sale. First, they
note the Skyhawks are obsolete, although the models being offered Argentina
are the 'Cadillac' of the Skyhawk line. Secondly, they will not be supplied
with weapons systems. Thirdly, Argentina would have to pay for them.
Previous deliveries of non-lethal American military equipment were either
financed or given away.
There is no agreement on the number of Skyhawks Argentina would buy.
American officials would only say Brig Julia's figure of 40 aircraft was
exaggerated.
One official added that Washington wanted to encourage the air force to
reduce its 'mishmash' of French, Israeli and American aircraft in favour of
US aircraft. The Argentines already fly Skyhawks, which played an important
role in the Falklands.
Britain reacted with equanimity, emphasising that Washington had discussed a
possible sale with London. An official explained that the time was coming
when Britain would have to accept that Argentina would upgrade its severely
depleted arsenal. Resisting this would feed resentment and instability in
the armed forces.
Still, he doubted the underfunded air force could afford the aircraft, which
would cost about Dollars 1.75m (Pounds 980,000) each.

Romania is easing regulations on companies' hard currency holdings and is

national bank has announced, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
At the same time, the government yesterday cut subsidies on many basic foods
and electricity, pushing up prices sharply, while cushioning the blow with
limited pay rises and cash handouts.
The new currency measures are part of a package of economic reforms drawn up
with the help of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They
were designed to clear a backlog of import payments, restore the confidence
of the business community and encourage foreign investment, Mr Mugur
Isarescu, governor of the national bank, said.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on US jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a week in which there was no firm indication about the scale of the US
economic recovery, traders will again be closely analysing the economic
numbers coming out of Washington, writes James Blitz.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will issue its 'beige book,' outlining the
state of the economy in recent months. But dealers will mostly focus on the
US employment report on Friday, which some economists expect to indicate a
rise in employment by about 100,000. 'The employment figures will be the
first indicator for a while on whether an economic upturn is really taking
place,' says Mark Austin, chief economist of
Hongkong Shanghai Bank.
D-Mark traders will have their sights fixed on Thursday's Bundesbank Council
meeting, amid speculation that the German central bank will increase
interest rates. Analysts point out that the rates for overnight and 3-month
money in the German interbank market are now hovering close to the
Bundesbank's Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent, suggesting that the bank may
have to put the Lombard rate up. A close watch will be kept on whether the
Bundesbank chooses to raise rates on repurchasing agreements on Wednesday.
With Japan enjoying two days of holiday on Monday and Tuesday, yen trading
will only pick up later in the week. The market continues to focus on
whether the Japanese authorities will produce a fiscal package to boost the
economy without cutting interest rates.
Traders will pay close attention to sterling today after the Bank of England
reduced dealing rates at the long end of the UK discount market last week.
The forex markets are generally expecting a  1/4 per cent cut in interest
rates this week.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Don't stop history at Los Angeles: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By a strange coincidence I finally got round to Francis Fukuyama's book The
End of History* just as Los Angeles went up in flames.
In 1989, Mr Fukuyama, then an obscure State Department official, sent shock
waves through intellectual circles with a magazine article arguing that the
US/western European brand of liberal democracy represents the end point of
history. The book, published earlier this year, expands the original
argument, explaining how science and human nature together drive societies
inexorably towards democratic capitalism. He sees this as the final
destination because it 'constitutes the best possible solution to the human
problem.'
Events in Los Angeles give pause for thought. The city erupted in violence
following the acquittal of the white policemen videotaped beating Mr Rodney
King, a black. The subsequent days of rioting saw some of the worst civil
disorder in the nation's history: more than 50 people dead, thousands
injured and almost 4,000 buildings destroyed  - a worse record than in most
of the race riots of the 1960s. Is violence of this kind unavoidable at the
end of history?
Some will deny any connection between the horrific events in Los Angeles and
the US's economic and political system. The apparent injustice of the
all-white jury's decision in the King trial was bound to provoke a reaction.
But the tension between blacks and whites, runs the argument, is not
primarily economic in origin; it is rather the price that is being paid for
the US's past failure to respect its own liberal principles. If there had
been no suppression of blacks' civil rights, the two races would today be
living in harmony. At any rate, they would rub along at least as well as
whites and Asians or whites and Hispanics.
Yet few Americans believe race is the whole story. It is ironic that just as
the word 'class' is being banished from the political vocabulary of former
communist countries, it is reappearing in the US. Fury at what seemed a
racially-motivated travesty of justice was the trigger for last week's
rioting.
But the methodical destruction of property also reflected an urban
underclass's frustration after years of economic and social deprivation. If
every face in the Los Angeles ghettos were magically painted white tomorrow,
the economic outlook would not be transformed. There would be less
discrimination in job hiring and education but the ghetto dwellers would
remain an economically depressed class.
Problems have festered because federal government has looked the other way.
The Bush administration believes the Great Society public sector programmes
launched in the 1960s encouraged greater welfare dependency. It has thus
failed to revive urban programmes cut drastically during the Reagan years.
At the same time, however, President George Bush has lacked the courage
vigorously to support an alternative approach to urban decay championed by
conservatives such as Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary. They urge
Thatcherite reforms such as tax breaks for inner city 'enterprise zones' and
steps to give tenants ownership stakes in public housing. By failing to
endorse the new approach, while rejecting the old, Mr Bush has ended up with
no policy.
The deeper question is whether periodic outbursts, such as the Los Angeles
riot, are inevitable in capitalist societies even if social policies are
more enlightened. Mr Fukuyama's analysis raises grounds for concern because
the forces he sees moving societies towards free markets and democracy are
different, and thus potentially in conflict.
Scientific rationality leads to free markets: at some stage people recognise
that this is the best way to achieve big gains in productivity. Societies
tend towards democracy, however, because this is the best way to satisfy a
deep human longing for 'recognition'  - or acknowledgment of human dignity
and worth. Non democratic societies are unstable because the few can wield
power only by trampling on the egos of the many.
What relevance does this have for Los Angeles? The answer is to be found in
the final section of Mr Fukuyama's book, which looks at the flaws in
democratic capitalism  - his end point of history. He concludes that
profound tensions are unavoidable.
One reason is that while the rhetoric of democracy proclaims universal
equality, the iron logic of the capitalist market strips away the dignity of
those who do not succeed economically. 'Garbage men and busboys will always
be treated with less respect than brain surgeons or football stars'. So long
as income and wealth differentials are substantial, no level of material
prosperity will prevent daily damage to the dignity of economic losers. The
wanton destruction in Los Angeles was as much a cry for recognition from the
economically powerless as a racial protest.
The case for liberal capitalism is that all other systems are worse. But Los
Angeles is a reminder that it rarely runs smoothly for long. For a more than
a decade, the gap between rich and poor has steadily widened. It would be
hard to imagine a clearer sign that a correction, involving a sharper focus
on the problems of the underclass, would be prudent.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Justinian: Elusive definition of privacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the loss of the anonymity of Jennifer Bennett  - the girl whose ear
condition was the basis of a Labour party election broadcast  - that lay at
the heart of her parents' complaint to the Press Complaints Commission.
Their complaint highlights the fact that the question of protecting children
and other dependent persons against the consequences of publicity which may
cause distress raise more direct and important issues than the wider and
less specific issue of privacy. The problem for the Bennett family was that
the newspaper industry has in its Code of Practice a clause protecting
privacy. It says nothing about protecting children from publicity unwanted
by parents seeking to safeguard the interests of their offspring.
The Press Complaints Commission ruled that the Bennetts had waived their
privacy by agreeing to the use in the broadcast of their daughter's
experience of delay in getting surgical treatment on the NHS.
Their action placed the issue of Jennifer's treatment 'in the public
domain', where it then became an appropriate subject for investigative
journalism. The waiver covered all aspects of privacy, despite the Bennetts'
express reservation that their daughter's identity should not be revealed in
any media use of the storm about the supposed failings of the NHS.
It is odd that the press has not emulated the law in throwing a protective
cloak around children. The law, in fact, goes out of its way to protect
young people in Court proceedings. The power of the courts is to direct the
press and broadcasting not to report court proceedings which reveal the
name, address, or school of a child  - or otherwise give information which
identifies the child in court proceedings.
The significance of this protective rule is that it covers the child witness
and not just the child in trouble with the law, for whom it might be said
there should not be overfondness in concealing the identify of an offender.
The general practice nowadays is for courts to make orders restricting media
publication whenever a juvenile is concerned. All this proclaims society's
view that personal information about children is not for public consumption.
Why, then, should not the press take a hint from the legislature and
regulate itself in the same spirit? Presumably the Code of Practice which
the Press Complaints Commission is administering is not immutable. But it is
timely for the newspaper industry to propose revision of its code.
The endless arguments over the need for, or nature and scope of a law of
privacy, founders on where to draw the line between what is public and what
remains private. Clearly, if the information is to be protected it must not
be a matter of public record or observable in a public place. One step out
of the front door on to the street, and the hungry photographer can take a
picture.
Attempts to specify precisely what is 'private' have so far escaped the
authors of privacy legislation. If the proponents want a privacy law of
whatever sort it is vital to distinguish what is personal from what is not.
The Australian Law Reform Commission in 1979 did attempt to define the scope
of the legal protection against unauthorised publicity. It adopted a
category of sensitive private facts. The category relates to the health,
private behaviour, home life, or personal or family relationships of the
individual 'in circumstances in which the publication is likely to cause
distress, annoyance or embarrassment to an individual'. Even though the list
begs certain questions  - for example, what is 'private behaviour'?  - it
does provide the basis for a sensible determination of what publications are
'in the public interest'.
Once the scope of private information is established, the remaining issue is
how far press freedom and responsibility override the personal fact.
The story of Jennifer's ear was a matter of acute public interest. It
provided the media in the throes of heightened electoral activity with a
significant political row between the parties over the rival values attached
to the National Health Service. But did the disclosure of Jennifer's
identity add anything to the legitimate story? And if it did conceivably add
a dimension to the story, was that addition justifiable, compared to the
distress which was likely to be caused to the child and her family.
Anonymity of children and other dependents is an issue for anyone concerned
with the responsibility of a free press. It deserves to be high on the
agenda of anybody involved with a revised code of practice.

FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities soar as urban
violence wanes

Wall Street
US STOCKS soared to record levels yesterday as Wall Street reacted with
relief to signs that urban violence appeared to be waning, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 42.04 higher at 3378.13, above its
previous record close of 3,366.50 on April 16, but the volume of just under
175m shares was not enough to signify a meaningful rally.
Advancing issues led, declining by 1119 to 611. Among other market indices,
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 4.38 to 416.91 and the Nasdaq composite
added 5.40 to 583.54. On Friday, the Dow fell 23.03 to 3336.09.
The main factor behind the gains appeared to be relief that the weekend had
not brought the feared violence in New York and other large US cities.
Big board trading was dominated by blue chip stocks. IBM climbed Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 92 1/2 , Ford Motor added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 and
Boeing fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 .
A number of pharmaceutical company stocks saw active trading, including
Glaxo's American depository receipts, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 26 5/8 and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 76 1/2 . Pfizer, which
agreed to sell its Coty cosmetics and fragrances business to Benckiser of
Germany for Dollars 440m, rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 1/8 .
Stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings from Bally Manufacturing, the
casino-hotel and fitness centre owner, contributed to a 25 cents improvement
in the issue to Dollars 5 7/8 . Bally turned in first-quarter profits from
continuing operations of 8 cents a share against a loss of 33 cents a year
earlier.
Lincoln National, the seventh biggest publicly-held US insurance holding
company, rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 following first-quarter
earnings of Dollars 101.3m or Dollars 2.19 a share against Dollars 39.3m or
89 cents in the 1991 first quarter. The improved profits came in spite of a
decline in revenue to Dollars 1.92bn from Dollars 2.13bn.
Napa Valley Bancorp was one of the biggest losers on the American Stock
Exchange. The issue tumbled Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 9 1/2 after the
northern California-based bank said its board had ended talks with other
financial institutions about a possible business combination.
In the insurance sector, General Re reversed its losses after plunging
Dollars 8 7/8 in two days. Shares in the biggest US reinsurance group closed
Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 80 1/4 .
Other insurance stocks also rose, Aetna Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 and
Travelers Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20 7/8 . Cigna, which reported its
first-quarter results after the close of trading, added Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 51 3/4 .
In the secondary market, technology stocks continued to lead trading.
Seagate Technology firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16, Apple Computer rose
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/2 and Microsoft added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
114.
Canada
TORONTO STOCK prices closed little changed, in light trading influenced by
holidays in London and Tokyo.
According to preliminary figures, the 300 composite index gained 6.48 points
to close at 3363.54. Advancing issues outnumbed declines 273 to 258.
Seven of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by conglomerates, up 0.7 per
cent. The real estate sector had the day's biggest decline at 1.1 per cent.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Big three Swiss banks seen as villains of
the piece - Mr Vontobel's cautionary tale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the rankings of Zurich's gnomes, few  - if any  - outrank the blue-blood
Vontobels. Thus, when a Vontobel speaks, the Swiss financial community
listens.
Yesterday, Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chief executive of the eponymous
family-controlled banking group, spoke loudly, launching a book* in which he
argues that radical reforms essential to Switzerland's financial industry
should not be implemented so quickly as to kill off most of the players.
The villains of Mr Vontobel's piece are the big three universal banks, Union
Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse, which seem,
perhaps unwittingly, to be doing just that.
He argues that the big three are already far too powerful in Switzerland,
dominating virtually every financial market and decision-making on the stock
exchange and other collective institutions. 'In the end, that is bad for
customers and bad even for Swiss politics,' he says.
The big banks, however, are recognised to need a strong base to support
their international aspirations. They have been snapping away market share
from the small regional banks and demanding the public sector cantonal banks
be weaned from their government guarantees.
Mr Vontobel too would like to see the playing field levelled but, he says,
the cantonal banks, which could be a major force in the market, need time to
adapt to a new era. 'It would be bad to take away the guarantee right away
 -maybe in 10 years.'
In his book, he writes, 'More and more, it seems that the interests of the
Swiss financial centre are diverging from the interests of banks working in
the international arena. This fact should be borne in mind when considering
conflicts over financial policies.'
He also points to the case of currency options. In other financial centres,
these are traded on futures and options exchanges open to all. In
Switzerland, the big banks have prevented the local futures and options
market, SOFFEX, from taking on currency options, prefering to keep that
business for themselves.

OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the beleaguered international developer, said
it plans to announce the sale of assets later this week as part of its debt
restructuring programme, AP-DJ reports from Toronto.
The company said it continues to seek additional cash from its bankers as
part of the restructuring. 'O&amp;Y also is pursuing other alternatives to
address its liquidity problems, including the sale of assets, some of which
will be announced later this week,' the company said. An O&amp;Y spokesman
declined to elaborate.
The company also said it missed making an interest payment of about CDollars
17m (USDollars 14.2m) due yesterday. The payment was to be made to holders
of its Series 1 and 2 bonds, secured by its First Canadian Place office
tower in Toronto. The bonds have a principal value of CDollars 325m.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pinault profit halved but payout held
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT, the French industrial group which recently ran into controversy
over its bid for Au Printemps department stores, saw its net profits halved
to FFr503m (Dollars 90m) in 1991 from FFr1.05bn the year before.
The fall was attributed to a cut in exceptional earnings. Last year it made
exceptional gains of just FFr129m, compared with FFr913m in 1990 from the
sale of two industrial units and a Paris property.
Pinault, chaired by Mr Franois Pinault, one of France's more ambitious
industrialists, said its performance so far in 1992 had been 'satisfactory'
and expressed confidence about full-year prospects.
As a result the board proposed to hold the dividend at FFr9.4 a share,
despite a fall in earnings per share from FFr48.6 to FFr23.3.
Turnover rose by 11.5 per cent from FFr32.57bn to FFr36.3bn and operating
profits by 47 per cent from FFr1.58bn to FFr2.32bn.
Pinault said one of its priorities was to cut debt. The group has been left
with heavy debts of FFr15.5bn after last year's acquisitions in the retail
sector, which included the Conforama chain of furniture stores as well as Au
Printemps.
The bid for Au Printemps, originally a partial bid for two thirds of the
shares, hit the headlines when minority shareholders complained about being
excluded from the deal. The ensuing row was one of the catalysts for the
French government's on-going reform of takeover legislation.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ford of Europe back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Europe, wholly- owned by the second largest US car maker, hopes to
break even for the whole of 1992 after losing Dollars 1.08bn last year,
chairman Mr Lindsey Halstead said at the weekend.
But this would depend on a new car sales recovery in the UK, which usually
accounts for around 40 per cent of Ford's European sales.
Last year the UK market fell by 20.7 per cent to 1.59m cars, after a 13 per
cent drop the previous year from 1989's record 2.3m units. Within the 1991
total Ford's own share fell to 24.24 per cent from 25.25 per cent the
previous year.
Ford hopes the market will reach 1.65m this year, although to do so means
the market rising to an annual rate of 1.8m in the third quarter.
'That would be one hell of a turnaround, so I'd be delighted if we could do
it,' Mr Halstead said in an interview with Reuter in Barcelona.
The European subsidiary has started the year relatively well, making a
first-quarter net profit of Dollars 84m compared with a loss of Dollars 129m
a year before.
It operated profitably in most of its main European markets, including the
UK, and reduced operating losses of Jaguar  - now a direct subsidiary of
Ford US, not Ford of Britain  - into Dollars 90m from around Dollars 130m.
However, Mr Harold Poling, chairman of the parent Ford US, has warned that
Ford of Britain itself must narrow its productivity gap with continental
Europe. All Ford's UK factories suffered from historic inefficiencies,
including productivity rates and amount of time worked.
The financial improvement in the UK, achieved despite the continuing decline
in the UK new car market, was the chief factor behind the European company's
return to profit.
The UK result came in the face of a 10.3 per cent fall in first-quarter
sales volume, to 95,896 from 106,892 a year ago.
Last year Ford actually increased its sales by 3.6 per cent in western
Europe overall, but had to cut prices and shoulder heavy marketing expenses
to achieve this.
Ford's experience has been in sharp contrast to that of General Motors,
Europe's most profitable mass car maker, earning Dollars 1.76bn last year
and expecting Dollars 1.5bn this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, the big Philadelphia-based insurer, yesterday reported after-tax
profits of Dollars 106m in the first three months, compared with Dollars 48m
a year ago.
The improvement was struck after realised investment gains of Dollars 37m,
as against Dollars 8m in the first quarter of 1991.
Cigna's chief executive, Mr Wilson Taylor, said that the property-casualty
results continued to 'reflect the weak pricing environment', but he added
that the employee benefits, and individual life and pensions businesses had
all performed well.
The property-casualty division reported after-tax profits of Dollars 31m,
but only after including realised investment gains of Dollars 21m and
Dollars 20m from the sale of Cigna's equity interest in MBIA, the bond
insurance business.
A year earlier, the company reported break-even figures, but had no net
realised gains or losses.
The employee life and health benefits division made Dollars 38m after-tax,
after including realised investment gains of Dollars 3m. A year ago, the
figure was Dollars 19m, with a similar level of investment gains.
The employee retirement and savings benefits operation made Dollars 48m,
after investment gains of Dollars 4m, compared with Dollars 43m, with no
investment gains or losses, a year ago.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Interest rate cut expected today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE of only a subdued recovery in UK consumer spending since the
general election is behind the decision by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
to seek a cut in base rates. An announcement is expected today.
Weekly sales returns collated privately by a group of about 30 large
retailers are believed to have shown only a minor uplift since the April 9
election. The retailers account for total sales of Pounds 75bn a year, or
one eighth of gross domestic product.
Together with other indicators showing little movement in consumer sectors
such as the housing market, the retailing data appear to have been
persuasive. Mr Lamont and his advisers seem unlikely to wait for more
detailed evidence about the economy before sanctioning a cut of up to half a
point in base rates, held at 10.5 per cent since September.
The opportunity for a cut in base rates has been opened by the strength of
the pound since the election. It may be followed soon by reduced mortgage
rates. That could help spur an uplift in consumer spending generally, which
accounts for some two thirds of the economy.
The figures from the retailing group  - organised by the British Retail
Consortium and including Boots, Dixons, Burton and J. Sainsbury  - are not
available publicly. A member of the group said they are sent each week to
the Treasury to help it in its job of monitoring the economy.
Figures for the two weeks around Easter would have been available to Mr
Lamont in the middle of last week when he began to think seriously about
cutting borrowing rates. This was signalled in the Bank of England's
operations on money markets at the end of last week.
Retailers in the project said the figures had shown little in the way of a
recovery. 'There is no sign of a mini-boom,' said one retailing director.
The companies in the scheme account for roughly half the sales of the retail
sector. The weekly sales figures complement the monthly sales figures for
retailing collected by the government's Central Statistical Office. Even
though the CSO's system for collecting its data is better established, the
figures are out of date by the time they are published; the CSO's figures
for April will not be published until May 20.
Outside retailing, the government has had better news about a likely
recovery from the recession which began around mid-1990. But indications
from business surveys about improved confidence among companies generally
have not been enough to convince Mr Lamont that the opportunity to bring
down rates should be spurned.
In thin trading yesterday  - London markets were closed for a holiday - the
pound was little changed against the D-Mark. It was quoted in Europe at
DM2.9308, within about 2 pfennigs of its central rate in the ERM of DM2.95.
In New York it closed at DM2.9305.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Clashes in Bosnia intensify: EC says escalated conflict
could lead to a reconsideration of peace efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELLS exploded every few seconds near the centre of Sarajevo yesterday as
the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina escalated into full-scale civil war.
Sarajevo radio said the parliament building and Bascarsija, the oriental
bazaar in the city centre, had been set ablaze and that Bosnia's mainly
Moslem militia were advancing strongly into Serbian-controlled districts.
But Belgrade radio said the Serbs were defending their positions with the
help of the federal army.
The EC's current president, Portugal, said the scale of the fighting and the
killing of an EC peace monitor at the weekend could make the Community
reconsider its peace efforts.
'This is tragic and unacceptable and could lead the European Community to
seriously rethink the usefulness of continuing its efforts and sacrifices to
mediate in a conflict in which those involved apparently want to maintain
this or an even higher level of violence,' said Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro,
Portugal's foreign minister.
However, Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on
Yugoslavia, told the BBC that the talks must continue. 'I don't think the
Community as such can just give up and forget about it.
'There is so much misery going on in Bosnia and most of the people don't
want this to happen at all. It's just quite a big minority who want to fight
and we've got to somehow or other see what we can do to stop it.'
The EC monitoring team is suspending its operations in all former Yugoslav
republics after a Belgian member of the EC team was killed near Mostar on
Saturday.
A journalist reached yesterday afternoon by telephone in Sarajevo, said:
'There are several explosions per minute. People are running madly on the
streets looking for cover."
'The situation is very, very serious,' said Mr Marrack Goulding, the senior
UN envoy, who arrived in Belgrade yesterday to assess the feasibility of a
peacekeeping force in Bosnia. 'It is essential that all sides should
exercise the same restraint and make the ceasefire work.' He is expected to
fly to Sarajevo today and then to the Croatian capital, Zagreb.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, last night appealed for foreign
military intervention.
Even as the fighting continued, EC and UN monitors were still trying to
rekindle local talks on a truce. UN sources said the Bosnian forces had
handed 90 Yugoslav troops over to UN peace-keepers after capturing them in
an ambush in Sarajevo at the weekend.
On Sunday, the EC and UN had mediated a safe passage for the army convoy in
exchange for the release of Mr Izetbegovic, detained on Saturday by federal
army troops at the Sarajevo airport after his return from the EC-sponsored
peace talks in Lisbon.
One witness to the fighting in Sarajevo said: 'There is a smell of ugliness
about the fighting today'. Belgrade television showed the wreckage of the
weekend violence, including charred corpses of federal soldiers and
burnt-out buildings.
Some 500 people have been killed and at least 450,000 have been driven from
their homes since fighting erupted in March over Bosnian independence.
Serbs, who make up 31 per cent of Bosnia's 4.4m population, staunchly oppose
independence, backed by the republic's Moslems and Croats.
Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, currently control more than
half of Bosnia's territory. Tanjug yesterday said Serb irregulars had gained
control of the predominantly Moslem towns of Gorazde in southeast Bosnia and
Doboj, in northern Bosnia.
Last night the presidency of the newly proclaimed Yugoslav republic,
comprising only Serbia and Montenegro, ordered its citizens within the
federal army to withdraw within 15 days. But 80,000 of the more than 100,000
troops stationed in Bosnia are from the republic itself and the order does
not mention withdrawal of equipment.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Treasury to endorse George for governorship of Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is to be endorsed
by the Treasury as a leading candidate for the governor's job when it
becomes vacant next year.
Mr George is expected to be high on a shortlist of contenders to be drawn up
by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury.
Others likely to be shortlisted include Sir David Scholey, chairman of the
SG Warburg investment bank; Sir David Walker, departing chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board; Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays
Bank and former Treasury permanent secretary; and Lord Alexander, chairman
of National Westminster Bank.
The decision will be taken this year by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
after informal talks in Whitehall and the City.
If Mr George takes the top job  - replacing Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who
retires in June 1993 after 10 years  - it would mark the first time since
the 1960s that someone already at the Bank was appointed governor.
Mr George has a good working relationship with the Treasury, which the Bank
advises. This is even though he and Sir Terry have disagreed fundamentally
on economic policy in recent years.
Helping Mr George's candidacy is his deep understanding of financial markets
and keenness to combat inflation. But his lack of experience outside the
Bank and abrasive management style might count against him.
Choosing an insider would avoid the furore when Mrs Margaret Thatcher
appointed Mr Leigh-Pemberton, a former chairman of National Westminster and
a Tory party stalwart. This was criticised on the grounds that Mr
Leigh-Pemberton knew little about central banking. The last deputy governor
to be promoted was Lord O'Brien, governor from 1966 to 1973.

More than 50 white men, women and children from Temple Israel in Hollywood,
as well as 'Brother Barber from London', stood up to applause. The Gospel
choir struck up again, and the Reverend Flowers appealed to the Lord
('You're still on the Throne, you're still in charge') to bless his ravaged
city.
Few Jews have ventured into the inner city since the race riots in Watts in
1965 sent them fleeing to north Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. But
last week's looting spread to these supposedly safe white enclaves, claiming
the life of one of the synagogue's own members and encouraging both black
and white to join together in mutual solidarity and grief.
The healing and reconciliation took place in dozens of churches last Sunday
as Los Angeles braced itself for the awesome task of rebuilding the city
shaken by three days of rioting which cost up to 49 lives, Dollars 500m in
property damage, and as many as 10,000 businesses destroyed.
The random violence is a sledgehammer blow to a city which has regarded
itself with pride as the multi-racial metropolis of the future.
Amid the uneasy weekend calm, there were hopeful signs. Young people of all
races marched with brooms, shovels, and paint brushes to clean up the rubble
and the pervasive gang graffiti in the barrios.
The relief effort was equally impressive. At Pastor Cecil Murray's First AME
Church, home of the oldest black congregation in Los Angeles, volunteers
worked round the clock to distribute food and clothing to riot victims.
After two decades of neglect, the local community remains suspicious. The
big question is whether the city's leaders will tackle the deep rooted and
economic problems which provided the tinder  - if not the spark of the
Rodney King trial verdict  - that ignited last week's explosion.
Much will depend on Mr Peter Ueberroth, the man appointed by Mayor Tom
Bradley to head the recovery. Mr Ueberroth managed the highly successful
1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games; and has a reputation as a trouble shooter
who is fast on the draw.
Mr Ueberroth intends to form a non-profit organisation this week which will
move quickly,with the creation of jobs being a top priority. He has already
made clear he expects help from companies in the US and abroad, suggesting
at a news conference on Saturday that Japanese investors will be pursued
aggressively.
In Mr Ueberroth's own words, the emphasis will be on a public-private sector
partnership which could be a blueprint for revitalising inner cities across
the US. At times the blond haired Mr Ueberroth looks and sounds like Mr
Heseltine touring Toxteth in 1981 after the Liverpool riots. So what are his
chances of success? At this stage, it is a good deal easier to identify the
obstacles, many of which are typical of virtually all of America's major
cities. These have declined inexorably in the face of the suburban exodus, a
shrinking tax base, and a sharp drop in federal support in the 1980s.
The withdrawal of federal funds amounts to a conscious decision on the part
of the Reagan/Bush administration determined to wean the cities off the
support which grew out of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society  - the
battery of welfare and other social programmes designed to lift minorities,
predominantly blacks, out of poverty.
These programmes fostered the growth of a black middle class which
gratefully accepted the public service jobs on offer and, in many cases,
joined the white flight to the suburbs; but increasingly black and white
experts have argued that these programmes not only failed to alleviate
poverty, they reinforced the culture of dependency among blacks and may even
have encouraged a violent 'counter culture' dominated by drugs, gangs,
unsafe sex and the Aids virus.
Mr Joel Kotkin, an expert on urban politics in California and Fellow at the
Petterdine School of Business and Management, estimates that black
participation in the labour force in Los Angeles is the lowest of any ethnic
group, roughly one third less than that of Latinos and Asians.
African-Americans have the lowest rate of two-parent families, with young
females three times more dependent on welfare and nearly twice as likely to
give birth to drug-addicted babies than their Latino or Asian counterparts.
These statistics suggest that only a comprehensive approach involving
education, health care and economic incentives has any chance of success.
So far, however, reaction among most black leaders, including the Rev Jesse
Jackson, has focused on appeals to the federal government to provide jobs
and affordable housing for blacks.
Miss Linda Wong, executive director of the Achievement Council in Los
Angeles has long worked to improve relations between black and other ethnic
minorities. She says the old civil rights approach of the 1960s is fatally
flawed.
Despite the apparent similarity between black outrage in Watts in 1965 and
South-Central Los Angeles in 1992, there are significant differences which
require radical new thinking on the part of local and national leaders, Miss
Wong argues.
According to this analysis, the inner city problem can no longer be reduced
to a black issue alone; it encompasses Koreans, central Americans, Mexicans,
and other latinos, most of whom were not present in South Central LA in the
1960s.
Second, the federal government is simply not equipped financially to deal
with the inner cities on the grand scale pursued by President Johnson until
the Vietnam war. Nor is the state government which this year faces a Dollars
10bn budget deficit and is already cutting higher education and other social
services to the bone. 'The private sector must be involved,' says Miss Wong.
Yet all the evidence of the past 20 years is that the private sector has
abandoned the inner city in favour of downtown Los Angeles. Local agencies
have offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to corporations
to invest in Mayor Bradley's dream of creating a gleaming gateway to the
Pacific rim for American and Asian businesses alike.
Mr Ueberroth's challenge will be to shift these priorities, to discover new
leaders in the Asian and Latino community and to negotiate the rivalries
between the city council, the county board of supervisors and the mayor
himself who at 74 tenaciously clings to power.
But succeed he must. For Los Angeles, with its ethnic diversity coupled with
the relative decline in numbers in its white population, offers a foretaste
of the future for the rest of the US. Failure would raise the spectre of a
society hopelessly divided on class, race and ethnic lines, a glimpse of
which millions of Americans caught on their television screens in the last
few days.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Strategy for asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir PHILIP GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I share your hope ('A Strategy on Asylum' (April 27) that there will be
some changes in the new Asylum Bill to be introduced in the forthcoming
session.
As you note, there seems to have been some decline in the number of asylum
seekers in the UK, but almost all of them congregate in London. There are
now some 30,000 asylum seekers living in London, many of whom go into bed
and breakfast accommodation at a cost of Pounds 15,000 a year, which means
that the total cost to London charge payers is about Pounds 36m per year  -
or 30 per cent of the total cost of expenditure on London's homeless
families.
This is a national problem and there should be national support for the
London boroughs that have to deal with it. During the debates on the last
Asylum Bill, the government blocked the arguments of London members. I hope
that ministers will change their minds this time.
We should also amend the arrangements for unaccompanied children who arrive
in this country seeking refugee status. Some London boroughs have acquired
considerable expertise in looking after these unfortunate children. Other
boroughs are less skilled. We do not want to encourage parents in troubled
parts of the world to try to smuggle their children into this country but
our arrangements lag behind those in place in both France and Germany. Once
again, ministers should think again.
You suggest that the long-term method of dealing with potential Third World
migrants into this country is 'a more generous economic policy' towards
trade with the Third World. This may well be true, but it will be a very
long time before the beneficial results are evident. In the immediate
future, we ought to increase two or three-fold the amount of money which we
allocate to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the other
agencies that deal with refugees on the spot. Over the past decade, the UK
has a good record in helping UNHCR; we must redouble our efforts and
encourage our partners in the EC to improve their record.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Morgan, who prides himself on being an expert on the European
press ('Perspectives: British papers  - the best and the worst/The press in
Europe', April 25) seems at pains to explain why 'the biggest French daily,
L'Ouest Republicain, sells only about 1m', is unknown to foreigners, and
that this astonishing newspaper 'seems to be published in Rennes'.
Here is the key to Mr Morgan's worries  - L'Ouest Republicain was indeed
founded in Rennes at the Liberation in 1947. But it no longer appears.
Besides, Ouest-France surely is France's best selling daily. It is published
in Rennes and sells about 1m copies. But it has 38 editions and not just a
mere dozen. And the Bretons don't seem to mind its publication in Rennes,
since it is a regional paper.
Now, my turn to be dismayed. When Mr Morgan surveys the the European press,
how can he write at length about France-Soir, which hardly anyone reads any
more (although 30 years ago it was France's largest selling paper) and is
shortly about to cease publication once and for all, and conveniently forget
to mention le Monde.
As a daily FT reader, I would agree that you find the best and the worst in
British papers. The FT generally complies with the first part of the remark;
Mr Morgan's article fits the latter one.

<TEXT>
Visiting a remote branch in Africa, the golf-mad company chief challenged
the lower-handicapped branch manager to a round on a course carved out of
the jungle. The local man turned up with a rifle as well as clubs in his
bag, and explained that the rough could hold dangers.
On the second tee, the chief's drive hooked into the trees, and just as he
found the ball a python coiled down from the branches. His opponent, close
behind, blew off its head with the rifle.
All went well until the sixth tee, where the chief sliced into the
undergrowth from which a lion emerged, licking its lips. The local man
plugged it straight between the eyes.
On the ninth, another slice sent the chief's ball into the jungle to land on
the bank of a river. As he reached it, an alligator seized his foot and
began pulling him into the water. The local man was again on hand, but this
time just stood calmly consulting his rule book.
'Can't you help me?' the chief cried desperately. 'Sorry sir,' his opponent
replied. 'You're not entitled to a shot on this hole.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How many people spotted the mistake in Tiny Rowland's defence of Lonrho's
contro- versial dealings with Libya in his company's Observer newspaper on
Sunday?
Tiny's description of his brave attempt to prevent Colonel Gadaffi from
nationalising the Libyan assets of British Petroleum at the start of the
1970s is an interesting political footnote. But it does not quite square
with other interpretations of what happened.
Anthony Sampson, in his book the Seven Sisters, says the Libyans
nationalised BP's assets after Iran was allowed to occupy three islands in
the Persian Gulf which were under British protection. There is no suggestion
that it had anything to do with Gadaffi's unhappiness about being swindled
by Britain's ministry of defence over an expensive military radar order  -
which is what Rowland implies.
The Lonrho chief says that he insisted that Anthony Parsons, who was in
charge of the Middle East desk at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
should pass on his warning about the imminent nationalisation of BP's assets
to a cabinet headed by then prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home. He,
however, had stepped down as premier in 1964, and was merely foreign
secretary at the time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, the fates have also looked unkindly on politician Francis Maude.
Only a month ago he was financial secretary at the Treasury and tipped as a
coming man. Now, the 38-year-old has not only lost his parliamentary seat
but is under attack for becoming a part-time adviser to the chairman of the
Hongkong Bank in its battle for the Midland.
Maude points out that he is not taking up the job as someone who has retired
from public office on a pension. He is willy-nilly out of work, even though
he prefers to call it 'involuntarily privatised'. So he has no qualms about
taking sides in what's likely to be one of the most politically sensitive
bid battles for a long time.
He certainly knows his way around the DTI and the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, but insists he had no responsibility for banking matters while at
the Treasury.
Suggestions that his new post raises concerns about conflicts of interest
are 'deeply silly', says Maude who thinks that the Hongkong Bank is a 'nice
outfit'. He has been hired for his expertise in areas such as competition
policy rather than for his influence with the government in power.
Anyway, he needs to make some money while he plots his political comeback,
and takes comfort from the fact that his old dad's political ambitions did
not suffer when he took a mid-career break from the Commons in 1959.
But that misses the point. His father Angus Maude stepped down voluntarily
and disappeared to the other side of the world to edit the Sydney Morning
Herald for a while.
There must be a suspicion that young Francis has taken the first well-paid
job which comes along without thinking. After all he could have gone back to
being a barrister.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's a funny old world.' The famous words of the deposed Margaret Thatcher
must be running through the head of top civil servant Robin Mountfield as he
starts his new job this morning after 19 years at the Department of Trade
and Industry
An irrepressible inter-
ventionist, he began his time at the DTI with such pleasures as taking the
aerospace sector into state ownership. Then came the Thatcher era's
privatisation of BL etc, which reduced him to grinning and bearing it.
So imagine his delight on hearing that Mr Intervention himself, Michael
Heseltine, was to take over as trade and industry secretary. Alas the news
was almost immediately followed by the 52-year-old Mountfield's sideways
transfer to the Treasury where state involvement with industry is viewed as
a sin.
There may nevertheless be compensations. After all, the Treasury job he is
going to  - deputy secretary in charge of industry  - might well be done all
the better for being filled with someone who can tell a milling machine from
a coffee grinder.
True, the last two incum- bents, Etonian Nick Monck and the deceptively
languid Richard Wilson, were first-rate civil servants. But they failed to
impress industrialists.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Videophone not yet an answer for deaf people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KARL HOLWEGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your otherwise excellent report on videophones, 'Phones with a view to
profit from vision' (April 28), was a rather more optimistic view of the
position of deaf people and the telephone network than is the case.
While many deaf people could benefit from videophones, to see a caller
speaking or using sign language, the standard of picture available from
systems now being introduced for use over the ordinary telephone network by
residential customers is unlikely to fulfil the communication requirements
of deaf people.
The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), in conjunction with
University College London, has received partial funding from the European
Commission under its RACE (R&amp;D in Advanced Communications Technologies in
Europe) programme to undertake research into the application of video
telephony for deaf people. We shall be starting trials later this year with
a view to establishing some video telephony services for deaf people in 1994
within the constraints of available technology.
Yet video telephony is not a panacea for all deaf people as many do not use
sign language or lip read. There are also, for instance, those both deaf and
blind. Access for them must come from a different route.
On June 1 1992, TYPETALK, Europe's first national telephone relay service
will officially open in Britain, run by the RNID with Pounds 4m funding from
BT. The basis of the service is for a central operator to transcribe text
from a deaf person's text telephone into speech and speech into text. The
system is also capable of having the text translated into braille where
appropriate.
I am sure that research, including that of the RNID, will eventually lead to
video telephones assisting deaf people. Meanwhile, TYPETALK opens up the
network now.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Los Angeles: a political test . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT HAPPENED in Los Angeles, now a metaphor as well as a city, shocked
America's political leaders, and so it should have. Two political questions
arise from it. Is the jolt sufficient to induce the sort of collective
effort necessary to stop it recurring and will it have an impact on the
outcome of the presidential election?
It is true that election years are normally more distinctive for their
promises than for their action. Yet, apart from one egregious impugning of
the likely Democratic candidate by the White House spokesman, the tenor of
the immediate political response has not been wanting. Both President Bush
and Governor Bill Clinton have addressed the unfolding tragedy mostly with
care and thoughtfulness.
President Bush has in effect agreed that the acquittal of the four policemen
charged with beating Rodney King was a miscarriage of justice. For a
Republican president harried by his right wing on domestic issues, such an
admission is itself extraordinary. His promise to pursue federal prosecution
to redress the wrong is wholly appropriate. But, the president properly
emphasised, public order must be maintained, by whatever necessary means.
Mr Clinton's answers were embodied in his campaign's finest address, in New
Orleans on Saturday. He stated that both parties had failed the country by
refusing to admit that race was at the root of the problem. Among the
Democratic faults, he pointed to the unwillingness to change a rigid and
self-perpetuating welfare system. Special programmes for the inner cities
might help, as would better political leadership. But the key was for
Americans to think about what kind of citizens they wanted to be and what
kind of country they wanted to live in.
These respective responses were delivered without notable political side,
welcome but probably not to be repeated when the campaign reheats. In
effect, Mr Bush was saying that the system was neither perfect nor broken,
so long as redress under existing law was applied. Mr Clinton, no
revolutionary, was saying that the flaws in the system were such that it had
become irrelevant to a substantial minority of the population, a fact which
imperilled social order.
It is hard to judge the political fall-out. Mr Bush must have been tempted
to take a harder line and play on the fears of white Americans, as in the
Willie Horton commercials of 1988, which helped to destroy Mr Michael
Dukakis.
It may be too much to hope that Los Angeles can avoid becoming a political
football. But it is devoutly to be desired, and the appointment of Mr Peter
Ueberroth to head reconstruction efforts points the way towards the sort of
political and business partnership that is required. The quality of
political response to the riots has hardened the impression that Americans
are this year being offered, with or without Mr Ross Perot, a serious
choice, not one between empty vessels. Only serious politicians and serious
policies can extract good from bad and ensure that the complex but not
intractable racial and economic problems of cities like Los Angeles are
addressed.

FT  05 MAY 92 / A revolution, step by step: Mr Major's legislative
programme, to be revealed tomorrow, promises fundamental, if gradual, change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major is in exuberant mood. It is not just that his general election
victory has handed him control of his political destiny. As he contemplates
the next five years in Downing Street, the prime minister believes that few
have appreciated the scale of the opportunities presented by his victory on
April 9.
He will begin to spell out his programme in tomorrow's Queen's Speech,
translating into legislative form the first batch of his manifesto promises.
There will be few fireworks and few surprises. Mr Major remains a politician
who believes in incremental rather than explosive change. He is fond of
telling colleagues that before climbing a ladder it is sensible to make sure
that it has sturdy rungs. The impatient and the incautious are reminded that
the poll tax is an example of what happens when the rule is ignored.
But change there will be; and the eventual impact of the prime minister's
prospectus will be far more profound than implied by the quiet manner of its
implementation.
It is not hard to explain Mr Major's good humour. His first term as an
elected prime minister has begun at just the right point in the economic
cycle while the opposition is in disarray.
Mr John Smith's expected victory in the Labour leadership battle will not
easily repair the severe damage done to the opposition by the less than
edifying manner in which the contest has been conducted.
The current deliberations of the Boundary Commission will be speeded up. The
resulting demarcation of constituencies could deliver to the Conservatives
another 20 seats at the next election.
As Britain prepares to assume in July the presidency of the European
Community, a glance in the direction of Bonn, Washington or Tokyo does
nothing to dispel the impression that Mr Major is more secure in office than
any of his counterparts on the international stage.
Germany's troubles and the internal preoccupations of the socialist
government in France have combined with the turbulent legacy of the former
communist regimes in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to give unexpected
credibility to Britain's vision of a wider, decentralised European
Community.
Mr Major will spend much of the next two months putting into law the
treaties on monetary and political union agreed at Maastricht But his
European partners are less sure of the federalist vision that inspired the
treaties.
At home, those elusive green shoots of recovery appear at last to be pushing
through the permafrost of recession.
It will not be a spectacular recovery; and it might yet be further delayed.
The debt burden loaded on to individuals and companies by the 1980s boom has
been eased not eradicated. Beyond the  1/2 -point cut now in prospect, the
intensification of Germany's economic problems has stifled hope of a
significant reduction in the historically high level of British interest
rates.
Unemployment, and with it the government's budget deficit, will continue to
rise. Warnings from the Treasury that this year's public spending round will
be the toughest in recent memory represent more than the ritual
sabre-rattling.
Mr Major's optimism does not hinge on the short-term outlook. He does not
anticipate an immediate surge in output. By temperament, the prime minister
prefers the steady to the spectacular.
It is too early to judge whether he is right, but the prime minister is
convinced that the disinflation wrought by the recession and by sterling's
place in the exchange rate mechanism does offer the prize of
non-inflationary growth.
His commitment to curbing inflation is too frequently under-estimated. Mr
Major is dismissive of suggestions that he should consider devaluing
sterling against the D-Mark to loosen the constraints applied by high German
interest rates. Mrs Thatcher may cavil at her successor's willingness to
tolerate high public spending and borrowing but he is determined that he
will deliver the permanently low inflation that eluded her.
With the economy at the bottom of the economic cycle, the resumption of
economic growth of 2.5 to 3 per cent would not undermine that ambition. It
is a background that Mr Major is convinced will allow him to deliver on his
manifesto promises.
There is no grand philosophical design. But the gradualism does not exclude
more sweeping ultimate ambitions. If the constituent elements of Mr Major's
programme are unexciting, the sum of those parts may prove surprisingly
radical.
The glue which binds them together is an instinct which tells him that many
more decisions taken by the state  - be it represented by Whitehall or by
local authorities  - should be devolved to individuals and families.
Ownership, choice and opportunity are the words he uses most frequently to
outline his objectives. Low taxation, privatisation, the citizen's charter,
incentives for home and share ownership, hospital trusts and
grant-maintained schools all reflect a presumption in favour of individual
empowerment.
He is committed to a welfare state but not to the monolithic structure
established in 1945. He sees government as the purchaser rather than the
provider of the public services for which at present it has responsibility
to deliver as well as finance.
On one level Mr Major plans further absolute shrinkage in the size of
government. The Queen's Speech will signal his determination to privatise
British Coal, British Rail and the remaining publicly-owned bus companies.
Alongside such direct sales, he foresees wholesale contracting out to
private enterprise. Further large chunks of Whitehall will be hived off into
free-standing agencies. Competitive tendering will be extended to the core
of local authorities' white-collar functions.
Where the state retains a near-monopoly  - health and education are the best
examples  - the aim is to establish a much more direct relationship between
suppliers and consumers, a relationship regulated by the citizen's charter.
With the uncertainties of the election removed, Mr Major expects hospital
trusts, family doctor budgets and grant-maintained schools to become the
norm rather than the exception.
The approach is not uniform. Colleagues point to his post-election housing
policy as a microcosm of a political strategy tailored to realities as well
as long-term goals.
The basic aim is to widen ownership. Local authority tenants who cannot
afford to buy their homes outright will be offered gradualist routes through
rent-into-mortgage and part-ownership schemes.
But those who choose or are forced to remain in the rented sector will be
nudged anyway into accepting more active responsibility for their
properties. Privatisation of estate management, property transfers to
housing associations and an extension of housing action trusts will deprive
local authorities of their role in housing provision.
In the public sector such change does not come cheap. Mr Major has no
philosophical objection to spending taxpayers' money if he is sufficiently
persuaded of the results.
The size of the public sector deficit will ensure that the public spending
round is unusually tough. But the commitment to an eventual return to budget
balance is elastic. Whitehall is working on a re-definition of policy which
would admit the reality that a return to debt repayment is a distant dream.
Mr Major's tax-cutting ambitions are modest, directed at helping the
'industrious and the thrifty' on avarage or below-average earnings. They
involve a gradual widening of the 20p lower rate band of tax, some new
incentives to encourage personal savings and an increase in the threshold
for inheritance tax. He is unmoved by calls for reductions in the top rate
of income tax.
It does not add up to a seamless whole. Much of Mr Major's approach to
policy is driven by a careful balance between his deep-rooted personal
instincts and his careful political pragmatism. There are obvious tensions.
The prime minister insists that Britain is 'over-governed' yet he wants his
government to act as a powerful agent for social as well as economic change.
His choice of Mr Michael Heseltine to run the department of trade and
industry is a signal that the government will be more active if not
interventionist in its relationship with industry. Mr Peter Walker's
stewardship of a new urban regeneration agency points in a similar
direction. Pragmatism has left Mr Major committed to a universal system of
state pensions and child benefit which runs against the grain of his
emphasis on individual responsibility.
Gradualism and pragmatism carry their own risks. At times they can too
easily be mistaken for drift. At others they can obscure the fundamental
implications of piecemeal policymaking.
Senior ministers admit that little attention has been paid to the
far-reaching consequences for local democracy of the planned changes in the
structure of local taxation and in education and housing policies.
Mr Major's interest has focused on a plan to simplify local government by
removing one of the present tiers. But the erosion of its role could
actually concentrate more power in Whitehall rather than disperse it to
individuals.
Nor can the prime minister expect the modest improvement in the
Conservatives' electoral performance in Scotland to reverse a decade-long
process of alienation from political rule from London. This is acknowledged
in his plans to revive the select committee on Scottish affairs at
Westminster and to nurture the role of the grand convention in Edinburgh.
But the approach leaves a suspicion that the government has not looked
beyond the next one or two steps.
There are some in Mr Major's own administration who admit that the question
of how Britain should be governed in the next century cannot be answered
simply with reforms in the welfare state designed to enhance the role of the
individual.
But for the moment the prime minister can be forgiven for brushing aside
such dilemmas. He has proved himself a consummate politician. He has a
mandate for a programme more radical in its intent than has been generally
realised. He has the right economic and political environment in which to
deliver it. Who wouldn't be smiling?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIOTING which has afflicted Los Angeles and some other American cities
is rooted in the circumstances of the US, whose ethnic mix, history of
racial strife and political institutions leave the urban poor effectively
outside the system. An epidemic of violent  - often drug-related  - crime
has created a law and order backlash which allows middle America to sanction
capital punishment as well as police behaviour which is as unacceptable as
it has now proved to be unproductive.
Yet urban deprivation and the existence of an alienated underclass are
familiar enough to Europeans. Throughout most advanced industrial economies,
unemployment rates of 10 per cent or more are persistent, with the
underlying rate ratcheting to a new floor after each recession. The position
is much worse in rustbelts and declining inner-cities, especially those with
substantial ethnic minority communities. Serious riots have afflicted
Britain and France in recent years.
That Europe's social disturbances have been less intense than those in the
US reflects in part that in Europe income distribution is less unequal.
Although there has been a widening of the gap between rich and poor in most
advanced economies, real wages have actually been falling among the lowest
income groups in the US  - not so in most of Europe. European governments
are also more redistributive in their spending, so that the middle classes
finance willy-nilly the education of underclass neighbourhoods. And most
European countries are prepared to pay more in social security benefits to
the losers in capitalism's race than the US (though all countries now seek
to target benefits better to avoid reinforcing a cycle of dependency).
Underneath these different circumstances, however, lies a common factor: the
decline in advanced industrial economies of the unskilled labourer.
Increasingly manufacturing and service industries require employees who are
motivated, educated and skilled. Employers can afford to pick and choose,
and they will not choose those who lack educational qualifications or
workplace skills.
Attracting more of the new highly-skilled jobs to the areas of deprivation
is thus only part of the answer. Many of the youths who set ablaze deprived
estates on North Tyneside last September desired jobs in Nissan's nearby
gleaming new car factory. Most would not have got beyond the initial
screening stage for applicants: they not only lacked education; they had
failed to acquire the basic skills of concentration and application which
are essential to efficient production in modern industries.
It cannot be too often stated that the key to offering opportunity to this
underclass lies in better education and training, which must be effective
long before young people reach the age of rioting. It is hard to see what
can be offered usefully to those who have already failed in the education
system apart from a minimum income sufficient to participate in civilised
society and labour market rules which do not destroy low-paying, low skill
jobs. But for the next generation, there must be hope not only that there
will be decent jobs to go to, but also that they will be able to compete for
those jobs. Societies which persist in denying opportunity to a significant
minority breed violence.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Leading Article: City regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME TIME over the next two months, responsibility for overseeing the UK's
investment markets and financial services companies will pass from the
department of trade and industry to the Treasury. The switch has been
presented as a rationalisation of financial regulation: it looks
suspiciously half-baked.
The DTI's record on financial regulation has been poor. Before the Financial
Services Act came into force, it failed to prevent investment disasters like
Barlow Clowes and Norton Warburg. Since the act, it has presided over a
fragmented system of investment regulation based on an uncomfortable blend
of statutory prescription and self-regulation.
Unfortunately, the Treasury has also failed to cover itself with glory in
this department. Successive chancellors were kept informed about the Bank of
England's concerns over Bank of Credit and Commerce International without
prompting tougher action  - though the ultimate responsibilty for banking
regulation rests with the Bank. There is no reason in principle why the
Treasury should make a better job of supervising the financial services
sector than the DTI. Secretive and haughty by nature, it lacks the DTI's
experience of consumer-related matters and would be a less effective
guardian of the interests of small investors.
On the plus side, the switch will allow a single government department to
negotiate in Brussels over the regulation of Europe's financial markets at a
crucial moment in their history, as Europe moves towards monetary union and
London faces mounting challenges from other financial centres.
But too many questions remain unaddressed. How can financial conglomerates
be properly regulated, if the responsibility for insurance companies remains
with the DTI? How can the fight against fraud be made more effective, if the
present disjointed system for investigating financial malpractice is left
untouched? Should the Securities and Investments Board, the top investment
watchdog, be strengthened, or should the UK opt instead for European-style
dominance by banking regulators? And is it right for one government
department to be responsible both for protecting investors and promoting the
interests of the investment industry?
Clear policy thinking on these matters is needed, not a piecemeal shuffling
of responsibilities between ministers.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Manchester International cello festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester's most recent festival was ambitiously devoted to Expressionism
in all its forms. Of somewhat narrower focus, the city's latest festival at
the Royal Northern College of Music, took a good hard look at the cello,
cello- and bow-making, and just about every aspect of cello performance.
Concerts, master-classes, workshops and competitions were crammed into the
four days of this the third (biennial) celebration, attended by conservatory
students from home and abroad, and featuring the services of 20
distinguished artist-professors of nine nationalities.
An intriguing, long programme on Sunday  - a gala in aid of the Jacqueline
du Pre Memorial Fund (the festival as a whole is dedicated to the memory of
the great paraplegic virtuoso Pierre Fournier)  - afforded the complete
cello and piano music of Schumann, Mendelssohn and Brahms. The opening
concert on Thursday night was less comprehensive, but managed to fit in no
less than three concertos, an Elegy (Faure's Op. 24) and Tchaikovsky's
Rococo Variations.
The BBC Philharmonic was conducted by Raymond Leppard, the sponsor was
violin dealer Peter Biddulph, and there were seven soloists.
Two of them  - Ralph Kirshbaum, founder-director of the festival and a
professor at the RNCM  - and Gregor Horsch (first winner of the festival's
Fournier Award)  - came together in the world premiere of the 46-year-old
Dutch composer Tristan Keuris's double concerto, commissioned for the
occasion by the BBC. This proved an enjoyable piece of writing, in the
conventional three movements played without a break (lasting about 21
minutes), warmly or, as the composer indicated, autumnally romantic in
feeling without any over-indulgence of the solo instruments' traditional
capacities.
Clearly Keuris is a thoroughly professional, fastidious composer whose notes
would tell no matter how abstractly he might choose to deploy them. Though
customarily athematic (as he informs us), his music on this occasion
ventures into melody, and succeeds most strikingly with it in the tautly
poised oboe part at the beginning of the lento movement. But these keenly
eloquent duettists were able to invest numerous passages, however fleeting,
in the outer movements (the first a constant doubling and halving of tempo,
the third a scherzo) with glowing melodic impulse.
The scoring is for a sizeable orchestra but with horns alone of the brass
section and no bassoons, omissions meant to promote the soloists. Oddly
enough it was the retention of a bassoon in the Vivaldi G minor concerto for
two cellos and strings with which the concert began (Wolfgang Boettcher and
Thomas Demenga) that gave the music its distinctive savour. The German,
Boris Pergamenschikow, was a marvellously passionate soloist in the Schumann
concerto: in the smallish hall his playing had the immediacy of speech
itself. The Finn, Arto Noras, concluded the evening with a very classy
account of the Tchaikovsky.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Peter Grimes/Cos fan tutte - Glyndebourne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Glyndebourne festival got under way this weekend  - unwontedly early, so
as to make time for building the bigger new opera house by 1994, but not too
unseasonably. At the dinner interval of Peter Grimes on Saturday there were
some intrepid picnickers on the lawn, and many more on Sunday (sunnier and
warmer) during Cos fan tutte. The famous gardens, front and side, are
intact, though not blooming yet; the cosy rear gardens and the tennis court
have already become building sites.
We need not be sentimental about the old house. The price of its vaunted
intimacy has always been a tight, airless acoustic: good for words,
unflattering to many voices, tricky for any conductor handling a
Romantic-size orchestra. With 1,150 seats the new house will be larger by
only a third, but the extra sound-space should be a boon.
On the other hand, producers will be inclined more than ever toward multum
in parvo stagings partly because of the irresistible temptation to explore
more of the repertoire than really fits Glyndebourne, but also to entertain
the ever-increasing proportion of their audience that has no great interest
in opera.
Trevor Nunn's new production of Britten's Peter Grimes is extremely
striking, but not overweening. The large cast, down to the last villager, is
presented in such sympathetic detail that the staging never dominates. It
opens nevertheless with a terrific visual coup: a whole, towering wall of
people crammed into the Borough's Moot Hall for the inquest, and singing
with maximum impact. Individual characters emerge at once: Donald Adams'
crusty Coroner, Geoffrey Moses' comically long-faced functionary, Susan
Bickley's beady-eyed, excitable Mrs Sedley (less of a witch than usual).
John Gunter's basic set is a crosswise section of a bleak East Anglian
shore, but it can accommodate a slice of the village too  - cramped
buildings leaning together, narrow winding lanes: as vividly natural as the
Albert Herring sets in the Peter Hall version. Grimes's hut is a plausible
boat-hulk, set high enough to leave a dangerous drop to the sea, with room
below for the procession of wrathful villagers. Britten's sea-interludes are
allowed to speak for themselves against nothing more than a changing play of
light on the front-cloth.
The grim story is played out with considerable impact. The East Anglian
accents that Nunn has made everybody learn are an uncertain asset; sometimes
they have the ring of picturesque 'truth', sometimes only self-conscious
quaintness. The Peter is an American tenor, Stephan Drakulich, who has
clearly made heroic efforts to master the dialect. That may or may not
account for his slightly throttled sound; but it is of a piece with the
desperately knotted character he presents, near breaking-point with
bafflement and anguish.
Grimes gets no heroic gloss here, which is a mercy (only Jon Vickers could
bring that off); but at his 'Now the Great Bear and the Pleiades', the roof
of The Boar opens to reveal a brilliant firmament. A risky inspiration: I
thought it struck home powerfully, reinforcing Peter's essential claim to
being a lonely visionary. Vivian Tierney sings a lovely Ellen, open-throated
and scrupulously musical, too brave and sensible to be either a prissy
schoolmarm or a bland saint. As Peter's luckless apprentice, 13-year-old
Daniel Wilmshurst is a heart-rending picture of dumb despair.
Alan Opie makes a fine, forceful Balstrode, contributing much more to the
action than mere sonorous utterances. John Graham-Hall, who was young Albert
Herring to the life only a couple of seasons ago, creates a haunted Bob
Boles, the sin-wracked Methodist; John Fryatt's Rector is lovingly detailed,
and Robert Poulton makes a lithe, flashy Ned Keene. Menai Davies's earthy
Auntie and her 'nieces' (Susannah Waters and Sarah Pring) figure strongly,
with help from Nunn's canny treatment: there is a hint, not overstressed,
that these village whores are also the local Fates. Andrew Davis conducts
the London Philharmonic to pointed effect. The score sounds superbly
prepared, and there are stinging touches that rarely register in larger
houses. The whole has an inexorable flow, never broken by passing events but
carrying them.
* * * As revived by Michael McCarthy, Nunn's cruise-ship Cos sails on with
visible eclat, but without  - so far  - a convinced focus. The six
principals are all good enough to weather the distractions provided by the
busy, extraneous passengers and crew who populate Maria Bjornson's shifting
decks; yet on Sunday the dramatic line went through blurry patches, not so
much ambiguous as just undecided about the tone and flavour of the tale.
With a few more performances it should find a sharper silhouette.
The ladies look too similar, but Renee Fleming and Suzanne Johnston sing
them with warmth and subtlety, abetted by Lillian Watson's reliably bright
Despina. John Mark Ainsley's stylish Ferrando is slightly shaded by Gerald
Finley's lusty, forward Guglielmo. As Don Alfonso, James Maddalena hovers
creepily at the edges of the action, a saturnine presence who never quite
reveals his hand. Bruno Weil is a serviceable conductor, with some
interesting ideas but no knack for welding the great act-finales into single
spans.
Glyndebourne Festival Opera. Peter Grimes in repertory to 22 June, Cos fan
tutte to 13 June.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Making a silk purse out
of a sow's ear - Big changes to the traditional way of life down on the farm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turn off the M25 motorway near St Albans to the north of London and a short
drive will bring you to Bowmans Farm.
There you can spend a busy afternoon showing the children the farm animals,
enjoying home-made ice cream or a full meal in the restaurant and stock up
with fresh produce from the farm shop.
Up to 200 children pass through each day on school trips and more than
60,000 visitors are expected this year.
Bowmans now has more staff on hand to look after its human flock than are
required to manage its three dairy herds, its sheep and pigs and its fields
of Brussels sprouts and malting barley.
For Bowmans, a 450 hectare farm 15 miles to the north of London,
diversification away from traditional farming activities has proved to be
big business.
It started producing ice cream and yoghurt from its surplus milk five years
ago and has now expanded farm-related business to the point where it
accounts for half of its income and total turnover has risen to Pounds 1.5m.
'Normally the farmer tries to chase people off his land but we encourage
them to come on,' says Geoff Lawrence, diversification manager at the
60-year-old farm. 'Most farmers would look at the number of people tramping
about the place with horror but you have to get used to dealing with the
public.'
In recent years many farmers have had little choice. The European Community
has been cutting the level of farm price support and subsidies while
renegotiation of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (Gatt) has
brought additional pressures.
No fewer than 41 per cent of the 188,000 agricultural holdings in England
and Wales have undertaken some form of diversification activity, according
to a recent study by Exeter University. The average increase in the level of
farm turnover was Pounds 22,000.
But the contented Sunday afternoon tripper should beware of concluding that
a new golden age of enterprise has descended on the British farm scene to
replace the traditional rural idyll.
'The figure for average farm earnings from diversification is misleadingly
high,' says Richard Butt, chief executive of the Rural Development
Commission, which seeks to boost the rural economy.
'The level of earnings which produces that average ranges from Pounds 1m to
a few hundred pounds. For many farmers, diversification produces a marginal
income.'
Two-thirds of farm diversification brings in less than Pounds 5,000.
One-in-eight of farm businesses produces a loss and if family labour were
costed at commercial rates, as many as four-out-of-10 farm diversifications
would be making a loss.
These statistics suggest that farmers need to approach the idea of
diversification with caution. Is their farm close enough to a large centre
of population or in a sufficiently attractive area to draw large streams of
visitors?
They must also take care to avoid setting up in the same business as every
other farm in the area or at least make sure that there is enough demand for
several competing farms to flourish.
'There is a tendency for everyone to latch on to the same idea; golf
courses, mohair farming or snail breeding,' says Butt.
Geoffrey Procter did decide to turn a quarter of Wide Open Farm, near York,
into a golf course but only after 18 months of very careful study. Physical
preparation of the site started a year ago and the first nine holes are due
to open in June 1993 with the remaining nine due to be ready a year later.
Articles in the farming magazines make creating a golf course sound easy but
it involves a lot of careful preparation, says Procter. He called in
specialists to design the course and expects to employ an experienced
manager to run it.
He calculates that his position, near a medium-sized town, will provide a
steady flow of golf club members.
Making the switch to a new form of activity can frequently involve a large
capital outlay and a long delay before the new venture starts producing
income.
Procter describes the capital outlay on the golf course as 'frightening' but
declines to say how much he has spent.
John and Carolyn Pearce have spent Pounds 350,000 (including a Pounds 50,000
grant) on converting farm buildings into eight craft workshops, a gift shop
and tea-room and offices on their farm near Bakewell in the Derbyshire Peak
District.
After selling off their dairy herd, the Pearces turned their 120-acre farm
over to less time-consuming sheep. The sheep produce an income of about
Pounds 6,500 a year while the gift shop, tea-room and rent from the
workshops and offices bring in Pounds 400,000.
As a spin-off from the building work, John Pearce set up in business trading
reclaimed building materials and has turnover of Pounds 500,000 a year.
It took two years from the time the Pearces sold their cows to opening the
tea-room, including six months spent fighting the Peak Park planning
authority for permission for a change of use of their buildings.
The planning officers initially ruled against the change because the
conversion would require the construction of a car park, but they were
overruled. 'But is still took six months during which time we were living
off our bank manager,' says Carolyn Pearce.
But planning controls are a significant problem for many farmers seeking to
diversify their business. Brian Moore was unsuccessful in his attempt to run
an ice cream parlour from his farm in the village of Weeton, in the green
belt near Harrogate.
The planning authorities objected to the large volumes of traffic created by
Moore's ice cream parlour. Moore fought against the planning ruling up the
Crown Court and estimates he spent up to Pounds 150,000 on legal fees, part
of which had to be met by selling some of his land.
Moore says the ice cream parlour accounted for one-third of his business,
with the rest composed of deliveries to local retailers, so it was essential
that he kept it going.
He sold the farm in Weeton and moved 30 miles across country to High
Jervaulx Farm in Lower Wensleydale. 'I made sure I had planning permission
for the ice cream parlour before buying,' he says.
But the most important factor determining the success of diversification are
the personality and the business skills of the farmer himself.
'While only a minority of farms will have a high order of entrepreneurial
skills, they are used to running their own business and they are generally
tough and resilient,' says Butt.
'Farmers are not used to selling because in the past, their output would
have gone to a marketing board or into intervention stocks,' comments Pat
Oakley, chief manager of agricultural finance and small businesses at Lloyds
Bank.
'But there is a new generation of farmers who have been away to college and
who are better prepared.'
The changes which still face the farming community seem likely to demand all
of their newly-acquired skills.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Some poll tax bills 'distorted'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INACCURATE estimates of councils' debt-repayment liabilities are seriously
distorting poll-tax bills, the Local Government Information Unit claimed
yesterday.
A report into the calculations for last year's government grants to councils
says that in several cases  - Manchester, Wycombe in Buckinghamshire and
Woking in Surrey are three examples  - bills are more than Pounds 100 higher
than they would have been if accurate figures had been used.
In other areas such as Westminster, Croydon and Portsmouth, bills would have
been up to Pounds 100 more than those issued after government Standard
Spending Assessments were calculated.
'Every council in the country is affected by these miscalculations to some
extent, ' the unit, a research body supported by trade unions and some
councils, says. 'For some, they may be the difference between being capped
and not being capped.'
The poll tax has cost Scotland more than Pounds 1.6bn, becoming 'the most
appalling waste of money in recent Scottish history,' Labour said yesterday.

</HEADLINE>

   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WHITEHALL power struggle over control of a new anti-pollution agency has
forced the shelving of plans to include environmental legislation in the
Queen's Speech tomorrow, Ivo Dawnay writes.
Ministers had expected a 'green' bill to be among the measures, but
disagreements between the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of
Agriculture have forced a further delay.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has insisted that a new agency
should combine the powers of the National Rivers Authority, the Pollution
Inspectorate and the waste-disposal functions of councils. But Mr John
Gummer, agriculture minister, is equally determined that land drainage,
coastal defence and the activities of the rivers watchdog should fall to
him.
The dispute first surfaced last year in an unresolved clash between Mr
Gummer and Mr Michael Heseltine, now trade and industry secretary.
A 'green' bill is now likely to be tabled next year, possibly taking in
factors from next month's United Nations environment conference in Brazil
and the government's decision to reduce the timetable for cutting carbon
emissions.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Maxwell disaster's silver lining: Norma Cohen investigates
growing pressure for reform of pensions law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is any irony in the death of Robert Maxwell, it may well be that he
has inspired an overhaul of UK pensions law giving future workers the
security and comfort in retirement that he denied his own employees.
The disappearance of about Pounds 400m from pension funds he controlled has
sparked calls from all quarters for pension reform. Most recently, the UK's
most influential group of employers has given its support for new laws
designed to make schemes more secure. It is widely acknowledged that
employers' support will be necessary to secure genuine reform of UK pensions
law.
The 100 Group of Finance Directors, which includes 145 of Britain's largest
companies, is preparing to publish the results of a survey of members which
broadly endorses calls for pensions reform.
It supports demands for tighter controls on fund assets and suggests a 'code
of conduct' for pension fund trustees. In particular, it urges trustees to
ban investment managers from purchasing 'shares, bonds or other assets' of
the company or of the investment manager itself.
Furthermore, the report urges pension funds to disclose more about their
affairs to members and urges that trustees hold an annual general meeting
for beneficiaries at which their actions could be subject to questioning and
challenge.
The survey covers companies controlling about Pounds 97bn in assets, about a
third of all UK pension fund assets. However, the report contains a stiff
warning to those arguing that pension reforms should clearly state that
surpluses  - built up by successive years of high investment returns  - are
the sole property of fund members. 'The lack of clarity as to who owns the
surplus often works to the advantage of the members for it can mean that
employers are willing to see their pension schemes well funded in the
confidence that surpluses arising are not irrevocably 'lost' to the
employer,' the report concludes.
It goes on to say that if employers are forbidden from securing surpluses
for their own use, they will fund schemes less generously and possibly place
benefits at risk.
The consequences of this would have significant fiscal ramifications. Unlike
most European Community countries, the UK relies heavily on voluntary
employer-sponsored schemes to provide retirement income. Indeed, says Mr
Alan Jenkinson, policy director at pensions consultants Noble Lowndes, a cut
in employer-sponsored benefits would be likely to spur political demands for
more generous state pension benefits.
Significantly, 100 Group members overwhelmingly believe that surpluses
should be shared between plan sponsors and beneficiaries. Seventy-four of
the 91 companies surveyed said they would either use a surplus to take a
contributions holiday or repay some of it to the company. An equal number
would also enhance benefits to members. Only 6 of the companies said they
would rule out an improvement in benefits while 50 were against repaying
some of the surplus to the company.
However, employers show little enthusiasm for suggestions that employees
should have a greater say in pension fund activities. The National
Association of Pension Funds has called for at least half of each scheme's
trustees to be either independent or representatives of members. The 100
Group found only nine companies among its members which had employee or
independent trustees. The overwhelming majority have a trustee body on which
decision-making is in effect controlled by company representatives.
Employers also expressed a desire to be able to use their surpluses to
reward their executives more generously. Most members supported lifting the
government's Pounds 60,000 ceiling on the portion of salary which can be
taken into calculation for pension purposes.
More than half of those surveyed had replaced their fund manager within the
previous five years because of poor investment performance.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Decision today on extending controls: Regulation of
companies in the Isle of Man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Isle of Man government will today announce the appointment of a senior
officer to establish a regulatory system to control those in the island who
form and administer companies and trusts.
Such a system is urged in a report produced about company law and trust for
the Manx government and published today. The structure of such institutions
is regulated in Manx law while their practitioners are not.
The highly confidential nature of trusts and some types of offshore company
enables unscrupulous operators to create them for people who use them for
illegal purposes. When such instances come to light it causes acute
embarrassment to the Manx government and regulatory authorities. The Manx
Financial Supervision Commission was set up in 1983 after the collapse of
Savings and Investment Bank, and has worked hard to construct a regulatory
system for the island's finance sector. Formations of companies and trusts
 -the backbone of any offshore financial services centre  - is the final gap
in Manx legislation.
Today's report was commissioned by the island's government after publication
in May last year of a report by Deemster John Corrin, the island's senior
judge.
He said then: 'I am very concerned about the integrity and competence of
those who earn their living by holding themselves out to form and administer
companies.'
Deemster Corrin recommended legislation:
To regulate and control those who form and administer Manx companies.
To make those who acquire and use Manx companies accountable to the island's
authorities.
To establish a supervision commission for companies.
The Manx government has accepted a recommendation in today's report that the
job of implementing those recommendations should be given to the financial
supervision commission.
Deemster Corrin also called for legislation:
To facilitate investigation of the affairs of companies  - consultation has
already begun about inserting a clause in the island's Companies Bill to
provide for inspections of companies.
To regulate those who carry on business as trustees  - consultation has
begun about a bill to regulate such people. To enable serious fraud cases to
reach the courts and be heard more quickly. Legislation to secure a more
speedy passage through the courts is expected this year.
The commission will be given enough resources to appoint an officer and
establish a system of regulation and supervision for all company and trust
business except insurance business, which is regulated by the Manx Insurance
Authority.
The commission is to submit proposals to enforce company law more
effectively and to consider legislation to make those acquiring and using
Manx companies more accountable to the island's authorities.
The authorities have already talked to financial professionals about the
best way to regulate this area. Points discussed include a code of practice,
a requirement for professional indemnity insurance, an obligation for
somebody in each company to be responsible to the supervisory commission and
controls on formation of companies in other areas by people based in the
Isle of Man.
Mr Jim Noakes, director of the supervisory commission, said he favoured a
register for practitioners rather than licensing. He felt that the concept
of 'fit and proper' should apply also to a company's directors, managers,
owners and controllers. Failing that, they should not be allowed to stay in
business in the Isle of Man.
Mr Noakes accepts that it may be hard to find the right person to be
regulating officer. 'We don't expect to do all this very easily, or without
cuts and bruises,' he said.

FT  05 MAY 92 / 'Check-off' risk to unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   UNIONS could lose 1m members

<TEXT>
or about 15 per cent of the total  - as a result of impending changes by the
government to rules for the automatic 'check-off' of union dues by
employers, according to Professor Paul Willman of the London Business
School, an expert in union finances.
Tomorrow's Queen's Speech is expected to include a proposal to make
check-off illegal unless an employee gives written consent to the system
every three years.
The government may also require written consent every time the level of the
union dues changes.
'Trade unions rely on a form of inertia-selling, and regular reconsideration
of the check-off option would be regular reconsideration of union
membership,' Prof Willman said.
He added in an official response to last year's green paper on industrial
relations that the check-off proposal would lead to 'considerable' loss of
membership.
Privately, many union leaders admit to similar calculations, although
publicly they maintain that enthusiastic work-place campaigns to sign up for
check-off could actually help increase membership. They cite the strong
support for maintaining union political funds shown in the political levy
ballots of the mid 1980s.
Some unions operating in the public sector, such as Nupe, have almost 100
per cent of their members on check-off.
The large general unions such as the TGWU and the GMB have more than 90 per
cent on check-off.
Skilled and white-collar unions have slightly fewer  - the engineering
section of the newly merged AEEU has 80 per cent on check-off and the
electricians' section has only 55 per cent.
Most of those not on check-off pay by direct debit arrangements or, more
traditionally, pay the shop steward.
Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, warned that if his union loses a
large amount of income from the check-off rules 'it will simply increase the
due-collection activity of 100,000 shop stewards during working time, which
is what employers wanted to get away from with check-off'.
Prof Willman says that most of the extra administrative cost of the new
check-off arrangement will fall on employers. Some organisations, including
the Engineering Employers Federation, are opposed to the change.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Power chief sees threat to coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO privatise British Coal could founder if the electricity market is
not urgently reformed, according to Mr John Baker, chief executive of
National Power, the generator.
He called on Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to
intervene, and said the electricity pool, or wholesale market, could
collapse because of the many gas-fired power stations being built.
His warning, which comes as National Power and its rival generator PowerGen
prepare to meet Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is a sign that National Power
is seeking to ensure a future for its coal-fired power stations, which must
compete with the independent gas stations.
Mr Eggar is expected to press for an agreement on the amount and price of
coal sold by British Coal to the generators. British Coal cannot be
privatised until it signs contracts with the generators because it relies on
them for most of its revenue.
Mr Baker said the generators could not agree to buy coal unless they could
sell the coal-fired power on to regional electricity companies.
This now looks increasingly unlikely because National Grid, which owns and
operates the electricity network, has warned that England and Wales will
have 60 per cent too much electricity by 1997. The prospect of that surplus
is forcing generators to jostle for long-term contracts to sell their power
to customers.
But Mr Baker said the market was not 'an even playing field'. Many of the
new gas stations had equity links with regional electricity companies which
had also signed contracts to take their output.
That could leave National Power and PowerGen short of contracts, even if
their stations produced cheaper power. They would have to sell their power
into the pool, where the surplus could force prices close to zero. The gas
stations could make 45m tonnes of British Coal's output redundant by the end
of the decade, Mr Baker said. 'Why aren't the regional companies talking to
us?' he asked. 'Why have all 12 signed long-term contracts without testing
the market?'
Mr Baker said the regulator should act quickly to check whether the regional
companies were breaking the rule that compels them to buy the most economic
power for their customers.
'I would like to see the regulator make a decision before we sign the
contracts with British Coal  - if only a statement of intent,' he said. 'If
the regulator said the regional companies could do exactly as they liked,
then by definition we would have less confidence about signing long-term
coal contracts.' He said the regional companies should be required to invite
tenders from generators.
But several regional electricity companies said they had had no offers of
long-term contracts to buy coal-fired electricity from National Power. 'We
would take a good coal offer,' one said, 'but that offer has not been made.'
The regional companies also pointed out that the rules allowed them to meet
only up to 15 per cent of their demand from the new gas-fired stations, and
most had not even signed up that much power.
But the chief executive of one regional company said there were legitimate
fears that some companies had agreed to buy uncompetitive power from the new
stations. And they might pass this higher cost on to consumers unless Offer,
the electricity watchdog, decided to penalise regional companies for
uneconomic purchasing.
Offer shows no signs of responding quickly. It said it would start work on
reviewing the issue later this year.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Business in the Community names new chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS IN the Community has appointed Ms Julia Cleverdon chief executive.
Ms Cleverdon joined the organisation  - whose president is the Prince of
Wales  - four years ago from the Industrial Society. She takes over as chief
executive of the body, which encourages companies to take social
responsibilities more seriously, from Mr Stephen O'Brien. He will be
executive vice-chairman.
The organisation gains a woman director at a time when one of its leading
priorities is Opportunity 2000, a drive to secure a more balanced workforce.
Ms Cleverdon hopes that initiatives such as Opportunity 2000 will help
ensure that the better male-female balance of BITC's own senior staff would
become the norm elsewhere.
During the 10 years since the foundation of Business in the Community -
partly in response to rising youth unemployment and the redundancies of the
last recession  - corporate involvement in the community has become a more
mainstream issue in Britain's boardrooms. One of the organisation's
successes has been to convince some companies that there is a business case
for community activities, rather than just a philanthropic one.
Ms Cleverdon sees her role as spreading this message, which is still largely
confined to large companies.
'In the 1980s, the measurement of whether a company was making a
contribution to the community was largely confined to how much money it
gave,' she explained. 'I believe that in the 1990s companies are going to
look far more strategically at a whole range of issues  - charitable
support, employee community involvement, purchasing policies, recruitment  -
and see how they can be fitted into a partnership with the community.
Companies need to put their employees' efforts alongside financial
assistance to make the maximum possible contribution.'
While some industrialists still question whether involvement in the
community should be a priority, Ms Cleverdon says that active companies are
showing growing sophistication in their approach. She cites Tesco's campaign
of offering vouchers in its stores to help schools obtain computers.
Even enthusiastic business leaders are concerned that the private sector
should not be seen as an alternative to state provision. 'The private sector
cannot make a difference alone,' says Ms Cleverdon. 'We have to forge the
closest possible links with the front-line parties like community
organisations, schools and local authorities. But we must remember that
people who work in companies and undertake community activities are not the
private sector in an abstract sense. They are parents. They are school
governors. They are the community.'
Four business leaders have been appointed as deputy chairmen. They are Mr
Peter Davis, chief executive of Reed International; Mr Eric Nicoli, group
chief executive of United Biscuits Holdings; Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman
of IBM (UK), and Mr Michael Heron, a regional director of Unilever.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Growth in magazines forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAGAZINES are poised for a decade of growth as consumer markets fragment and
media audiences become more selective.
This optimistic outlook will be unveiled by the Henley Centre for
forecasting at the annual conference of the Periodical Publishers'
Association in London today
The Henley Centre believes that the fragmentation of markets and traditional
lifestyles will boost magazines that are closely targeted at particular
consumer interests or roles.
'Our forecasts for corporate profitability and consumer affluence and
spending suggest that both parts of the magazine sector (business and
consumer) will experience strong growth in the 1990s,' Henley says.
In the 1980s the number of magazine titles in the UK increased by 75 per
cent to more than 6,000. More launches than closures of magazines are
expected throughout the 1990s.
Magazines' share of total advertising declined slightly from 20.7 per cent
to 20.4 per cent in the 1980s. However, there was an increase in spending on
magazine advertising from Pounds 643m in 1980 to Pounds 951m in 1990 because
of the overall growth in advertising spending.
Demographic changes will produce new business opportunities for magazines
aimed at parents and older people.
'The strength of the magazine sector in the 1990s will lie in the provision
of specialist information and in targeting the roles in peoples' lives,' the
Henley report says.
According to Advertising Association forecasts, the business, or trade,
press will remain the fastest-growing sector of the media, from estimated
revenue of Pounds 783m this year to Pounds 2.13bn in 2004 at current prices.

ISRAELI officials have participated in the interrogation and torture of
prisoners at Khiam jail in southern Lebanon, according to a report by the
human rights group Amnesty International.
The report, based mainly on interviews with former detainees held at Khiam
between 1985 and 1991, says most of the approximately 200 men and women
imprisoned without charge or trial there have been tortured to get
information. Victims said they were beaten and given electric shocks.
Khiam prison is run by the Israeli-financed South Lebanon Army militia.
While claiming that it has no responsibility for the prison, Israel has said
repeatedly that it was ready to 'use its influence' to free all of the
remaining Khiam prisoners and some 36 Lebanese held inside Israel in
exchange for four Israeli servicemen still missing in Lebanon.

AT LEAST 13 people were killed yesterday in clashes between Moslems and
Christians in Upper Egypt. It was among the worst outbreaks of sectarian
violence in many years and is certain to prompt calls for heightened
security.
Egypt's Interior Ministry blamed feuding between Christian and Moslem
families over the purchase of a house in a village near Assiut.
Concern is growing about tension between the two communities, especially in
Upper Egypt. Christians account for about 10 per cent of Egypt's population
of 58m, but they are most numerous in Upper Egypt.

   KABUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE senior Afghan guerrilla leaders arrived in Kabul yesterday as at least
30 rockets fired by a rival killed 13 people and wounded 77 in the Afghan
capital. Official Kabul radio blamed forces loyal to hardline guerrilla
chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
Kabul's night sky was riven by tracer bullets, anti-aircraft guns and
rocket-propelled grenades as Burhannudin Rabbani, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi
and Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf drove in at the head of hundreds of vehicles.
Thousands lined the route to the office of the new head of the Islamic
government, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi. The three leaders had driven from
Peshawar, their Pakistani base, with Shia Moslem leader Ayatollah Asif
Mohseni and the chief of Afghanistan's Wahabi sect. With them were
representatives of Mr Hekmatyar, whose forces fired rockets at the city to
underscore his opposition to the Mojaddedi government.
Under a formula worked out between the guerrilla leaders last month, Mr
Rabbani was not due to come to Kabul for two months, when he would become
the new head of state.
Mr Hekmatyar's armed opposition to Mr Mojaddedi, and the threat he still
poses to the capital, despite being pushed out of Kabul last week by fierce
fighting, appears to have forced a change of course.
Mr Rabbani, whose main field commander Ahmad Shah Masood was largely
responsible for the collapse of the former government, congratulated the
heroes of the mujahideen 'holy war' and prayed for the survival of the
Islamic government.
The presence of the guerrilla leaders will bolster Mr Mojaddedi in his
immediate battle with Mr Hekmatyar but could result in the very faction
fighting the formula was designed to avoid.
At the same time, the Kabul-area mujahideen commander Abdul Haq tried to
negotiate the release of an abducted minister from the deposed regime.
Mr Haq said said the former civil aviation minister, Wadir Safi, was safe
after being abducted on Saturday night in the capital. His capture followed
the kidnap and assassination of Mr Abdul Kareem Shadan, former chief
justice, whose mutilated body was found late on Saturday night.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Short-term hiring picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies are showing a fresh interest in hiring workers on
temporary contracts, as demand starts to pick up and union resistance
appears to be on the wane.
Temporary contracts, allowing employers to respond more flexibly to
fluctuations in demand, have been more common in Japan and continental
Europe. But last month Dutch-owned truck maker Leyland DAF became the first
big vehicle manufacturer to introduce temporary workers in its UK plants.
The company took on 100 staff on three-month contracts after signs that
demand was picking up. If the recovery is not sustained the company has the
option of cutting back again.
'A strategy of using temporary workers is now going to be a permanent
feature in our company; that's the way our parent company DAF has operated
for a long time,' Mr David Rowlands, communications manager, told the
magazine Personnel Today.
The unions agreed to the recruitment on temporary contracts in a deal which
also included a wage freeze.
In the public sector, a combination of uncertainty over annual income and
devolution of bargaining is expected to make temporary contracts attractive
to trust hospitals opting-out from local health authority control in the
National Health Service.
The National Communications Union has agreed with the Royal Mail's
engineering and construction business that contracts of less than six months
can be negotiated.
The property market is on course to improve next year, according to Healey &amp;
Baker, the commercial property specialist.
Its Quarterly Investment Report says political stability together with
optimism about a likely fall in interest rates have opened the way for an
upturn in the property sector.

<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher is to be offered a hereditary peerage in the
dissolution honours next month, it was reported last night, Ivo Dawnay
writes.
Dissolution honours are awarded following general elections and are strictly
in the power of the departing or continuing prime minister.
But there has been speculation that Mr John Major might avoid stirring up
controversy by offering only life peerages, as was the cross-party
convention in the 1960s and 1970s.
If Mrs Thatcher accepts a hereditary earldom, giving her the right to the
title of countess, her son Mark will immediately have the right to an
honorary viscountcy and be in line to become an earl on the death of his
mother. This would allow him to sit in the Lords, unlike the baronetcy which
he will inherit from his father Sir Denis.
Downing Street last night refused to comment on the speculation, saying only
that the dissolution honours were not expected to be published before the
beginning of next month.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Steady Eddie is getting ready: Peter Marsh on runners in the
race to head the Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE George is not so much knocking on the door marked 'Governor' at the
Bank of England. He is already halfway through picking the lock. Mr George,
53, has been deputy governor since 1990 and has worked for the Bank for 30
years. He has a cast-iron reputation for understanding financial markets and
has the trust of many in the government and the City.
But while the self-effacing Mr George is probably the front-runner to take
over after the retirement of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton next year, his
selection is by no means assured.
Mr George's lack of charisma may count against him; he is not a fluent
public speaker, and dislikes publicity. As an archetypal backroom operator,
he has a streak of deviousness  - an attribute highly important in the
Bank's approach to financial markets, but which might be less appreciated in
the top post.
Also, his reputation could be dented by the results of the inquiry by Lord
Justice Bingham into last year's Bank of Credit and Commerce International
scandal.
Mr George was a key person at the Bank of England involved in the
supervision of BCCI. Any hint in the Bingham report, expected by the summer,
that Threadneedle Street was at fault could rebound on him.
The chain-smoking Mr George joined the Bank as an economist soon after
leaving Cambridge. In between, he had a short spell in Berlin, working for
British intelligence. During this period, Mr George learnt fluent Russian  -
an ability useful in the Bank's dealings with eastern Europe.
While Mr Leigh-Pemberton has a mainly ambassadorial role, Mr George is in
charge of the Bank's day-to-day operations.
These include advising the Treasury on economic policy, banking and markets
supervision, and acting as a semi-official cheerleader for the City.
'Nothing important happens at the Bank without Eddie pulling the strings,'
says one insider.
Although outsiders may know little about Mr George, inside the Bank he is
said to be extremely forceful. A former associate says: 'Eddie is an
achiever; he likes to be in control.' Another insider says: 'It's surprising
how many Bank decisions are reversed in the quiet of the deputy governor's
room.'
This non-collegiate approach to decision making is said by some to be a
product of Mr George's lack of outside experience. One former government
official says of Mr George: 'He is too much of an insider (for the
governor's post). You want someone who can come to the Bank with a fresh
eye.'
Such considerations could tip the decision about the top job towards one of
the other contenders.
Also expected to be on the shortlist are Sir David Scholey, chairman of the
SG Warburg investment bank; Sir David Walker, departing chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board; Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays
Bank and former Treasury permanent secretary; and Lord Alexander, chairman
of National Westminster Bank.
But where Mr George scores highly is in his preoccupation with controlling
inflation. Although this is part of the job of being a central banker, Mr
George is 'evangelical' about this point, according to one associate.
In the past, this has led to differences of opinion with Sir Terry Burns,
permanent secretary at the Treasury and another great survivor of UK
economic policymaking.
In early 1988, when Sir Terry was advising Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor,
Mr George was an important voice at the Bank urging the Treasury to tighten
monetary policy in an effort to reduce the inflationary effects of what
became known as the 'Lawson boom'. According to one account, Mr George at
the time told Mr Leigh-Pemberton he should resign if Mr Lawson failed to
listen to the Bank's strictures. The Treasury did finally tighten policy  -
but it was too late for Mr George's liking.
When Britain cut interest rates by 1 percentage point when joining the
European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990  - to capture headlines
before the Conservative party conference  - Mr George helped draft a
controversial letter sent by the Bank to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime
minister.
This argued  - in unusually forceful tones  - that the rate cut would
unsettle financial markets.
On both these occasions, history has shown that Mr George's instincts were
correct. Whether he can meld the qualities he showed then of deftness and
intelligence with the more outgoing role which would be required in the
governor's job will be a question exercising his fan club in the months
ahead.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Prescott backs Labourlink with trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Prescott, the candidate of the traditional blue-collar left in
Labour's deputy leadership election, yesterday hit out at calls for a 'new
vision' for the party and claimed that its historic goals are as relevant
now as they were a century ago.
In a toughly worded speech to a May Day rally in Gwent, the shadow transport
spokesman defended Labour's links with the trade unions and implicitly
castigated party 'modernisers' who argue for fundamental change to Labour's
message.
His speech came as Mr Bryan Gould and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the two other
contenders for the post, stepped up their efforts to appeal to the left.
Both, however, have adopted postures aimed as much at the reforming wing of
the party, especially on party reform and constitutional change, as at the
traditional left.
Vigorously backing the case for collective action to back a campaign for a
fairer distribution of wealth, Mr Prescott said: 'There is much talk of the
need for new radicalism and new vision in the Labour party. But what is
wrong with the old vision?'
Advocating policies of full employment, accountable public ownership,
quality health, welfare and education services, and housing for all, he said
that Labour's main problem was the 'lack of the conviction necessary to
challenge a society in which the distribution of power and wealth is so
unequal and unjust'.
Mr Prescott, who won the backing of 64 MPs for his deputy leadership
challenge, said reform of the unions' block vote and role in leadership
selection must be debated.
But he added that with the union movement under attack from the Conservative
government it was essential to recognise the need for solidarity between the
party and the organisations that founded it.
'These reforms should strengthen the essential link between us, not weaken
our relations for fear that our links will be used against us by our
opponents,' he said.
Meanwhile Mrs Beckett used a weekend television interview to remind the
party of her backing for Mr Tony Benn's deputy leadership challenge in 1981
and reiterated her reservations about Mr Neil Kinnock's abandonment of a
unilateral nuclear disarmament policy.

EC aid ministers yesterday approved the dispatch of 800,000 tonnes of food
to Africa and other famine-stricken parts of the world, David Buchan reports
from Brussels.
Most of the aid, worth a total Ecu220m (Pounds 154m), represents an increase
in the EC's 1992 aid budget, requiring approval of the European parliament
which is expected today.

ARGENTINA has said it wants to take up an offer by the US government to sell
it fighter aircraft, ending the arms embargo clamped on Argentina by Britain
and the US after the Falklands conflict 10 years ago.
The American A4M Skyhawks would replace aircraft Argentina lost in 1982.
On Friday, Brigadier Jose Julia, air force commander, announced his
'absolute conviction that before the end of the year we will see in our
skies more, and better combat aircraft.'
US officials played down the importance of the proposed sale. They noted
that the Skyhawks were obsolete, and that they would not be supplied with
weapons systems.

<TEXT>
MR F W DE KLERK, the South African president, last night reshuffled his
cabinet, appointing Mr Derek Keys, the former chairman of Gencor, the South
African mining and industrial conglomerate, as the new finance minister.
Mr Keys, who was appointed minister of trade and industry and economic
co-ordination earlier this year, will now take responsibility for finance as
well. He replaces Mr Barend du Plessis who resigned 10 days ago because of
exhaustion.
Mr Keys will take up his post at a time when South Africa is faced with a
difficult political transition from white rule to multi-racial democracy,
with a multi-party interim government expected to assume power within
months.
His appointment will be welcomed by the business community, which credits
him with a revolution in managerial attitudes at Gencor. Under his
leadership, the company achieved a sharp improvement in profit performance,
increased its stock market rating and gained a reputation as the best
managed mining house in South Africa.
As Gencor chairman, he was praised for his policy of decentralised
management, involving maximum delegation of duties and responsibilities  - a
policy which he may need to pursue in his new job, which covers a number of
important economic portfolios.
Mr De Klerk also announced the appointment of Mr Roelf Meyer, one of
government's chief constitutional negotiators, as minister of constitutional
development, to replace Mr Gerrit Viljoen. Mr Gene Louw is to take over from
Mr Meyer as minister of defence.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Old champion re-enters Kenya's democratic lists: Kenneth
Matiba's return signals start of the flight for opposition leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S fraught transition to democracy entered a new phase at the weekend
with the return to Nairobi of Mr Kenneth Matiba, a founding father of
Kenya's democracy movement.
Welcomed home by an enthusiastic crowd, the ex-minister and former detainee,
who has spent more than a year in London receiving medical treatment after a
stroke, announced his candidacy for the presidency in the election expected
later this year.
It signalled the official start of the battle for the leadership of the main
opposition party, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), likely
to be as passionate as the campaign to oust President Daniel arap Moi.
Ethnicity rather than ideology, personality rather than policy, are likely
to determine the outcome in both cases.
Mr Matiba was given a tumultuous reception. But the thousands who turned up
to greet him were drawn mostly from his Kikuyu tribe, Kenya's single largest
ethnic group.
The event provoked an instant response. On the day Mr Matiba arrived home,
Mr Oginga Odinga, Ford's interim chairman and undisputed leader of the Luo
tribe, Kenya's second biggest ethnic group, said he would not give up his
own candidacy for president. Mr Odinga, a former vice president, said that
at independence he had moved aside for former President Jomo Kenyatta, a
Kikuyu, and he would not do the same again.
His stand reflects widespread feelings among Kenya's ethnic groups that the
Kikuyu have had their chance at political power and should now allow someone
from another tribe to have the presidency. In Kenya there is a common
understanding that the tribe which has captured the presidency has received
a disproportionate allocation of public sector jobs and economic benefits.
A columnist in Nairobi's Sunday Nation newspaper last week advised Mr Matiba
to beware of power-hungry individuals who were bent on hijacking the
democratic movement for tribal reasons and suggested he stand aside in the
presidential race.
At the weekend Mr Matiba brushed aside the tribal question and said:
'Kenyans are not the same as they were 20 years ago. John is John wherever
he was born.' Yet the reality is that Mr Matiba returned to a country torn
by tribal violence fuelled by fears of impending political change.
Since the beginning of March, at least 250 people have been killed and
25,000, mostly Kikuyus, left homeless in clashes with President Moi's
Kalenjin tribe in western Kenya.
Mr Matiba's candidacy is also dogged by a split in Ford's Kikuyu ranks. Many
younger Kikuyu politicians are grouped around Mr Paul Muite, the lawyer
activist who is adamant that the older generation of politicians should make
way.
Questions have also been raised about Mr Matiba's health following his
stroke. Many doubt whether he is fit enough for a gruelling campaign.
Prospects for a stable transition have not been helped by government's
failure to elaborate a clear programme, negotiated with the opposition. But
as long as Ford remains preoccupied by its internal battles, the uncertainty
and tribal clashes will go on.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Riots likely to provoke shift to right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS the smoke drifts away from a calmer Los Angeles, electoral analysts have
been debating the likely political fallout from last week's riots and the
controversial trial verdict that triggered them.
Both President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton have veered in their
response to last week's events. They have gradually diminished their
emphasis on understanding the frustration caused by a jury's acquittal of
four police officers filmed beating Mr Rodney King, and have toughened their
insistance on respect for law and order.
In the longer run, however, both the verdict and the Los Angeles violence
have unleashed emotions that could significantly reshape voting patterns, if
either candidate can succeed in tapping them in November's presidential
election.
At first glance, Mr Bush would seem to have a hard task turning last week's
events to his advantage. He has been accused both of fanning racial hatred
with his divisive 1988 election campaign and of neglecting the urban
problems that provided the tinder for the Los Angeles rioting.
The latter criticism has been especially pointed when it has come from his
own secretary of housing and urban development, Mr Jack Kemp.
But for Mr Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, the issues
raised in Los Angeles last week are also fraught with difficulty.
Although he has drawn heavily on urban, low income and black voters in this
year's primaries, Mr Clinton's candidacy has been underpinned by an effort
to pull the Democratic party in a direction that will enable it to recapture
the socially conservative middle class, and mostly white, voters who
deserted it in the 1980s in favour of former president Ronald Reagan's
Republicanism.
Indeed, Mr Clinton has been criticised by many Democratic city leaders of
himself neglecting urban problems in his campaigning  - although he has been
consistent in his appeals for racial unity.
Worse still, last week's scenes of burning and looting seem likely to
reawaken the worst fears of white suburban voters and play into one of the
most glaring of the Democrats' electoral weaknesses in the last two decades:
the perception that they are soft on crime.
There is one difference from the urban unrest of 1965-68 which propelled Mr
Reagan to California's governorship and Mr Richard Nixon to the presidency
on a law and order platform.
This time, the Republicans have been in power, both in California and in the
White House, for over a decade and so it should be more difficult for them
to blame crime and violence on their Democratic opponents.
Yet political analysts agree that the likely outcome of last week's violence
 - despite general public disagreement with the acquittal that preceded it
 -will be a move towards the right.
This year, they argue, voters in the suburbs ' suburbs like Simi Valley, the
predominantly white community whose jurors delivered last week's
controversial verdict  - will for the first time outnumber those in the
cities. For those voters, reaction to the rioting is likely to outweigh
reaction to the verdict.

Mr Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Democratic party, also led a

measures with officials there.
South Korean students chanted anti-American slogans outside the US embassy,
demanding that Korean residents in Los Angeles be compensated for riot
losses.
Meanwhile, China told the US yesterday to put its own house in order after
the race riots in Los Angeles before telling Beijing to clean up its human

FT  05 MAY 92 / Envy at Korean climb up the financial ladder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past few days the world has viewed scenes of violence in Los
Angeles, recorded by helicopter television crews. Also shown over and over
have been the horrific images, captured by an amateur photographer, of the
beating of Mr Rodney King, a black motorist, at the hands of four white Los
Angeles policemen.
But there is another videotape, less widely broadcast, that tells much more
about the complexity of racial tensions that violently erupted in California
last week.
This camera was mounted in a Los Angeles grocery store, and it recorded the
shooting of Latasha Harlins, a 15-year-old black girl, who got into an
argument with a Korean grocer over paying for a Dollars 1.79 (Pounds 1.01)
bottle of orange juice. Within Los Angeles' black community, Latasha is as
well known as Rodney King.
The probation sentence given to her killer, Soon Ja Du, a Korean business
owner, convinced many blacks that the judicial system holds double standards
based upon racial discrimination. On any day of the week in this city,
including the day last November when Latasha Harlins' killer was sentenced,
black men are sent to jail for far lesser crimes.
It was no coincidence that in last week's violence, businesses owned by
Korean immigrants were targeted for destruction. More than 850 shops and
businesses owned by Korean immigrants were set alight or looted. According
to preliminary estimates, the Korean community suffered more than half of
the total losses of about Dollars 550m.
Tensions between black Los Angelenos and Korean immigrants have been
simmering for some time. Last year, blacks in South-Central Los Angeles
staged a summer-long boycott of a liquor store where a black man had been
shot by the Korean owner.
Resentment toward Korean and other Asian immigrants stems from their
apparent ability rapidly to rise above the poverty of black and Hispanic
neighbours in America's inner-city ghettos. This is especially true in
South-Central Los Angeles, which 10 years ago was predominantly black.
Since then it has drawn in new Latino and Asian immigrants, including some
300,000 Koreans. Now blacks find themselves a minority, even within
traditionally black neighbourhoods.
Asian immigrants, many of them better educated than poor Americans, own most
of the grocery stores and laundries in this section of the city.
The key to the ability of Korean immigrants to climb the economic ladder is
their system of mutual financial support, called keh, through which friends
and family members provide what westerners would term venture capital for
new businesses.
Typically, some 50 or so Asian immigrants pool their savings to give one of
their members the opportunity to open a grocery store or a laudromat.
Ultimately, each member of the group is financed.
Others arrive in the US with substantial funds, or spend years working long
hours to save money to open their own business. According to the US Census
Bureau, 10 per cent of all Korean immigrants own their own businesses and 75
per cent work in a company they partially own, or work for another Korean
business.
In contrast, black entrepreneurs find it almost impossible to raise capital
for inner-city businesses. While blacks make up more than 12 per cent of the
US population, they own only 3 per cent of businesses.
Last week some rioters  - not all of them black  - seemed intent on
redressing the balance of opportunity.
In the wake of the violence there have been some signs of hope. Whites and
blacks joined weekend clean-up efforts in Koreatown and thousands of
Koreans, calling for reconciliation, marched the streets.
Yet this conflict demonstrates that the problems of Los Angeles are not
simply 'black versus white'. The city has complex racial and cultural
tensions, sharpened by economic pressures that can set them alight.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Falling wages spell rising crime in black America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOS ANGELES riots were sparked by what appeared to many to be a
miscarriage of justice; and slow burning resentment arising from past
decades of judicial inequality are the historical background to this latest
bout of race-related discontent. But the tinder which inflamed the anger of
the rioters has an important economic element: the collapse in the legal
economic opportunities of badly educated young black men over the past two
decades, and the rise of crime as a substitute.
The poor and poorly educated, regardless of race, have been hardest hit by
the economic shifts which have affected the US economy over the past two
decades. The virtual disappearance of high-wage, low-skill manufacturing
employment and the rising demand for educated and technically literate
graduates have opened wide gaps in wage and employment opportunities. The
real wages of the lowest-paid 10 per cent of workers fell by more than 30
per cent between 1970 and the late 1980s while the percentage of unskilled
men without jobs doubled to more than 30 per cent over the same period.
This long-term decline in the probability of, and return from, unskilled
employment has affected young black men particularly badly. Young blacks are
less likely to graduate from high school, less likely to find employment and
can expect to earn a third less than young white males. A quarter of all
18-24 year olds, but 30 per cent of young blacks, failed to complete high
school in the late 1980s; the employment rate of less experienced black men
is now 10 percentage points lower than that of whites, as the upper chart
shows; and the gap between the earnings of young blacks and whites is
growing again.
Poor employment opportunities have led directly to a large rise in criminal
activity among young black men, according to Mr Richard Freeman, an
economics professor at both the London School of Economics and Harvard
University. One-fifth of all black men aged 16-34 year of age had a criminal
record in the 1980s, compared to 7 per cent of all men in that age group.
Criminal activity is also concentrated among the badly educated. According
to Mr Freeman, 'the proportion of disadvantaged young black men with
criminal records grew so large in the 1980s that crime became a major
determinant of their economic life rather than deviant behaviour on the
margin.' Over two-thirds of all prisoners aged 18-24, and three-quarters of
black prisoners in that age group, are high school drop-outs; more than
three-quarters of black male high school drop-outs aged 16-34 have a
criminal record; and 26 per cent of all black male drop-outs aged 25-34 were
in prison in 1986, compared to 7.4 per cent of all male drop-outs.
This rise in criminal activity partly reflects the higher relative return
from crime in recent years. The rather sketchy US evidence suggests that
badly educated young men can triple their take-home pay though crime. A
survey in Boston in 1989 found that over two-thirds of young men believed
they could make more money 'on the streets', up from a third in 1980.
Crime also brings risks. Mr Freeman reports a survey of regular drug-dealers
in Washington DC which found they had a 50 per cent chance of being charged
with a drug offence in any given year, while those arrested had a 50 per
cent chance of imprisonment. A criminal record also stunts future legitimate
job opportunities. A past spell in jail reduces the probability of future
work by 25-30 per cent, of which only a third is due to future imprisonment.
Any serious attempt to reduce inner-city poverty and non-employment in the
US will have to reduce the incentive to become involved in crime. Mr Freeman
argues that a rise in legitimate labour force participation will require a
combination of spending on law enforcement, rehabilitation for past
offenders and education for likely drop-outs. The scale of the recent
destruction suggests these programmes would be worth the money.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Tough challenge for LA's task force chief

<TEXT>
MR PETER UEBERROTH, named by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley to lead
reconstruction efforts in the riot-torn city, is a man who thrives on
challenges, but many see his latest undertaking as daunting.
More than 1,600 businesses were destroyed or severely damaged in
South-Central Los Angeles in three days of violence. A total of 5,200
buildings were severely damaged.
Mr Bradley said that he chose Mr Ueberroth to head the task force because of
the superb job he did as head of the committee that organised the 1984
Olympic Games in Los Angeles, winning unprecedented support from the private
sector and ultimately recording a Dollars 215m surplus for the city.
A keen sportsman, Mr Ueberroth also served as US baseball commissioner from
1984-89, and is credited with solving the financial problems of the sport.
Mr Ueberroth, who is a staunch Republican, has been mentioned in some
circles as a potential political candidate. He is reputed to be a smart,
tough negotiator and a good organiser who is skilled at keeping the peace
but mobilising support for his cause.
He currently heads the Contrarian Group, an organisation that invests in
troubled companies, aiming to turn them around.
The son of a travelling salesman in aluminium siding, Mr Ueberroth, 54,
began his business career in Hawaii, where he was hired by the financier Mr
Kirk Kerkorian to help him establish a non-scheduled airline. At the age of
23, Mr Ueberroth founded his own charter airline service, but the venture
failed.
None the less, Mr Ueberroth went on to a successful career in travel-related
services, founding and acquiring companies that provide reservation
services, travel agencies and hotels. In 1989 he mounted a bid to acquire
the now defunct Eastern Airlines.
He has recently been in the public eye as head of the Council on California
Competitiveness, which last week delivered a damning report on the state's
business environment. which concluded that California is 'on the road to
fiscal disaster'.
'Government in California is not working at any level; it is in a state of
paralysis,' the report asserts.
In Los Angeles, Mr Ueberroth must cut through government red tape and
persuade the private sector to invest in what to many appears the most
unlikely of 'turnrounds'.
Although local government leaders welcomed Mr Ueberroth's involvement, many
remain sceptical about his ability to revive parts of the city that were
economically depressed even before last week's devastation.
Despite the scale of the task, he exudes confidence.
'We are not going to put it back the way it was. We are going to make it
better,' he said, after touring the riot-ravaged streets of South-Central
Los Angeles over the weekend.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton seem set to win substantial,
three-state victories today in their parties' primaries.
Just as in Pennsylvania's primary last week, today's votes in North
Carolina, Indiana and the District of Columbia have generated little heat.
Mr Bush has formally wrapped up his party's nomination, and Mr Clinton, who
has already won more than 70 per cent of the delegates he needs, is now
behaving as the Democrats' de facto nominee.
This robs their two surviving challengers  - Mr Pat Buchanan, the right-wing
television commentator, for the Republicans, and Mr Jerry Brown, the former
governor of California, for the Democrats  - of any realistic claim to be
still in contention.
Mr Buchanan is staging his last stand in North Carolina, hoping to embarrass
Mr Bush by at least partially emulating the 1976 success of Mr Ronald Reagan
against incumbent President Gerald Ford.
North Carolina boasts a large body of conservative voters who have
consistently re-elected Senator Jesse Helms  - possibly the most right-wing
senator  - but Mr Helms has backed Mr Bush, although with little evident
relish.
On the Democratic side, Mr Brown seems unlikely to make much of a dent in Mr
Clinton's ability to garner votes in the south; and opinion polls suggest he
will not fare much better in Indiana or the District of Columbia.
Recent polls show Mr Clinton winning 60 per cent of the Democratic vote in
North Carolina, against Mr Brown's 13 per cent, and 55 per cent in Indiana
compared with Mr Brown's 15 per cent. At the weekend Mr Clinton also picked
up delegates from caucus votes and party conventions in Guam, Texas and
Missouri.
But the same polls suggested that Mr Clinton would come in third in both
states in a three-candidate general election against President Bush and Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is seeking to enter the election as an
independent candidate.
Mr Perot yesterday urged caution in accepting a free-trade agreement with
Mexico, Reuter adds from San Antonio, Texas.
He said the US was in a vulnerable position. 'Just to suddenly throw the
doors open will really wipe out the jobs of millions of people in this
country,' he said.

FT  05 MAY 92 / German interest rates put Emu success at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH German interest rates are jeopardising many EC countries' chances of
meeting the stiff fiscal targets set for European monetary union (Emu) at
the Maastricht summit.
The objectives were laid down as the crucial criteria to decide which
countries could participate in Emu at the end of the decade.
However, sluggish European economic growth  - a consequence of high interest
rates across the continent  - is leading to a sharp increase in EC
public-sector borrowing this year. This compounds the economic obstacles in
the path of Emu, which is already facing larger than expected political
hurdles because of the growing reluctance of the German population to
countenance abandoning the D-Mark.
Underlining a growing mood of questioning about Germany's commitment to Emu,
one senior European central banker said at the weekend: 'There's no doubt
that they (the Germans) are having some second thoughts.'
Economic expansion in most western European countries is expected to remain
in the 1-2 per cent range this year, after an average of only 1.2 per cent
last year.
Dampened growth automatically widens public-sector deficits by increasing
social security spending and reducing tax revenues. This is raising doubts
over whether a majority of European countries will be able to fulfil the
fiscal targets by the time of the earliest date for Emu in 1997.
Because of bloated deficits caused by unification, some experts at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris
calculate that Germany itself may not be able to meet the fiscal targets.
A considerable economic pall has been cast by the Bundesbank's policy of
keeping interest rates high to dampen the inflationary effect of steep
German public-sector deficits. These deficits have been driven up by
large-scale transfers of public funds from west to east Germany.
Reflecting concern about the growth of German money supply well outside the
Bundesbank's target range, the central bank seems likely to keep its
discount and Lombard interest rates unchanged at least until the autumn.
They were raised to 8 per cent and 9 3/4 per cent respectively - the highest
levels since the 1930s  - a week after the Maastricht meeting.
The Maastricht fiscal policy criteria require that countries bring their
budget deficits down to no more than 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
The outstanding stock of government debt is required not to exceed 60 per
cent of GDP.
Andrew Fisher adds from Frankfurt: Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of
the Bundesbank, reaffirmed yesterday that the bank had no intention of
cutting interest rates for the moment, as inflation was 'unacceptably high'
and money supply growing too fast. The bank's goal was an inflation rate of
2 per cent or less.

FT  05 MAY 92 / French government likely to secure comfortable debate
majority

<TEXT>
DESPITE uncertainty over the votes of the right-wing Gaullist RPR party, the
French government is likely to secure a comfortable majority in this week's
debate in the National Assembly on revising the constitution, as the first
step to ratifying the Maastricht treaty on European union, writes Ian
Davidson in Paris.
The leaders of the RPR opted last week to play down the treaty's
significance and urged members to support it in principle.
But among the Gaullist rank-and-file serious reservations remain about some
constitutional aspects of the treaty, and the group has said it will table
amendments to the government's constitutional revision bill.
However, the government can count on overwhelming support from members of
the Socialist party, as well as almost all of the centre-right UDF umbrella
grouping and the UDC centrist group, both of which are traditionally
pro-European.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Race for Europe's central bank hots up: An acrimonious
tussle between governments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, entertained Sir Brian Jenkins, Lord
Mayor of London, to lunch last Tuesday the two men had billions of dollars
on their minds.
Sir Brian was in Paris, accompanied by Mr Pen Kent, an associate director at
the Bank of England, as part of a Pounds 1.5m campaign by the City to try to
bring the future European central bank (ECB) to London.
It was the latest move in an acrimonious tussle over the site of the EC's
planned supranational monetary institution, a dispute primarily pitting
Britain against Germany, which has lodged a strong bid to make Frankfurt the
ECB's home.
Under plans for European monetary union (Emu) by the end of the century, the
ECB would operate interest rate policies across Europe and pool huge
quantities of foreign exchange reserves. At stake is not simply the prestige
of hosting the bank which controls European money, but also the additional
financial business activity which could be brought in its wake.
EC heads of government are scheduled to decide on the issue by the end of
the year, possibly at the EC summit in Edinburgh in December. Initially they
have to choose a site for the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the
embryonic central bank which is due to open its doors at the start of stage
two of Emu on January 1 1994.
The EMI will be converted into a fully-fledged central bank when the third
and final stage of Emu starts  - either in 1997 or in 1999, on present EC
plans.
Because of the complexities of the problem  - which also involves decisions
on the sites of a number of other European institutions  - the matter may
drag on into next year. The Paris Foreign Ministry, for instance, says
France will block any decision on the site of the central bank until the EC
agrees that Strasbourg will be the permanent home of the European
parliament.
Central bankers warn that postponement would greatly damage chances of
choosing staff and facilities for the EMI in time for its planned start-up.
Paris has not put in a bid to attract the ECB, although both Lyons and
Strasbourg are contenders. But Mr Chirac, as one of the leaders of France's
right-wing opposition, will play a role in forming public opinion on the
issue.
Sir Brian met Mr Chirac above all to try to enlist France's support to stop
the ECB going to Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Bundesbank have
energetically backed Frankfurt, arguing that a decision in the city's favour
is necessary to combat unease in Germany about giving up the D-Mark.
A more likely outcome of London's high-profile campaigning, however, will be
to encourage EC governments to place the bank in a city outside one of the
continent's three largest financial centres. This would prevent either
London, Frankfurt or Paris claiming that one of the other centres was
clinching an unfair competitive advantage.
On this reckoning, Amsterdam is a clear favourite as a compromise.
'People know that smaller countries get their chance when larger countries
disagree. Then the choice should be for Amsterdam,' says one Dutch official.
If Amsterdam was held to infringe the competitive status of, say, Paris,
then a still more modest financial centre  - Luxembourg  - would come into
the running.
Germany's insistent pro-Frankfurt stance is prompting criticism from other
EC countries. One top European central banker  - from a country not seeking
for itself the ECB site  - said: 'They (the Germans) are bringing it to a
level at which it is difficult to have a reasonable discussion.'
London's candidature, on the other hand, is greeted with derision from
German officials. They point out that Britain is the only EC country not to
have declared its willingness to proceed to the (final) stage three of Emu.
Germany is stepping up the drumbeat in favour of Frankfurt. Bonn has stopped
short of suggesting it will not ratify the Maastricht treaty unless the
Commission opts for Frankfurt. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minster, has
however said that Germany will find it more difficult to accept a single
European currency unless the decision-making centre is Frankfurt.
According to Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive of Commerzbank, the
third largest German bank, Frankfurt is the 'obvious and logical' choice. In
view of the symbolic importance of Frankfurt as the home of the Bundesbank,
Mr Kohlhaussen argues that a vote for any other city would appear as if
'stability as the precondition of a hard currency was no longer seen as so
important'.
Central bankers point out that, for money dealing purposes, the geographical
location of the bank is irrelevant.
The decision will be a matter of pure politics. Other matters, for instance
on the application of the Maastricht criteria drawn up to decide which
countries should join Emu, are economically more important. The wrangling
indicates, however, that  - nearly five years before the earliest date at
which monetary union could actually start - the political consensus behind
Emu is still remarkably fragile.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Leaders in Bonn reject talk of grand coalition
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALK of a grand coalition between Christian Democrats and Social Democrats
to tackle Germany's daunting unification problems is spreading through Bonn,
in spite of denials from all the key party leaders that they want anything
of the kind.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, Social Democrat (SPD) prime minister of Lower Saxony
and one of the party's leading state 'barons', called yesterday for just
such a solution on the grounds that the current Christian Democrat
(CDU)-Free Democrat (FDP) coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl was no longer
capable of running the country.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and leader of the Bavarian-based Christian
Social Union (CSU), sister party of the CDU, said in an interview with Stern
magazine that the coalition partners must solve their differences before the
summer break, or they might fall apart.
And Mr Wolfgang Kubicki, state leader of the FDP in Schleswig-Holstein, gave
them less: just six weeks to decide common policies on the key questions of
budget cuts, dealing with asylum seekers, financing old-age care, and
fighting crime, or face collapse.
Without the FDP, the CDU and CSU would lack a working majority in the
Bundestag by 13 votes: they currently have 319 seats in the 662-seat lower
house of parliament. The SPD could not put together a rival government
without at least two partners, the FDP and the Progressive Democrats, the
successor-party to the Communists in East Germany. The SPD has 239 seats,
the FDP 79, the PDS 17 and the Greens just eight.
The only obvious alternative solution would be a grand coalition of CDU/CSU
and SPD, as was formed in 1966.
It is a solution so far flatly rejected by both Mr Kohl and the entire
national leadership of the SPD, which heard Mr Schroder's proposal yesterday
and rejected it.
The one sign of action, however, is that the SPD leadership has agreed to
meet the government partners for cross-party talks on May 27  - to discuss
the financial burden-sharing between the central government and the states,
and probably other key differences which might require a constitutional
change to resolve: asylum and ratification of the Maastricht treaty on
European union.

SPAIN HAS warned it will continue to block the EC convention allowing free
movement of people within the Community unless the UK is willing to
negotiate the restoration of Spain's territorial sovereignty over Gibraltar,
writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The warning, which affects a key element of European single market
legislation, came in the course of talks yesterday between Mr Francisco
Fernandez Ordonez, Spain's foreign minister, and his UK counterpart, Mr
Douglas Hurd.
Under the External Frontiers Convention, which will take effect next year,
Gibraltar would become a Community entry point. Spain views such a
development as undermining its claims over the British colony, which joined
the EC in 1973 as a dependent British territory.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Craxi caught in cross-fire of Milan scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE effects of the two-month-old Milan corruption scandal, centring on
pay-offs for public contracts being funnelled to political parties, have
finally reached Rome and are likely to influence the choice of Italy's next
president.
At the same time the Milan municipal council is expected to resign as a
result of the scandal, and an interim council of 'technicians' be appointed
under Mr Giampiero Borghini, the socialist mayor.
Milan magistrates are expected to decide this week whether to make a formal
request to parliament for the waiving of immunity on Mr Carlo Tognoli, the
outgoing Socialist minister of tourism, and Mr Paolo Pillittieri, returned
as a Socialist deputy in the April 5 general elections.
Mr Tognoli, mayor of Milan from 1976-86, and Mr Pillittieri, mayor of the
city from 1986 until late last year, have been notified by magistrates that
they are under investigation for alleged illegal receipt of funds. Both men
have denied any wrong-doing.
They are the most senior figures yet to be involved in the investigation and
Mr Pillittieri is the brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist
leader.
Since the arrest on February 17 of Mr Mario Chiesa, a prominent member of
the Socialist party and allegedly the central figure in a large municipal
corruption network channelling funds to political parties, almost 20 people
have been charged with corruption and abuse of office.
Magistrates appear to be establishing an ever-widening network around Mr
Chiesa, head of the Pio Albergo Trivulzio, the city's oldest charitable
institution. With the arrest last week of two senior figures belonging to
the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the charges of corruption now
include the whole ideological spectrum.
A former Christian Democrat party official has also been charged with
corruption.
However, the main political attention has focused on the Socialist party and
its leader, Mr Craxi. Mr Craxi has long made Milan his power base and the
city has been the show-case of post-war Socialist administration. The people
now under investigation have all been closely connected with Mr Craxi.
Even though the charges have not been proven, Mr Craxi's reputation has been
badly damaged. Mr Eugenio Scalfari, the editor of Italy's largest selling
daily newspaper, La Repubblica, and an old enemy of Mr Craxi, said over the
weekend the Socialist leader was no longer qualified to stand either for the
presidency or the premiership.
Before the April elections Mr Craxi had seemed the person most likely to
head the next government. In a damage limitation exercise, the Socialist
party has appointed a special commission of inquiry into the activities of
its Milan section.
But if magistrates decide to press for charges against Mr Tognoli and Mr
Pillittieri the damage will be hard to limit. Once a request to waive
immunity has been placed before parliament, the process normally takes a
month to consider.

FT  05 MAY 92 / German strikers force talks: Government to make improved
offer tomorrow to public sector unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ESCALATING action by Germany's public sector unions yesterday forced the
government back to the pay negotiating table. Talks will restart tomorrow
evening in Stuttgart, when unions will be presented with a 'new, improved
offer', the interior ministry said last night.
Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the oTV public sector union leading the
action, welcomed the government initiative. She said it was 'the first
signal that the employers are prepared to reduce the temperature in the
conflict they have provoked'.
About 270,000 workers were striking yesterday. They affected airports for
the first time in the eight-day wave of national stoppages. The strikes have
brought most transport and rubbish collection to a standstill and yesterday
forced the closure of Hanover and Berlin's Tegel airports. The oTV union
said they would be stepped up and continue today at that level 'until the
end of negotiations'.
The union also threatened to step up action at the main international hub
airport at Frankfurt, as well as Hamburg and Stuttgart. Union officials said
Frankfurt, continental Europe's busiest airport, would be hit from today.
'I anticipate broad-ranging action, for example in luggage handling or
safety control,' an oTV spokesman said. Strikes were due to start at
midnight local time (2200 GMT) and the airport would be closed initially for
24 hours, he said.
The prospect of a break in the deadlock arose as leading political parties
showed signs of preparing to co-operate over the country's financial
problems. A meeting between the coalition parties and the Social Democrat
opposition, proposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl last month, has been booked
for May 27.
The date was announced as Bonn buzzed with talk of a grand coalition or
parliamentary elections as the best hopes for resolving pressing financial,
political and constitutional difficulties.
Agendas for both the pay and cross-party co-operation talks are not yet
fixed. The oTV, however, said it was assuming that the employers' new
proposals would include an advance on the 4.8 per cent 'final offer' which
led to strike action.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and chief negotiator for federal, state
and local employers, is expected to put forward an increased overall offer
weighted to give low-income public servants a higher increase than top
earners.
He may also seek an agreement extending beyond the normal 12 months.
Ms Wulf-Mathies had earlier hinted that a compromise with limited increases
for higher earners would be acceptable.
Much will depend, however, on the total value of Mr Seiters' package. The
unions, which had earlier accepted a 5.4 per cent rise recommended by
arbitrators, have since said they want more.
The oTV alone, the biggest union among the half-dozen taking action,
yesterday called out 220,000 workers. A further 20,000 will join them this
morning.
The cumulative impact of the stoppages, which started last Monday in local
transport and post offices, hit hard yesterday as people returned from the
May Day holiday weekend. Most towns and cities had kerbside rubbish dumps
and intractable traffic jams.
Lufthansa, the state-controlled airline, said it had to cancel 200 flights
yesterday, some 20 per cent of its daily traffic, and expected worse today.
Although only two airports were closed, delays built up rapidly at other
centres as baggage handlers, cleaners and engineering workers stayed away.
About 120 long-distance trains were cancelled. Postal deliveries dried up as
sorting office strikes took effect and civil servants drafted in to help
proved unable to cope. Operations were postponed at dozens of hospitals and
children were turned away from closed kindergartens and schools where
caretakers had turned off water and power.
Meanwhile, pressure built up in the private sector. The IG Metall union,
which last week staged its first wave of warning strikes in the engineering
industry, said that unless an improvement on the employers' 3.4 per cent
offer came within days it would call an official strike ballot. Some 30,000
members have been called out on token stoppages today as employers resume
pay talks this morning in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg. Printing industry
unions, offered 3.3 per cent, also threatened to call out their 220,000
members.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Funds to rebuild Los Angeles sought from private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Ueberroth, the businessman appointed to head the drive to sort out
Los Angeles after the riots last week which killed 58, has put big private
sector US corporations on notice that he expects them to provide funds to
rebuild the inner city.
Mr Ueberroth will head a non-profit organisation  - dubbed Rebuilding LA  -
which will seek public and private sector funds, including appeals to
foreign investors headed by Japanese and Korean companies.
Los Angeles lurched towards a semblance of normality yesterday as businesses
and schools reopened, the curfew was lifted last night, and the city
confronted the task of rebuilding after last week's riots.
Mr Ueberroth, a former baseball commissioner who also stage-managed the 1984
Olympic Games in Los Angeles, has taken the unpaid post at the invitation of
Mayor Tom Bradley.
His appointment drew a broadly positive reception, although some minority
community leaders pointed to his lack of experience in race relations. Mr
Ueberroth said he would proceed only if he won the support of the
African-American, Latino and Asian communities.
The federal government yesterday sent Mr David Kearns, deputy secretary of
education and a former chairman of Xerox, the US reprographics group, to
co-ordinate government efforts to rebuild the city.
The White House said the federal government would be making some Dollars
300m (Pounds 170m) of disaster aid available, of which two thirds would be
to rebuild damaged infrastructure. In addition, the Small Business
Administration is expected to provide Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m of loans.
Damage from rioting and looting was estimated by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department yesterday at Dollars 717m, and more than 10,000
businesses have been destroyed. Officials said that by yesterday morning
2,383 people had been recorded as injured.
The White House said snipers had fired at National Guardsmen and law
enforcement officers, adding that the Californian authorities had asked for
federal troops to stay on duty in Los Angeles 'for a while longer'.
Patrols by heavily armed US marines and National Guards  - nearly 8,500 are
there  - are expected to continue this week.
Tension between blacks and Korean Americans remains high after the riots
which saw dozens of Korean stores torched and looted during the worst ever
urban violence in the US. More than 30,000 people, mostly Korean Americans,
marched in the streets at the weekend in an appeal for peace.
Hundreds of volunteers of all races joined in an effort to clean up the
gutted stores in South Central, Los Angeles, the centre of the rioting.
Hollywood stars helped with sweeping and food distribution.
'Magic' Johnson, the basketball star who recently announced his retirement
because he has contracted the HIV virus, said he would use his personal
fortune to buy property in the city's worst-hit areas.
A round-the-clock grassroots relief effort sprang up at First African
Methodist Episcopal Church on Adams Boulevard in South Central. The pastor,
the Reverend Cecil Murray, likened last week's fires to Dante's Inferno:
'But people are now combining hope with hopelessness, tomorrow with
yesterday. We feel that the movement for freedom in China, Berlin and South
Africa and Russia is spreading around the world. The walls are tumbling
down.'
Residents in South Central Los Angeles remain sceptical of how much the city
and federal government can do. One of them, Miss Pat Coleman, said she
expected interest in the inner city would decline sharply once people forget
the television images of violence, and she predicts more black-on-black
crime.
Miss Caroline Smith, a secretary on sick leave, agreed: 'Ain't nobody can
help us but a Higher Being. I've given up on people, that's why I stick with
my pet animals."
Black resentment of the 300,000-strong member Korean American community is
strong, particularly against the liquor stores which were victims of what
even the blacks agree was selective violence.
Blacks complain that the Koreans are abusive and eager to overcharge on
essentials such as milk, and that they are unwilling to hire African
Americans.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Reform of pension fund use resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY government move to prevent companies from using their pension fund
surpluses for their own benefit is likely to result in significantly lower
levels of corporate contributions and threaten the security of schemes,
according to finance directors of Britain's largest companies.
A report to be published shortly by the 100 Group of finance directors,
after a survey of its members, is the first formal response from British
industry to proposals for pension fund reform aired in recent months.
Co-operation from employers who sponsor pension schemes is seen as critical
in implementing any plans for reform. The companies surveyed account for
roughly Pounds 97bn in pension fund assets, about a third of all those in
the UK.
Since revelations that more than Pounds 400m has disappeared from pension
funds controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, UK lawmakers have been
besieged by public demands for an overhaul of UK pensions law.
The cross-party parliamentary select committee on social security, after
months of hearings, has called for legislative changes to improve pension
fund security.
While some groups have called for laws to prevent employers from using
scheme surpluses, the committee failed to address the matter, saying it
required further study. The report by the 100 Group shows that, despite
concerns that reform would hobble companies' ability to use surpluses for
themselves, the majority of large employers believe that surpluses should be
shared with workers.
Of 91 companies responding to a questionnaire, 74 said they planned to use
funds to improve benefits to members, and only six said they would not do
so.
An equal number said they would also use the surplus either to take a
contributions holiday or repay some of it to the company.
The study showed a wide degree of support for some elements of pension
reform that have been proposed by the select committee. In particular, the
finance directors are calling for 'rigorous internal control and
accountability in pension scheme management'.
The study, the broadest of its kind in the UK, found several significant
trends. Particularly, there is a growing concentration of pension funds in
the hands of a small number of fund managers. The study noted that five
internally managed funds and six UK fund managers accounted for more than
half of all the funds surveyed.
'A limited number of major fund managers control an increasing part of the
share capital of UK companies. The effect of this is yet to be seen in
practice but it may militate against short-termism,' the study noted.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Mellor to overhaul policies at new heritage department
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID MELLOR is determined to launch a rigorous review of policy in every
area of activity covered by his new National Heritage department.
This means that everything from funding of the arts to sport, tourism and
broadcasting will be given a fresh look by the potentially high-profile
department created after the general election.
Mr Mellor said in an interview with the Financial Times: 'I can't think of a
single area where there is an existing policy that doesn't have to be taken
down, inspected, scrutinised and at the very least polished up and probably
frankly dismantled and put together again.'
The former chief secretary to the Treasury insisted, however, that he
intended to seek consensus and was already planning to bring in 'a whole
host of people' for talks on future initiatives.
'I accept my responsibility to give a lead but I believe the record shows
that I am someone who is capable of stimulating a debate by bringing in the
best brains from the groups affected and outside,' he said.
One of his main tasks, which include setting up a national lottery designed
to raise Pounds 1bn a year and planning the millennium celebrations, will be
renegotiation of the BBC's Charter. Mr Mellor said neither he nor Mr John
Major, the prime minister, was about to take an axe to the BBC. He said he
did want to stimulate the widest possible public debate about the
corporation's future role and funding.
Everyone, Mr Mellor said, had wanted a powerful arts ministry rather than a
sideshow, yet they wanted him to be taken to the vet first and neutered
before having anything to do with them.
'If groups want to be represented by a cabinet minister who enjoys the
full-hearted confidence of the prime minister as a major player in his
administration they have to expect that an element of dynamism has to be
injected,' he said.

David Mellor's officials are already calling it 'the F word'. And they are
not at all sure whether they should use it in the hearing of the first
secretary of state for the new National Heritage department.
This 'F word' has nothing whatever to do with the language of an avant garde
Arts Council-funded play. This is 'F for Fun', and a reference to the
instant nickname given to one of Prime Minister John Major's 'big ideas' - a
department with Cabinet rank which brings together everything from arts,
museums and libraries to sport, tourism, broadcasting, proper celebration of
the millenium and a national lottery to help pay for those activities.
In fact Mellor does not actually disapprove of the fact that his department
will forever be known as the Ministry of Fun.
'I was responsible for that. I am not a pompous chap,' he says, relaxing
into an armchair in his temporary accommodation, the Office of Arts and
Libraries facing St James's Park in central London.
While his public image may have softened, the Heritage secretary concedes
that he has been a fairly controversial character in a political career that
began as the 15-year-old chairman of the South Dorset Young Conservatives.
The smiles over his new job description should not be allowed to obscure the
fact that Mellor is a serious politician - dubbed a 'rottweiler' by some
colleagues because of his savage attacks on Labour's taxation plans during
the campaign.
All the signs are that John Major is equally serious about the creation of
the most significant new ministry since Harold Wilson set up the Ministry of
Economic Affairs 30 years ago.
'The prime minister has taken the exceptional step of creating this
department as a fundamental vision of the kind of society that he wants
Britain to be,' Mellor says.
In the 1980s, the Tories concentrated on the need to make Britain a dynamic
economy, and to reawaken a competitive entrepreneurial spirit. Now it is
time, Mellor says, to give everyone a chance to take part in culture, in
sport, in heritage.
Later, he lights on a better way of explaining his new mission, albeit with
the help of a remark by the un-Thatcherite economist J K Galbraith regarding
private affluence and public squalor in the US. Mellor goes on: 'We want
private affluence. None of us is ashamed of private affluence; it is the
fundamental basis of a successful society. But the public dimension has got
to be looked after as well and my job is to ensure that the public dimension
is looked after.'
The new government department did not come as a surprise, and neither did
Mellor's appointment. The arts had long sought representation at Cabinet
level and the idea started to germinate in Major's mind when, as chancellor,
he imposed a tax on football pools to help modernise club grounds.
'I suppose I would have been surprised if I hadn't got the job. The prime
minister thinks the responsibilities fit me like a glove, though obviously I
must prove the glove hasn't got too many holes in it.'
Not only has Mellor been broadcasting minister (twice) and arts minister
(once) but the fact that he supports Chelsea Football Club and enlivened
debate at the Treasury - where he was Chief Secretary from 1990 until the
general election - with a compact disc player and lots of classical music
was surely the clincher.
'This isn't some poor little tugboat limping along behind the rest of the
fleet. This is a full-scale ship that can sail along with every other
department as their equal,' he says.
But how will the department which Mellor insists is not 'a Frankenstein
creation cobbled together from bits of bodies lying around in other
departments' actually be set up? Where will it be located? How will it be
funded and, most important, what will it do?
Because it is new, the National Heritage department has to reach decisions
on everything from how many paper clips are needed to how long the
department's question-time in the House of Commons will last.
Mellor is out to attract 'the brightest and best' from Whitehall and there
are signs that he may succeed. More than 50 civil servants have already
applied for the five jobs in the press office.
What is more tricky is finding a permanent home. The Office of Arts and
Libraries is too small for a final staff of about 400. Mellor wanted to go
to London's Docklands, which he regards as one of the bravest development
ventures in Britain this century. The move was ruled out because of the
slender nature of the government's majority and the need to be close to the
Commons to vote in key debates.
The old Energy Department is a candidate, along with two other premises, and
there is also the possibility that the department will go to a new building
 -one with some style though not grandiose.
'One cannot put up a sign that says National Heritage over something that
looks like one of the more unattractive manifestations of one of the direr
eras of British architecture. But equally one cannot move into somewhere
that looked as if one was getting above one's station,' says Mellor.
If all goes well, the public money that already goes to the arts - Pounds
221m to the Arts Council alone next year - will be augmented by up to Pounds
1bn a year from a national lottery.
Mellor choses his words carefully when addressing just what the mix of money
will be.
'A clear undertaking has been given that the lottery is not to replace other
public provision, but I think it was also said that we would have to have
regard to the proceeds of the lottery when looking at the allocation of
other resources,' he says, in a sentence that did credit to a former
Treasury minister.
But what is he actually going to do with the funds?
'I don't see myself as a sort of culture Tsar, either trying to provide a
false picture of the culture of the nation or providing bread and circuses
for the masses.'
Apart from encouraging 'the whole swathe of creative people in society' to
high artistic tic and sporting achievements, Mellor says he wants to create
'memorials', before quickly deciding that is not the right word.
Instead he changes it to 'permanent examples of the nature of our culture
that future generations will have pride in, the way we take pride in
Buckingham Palace or the British Museum.'
Once 'the premises and the livestock' have been sorted out, Mellor will
start to address policy. Like most people in most of the areas that National
Heritage is now responsible for he believes that change is inevitable, he
says.
'I don't want them to fear change or fear that change will be pushed upon
them by some petty dictator calling himself the secretary of state for
National Heritage.'
The secretary, who has been called arrogant, ambitious, rude and abrasive -
'tuppeny-halfpenny rubbish that people take out of the cuttings libraries' -
is already setting up a series of meetings with leading figures in areas
under the department's reponsibility, including arts and broadcasting.
A key issue will be the future of the BBC and the renegotiations for its new
Royal Charter after the current one expires in 1996. Mellor, widely praised
for his improvements to the 1990 Broadcasting Act, denies he is approaching
the BBC with an axe.
'And what's more John Major isn't either,' he says, adding that he wants to
open up a public debate about the future of the corporation.
Yet Mellor does issue an unambiguous warning about his intentions. 'I can't
think of a single area where there is an existing policy that doesn't have
to be taken down, inspected, scrutinised and at the very least polished up
and probably frankly dismantled and put together again.'
However creative his policies turn out to be, he knows the National Heritage
department will not be able to create a Mozart. But he believes there is a
vein of artistic potential which can be tapped and that it is cultural
achievements that endure in a society - more than its patrons or its
politicians.
'If we can find someone in this country who writes great music he will be
remembered long after people have forgotten what the community charge was,'
says Mellor.

FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK and Singapore attract
buyers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL buying was detected in several Pacific markets yesterday.
Tokyo was closed for a public holiday and will remain shut today.
HONG KONG reached another record high as strong institutional buying pushed
the Hang Seng index up by 129.57 or 2.4 per cent to 5,613.78. Turnover
soared to HKDollars 4.8bn from HKDollars 3.6bn. Favourable political
developments in China and a half-point cut in interest rates have helped to
lift prices.
SINGAPORE rose on institutional buying and the Straits Times Industrial
index jumped 2.3 per cent or 33.02 to 1,498.97. Volume rose to 97.1m shares
from 76.7m on Thursday.
Malayan Credit, the target of a hostile takeover bid, rose 4 cents to
SDollars 2.22, but was still short of Cycle and Carriage's offer price of
SDollars 2.25.
KUALA LUMPUR also attracted institutional buying. The composite index gained
5.84 to 597.47 in volume of 34.9m shares against 39.6m.
Tobacco shares were sought following a rise in cigarette prices, with
Rothmans gaining 80 cents to MDollars 13.
AUSTRALIA lost early gains on news of a worse-than-expected March current
account deficit. But dealers remained confident that the Reserve Bank would
cut rates by one point to 6.5 per cent today. The All Ordinaries index ended
0.8 lower at 1,664.4 in turnover of ADollars 165.1m.
NEW ZEALAND recovered from a poor opening to close slightly higher, buoyed
up by good demand for leading stocks. The NZSE 40 index rose 6.94 to
1,467.54.
MANILA rose in reaction to last week's lifting of a 5 per cent import tax.
The composite index rose 6.81 to 1,245.83 in combined turnover of 370.7m
pesos from 301.1m pesos.
TAIWAN traded in a narrow range, as the weighted index rose 6.94 to
4,539.47, in turnover of TDollars 17.3bn.

FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strikes wipe 3.9 per cent off
Lufthansa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER problems disrupted trading in Paris as the Continent returned from
its long weekend, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT showed its first sign of nerves about the public sector strikes.
The DAX index fell 5.74 to 1,728.29 while the FAZ index lost 1.7 to 699.29.
Turnover fell to DM3.8bn from DM5.1bn on Thursday.
Lufthansa dipped DM6 or 3.9 per cent to DM147.50 as strikes shut a number of
Germany's airports. Unions plan to close Frankfurt today. The airline said
that it could lose up to DM40m a day in lost revenue if all its aircraft
were grounded.
Car stocks were weaker on news of a fall in new vehicle registrations.
Volkswagen, which publishes its annual report tomorrow, lost DM1.50 to
DM378.80.
Schering bucked the trend, gaining DM1.50 to DM819.50 on expectations of
positive first quarter results today. Bayer rose DM1.80 to DM281.80 while
BASF, after paying a DM12 dividend last Thursday, was down a net DM1.10 at
DM239.90.
PARIS traded for only 2 1/2 hours yesterday due to a technical problem. The
CAC-40 index closed up 10.48 at 2,041.62, inspired by a firm start on Wall
Street, in turnover of just 1.2bn.
Ciments Francais was re-quoted yesterday after last week's suspension and
vaulted FFr78 or 20.7 per cent to FFr455, following news last week that
Italcementi would support the price at FFr470.
Other gainers included Eurotunnel, up FFr1.15 or 3.1 per cent at FFr38.70,
and Elf FFr6 higher at FFr398. But Euro Disney lost FFr2.90 to FFr134.10.
MILAN was dragged down by Stet, Italcementi and the banking sector. The
Comit index fell 6.67 or 1.3 per cent to 496.21 in turnover estimated at
more than L100bn after last Thursday's L113bn.
Stet dropped L122 or 6 per cent to L1,899 with an estimated 10m shares
traded, following news late last week that the state holding company Iri
planned a large share and warrant placement. The fall brought the stock into
line with Friday's closing price in London. Dealers said Iri defended the
share price, via Banco di Roma.
Italcementi dropped another L200 or 1.3 per cent to L14,650 as investors
continued to register their disapproval of a big rights issue to finance its
purchase of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais. The stock was also
harmed by news that Consob planned an investigation into possible insider
trading in Italcementi shares.
Fears of bad loans and a possible placement by Iri of savings shares in
Banca Commerciale prompted a fall of L108 or 3.1 per cent to L3,325. Worries
about higher property taxes forced insurers lower, with Generali down L390
at L29,500.
ZURICH's SMI index put on 27.6 or 1.46 per cent to 1,907.7.
Roche bearers gained SFr130 to SFr4,450 ahead of today's annual meeting
while Nestle bearers added SFr100 to SFr9,960 following last week's positive
1991 results. But Swissair bearers lost SFr20 to SFr742 after the airline
said passenger numbers fell by 7 per cent in the first quarter.
AMSTERDAM extended last week's gains as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to
129.9.
Elsevier was up Fl 3.60 or 3.1 per cent at Fl 118.40 on strong foreign
buying. Philips rose 60 cents to Fl 39 ahead of tomorrow's first quarter
results.
Hunter Douglas gained Fl 3 or 4 per cent to Fl 76.50 while Fokker rose Fl
1.30 to Fl 36.30 in spite of denying reports that it was in talks with
British Aerospace.
STOCKHOLM saw Skandia's unrestricted shares rise SKr12 to SKr130 amid
speculation that Norway's Uni Storebrand would sell its 28 per cent stake in
Skandia, after the latter's takeover bid for Hafnia was rejected last week.
The Affarsvarlden General index rose 4.0 to 985.5 in turnover of SKr549m.
OSLO saw Den norske Bank jump 17.7 per cent or NKr1.40 to NKr9.30 ahead of
today's first quarter results. The all-share index was up 6.58 to 449.48.
The Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable owing to the closure of the London
Stock Exchange.

FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Small is beautiful in South Korea - The
influence of foreign investors has been in second-tier stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expectations that opening the stock market to foreign investment last
January would revive South Korean equities after a long period of
underperformance have been dented by a run of bad news in recent months.
'Things can't get any worse. The only direction the market can go is up,'
says one foreign securities analyst in assessing the performance of the
Seoul stock market this year.
It remains to be seen, however, when the long predicted recovery will occur
and whether it last. The composite index closed at 620.33 yesterday, 1.54
per cent higher than at the start of the year, compared with a 8.9 per cent
rise in the Pacific Rim excluding Japan as shown in the FT-A World Indices.
Negative factors afflicting the market have included the government's
setback in National Assembly elections in March, which increased political
uncertainty. It also created doubts about the government's ability to solve
the country's economic problems, which include high inflation, steep
interest rates and a sizeable trade deficit.
The row between the government and Hyundai, Korea's second biggest business
group, has provoked worries about the effect of the dispute on the economy
and whether the feud signals a new state crackdown on the chaebol, the
conglomerates that dominate industry.
But the influence of foreign investment in the Seoul market has been greater
than that indicated by the market's index, which is heavily weighted towards
large-capitalised shares. Foreign investors, primarily from the UK,
concentrated on buying shares of small and medium companies with low
price/earnings (p/e) ratios and good fundamentals, spurring interest among
domestic investors.
The sub-index for medium-capitalised companies has risen by 35 per cent this
year, and that for small-capitalised businesses by 50 per cent.
In a move to give more prominence to smaller companies, the Korean Stock
Exchange announced last week that it would introduce a second index on May 1
that would average all share prices without giving weight to capitalisation.
Based on this index, the market has risen by 30 per cent since the start of
1992.
Foreign net investment in the Seoul bourse, which amounts to Dollars 665m so
far this year, has subsided after an initial rush of activity in January.
One reason is that the foreign preference for investing in smaller companies
meant that the 10 per cent ceiling imposed on foreign shareholdings was
quickly reached. Foreign investors, meanwhile, have avoided buying blue-chip
Korean companies because of their high p/e ratios and heavy debts.
There is speculation among foreign brokers that the government may raise the
foreign ownership ceiling to 25 per cent this summer. 'If that happens,
foreign interest will be revived. The amount of overseas investment in the
Korean market could reach Dollars 2.5bn this year,' says Mr Duncan Ross,
branch manager of Baring Securities.
The government is also simplifying investment procedures in response to
foreign criticism. 'Foreign investors viewed the initial process as too
complicated, but things are now improving,' says Mr Peter Thorn, the chief
representative for WI Carr.
Rules that prevented foreign nominee companies or unit trust funds from
participating in the market have been modified in recent weeks. But the
imposition of a capital gains tax on investors from countries that have no
double tax treaty with South Korea is still dampening interest from Germany,
Japan and Hong Kong.
An improvement in the economy could set the stage for a market rally.
Inflation appears to be slowing, while the trade deficit has narrowed in the
first quarter of 1992. A slowdown in economic growth to 7 per cent this year
from last year's 8.4 per cent should reduce borrowing demand, leading to
lower interest rates.
But Mr Philip Smiley, Seoul branch manager of Jardine Fleming Securities
warns that a market surge could be short-lived. 'There is a big overhang of
shares held by local institutions and their sale could depress any rally.'
Previous upturns have run out of steam for this reason. If enough foreign
investment is attracted to Seoul in the coming months, that may represent
the crucial difference in sustaining a recovery.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Economics: German figures focus attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTANT economic data from Germany this week will ensure that the country,
already troubled by industrial activity, continues to be the focus of
attention. The data are expected to confirm an economy slowing but not in
recession.
Most analysts forecast a fall in industrial production for last March.
Provisional figures for February's industrial production showed a monthly
rise of 1.2 per cent after January's sharp 5.2 per cent rise. According to
Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank, both figures were distorted by
mild weather factors. 'It is equally clear that there are still no signs of
serious recession in west Germany,' she says.
Employment data are also due this week. East Germany's labour market remains
grim. In March unemployment was 15.5 per cent from 9.2 per cent a year ago.
However, the number of unemployed is expected to have stayed steady in
April. West German unemployment appears to be rising, but modestly.
In the US, employment data for April is expected to confirm the anaemic pace
of economic growth. While unemployment claims have fallen since the
beginning of the year, the drop has not been of a scale normally associated
with a typical, healthy recovery.
Growth in M3, the target measure of money supply, in France is expected to
have risen further in March following February's increase. In February M3
was 3.5 per cent up on a year ago and the median forecast for March is a
rise of 0.5 per cent. The target range for M3 growth in 1992 is 4-6 per
cent.
Other economic data and events this week, with, in brackets, the median of
forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company, include:
Today: US, preliminary figures for first-quarter productivity, auto sales
April 21-30 (6.2m), presidential primaries in District of Columbia and North
Carolina; UK, April official reserves (Pounds 50m), state opening of
parliament; Canada, April foreign reserves; Japan, children's day holiday -
all markets closed.
Tomorrow: US, Federal Reserve releases Tan Book for May 19 federal open
markets committee, March wholesale trade; Japan, March trade balance - IMF
basis, March current account, March foreign bond investment; Canada, April
help wanted index (63).
Thursday: Germany, regular Bundesbank council meeting, G7 economic ministers
meet with CIS and eastern counterparts for East-West conference, April
unemployment - West (up 10,000), March employment  - West (up 5,000), April
vacancies - West (up 3,000), April unemployment  - East, April short-time
work - East; US, March consumer credit (unchanged), M1 (up Dollars 0.2bn),
M2 (up Dollars 1.8bn), M3 (up Dollars 9.5bn), for week ended April 27,
initial claims for week ended April 25 (410,000); Sweden, April unemployment
rate (4.4 per cent); Switzerland, April federal consumer prices index (up
4.5 per cent on year); Australia, March unemployment rate (10.6 per cent),
April employment (up 10,000); Canada, February wages and salaries (flat).

earnings (up 0.3 per cent), April average work week; April employment growth
(up 0.1 per cent), April unemployment rate (10.9 per cent), April housing
starts.
During the week: Germany, March industrial production (down 1.0 per cent),
March manufacturing output (up 0.3 per cent), March manufacturing orders

expecting a halved figure of 4.4p when it announces results tomorrow.
Pre-tax profit, which fell sharply in the first half of last year to Pounds
51.5m, is thought to have improved to between Pounds 53m and Pounds 55m.
Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar House acquired last June for an initial
Pounds 60m, could have contributed the best part of Pounds 10m to operating
profits in engineering and construction. Progress in that division is again
expected to have offset declines in property and in shipping and hotels.
The Ocean Emerald oil rig, source of Davy's trials, has been completed and
Trafalgar House is hanging on to it until it is paid.
British Petroleum is still suffering from lower oil prices. Last week's rise
in the oil market will be too late to affect its first-quarter results,
which will be reported on Thursday. It is estimated that the group's pre-tax
profit will drop to about Pounds 70m (excluding stock losses and gains) from
a level of Pounds 521m in the same period last year.
Tate &amp; Lyle, the sweeteners group, is reporting results for the six months
to end March on Wednesday. Analysts expect a slight slippage from the Pounds
94.7m reported last time.
Falling prices for high fructose corn syrup in the US will have affected
profits from Staley, though there will be a first-time contribution from
Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian business bought in June.
Thursday sees full-year results from Sears, the shoe shops to mail order
retailer, which appointed a new chief executive in February.
After interim profits fell from Pounds 62.4m to Pounds 4.6m, weighed down by
heavy exceptional costs relating to restructuring and disposals, profits for
the year to end-January will be well down on the previous year's Pounds
146.9m. Analysts are looking for profits before exceptional items of around
Pounds 92m to Pounds 93m, but this could come down to about Pounds 50m
post-exceptionals.
The final dividend is expected to be maintained.

FT  05 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Sweden and Finland turn in
declines
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE the EC, the government bond markets in Sweden and Finland have
suffered from political uncertainty and economic upheaval, writes Sara Webb
in Stockholm.
The Finnish government market fell 1.7 per cent in April, following the
resignation of the Central Bank governor and an ensuing outflow of capital.
The financial crisis in Finland pushed Sweden's bond market down 0.1 per
cent in April. In addition, political worries last week upset the Swedish
market and pushed up bond yields.
Sweden's New Democracy Party made a name for itself campaigning for cheaper
alcohol, abolition of traffic wardens, and lower taxes in the 1991 general
election.
Last week, it joined forces with the socialist bloc in Parliament and
stopped the Centre-Right government from pushing through the abolition of
part-time pensions.
The news that the government had failed to win a majority sparked a minor
sell-off in Swedish government bonds on Wednesday. Five-year bond yields
rose from 10.04 per cent to 10.12 per cent on the day.
But while Swedish investors reacted badly to the news, international
investors appear less concerned. They hope to benefit from a closer
association between the Swedish krona and EMS currencies.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Calm reaction to rate cut signals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDICATIONS that a UK base rate cut is likely later today were received with
equanimity by the gilt-edged securities market at the end of last week.
The reduction by up to half a percentage point was signalled by Bank of
England money-market operations and by the announcement on Friday of a
Pounds 800m tranche of short-dated gilts, available for trading from today.
Given the pricing of these bonds, they are unlikely to find buyers unless
the Bank cuts its short-term dealing rates, an action which would be
followed by a cut in bank base rates.
Signs of an imminent cut in borrowing rates, now at 10.5 per cent, might
have been expected to lead to a softening in prices for long-dated gilts, on
the grounds that it indicates a relaxing in monetary policy.
But with the economy still becalmed there seems little risk of any
significant inflationary surge. Also, with the pound anchored in the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) the chances of prices and wages
moving up substantially over the next 18 months appear small.
The hints of the first base rate cut since September came at the end of a
week in which gilts continued their solid performance since the election.
Yields dropped by about one tenth of a percentage point along the yield
curve, with a corresponding rise in prices. The 10 per cent Treasury bond
payable in 1994 moved up  3/16 to 101, while the longer dated 9 per cent
Treasury gilt due in 2008 rose  7/8 to 100 1/8 .
The price rise occured in spite of the absorption by the market of Pounds
2.5bn worth of long-dated gilts - in the form of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury
stock due in 2017 - in the Bank's biggest gilt auction yet. The auction sold
on a yield of 9.02 per cent, with a cover of 1.82 times, indicating healthy
demand both from overseas and domestic institutions.
With the successful auction, the Bank has found buyers for some Pounds 8.5bn
worth of gilts in the first month of the 1992-1993 financial year. That is
nearly a third of the Pounds 30bn total of gilts issues which it is likely
to have to sell during the year, to fund the rising public borrowing
requirement.
The pace of funding is being continued with the Pounds 800m tranche of 8 3/4
per cent Treasury bonds maturing in 1997, priced at 8.98.25 and with a gross
redemption yield of 9.18 per cent. Also available from the Bank today is
Pounds 200m of 2 1/2 per cent index linked stock payable in 2013, at a price
of 109.04.
The attractiveness of gilts to many investors since the election - in the
past month 10-year yields have fallen by nearly 1 percentage point to just
over 9 per cent - has been partly due to a reappraisal of sterling
securities by overseas institutions. It has its roots partly in a stronger
sterling.
But not all of the extra demand for gilts from non-UK financial groups was
triggered by the election result. In March - a poor month for gilts
generally in which yields increased sharply - overseas institutions bought
Pounds 844m worth of the securities, according to Bank figures.
Including purchases in February, that brought overseas buying of gilts in
the two months to Pounds 1.7bn - the largest two-month total since gilt
funding restarted last year. But in March non-bank UK investors were much
less enthusiastic. They sold Pounds 413m of the bonds, leaving the net
purchases of gilts in the month at a low Pounds 447m.

FT  05 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Torpid times look likely to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are torpid times for the US bond markets. Last week's flow of economic
news left the strength of the economic recovery as debatable as ever, and
the yield on 30-year long bond virtually unchanged at 8.00 per cent. It is
scenario which many analysts believe will continue for a while yet.
'The weight of the evidence still points to a gradual, rather than dramatic
pick-up in the pace of economic growth,' says Salomon Brothers. 'That
backdrop also should keep Federal Reserve officials open to the possibility
of further easing, because money growth remains weak, while the trend in
overall credit is mixed at best.'
'The observation that the first quarter saw the strongest quarterly
performance of the US economy since the first quarter of 1989 tells you more
about the weakness of the last three years than it does about the momentum
of the economy in early 1992,' suggest analysts at James Capel.
Last week, support for a relatively glum assessment of the speed of economic
recovery came from a steady stream of statistics. First, on Tuesday, there
was the gross domestic product figure which, indeed, showed a first-quarter
increase of 2 per cent.
As the Capel analysts noted, this was the biggest three-month rise for three
years. Nevertheless, bond markets gave a sigh of relief.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman had already projected
growth of that order, and some pundits had argued that the mild winter
weather had influenced first-quarter performance.
Moreover, for the early stages of a recovery, this is seen as a fairly weak
figure. The markets had certainly feared that the number would be higher.
Had that been the case, inflationary fears could have been sparked.
The housing figures then added hugely to the market's peace of mind. New
home sales posted a 14.8 per cent decline in March - the steepest monthly
drop in 10 years. For many pundits, this was a clear signal that the housing
sector's revival had stalled.
Two days later, jobs figures disseminated further calm. The initial
unemployment claims report showed an unchanged figure - at just over 400,000
 -for the week ended April 18. And neither the leading indicators nor the
manufacturers' orders figures did anything to upset the picture.
The former rose by 0.2 per cent, which represented a slowdown from the very
strong trend seen earlier in the year, while manufacturers' orders increased
by 1.6 per cent.
Finally, the National Association of Purchasing Manufacturers' index rolled
out at 51.3 per cent in April - sharply down on the February and March
figures.
All this presents a relatively stable background for this week's quarterly
refunding operations. The government announced last week that it will sell
Dollars 36bn-worth of new securities.
Perhaps the only modest surprise was the Treasury's decision to reopen the 8
per cent bond issue, maturing in 2021 - the first time since 1983 the
authorities have reopened a bond issue for the second time.
This week, attention is likely is focus on the unemployment figures, due out
on Friday. Here, it is reckoned that the unemployment rate will show little
change - easing to around 7.1 per cent at most, compared with 7.3 per cent
in March. And, if so, that is the sort of borderline improvement which will
keep bond markets on an even keel.

FT  05 MAY 92 / European Government Bonds: Low-yielding D-Mark bloc falls
out of favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERFORMANCE figures for April show that European government bond markets
experienced sharp reversals of fortune during the month.
In particular, the low-yielding markets clustered around Germany - known as
the 'D-Mark bloc' - fell out of favour, while high-yielding markets
continued to rise against expectations.
At the turn of the year, portfolio investors were starting to commit funds
to German bonds, often switching out of higher-yielding markets which were
seen as due for a correction. Many believed German interest rates would be
cut in the first quarter to stimulate a flagging economy, with inflationary
pressures firmly squeezed out and bond prices rising.
There have been disappointments in both respects. Although consumer price
data released last week showed inflation in western Germany slowing to a
year-on-year rate of 4.5 per cent in April, from 4.8 per cent in March,
money supply growth remains stubbornly high. In addition, the current round
of disputes has renewed fears that wage inflation will spread through the
economy. The Bundesbank now looks unlikely to ease monetary policy until the
second half of the year.
As a result, the German market returned a miserly 0.44 per cent during
April, according to the JP Morgan government bond index monitor - the worst
performing bond market within the European Community. The rest of the D-Mark
bloc managed to out-perform Germany, with yield spreads narrowing by 10-20
basis points, but were held back.
In contrast, high yielding European markets showed the best returns on the
month. The best performing European markets were the UK (with a total return
of 4.5 per cent), Portuguese (2.19 per cent), and Spanish (1.34 per cent)
markets.
However, further gains by the high-yielding markets will be hard-won. The
price rises last month were due in most cases to one-off boosts.
Indeed, prices have risen so swiftly in some higher-yielding European
markets that institutions are again wary of committing new funds.
The UK gilts market is a prime example of this. The yield spread between the
gilts and German bund market at the benchmark 10-year maturity narrowed from
nearly 200 basis points to less than 120 basis points during April. Although
the government managed to sell Pounds 2.5bn new bonds last week,
institutional investors were questioning whether gilts offer 'relative
value' at current levels.
Looking ahead, the progress of high yielding bond markets depends on the
ability of governments to stem inflation. So far the progress has been good
and bond prices have risen in union.
Equally, the UK government's determination to bring inflation down will have
to remain credible if bond prices are to rise further. Italy and Spain are
in a similar position.
In contrast, there is little doubt about the determination of the German
authorities, in the shape of the fiercely independent Bundesbank, to bring
inflation under control. Consistently high interest rates mean that bond
market investors have not seen the early gains they expected - April was a
vivid illustration of this  - but still hold the promise of big gains ahead.

FT  05 MAY 92 / What the charts don't reveal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charts do tell us something; but they can't tell us what that something is.
This, at any rate, is my frustrating conclusion from trying to prepare
myself mentally for a meeting with the whole fraternity last week. (Or
should it be sorority? or mystery? The language is short of politically
correct collective nouns.) If what they do works, why?
The best evidence that it works is solidly pragmatic: it is attracting
academic interest. Baffled by the refusal of prices to behave rationally,
the financial market group at the London School of Economics has been
experimenting with chart analysis. This effort is rather in the spirit in
which doctors have tested folk remedies. They have often found drugs which
work - aspirin is only the most important of many - and then spent up to a
century finding out how (aspirin again).
This academic work has already had some success; it has shown, for example,
that talk of support levels and resistance levels, which makes no economic
sense at all, does refer to something which actually exists in the markets.
But that is something which every trader already knows. The greater mystery
is to explain when and why markets which overshoot suddenly develop vertigo,
or recover their confidence.
The actual overshooting process has already generated a large literature in
economics, which consists largely of tautologies. The difficulty is to model
a form of behaviour which swings between mass hysteria and returning
commonsense. These turning points are at bottom what chartists claim to be
able to predict (but not to explain); but my own experiment last week,
collecting one-month forecasts of the Nikkei index, was less than
confidence-inspiring. Forecasts ranged from 8,000 to 19,000. On this
showing, chartism isn't a science, in spite of calling itself technical
analysis; more a form of impressionist art.
In spite of this, chart analysis is a growth industry. Just about all the
blue-blooded houses in the City now employ chartists to predict exchange
rates (no doubt since apparently rational approaches hardly work at all);
and more and more are charting equities and commodities, and especially
derivatives. Indeed, some practitioners now predict not what will happen in
the markets, but what rival chartists are going to predict.
This tail-chasing process is suggestive; for charts are sketches of market
psychology in action, and if that psychology is itself chartist,
meta-chartism makes sense. In the end, though, it should be self-defeating,
like trying to invest the whole market in index-following funds: either way,
prices would have no connecting link either with reality or with past
prices. It is saved from this danger by the fact that while index-following
is precise, chart analysis isn't. Indexation only works because it is not
too widespread, chart analysis because it doesn't work too well.
You may see now why trying to think about chartism is such a dizzying
business; you keep circling round the central mystery, without getting any
nearer. What is it that the analysts are observing? Simply to say that it is
market psychology gets us no further; what does it tell us about that
psychology?
One metaphor which appeals is that of a random walk within limits, like a
drunk staggering up a road; the observer can see the drunk, but not the
road. The drunk staggers, sees the ditch, and staggers the other way. A
chartist tracing his path, tells you where the ditches are; which would be
easy, except that the road itself twists. The chartist art is to distinguish
a random lurch from a frightened stagger. If this works, the challenge to
economists is to explain how and why behaviour changes near the ditches.
Or try sheep-dog trials. The sheep dash hither and yon in a rather
hysterical way. The good chartist collie seems able to read their minds; but
he lacks the language to tell us how he knows, and we could not understand
him if he tried. And that, perhaps, is how the trading houses think. They
are all buying dogs because they know that their clients are sheep. Dear me.

FT  05 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Eurosterling sector may be in need of a
short rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROSTERLING bond market has held up well in the face of more than
Pounds 2bn of supply since the UK election. The bullish sentiment which
still pervades the market is exaggerated by grim conditions in most other
bond markets. But some inventory is beginning to mount up, and the market
may be in need of a short rest.
The market has coped with heavy supply because other factors have combined
to attract crucial groups of investors to the market at the same time.
Most bond fund managers were substantially underweight in sterling before
last month's election. Since then, they have switched not just to neutral
but to overweight positions.
A month ago, the sterling bond market was beset by political uncertainty.
Now, it is one of a shrinking band not wracked by political problems.
At the same time, European retail investors, reluctant to buy the market due
to previous negative experiences with the currency, have regained some
confidence. Sterling's strength since the election, and the prospect of a
move to the narrow band within the exchange rate mechanism have helped
convince some, like the Germans, who are no longer preoccupied with their
own domestic bond market, to look again.
The sterling market is well acquainted with the alternation of feast and
famine which characterises most Eurobond market sectors.
'Sterling, like Canadian dollars, is still a hot-money sector,' said one
banker. 'It's the flavour of the month, then it's dead for two.'
There is as yet little sign that the recent crop of issues represents
anything more than the latest burst of activity. But bankers are keen to
develop a corporate bond market in sterling, akin to, or at least modelled
on, the US corporate bond market. To this end, many are developing stronger
credit research capacity. The theory is that there is a long-term trend away
from bank lending and towards funding in the bond markets.
'Banks no longer want to lend to corporates in sufficient size. The advent
of capital adequacy rules is having a strong impact on the availability of
loans,' one banker said. Some companies, realising that loans are much
harder to come by, are keener to tap bond markets.
Most of the latest batch of issues have been launched by UK companies. Among
the crop was an ambitious Pounds 500m deal for Hanson, the largest deal in
the sector to date, which lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston claims to
have placed. But other bankers suggest there is inventory around, and other
paper, like Finland's Pounds 150m deal via Baring Brothers, is not yet fully
placed.
The preponderance of UK companies in the market is strongly linked to the
availability of swaps. Swap spreads have been tight for some time, making
the market unattractive for borrowers which do not have a fixed-rate
sterling funding requirement.
Swap spreads from five through to 10-years are around 30 basis points above
gilt yields.
So a strong company which would have to offer bonds at a spread of, say, 80
basis points above the gilt yield would have to pay at least 50 basis points
above the London interbank offered rate.
Of last week's new issues, only the National &amp; Provincial Building Society's
five-year deal via JP Morgan, which took advantage of a slight widening of
swap spreads, was swapped. However, while companies are eschewing
floating-rate funding at the levels available, many do not want to lock in
fixed-rate levels yet, since they expect rates to fall further.
Indeed, perceived signalling by the Bank of England on Friday of a further
reduction in rates is likely to deter corporate treasurers further.
The tightness of swap spreads has thus limited the market to UK companies,
for the most part, reducing the availability of sovereign and supranational
paper.
The lack of top quality paper was highlighted last week by the success of a
Pounds 200m 10-year Eurobond for the European Investment Bank, launched by
Salomon Brothers, which offered a meagre 9 basis point spread above the
comparable gilt yield. Not only was the issue snapped up by investors, but
the spread has subsequently tightened to five basis points.
In fact, the performance was reflected in other sovereign and supranational
sterling Eurobonds, which tightened three to four basis points relative to
gilts last week.
Otherwise, Eurosterling spreads have been steady, a positive sign given the
strong performance of the gilts market which the Eurosterling sector
normally lags.

<TEXT>
REPAP Enterprises, a leading producer of coated papers in Canada and the US
and kraft pulp in western Canada, reported a first-quarter loss of CDollars
44.6m (USDollars 37.3m) or 86 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars
17.5m or 34 cents a year earlier. Both figures were struck after preferred
dividends.
Revenues were CDollars 278m against CDollars 274m.
Shipments of pulp and coated papers were up 17 per cent and 16 per cent
respectively in the first quarter, and Repap said firming prices made the
outlook more hopeful for the second quarter and second half of 1992.
It said an April increase of USDollars 40 a tonne for a bleached kraft pulp
will improve cash flow in the second quarter while discounts on coated
papers had stabilised.

NEDCOR, South Africa's fourth largest banking group, managed to record a 15
per cent increase in earnings in the six months to the end of March despite
the difficult operating environment.
Mr Chris Liebenberg, chief executive, said the first half had been much
tougher than anticipated. Net interest income rose by 20 per cent to R796m
(Dollars 276m) while other income was up by 19 per cent to R493m. Net
operating income was 19 per cent up at 443m.
The lower bottom line increase - net earnings were up by 15 per cent to
R192m - was principally the result of a 23 per cent rise in specific and
general provisions for bad debts to R103m.
Mr Liebenberg said although only about 4 per cent of the total loan book was
to the agricultural sector, the group still felt the effect of the bad
drought.
The bad debt position was also aggravated by very difficult conditions in
the mining industry and Nedcor's high home-loan exposure in the black
community where unrest has driven many tenants into arrears.
Total assets grew by 13 per cent to R45bn, while advances were 18 per cent
up at R33.2bn.
Mr Liebenberg said the second half would be very tough, but he expects
earnings to be matched or improved. The dividend was lifted by 11 per cent
to 21 cents per share on an earnings per share increase of 13 per cent, to
102 cents.
