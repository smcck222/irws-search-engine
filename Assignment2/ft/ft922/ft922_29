<TEXT>
L and C Steinmuller, the German power boiler and environment equipment
manufacturer, has reached provisional agreement to acquire a 40 per cent
stake in the power supplies group of Tampella, the Finnish engineering and
forestry group, controlled by the Bank of Finland.
Tampella said the arrangement would enable it to 'achieve its strategic
goals' inside the European Community while Steinmuller would gain 'new
marketing channels' in Scandinavia and North America.
The announcement follows the decision last week by the Finnish
state-controlled paper machinery and engineering group Valmet to acquire 91
per cent of Tampella's board machine production plants.
It also represents a further move in the restructuring of the debt-ridden
Finnish company that made a pre-tax loss of FIM1.6bn (Dollars 355m) last
year.
The power supplies business supplies chemical recovery systems for the wood
processing industry and heat and electricity plants for the power industry.
Steinmuller is a subsidiary of Philipp Holzmann, the Frankfurt-based
construction and project management company.
Tampella was saved by the Bank of Finland as part of the rescue of the
country's main savings bank, SkopBank. The bank's credit loss troubles were
mainly caused by the outstanding debts accumulated by Tampella on loans
totalling FM1.5bn.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bank Vontobel sees higher income
</HEADLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK J Vontobel &amp; Co, a leading Zurich investment bank, expects to reverse a
two-year profit slide this year in spite of difficult trading conditions in
Swiss financial markets, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
'We are expecting higher income this year,' Mr Oskar Holenweger, chief
executive, said at the bank's annual news conference, adding that first
quarter results were 'comfortably over budget'.
Net income of Bank Vontobel in 1991 dropped 8.6 per cent to SFr13.8m
(Dollars 9.1m), mainly because of the erosion of margins in brokerage
operations following the removal of fixed commissions from Swiss securities
transactions at the beginning of 1991. The bank's net commission income
dropped 9.4 per cent to SFr83.7m.
Income from portfolio management and custodial services was flat at SFr30.7m
while that from new issues and miscellaneous commissions jumped 30.6 per
cent to SFr20.5m.
Net interest income halved to SFr6.5m, partly because of internal
infrastructure investments, but income from trading soared to SFr22.6m from
SFr5m.
Despite the bank's weaker earnings, consolidated net income of the Vontobel
group soared from SFr6.3m to SFr22.3m, excluding an extraordinary SFr15m
transfer from hidden reserves in the previous year.
Mr Walter Kaeser, chief financial officer, attributed the gain to improved
earnings of other subsidiaries and from the treasury operations of the
parent company, Vontobel Holding. Profits on treasury operations jumped from
SFr2.7m in 1990 to SFr16.1m last year.
Vontobel Holding's net income in its fiscal year to March 31, 1992, rose 4.4
per cent last year to SFr14.1m.

dilute stake further

<TEXT>
SHARES in STET, the company which controls Italy's state-owned
telecommunications activities, continued to plummet yesterday following the
announcement that the IRI state holding group planned a further dilution of
its stake.
Ordinary shares in STET plunged by L122 to L1,899, while savings stock fell
by L95 to L1,770 as dealers responded to IRI's plan, announced last week, to
sell off more of its holding.
Under the complex proposal, IRI's stake could fall to just 1 per cent of
STET's non-voting savings shares. However, state control will be guaranteed
as IRI's holding of ordinary shares in STET will not fall below 53 per cent.
IRI now owns around 69 per cent of STET's ordinary stock and 30 per cent of
its savings shares, if all outstanding warrants are exercised.
The deal, scheduled for June, involves the sale of 350m ordinary shares and
of warrants to acquire a further 175m ordinary shares and 350m savings
shares.
Existing shareholders will be offered 'packets' of 1,000 ordinary shares and
50 A warrants, each of which will be valid to buy a further 10 ordinary
shares, as well as 100 B warrants, giving the right to buy 10 savings
shares. No terms for the deal have been disclosed.
Although attractive in principle, the part-privatisation has been attacked
by dealers on the grounds that it comes too soon after a string of
money-raising ventures by IRI, notably on the telecommunications side.
Last June, IRI raised around Dollars 275m by reducing its holding of STET
savings shares.
The market's hostility has been reinforced by the gloom on the Milan bourse,
which has been beset by general political uncertainties and a deepening
local corruption scandal.
'The market is in no mood for any capital raising ventures at present", said
one broker.

<TEXT>
PFIZER, one of the biggest US drug companies, has agreed to sell its Coty
cosmetics and fragrance subsidiary to Joh. A. Benckiser, the German consumer
products company, in a deal valued at Dollars 440m.
The deal, expected to close by the end of June, comes nearly 30 years after
Pfizer first acquired Coty, a leading supplier of men's and women's
fragrances to US mass market retail outlets.
Mr William Steere, Pfizer chairman, said the sale would allow Pfizer's
management to focus on the business strategy of the company's main
health-care operations.
He said Pfizer's strategy would be to retain the group's other consumer
products businesses, based on over-the-counter medications.
Mr Steere said Coty's 1,162 employees would be 'better served by a strategic
buyer'. He said the fragrance and cosmetics company would be in a stronger
position to realise its potential 'with Benckiser's commitment.'
Benckiser, which is based in Ludwigshafen, has operations in more than 20
countries and is active in household products, fragrances and cosmetics. It
sells a range of fragrance products through its US subsidiary.
Mr Thomas Bonoma, executive vice-president of Benckiser, said Coty would
provide 'a powerful array of additional brands to complement our existing
lines.' He also said Benckiser was eager to make use of Coty's US
distribution network.
On Wall Street, Pfizer's share price was improved by Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 72 1/8 .

<TEXT>
A US federal court jury has rejected Atari allegations that Nintendo had
attempted to monopolise the video game market illegally, Reuters reports.
Atari had sought Dollars 160m in damages in the anti-trust suit. The jury
returned its verdict on Friday.
Mr Michael Khourie, a lawyer for Atari, said the jury ruled that while
Nintendo did have monopoly power, it had not tried to monopolise the market
illegally. 'The attempt to monopolise is a different offence than actual
monopolisation.'
The jury was unable to reach a decision on whether Nintendo had abused its
monopoly position in the industry. Mr Khourie said this question could go to
trial again.
In its suit Atari alleged Nintendo had used its monopoly power to force
independent software companies to agree to provide games exclusively to
Nintendo.

<TEXT>
KIMBERLY-CLARK and Procter &amp; Gamble, the two major diaper manufacturers in
the US, have reached out of court settlements on patent and other disputes
after nearly seven years of litigation, Reuters reports.
Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark announced that an anti-trust action, due to be
heard in federal court in Dallas yesterday , patent lawsuits and other
disputes in the US, Canada and Britain were included in the settlement with
Ohio-based Procter &amp; Gamble.
Details of the settlement are confidential, but Kimberly-Clark's director of
corporate communications, Ms Jean Allen, said her company 'is pleased with
the terms'.
The 'diaper war' has been waged since August 1985 when Proctor &amp; Gamble
brought a patent-infringement action against Kimberly-Clark, citing use of
an elastic waistband material. Kimberly-Clark counter-sued, alleging Proctor
&amp; Gamble was attempting to monopolise the disposable diaper market.
In July 1987 a Dallas court found in favour of Kimberly-Clark's waistband,
declaring the P&amp;G patent invalid. The decision was upheld on appeal.
Over the next five years, Proctor &amp; Gamble brought various
patent-infringement charges against Kimberly-Clark, while the latter
continued to accuse P&amp;G of anti-trust violations.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Guide for banks on securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England has published guidelines for the securitisation of
credit card receivables by banks. This process allows banks to bundle up a
large number of credit card receivables and sell them, via the bond markets,
to outside investors - a practice common in the US, writes Philip Coggan.
Through securitisation, banks will be able to remove credit card receivables
from their balance sheets - thereby freeing them to make other loans. A
number of banks, including Barclays, have been pressing for this change.
The Bank of England has been concerned to ensure that, before such loans can
be taken off balance sheet, all the risks involved in the loans are removed
from the banks. In particular, where goods bought via credit cards are
faulty, the customer may have a claim against the card issuer; it wants
banks to receive an indemnity against such liabilities, or take out
insurance to cover the risk.
In addition, the Bank intends to impose a limit on the amount of credit card
receivables which a bank can remove from its balance sheet. The limit, which
will be reviewed periodically, has been initially set at 10 per cent of a
bank's capital base.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fulcrum Trust raising funds and seeking to
extend life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULCRUM Investment Trust is asking shareholders to approve a Pounds 12.9m
rights issue and to extend its life to 1999.
The split capital trust currently has two classes of shares: income and
capital. The directors propose an underwritten rights issue of income shares
on the basis of 5-for-2 at 57p.
In addition, it is planned to create a new class of capital - zero dividend
preference shares - which will have first claim on the assets. Just over
8.6m of these shares will be placed with existing capital shareholders
having the right of clawback on a 7-for-13 basis. The zeros, which are being
placed at 103p, will be entitled to receive 208p on the new winding-up date
in 1999. This is equivalent to a redemption yield of 10.8 per cent.
There will be a reduction in the net dividend on the income shares from 9.2p
to 8.37p and the redemption value of each share will fall from 40p to 0.1p.
However, if the trust can achieve dividend growth of 5 per cent a year, the
gross redemption yield on the shares will be 13 per cent.
Shareholders must approve the proposals at an extraordinary meeting on May
26. The directors have received undertakings to vote in favour from 63.8 per
cent of income and 36 per cent of capital holders; in aggregate, this
represents 49.9 per cent of the total votes.
The directors are required to convene an EGM to wind up the company at some
point between January 1 1991 and December 31 1994.
The trust is accordingly making an alternative cash offer, equivalent to the
current redemption values of the two classes of capital; namely 40p per
income and 10.75p per capital share.
These compare with Friday's closing prices of 65p and 11.5p respectively.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Europa board favours Brierley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS IN Europa Minerals, the UK mining finance house, have been
urged by their board to support the financial rescue offered by companies
associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, rather than
rival proposals from Austmin, an Australian exploration company.
However, Mr Guido Staltari, managing director of Austmin, which is Europa's
biggest shareholder with 14.3 per cent, said that by last weekend he
expected proxies representing 45 per cent of the votes to be lodged in
favour of his company's scheme.
Europa's board reported that it had sold off one of its two remaining UK
coal properties for Pounds 50,000. This resulted in a book profit of about
Pounds 359,000, after expenses, as the company had been able to release a
provision against closure costs of Pounds 317,000.
It was negotiating the sale of the other coal property and 'significant
progress has been made in agreeing new facilities with Europa's two
principal bankers'.
In a circular to shareholders the Europa directors recognised that the
Austmin proposals represented a smaller discount to the share price prior to
the announcement of an open offer and placing by GPG and Mid-East Minerals,
companies in Sir Ron's orbit.
'This is significant for shareholders who do not take up their entitlements,
but for those who do, this would not be an issue,' the circular reads.
In addition, the MEM offer of warrants would allow present Europa
shareholders 'to participate in the company's potential upside without
financial commitment at this stage'.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Another stumbling block for Chelsea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULHAM Football Club's announcement on Saturday that it expects to stay at
its Craven Cottage ground for another season represents an awkward back pass
for Chelsea Football Club, its potential landlord at Stamford Bridge in west
London.
Fulham's agreement to move to Stamford Bridge is regarded as crucial to
Chelsea's purchase of its ground from Cabra Estates, the quoted property
company.
The deal involves Chelsea paying Pounds 13m cash and taking on a liability
to Fulham which would have cost Cabra Pounds 8.25m.
Cabra, which has about Pounds 52m debt, is anxious to have vacant possession
of Craven Cottage.
Fulham's directors seem willing to exchange Pounds 5m of the amount owed to
them for a 125-year lease at Stamford Bridge at a peppercorn rent. But they
would like the rest in cash and are concerned that the third division club
will be a poor relation at Stamford Bridge, which helps to explain the
flexing of negotiating muscles.
With Chelsea having to find Pounds 13m to buy the ground, further cash
outlay would add to the strain. This level of debt would be exceptionally
high for a football club.
As the plan is for Chelsea to become the mortgagee at Stamford Bridge, the
value of the ground with such a lease is also an issue. The main lender is
the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is carrying out a new valuation.
Cabra had considered winding up Chelsea after the club failed to come up
with Pounds 22.85m cash to buy the ground. Legal proceedings have been
halted while the new deal is negotiated.
Fulham's departure from Craven Cottage could only be delayed for one more
season because of the lease. It would have to spend up to Pounds 300,000 on
essential safety work to stay on even for that short period.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Better trading environment for Daily
Telegraph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Panmure Gordon, brokers to the Daily Telegraph, has published a report on
the company, which is planning a stock market flotation in the summer. The
report says it has been transformed over the last six years from a loss of
Pounds 11.2m in 1986 to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 40.5m in 1991.
However, the report says the company is operating in a mature area of
publishing, although the quality national sector should do well in a period
of cyclical recovery.
The broker argues that the Telegraph will be able to use its strong cash
flow and its share quotation to make acquisitions. These are likely to be in
the media, mainly newspaper publishing in the UK and overseas, and to some
extent in the UK television industry.
Panmure is constrained from making profit forecasts but says currently there
is a more encouraging trading environment, and operational gearing means
extra revenue can convert into profits at rates up to 70 per cent.
In 1993 the recovery in advertising should gather pace, and the group's 15
per cent stake in John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group, should more
than cover its financing costs.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Royal paid under Pounds 15m for options -
Move to dampen rumours on cost of election investment strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL INSURANCE has moved to dampen speculation that a deal designed to
protect the value of its UK equities portfolio against the general election
result has lost it tens of millions of pounds.
The beleaguered insurer, which virtually doubled its pre-tax losses last
year to Pounds 373m and passed its final dividend, bought put options last
autumn to protect itself against a drop in the FTSE 100 index following a
hung parliament or a Labour election win.
It said yesterday that it had paid less than Pounds 15m for the options,
that the expense was part of last year's accounts and that the options,
lasting a year, remained tradeable. There had been speculation that the cost
of the puts was between Pounds 15m and Pounds 40m.
A large part of its Pounds 400m portfolio of UK equities is covered. The
options' seller would buy shares from Royal if the FTSE fell below the a
trigger level, which Royal has also refused to disclose. It said yesterday
that the cash it would have received had the election result been different
was 'not a big deal'.
Since the election, the FTSE has risen by about 10 per cent - it closed at
2659.8 on Friday. But it is not clear what increase there has been in the
value of Royal's portfolio to compensate for the cost of the options.
Royal would only say they were taken out in the autumn. Between September
and November the FTSE fell from 2679.6 to 2420.2, with the sharpest drop
coming in mid-November.
The options were revealed with the final results in February. Mr Richard
Gamble, chief executive, said that in the run-up to a general election, 'we
simply could not afford the risk of the market going into free fall.'
The company added yesterday: 'All we have done is to take out reinsurance
against a possible loss.'
The protection of the balance sheet against a significant decline in equity
values was regarded as prudent after the battering inflicted by two years of
heavy losses.
The important solvency margin - measuring net assets as a percentage of
non-life premium income - was improved from 29 per cent to 34 per cent by
the sale of its Dutch operations for Pounds 166m in February, but was still
giving some cause for concern. The announcement that the final dividend
would be passed, saving Pounds 96m, came a few days after this disposal.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Thorny questions on commissions: The OFT inquiry into fees
charged for raising capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout decades of upheaval and change in the securities industry, at
least one thing has remained immutable - the scale of commissions companies
pay for raising capital. Even that could now change following an inquiry by
the Office of Fair Trading.
Its move could bring to a head a long-simmering controversy pitting
companies anxious to reduce costs against brokers and underwriters who
collect the fees, and which could even question the UK system of pre-emptive
rights.
For companies on the verge of bankruptcy and for those in the pink of
health, 2 per cent of new equity capital has traditionally been set aside to
cover the costs of brokers, underwriters and sub-underwriters. Brokers to a
rights or initial public offering earn 0.25 per cent of the total,
underwriters and sub-underwriters 0.50 and 1.25 per cent, respectively. Only
in rare cases such as privatisations are commissions lower.
But early this year, the OFT began questioning the resistance of the cost of
raising capital to competition, market conditions or indeed, any other
factor.
In March, the OFT approached City of London trade associations to discuss
why underwriting fees remained impervious to market forces. Its review is in
a preliminary phase, and no decision has been made on whether to launch a
formal investigation.
The OFT has received no formal complaints from companies, but it has been
made aware of 'general comment' from some unhappy about their inability to
negotiate fees.
'It just seems to me to be illogical,' says Mr Hugh Collum, finance director
at SmithKline Beecham and chairman of the 100 Group of Finance Directors
which includes Britain's largest corporations.
Companies planning rights negotiate the size of the discount to the share
price at which new stock is to be offered. He says there seems little reason
why fees for the service should not also be negotiable.
City brokers say the possible OFT attack on underwriting fees raises the
prospect of a two-tiered market, with blue chip companies making rights
offerings at a fraction of the former cost. Companies making rights
offerings to prevent them sliding into bankruptcy face higher costs. Thus,
the cost of capital would rise steeply for those needing it most.
They view the prospect with anxiety. At the heart of the UK system of
underwriting lies the pre-emptive right of shareholders to have first
refusal of any offering of stock that might dilute their stake.
Preserving pre-emptive rights requires companies to announce their intention
to sell shares at a set price ahead of the offering date and makes
underwritten offerings the one way companies can be sure of raising the
capital they need.
In the US, where shareholders do not have pre-emptive rights, issues are
rarely underwritten. Companies take advantage of shelf-registration rule 415
of the Securities and Exchange Act and file documents announcing their
intention to raise capital.
When conditions are advantageous, they take their filing 'off the shelf' and
sell shares. While there are other costs, US companies say the procedure has
made raising capital cheaper.
In the UK, a company's largest institutional shareholders typically act as
its sub-underwriters in rights offerings, selling the shares to others at
roughly what they cost but keeping the 1.25 per cent commission as profit.
'It's money for old rope,' said one institutional fund manager.
To the brokers and fund managers who earn the fees, the system is efficient,
logical and cheap. Mr Charles Nunnelley, chairman of the Institutional Fund
Managers Association and chairman of Robert Fleming Asset Management, says
companies can - and do  - negotiate costs by arguing over the level of
discount to market price at which shares are to be sold.
He says the size of the discount is the real expense for companies, not the
cost of commissions to underwriters.
Underwriting commissions are a kind of insurance policy, Mr Nunnelley
argues. They are not intended to reflect the risk of an issue but the
general market risk between the date an offering is announced and the date
the shares are sold.
Brokers say the system of underwriting militates against negotiating fees.
'A broker calls you up and says will you take a piece of XYZ company's stock
at this price and you have to say yes or no on the spot. You don't have the
opportunity to negotiate the fee,' said one fund manager.
Brokers claim capital-raising costs have responded to market forces.
Discounts on rights offerings have fluctuated widely over the years. They
hovered between 15 per cent and 20 per cent through the early 1980s, but the
competition of Big Bang in 1986 and go-go stock market prices combined to
narrow discounts to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent.
Last year, after several well-publicised rights issue flops, discounts on a
few issues widened to more than 20 per cent.
Meanwhile, Mr Nunnelley and others in the fund management industry say
little money is made from underwriting or sub-underwriting. 'It's a lot of
very small profits that can be wiped out by a single failure,' he said. When
the UK government sold its stake in British Petroleum, arranging
underwriting days before the October 1987 stock market crash, the ensuing
losses were said to have wiped out several years' worth of institutions'
underwriting profits.
The OFT wants to know how much money is made from underwriting. It has asked
IFMA, the British Merchant Bankers Association and the National Association
of Pension Funds for profits earned by members from the activity over the
past 10 years.
Mr John Rogers, secretary to NAPF's investment committee, says the exercise
has been profitable for pension funds 'or they wouldn't do it'. But the
profits are marginal compared with investment gains. If sub-underwriting
became operationally difficult for pension funds, they would not do it at
all, he says. 'For our part, we are as happy to see non-underwritten deep
discounted issues,' he says.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Lagardere to spell out merger plan today
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of the Hachette publishing empire and the
Matra defence and electronics group, will today announce details of the
merger of the two companies and a FFr2.8bn (Pounds 280m) recapitalisation
and rationalisation programme for Hachette.
The shares of both companies have been suspended since last Thursday pending
the announcement prompted by problems at Hachette.
Hachette is burdened by net debt of about FFr8bn after its US acquisitions
in the late 1980s. It made FFr3.5bn losses last year on its ill-fated
investment in La Cinq, the bankrupt French television station.
The La Cinq losses took such a toll on Hachette's balance sheet that it has
asked its banks, including Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris,
for FFr2.8bn in extra capital. The banks are believed to have agreed in
principle.
Hachette is expected to issue a combination of new shares and convertible
bonds. As a result MMB, which indirectly owns 51 per cent of the equity,
would lose its majority holding, but it is expected to retain control of the
voting shares.
MMB, the holding company through which Mr Lagardere's family controls
Hachette and Matra, yesterday announced losses of FFr448.2m in 1991 against
net profits of FFr368.2m in 1990. The board proposed to cut the dividend
from FFr2.25 to FFr1.5 a share.
Hachette last week disclosed a loss of FFr1.93bn for 1991 compared with
profits of FFr492m the previous year.

<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK'S political advisers have been taking advice from Mr Keith
Hampson, the Conservative MP with close links to the President of the Board
of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, in its battle with Hongkong Bank to take
control of Midland, it was disclosed yesterday.
Mr Hampson's role will be seen in the City of London as important since the
struggle for control of Midland is increasingly being played in the
political arena.
Mr Heseltine has the central role in deciding whether Lloyds' or Hongkong
Bank's plans to acquire Midland should be scrutinised by the UK competition
authority, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Hampson has for several years been on a retainership with GJW, the firm
of political lobbyists hired by Lloyds. He said yesterday that Mr Andrew
Gifford, GJW's founder, had spoken to him about the bid.
But Mr Hampson said he would not describe himself as an adviser to Lloyds.
'I haven't had a cheque from GJW since last summer', he said.
Mr Hampson, a co-manager of Mr Heseltine's unsuccessful campaign to become
leader of the Conservative Party in 1990, will be used as a 'sounding board'
by Lloyds, a Lloyds adviser said, though it is unlikely he will do any high
profile lobbying for Lloyds.
Lloyds is also employing Mr Tony Carlisle, of public relations firm Dewe
Rogerson, who has close links with the Treasury, having worked on most of
the UK government's big privatisations.
Meanwhile, Hongkong Bank has taken on Sir Tim Bell, the public relations
adviser who worked for Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and his firm Lowe Bell, as a
political lobbyist. It is also employing Mr Francis Maude, the former
treasury minister, as an adviser to its chairman, Mr William Purves.
Even Midland has taken on a politician lobbying firm, Ian Greer Associates.
The first important political decision to be made in the battle for Midland
is whether DG4, the European Community competition authority in Brussels,
has jurisdiction over Hongkong Bank's offer.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Volvo thwarted in bid for Procordia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish Government is to press ahead with its plan to privatise its
large minority stake in Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and food
group, thwarting a controversial bid by Volvo, the Swedish automotive group,
to merge the two companies.
The sell-off of the state holding in Procordia is expected to raise between
SKr16bn (Dollars 2.7bn) and Skr17bn.
However, under an agreement released last night Volvo will become the
largest single shareholder in Procordia and will be free to acquire a
majority stake by buying shares on the market.
In January Volvo, Sweden's leading industrial group, announced a SKr38.7bn
(Pounds 3.66bn) plan to merge with Procordia, in what would have been the
country's largest corporate takeover.
The proposal ran into opposition from the conservative-led government, which
is an equal shareholder in Procordia and had planned to make the sale of its
stake the first step in its privatisation programme.
Volvo holds 42.7 per cent of the votes in Procordia and 39.5 per cent of the
capital, while the state holds 42.7 per cent of the votes and 34.2 per cent
of the capital.
Last night's agreement between Volvo and the government is a blow to the
prestige of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's autocratic chairman, whose
pre-emptive move to force through a merger clearly under-estimated the
strength of Swedish government opposition.
Under last night's agreement Volvo will raise its holding in Procordia from
42.7 per cent of the voting rights to 45 per cent in an exchange of some of
its low-voting B-shares for some of the government's high-voting A-shares.
The government stake will be reduced to 40.4 per cent and Volvo will pay
cash for any difference in the value of the shares exchanged.
The Swedish government is then committed to selling its remaining stake in
Procordia 'as soon as possible' in a broadly based Swedish and international
offering.
Volvo will have first right of refusal, if the government reaches agreement
with any large single investor or with a group of investors acting in
concert for the sale of a stake of 5 per cent or more.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: A spring in the step of fiscal debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late spring is the season when finance ministers stray from home.
Last week, they came from all over the globe for the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington. Next weekend, European Community
finance ministers converge on Oporto, Portugal, for one of their
twice-yearly informal gatherings. On May 18 and 19, the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will host
finance, trade and foreign ministers from its 24 industrialised member
nations at its annual ministerial meeting.
One short-term purpose of this peripatetic hob-nobbing is to prepare the
annual economic summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised
countries - to be held in Munich in early July. The more important
longer-term goal is to help frame and co-ordinate economic policies in the
G7 (the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada) over the
coming decade.
The G7 process of cajoling and consensus-building is far from perfect. But
it can probably take the credit for preserving the world from extreme
protectionism over the past two decades of monetary and economic turbulence.
Although much can still go wrong, the leadership and assistance provided by
the G7 countries probably constitute the best hope of integrating Russia and
other former communist countries into the world economy.
But, while the problems and challenges posed by the collapse of communism
have grown, so have the difficulties of economic management among the G7 and
in the other industrialised countries. Although hopes have risen over the
past month of economic recovery in the US, Germany, Britain and Canada, the
world economy is still too fragile to be left on auto-pilot.
The Munich summit should, therefore, be an important event, and not just for
the G7. The influence group members exercise on other countries is large and
growing.
The danger is that, for the second year running, a man from Moscow will
steal the show. Last year's London summit was upstaged by the arrival of Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, then president of the Soviet Union, for talks on the
final day with the summit seven. This year, Russian president Mr Boris
Yeltsin is expected to join the G7 leaders after their main discussions.
That should be just after the planned July 1 adoption of a unified rouble
exchange rate which could spell high drama in the Russian economy.
By contrast, Germany, this year's summit host, wants the G7 leaders to
discuss a two-part growth strategy for the western industrialised countries
in Munich.
Details of the proposed strategy are sketchy so far. But according to Mr
Horst Kohler, a state secretary in the German Finance Ministry and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief international economic negotiator, the G7
should tackle short-term worries about growth with confidence-building
measures, and focus more on structural problems in the world economy to help
increase its long-term growth potential. Serious structural problems
include:
The relationship of savings, investment and interest rates. To secure
growth, it will be necessary to increase savings and depress inflationary
expectations. Only then will finance be forthcoming for investment needs of
the industrial countries, Russia, eastern Europe and the developing world at
affordable real interest rates.
The weaknesses of education and training systems, especially in the US and
Britain.
Entrenched industrial subsidies and labour market rigidities, preventing a
better allocation of world resources.
The fact that these last two problems are prevalent in Germany shows the
talks in Munich will have to be frank to achieve anything.
High budget deficits will also be a theme. They have been recognised as a
serious impediment to growth for at least a decade. But the budgetary ill
health of all G7 countries, except Japan and possibly France, illustrates
how actions have fallen short of generally accepted policy prescriptions.
However, if last week's meeting of G7 finance ministers in Washington is any
guide, the big industrial countries may return to fiscal rectitude. They are
gradually abandoning their recent flirtation with expansionary fiscal
policies as an antidote to recession.
Only Japan was urged to spend more on public works to boost its economy.
This probably reflected frustration by other countries about Japan's rising
trade surpluses at a time of slowing domestic growth rather than a long-term
assessment of what might be best for the global economy.
Significantly, it was Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer,
who led the questioning of Germany's high public-sector deficit. He also
warned of a tough round of public expenditure negotiations in the UK between
now and the Autumn.
The G7 discussions also highlighted how difficult it is for ministers to
speak the same language when striving for consensus. The size of Germany's
public-sector deficit was disputed between the UK and US, on one side, and
Germany on the other.
The UK and US claim the deficit amounts to around 6 per cent of gross
domestic product when all elements of the public sector are taken into
account. If true, that would give Germany the EC's second biggest annual
deficit after Italy. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, cited IMF
figures that put the deficit at about 3.5 per cent of GDP. Even if all
off-balance sheet items were included, the deficit would not exceed 5 per
cent of GDP, he said.
G7 fiscal policy is bound to be a key issue of debate at Munich and in the
years ahead. The least the seven finance ministers should do now would be to
instruct their officials to work out a harmonised method of calculating
deficits so fiscal debate does not turn into unnecessary dispute.

FT  05 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In many ways the proposals put forward by Sir Kenneth Clucas for changing
the regulation of UK retail financial services look sensible. Sir Kenneth's
central idea - merging the life insurance and unit trust overseer Lautro
with Fimbra, the financially strapped body which looks after independent
intermediaries - should introduce badly needed stability into the system.
The self-regulating organisation (SRO) which emerges will at least be
viable, and may even serve to slow down the regrettable contraction of
independent financial advice.
Externally imposed structures, though, inevitably fail to satisfy all those
they are intended to please. Imro, for example, another SRO which looks
after investment managers, clearly remains unconvinced by the Clucas
argument that regulators should be distinguished from each other by the sort
of clients which their members serve. Imro thus looks certain to keep
pleading the cause of regulation according to the function of company
concerned.
Given that Imro stands to lose 30 per cent of its members, it will doubtless
be accused of special pleading. But a large number of its members, notably
in Scotland, evidently share the concern. Not unreasonably, the likes of
fund manager Baillie Gifford wonder why they should have to report to the
new SRO on the marketing and administration of unit trusts when this part of
their overall business is tiny.

FT  05 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: General Motors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the appetite of US investors for equity issues, it would seem
nothing could go wrong with the planned Dollars 2.3bn offering from General
Motors. The company has carefully prepared the ground, first by announcing a
far-ranging restructuring plan and then first-quarter net income of Dollars
179m instead of a widely expected loss. The restructuring seems in earnest,
involving a move towards buying in components and rationalisation of the
North American model range and plants. So GM's share price may be able to
make up some ground on Ford.
Still there are grounds for scepticism. GM will probably face fierce
opposition to restructuring from the United Auto Workers union. And though
its own shares are not necessarily that expensive in terms of longer term
earnings potential, the offering looks set to come in a market where even
cyclical stocks are discounting robust recovery this year.
Given the lack of international appeal, most of the issue may have to be
placed in the US. But US investors, for different reasons, are also expected
to take the lion's share of the Wellcome offering. At some stage they may
rebel against such a heavy burden. International investors might reflect in
their turn that Japanese industrial equities look cheap on fundamental
grounds and the yen is weak. Toyota could put up a fight with GM in the
equity market as well as the forecourt.

FT  05 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Oil shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's revival in oil shares - even unfashionable BP gained 10 per cent
 -raises the question of whether the sector has been too long out of favour.
There are two main arguments, both based on the view that oil companies'
problems have been largely caused by recession. The first is that resumed
growth in some western economies augurs well for the price of crude. The
second is that the sector is closer to the turning point in the cycle for
its downstream operations, notably petrochemicals.
Both arguments have holes. While the fundamentals for oil prices have
improved slightly in recent weeks, demand is scarcely roaring ahead. There
is also huge uncertainty on the supply side, not least from Opec and the
CIS. As for the downstream cycle, demand for petrochemicals is growing in
the US but remains depressingly weak elsewhere. In any case, the cyclical
rebound in profits may be held back by a degree of overcapacity.
In marking oil shares higher, the market may simply have calculated that
they must be cheap because they had fallen so far. But in recent months the
sector has fragmented, with Shell and Enterprise rated as quality companies
and the likes of BP and Lasmo reflecting the fact that their dividends are
vulnerable. The market has been rational about the companies. It is perhaps
in danger of being less realistic about the sector.

FT  05 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The shadow of the Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For those of an apocalyptic turn of mind, events in Germany have raised the
spectre of disarray in the ERM or even its collapse. Twenty years ago, after
all, it was the misbehaviour of the dollar which caused the demise of the
Bretton Woods system. But there is an important difference. Then it was US
inflation - generally ascribed to the deficit financing of the Vietnam war -
which alienated the system's other members. Now, although unification has
certainly landed Germany with an inflationary problem, the difficulty is
rather the severity of the measures it is taking to deal with it. At the
start of the 1970s, cutting loose from the dollar was a sign of monetary
rectitude. Abandoning the D-Mark now would be the reverse.
The more subtle question is whether the D-Mark might relinquish its central
role to another member currency. Germany's economic dominance in the system
should not be exaggerated. United Germany accounts for perhaps 27 per cent
of the combined GDP of the ERM members, compared with 20 per cent for France
and 17 per cent for the UK. The question is which currency would be a
plausible substitute. The French franc would be little help, since France
seems independently bent on matching Germany's monetary stringency. And
however attractive sterling now seems under a re-elected Tory government,
its chief appeal lies in that government's commitment to hanging on to the
Bundesbank's coat-tails.
This is not to deny that the ERM has a genuine problem. Germany does not
even know how fast its money supply is really growing, let alone whether its
target rate of growth is appropriate. The result is that the united Europe
of 1992 has to grapple with an inflationary demon which for many of its
members no longer exists, while the US and Japan are able to use monetary
stimulus to improve their competitive positions in the world. But there
seems little alternative to Germany's partners hanging on, while taking such
comfort as they can from the fact that German dominance of the system allows
them to copy its loose fiscal policy as well.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Britain's new director of public prosecutions, Mrs Barbara Mills, tells
us that low ethical standards in business will not generate long-term
business advantage ('DPP chief suggests safeguards for companies', April
29). Mrs Mills is seeking to promote ethical behaviour through the fear of
commercial retribution - much as Mr John Patten, the education secretary,
recently offered the super-commercial consideration of divine retribution
for bad social behaviour.
This line of thinking tends to confuse the ethical with the self-interested.
If a manufacturer refrains from selling elite torture equipment because he
thinks his main conventional business would suffer, he is acting from
self-interest. If the manufacturer avoids the torture business because he
thinks it is wrong to harm people, then he is acting according to ethical
principle.
Grounding ethics in nothing but (long-term) self-interest would mean that,
if profitability conditions changed, our manufacturer would be right to
switch to torture equipment.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Too gloomy a picture of air travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Doganis paints a gloomy picture of the likely results of air
transport liberalisation within the Community (Personal view: 'No freedom in
the skies', April 29) but it is in our view far from complete.
He sets out first the supposed expectations of the protagonists of
liberalisation and compares them with what he perceives to be the reality
post-1992. This is a false comparison.
For all but the last few years, governments have controlled the European air
transport market through a series of inflexible bilateral arrangements,
limiting the routes to be flown, nominating the carriers to operate them,
fixing the capacity to be offered and the fares to be charged. The last
interest to be considered was that of the customer.
Henceforth, all this will be taken out of governments' hands. It may be that
not all airlines will want to take advantage of their new found freedom to
compete - and, incidentally, we share Professor Doganis's fears that there
may be fewer of them to do so - but they will at least be free to do so if
they wish. And as experience quickly showed on the London-Amsterdam route,
following the pioneering negotiation of a liberal air services agreement
between Britain and the Netherlands, the presence of only one extra carrier
on a route does produce very real benefits for the consumer as well as
stimulating a growth in traffic.
Moreover, Prof Doganis ignores the stimulus which liberalisation has already
provided for new services to the Continent from regional airports. For
instance, in 1985 Belfast had only one such route, to Amsterdam, whereas
this summer there are now in addition direct daily flights to Paris,
Stuttgart and Milan. This would have been unthinkable only five years ago.
Faced with a choice between the old regime and the new, the user can only
vote one way. This is why we have consistently supported the UK government,
and will continue to do so, in its now largely successful attempts to
transform the regulatory framework for the Community air transport industry.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER LUFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Jacques Calvet's Personal View, 'The New Utopias that threaten Europe'
(April 29), looks very much like special pleading obfuscated by broad and
unsubstantiated generalisations. Remove the attacks on federalism,
competition-policy and the criteria agreed for economic convergence
curiously defined as a monetarist utopia - and what is left seems to be a
desire to see old-fashioned national subsidies replaced by European ones. At
a time when agricultural subsidies are stalling the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade talks and threatening world trade, this would be a
confirmation of all the worst fears of those who always suspected the
creation of a Fortress Europe.
Particularly odd is the attack on federalism. Apart from raising again the
old canard about the failure of some self- styled quasi-federal governments
such as in the old Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and elsewhere, while
conveniently ignoring the fact that they were the result of totalitarian or
external imposition and not democratic choice, Mr Calvet offers no coherent
alternative.
It may also surprise British readers that Mr Calvet links federalism with
liberalism as Mrs Thatcher has repeatedly attacked it for being associated
with socialism. It is, of course, not necessarily associated with either. In
the European context 'federal' is essentially shorthand for 'democratic'.
There is simply no alternative to a federal Europe if the Community's
institutions are to be open, accountable and subject to democratic control.
Open debates in the European Parliament must replace decision-making behind
closed doors between ministers and civil servants. Or does Mr Calvet prefer
a more closed system with the ear of government accessible only to the
special pleading of Europe's corporate giants?

checked with the search company which the bank used) had nothing on file to
classify me as a bad risk. The bank refused my application and wrote saying
that it was under no obligation to tell me why the application was refused.
In subsequent correspondence, the bank did not deny that the reason was that
I was already a customer with a Visa card and that the offer was designed to
attract new customers. It appears from correspondence elsewhere that
thousands of customers found themselves in the same position.
Is this ethical behaviour of which the bank would be proud? I have
subsequently changed banks as a result of this experience. When will service
companies learn that their actions can lose them customers for life and that
no amount of window dressing or ethical charters can make up for a genuine
commitment to their customers?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Ashby's letter (April 29) draws attention to the unsatisfactory
arrangements for training and enterprise councils. These were yet another
set of the quangos in which British governments delight, since they provide
high cosmetic value at low cost. The fact that they are usually ineffective
doesn't matter, since this is easy to hide.
Tecs should not be given public law status, but rather be merged with
chambers of industry and commerce, which should. The government should then
have a serious discussion with the chambers about standards. Finally, the
British Overseas Trade Board could then be closed down and all its resources
given to the chambers.
We could have got all this right first time if Conservative ministers really
had any idea about helping a market economy to work, but better late than
never.

EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER REID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your reporting of the working time debate at the Social Affairs Council
('Social Europe', April 30) focused on the 48-hour maximum working week and
the designation in principle of Sunday as the day of rest. It should be
remembered that these aspects of the draft directive were proposed, by
France and Germany respectively, some considerable time after the proposals
were originally published by the Commission. Employers throughout the EC
have unanimously condemned them since their original publication.
In the increasing debate that will take place between now and the next
Social Affairs Council meeting on June 24 we should not lose sight of the
principle that pay and conditions of work, including the organisation of
working time, should be matters to be determined between an employee and an
employer and should not be dictated at EC level. The only tolerable
intervention that is acceptable is on objective health and safety grounds,
as Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, proposed. If it is
endangering the health and safety of engineering technicians to work more
than 8 hours per night or more than 48 hours per week, so is it unacceptable
for hospital workers or President Delors. The latter two, of course, will
not be covered by this directive. So much for objectivity.

FT  05 MAY 92 / All at sea in Europe: Why the EC ship of state is drifting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row is brewing inside the European Community over new institutional
reform, which Brussels intends as a solution to future problems but which
could end up merely complicating present ones.
After the stormy waters of negotiations on its Maastricht treaty on
political and monetary union, the Community ship of (super)state now lies
becalmed. But on board all is far from calm. Some of the passengers (member
states) and much of the crew (the European Commission) are growing restive.
A queasy period in the doldrums was inevitable this year, as the Maastricht
treaty waits for the ratification that it must get from each and every EC
parliament. But the Community is also stalled on its 'normal business'.
It has made little or no progress so far in reaching a Gatt trade deal with
the US, in carrying out its internal farm reform, or in agreeing future EC
funding up to 1997. The EC executive itself is starting to rattle apart as
its four-year term draws to an end this December, with commissioners openly
sniping at each other over industrial policy. And on Yugoslavia, where the
world is looking to the Community for a political lead, the Twelve seem no
more in tune than they were before Maastricht.
In these circumstances, it is only natural that the Commission should be
dreaming of becoming a more powerful executive which could shake member
states out of their inaction. Strictly speaking, the new institutional
changes being bandied about in Brussels have nothing to do with the current
malaise. They are part of the report on enlargement which the Commission has
been asked to submit to the Lisbon summit in June.
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said at the weekend that
'profound changes would be needed to improve the efficiency and democratic
accountability of a Community of 25-30 members', and that it would be
'dishonest not to face up to this'. He wants to change the Commission into a
more political executive whose head might be elected by the European
Parliament, perhaps from candidates nominated from the European Council (as
EC summits are known). It would also be directly accountable to EC leaders.
Such an executive, mooted in the early 1950s, would effectively eclipse, but
not formally replace, the current EC Council presidency that rotates every
six months between governments. The latter might wear the ceremonial ermine,
but no longer steer the substance, of the Community.
Mr Delors prides himself on thinking big and far. These are long-term ideas
to cope with at least two waves of enlargement - from the European Free
Trade Association (Efta) and, later, from central Europe. But they are
fuelled also by shorter-term frustrations, chiefly over the chairing - and
obstruction  - of Community foreign policy by small countries.
The Portuguese presidency is seen as out of its depth. Conscious of its
weakness, it farms out reports to others - to Spain a study on the Maghreb,
to Britain a study on relations with Turkey, to the Dutch a study on new
membership of the Council of Europe. Each such individual act of delegation
may make sense, but taken together they reinforce the impression of a
rudderless Community. In the Yugoslavia crisis, Brussels also blames
Portugal for not taking a tougher line with Greece which refuses to follow
its EC partners and recognise Macedonia.
The present system of 'chain-gang diplomacy' means that when one country
tugs - Germany over recognising Croatia and Slovenia, Greece in its stance
towards Macedonia - the other 11 have to follow for the sake of consensus.
The difference is that Greece is over-playing an extraordinarily weak hand.
Athens is not only in clear breach of the terms of last year's loan from the
EC, but also blocking any rapprochement with Turkey and a big financial
package for eight Mediterranean countries. It is hardly Portugal's fault
that under the present system there is little to stop Greece being an
Achilles heel. But, at last weekend's meeting in Guimaraes of foreign
ministers, Portugal was criticised for producing a report on developing the
Maastricht provisions for 'a common foreign and security policy' that was
just a platitudinous re-hash of treaty language.
Next to take over the presidency, on July 1, is Britain. It can be counted
on a) to oppose any idea that a still-stronger EC executive is needed to
manage a more numerous Community, and b) to run a thoroughly businesslike
presidency to show that the current system can produce results. 'There is no
such thing as a perfect institution, but you can have a workmanlike one',
said a British official at Guimaraes.
But this will not stop the coming clash. The certainty of enlargement was
reinforced on Saturday when - ironically, in the 'Arab Room' of the Oporto
stock exchange - the EC-Efta treaty to create the European Economic Area was
signed. Afterwards, Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, Iceland's foreign minister
and current president of Efta, jested that 'the EC will break up in the next
century' if it was not careful with enlargement. Mr Delors wants to ensure
that remains a joke.

The only line in any of Shakespeare's plays which, in my experience, causes
spontaneous applause every time it is delivered occurs in 'Henry IV Part 2',
Act 4 Scene II: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers'. My
guess is that audiences have clapped this every time the play has been
performed since 1597. Could it be something to do with the way that human
misfortune so often seems to result in fat fees for lawyers? First Tuesday

Earlier BBC2 begins a six-part documentary series on The Racing Game just as
English racing seems to be going down the drain - or rather, overseas.
Trainers, by all accounts, are leaving because there is no longer as much
money here as in the US or France. During the last flat season the producers
based themselves in the stable yard of Newmarket trainer Luca Cumani. From
there they follow the fortunes of owners, stable lads and punters (9.20).
BBC1 continues with its spin-off from 'Crimewatch', Crime Limited in which

FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Ornette Coleman &amp; Prime Time - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever else you have heard about the harmolodic theory of jazz - the
mention of it can still bring jazz buffs to blows - Ornette Coleman's
agitato ensemble playing leaves an indelible mark on the musical memory. His
technique, pioneered in the 1950s, has influenced musicians ever since. The
term he invented for group improvisation, where each musician is in a
different key, stands for harmony, movement and melody. All instruments play
an equal but leading role and each works independently: but towards the same
colourful end.
The Prime Time band which has executed this theory since 1975 has
traditionally employed a double (electric) rhythm section to beat the
message home. On this tour, the band featured a keyboard player (David
Bryant) and tablas (Badal Roy) in addition to electric bass (Al McDowell),
two guitars (Kenny Wessel and Chris Rosenberg) and son Denardo Coleman on
drums. The resulting new sound is no less challenging - the alternate
meshing and colliding of instruments is still there - but with more spaces
between. The movement (much of it provided by Denardo's demonic drumming) is
as energetic but more approaches are made to melody and harmony than
hitherto.
The guitars and piano are often used to introduce a piece, working at a
melody until Ornette appears on alto or tenor sax to chase it away with a
wonderful blizzard of notes. In one number - there are no introductions -
Chris Rosenberg picked out what sounded like Bach's cello Suite No. 1 for
several minutes until Denardo came hammering across him with an industrial
samba, Ornette hard on his heels with an almost straight calypso solo.
While the keyboards provide an extra melodic dimension, the clack and bong
percussion of Badal Roy's tablas add excitement and colour to the new group.
The guitarists twitch and also play a kind of funk with the wah wah; the
bass rumbles menacingly in McDowell's hands (and ultimately in Denardo's
when the two swap jobs). Scribbling serenely among this controlled anarchy
on saxophones or trumpet, resplendent in a suit apparently made from cooking
foil, which dazzles under the spotlight, is Ornette.
Thirty years after he dropped harmolodics on to an unsuspecting New York
scene, the sight and sound of Ornette Coleman with the alto is still
contemporary, modern and artistic. His most recent work is on the soundtrack
for Cronenberg's Naked Lunch (Milan/BMG), recorded with the London Symphony
Orchestra 'without order, sequence, key or strict tempo'. Seated and sawing
frenziedly at the electric violin in front of Prime Time he remains fresh,
vital and often baffling.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: The Boy's Own Story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liverpool FC manager Bill Shankly put football into perspective: 'Some
people think football is a matter of life and death. I can assure them it is
much more serious.' That truth underpins The Boy's Own Story by Peter
Flannery at the Chelsea Centre Theatre. It makes an extraordinary one-man
goal-mouth show acted by Guy Masterson; at the end of the 90 minutes, the
lad done great.
Flannery's play tells of John McKenna, 'the best keeper never to play for
England', who now plays for Sunday-league Stratton; at 32, he is washed up
and fit for nothing but more of the game he now hates. His past includes a
deprived foster-childhood and a successful first division career. The play
follows the Tom Stoppard tactic of watching from the margins. As Rosencrantz
is to Hamlet, so is the goalkeeper to football: conspicuous by absence.
Football is a zero sum game, but especially for goalkeepers. '0-0 is the
worst result for the other players. They've failed, you've succeeded.' But
who remembers - Gordon Banks' spectacular save from Pele in the Mexico 1970
world semi excepted - a great save? The Boy's Own Story knows that all
goalkeeping amounts to is the pleasure of denying others.
Guy Masterson's fine, energetic performance combines all-stage dynamism with
emotional control and clever parody. He hurls himself round the set and
flings himself into impressions of football commentators. He manages to
imply much more than he says, to insinuate intelligence. Richard Digby and
Tony Yates direct, and could benefit from more sound effects to match the
clever lighting.
Beneath the deliberate cliches of Flannery's play lurks this disturbing
banality: football, game of two halves to the cognoscenti and game of two
syllables to the condescenti, is never just a game. Until the result, normal
life stops; players are then licensed to be sick as parrots or over the
moon: 'All that is expected of us is that we never lose.' The Boy's Own
Story knows that these pressures affect the non-sporting life more than one
might care to think.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Art of women reappraised - A pioneering exhibition in
Norwich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEANNA PETHERBRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Popular histories of 20th century art have been projected as a series of
dramatic moments and movements. The moments are signalled by momentous works
 -Picasso's 'Demoiselles d'Avignon' for example  - the movements are those
of Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction(ism), Post-Modernism. What is generally
overlooked is that the 'isms' of modernism have been 'hisms', and that star
artists and popular icons are only the tip of a cultural iceberg.
Ten Decades, a pioneering exhibition at the Norwich Gallery, examines the
careers of 10 British women artists who participated very fully in the art
of their times - a span of most of this century.
It is possible to hype the contributions of some of the included artists -
Eileen Agar, the flamboyant and successful Surrealist; Gertrude Hermes, the
print-maker and sculptor who shaped graphic conventions in the 1930s;
Barbara Hepworth with a guaranteed seat in sculptors' Parnassus. But the aim
of the exhibition, curated by Dr Katy Deepwell, is precisely to question
this sort of myth-making. By presenting work once at the forefront of
avant-garde practice within the context of an individual artistic
development and professional career, we are encouraged to examine the
criteria which have shaped art history and cultural institutions, and
question why many of these women artists have been marginalised.
The 10 artists belong to a 'birth cohort': all were born between 1897 and
1906. They have little else in common, being from widely varying backgrounds
and having pursued very different careers except in their professional
commitment to practising as painters, sculptors, print-makers, muralists and
their identification with the different art movements of their times. What
pulls the exhibition together, as a visual presentation as well as a
coherent argument, is the way in which each group of works is hung next to
text panels of the artist's biography. Apart from being extremely
informative, this is also a strategy to subvert the usual pop-histories of
art, which focus on headline events rather than artistic development.
The exhibition has been restricted to three works by each of the 10 artists,
irrespective of their standing. The works come from different periods in the
artists' lives in order to indicate change and development - again a
strategy not often allowed in monocular historical survey exhibitions, where
works are carefully selected to present a coherent picture. Ten Decades is
one of those rare exhibitions where the intentions of the curator are made
explicit through the presentation, and one does not have to mull through an
immense catalogue to try and tease them out. Katy Deepwell knows her
material so thoroughly and is so politically astute that question and
strategy are identified.
Nevertheless, three works are not sufficient to inform one about unfamiliar
artists and if the venue had allowed, this could happily have been a much
larger exhibition. The works, chosen from private collections, are not
necessarily key works, and selection could have been tighter. However there
are some wonderful inclusions: Sylvia Melland's 'Girder' etching of 1964 is
one of her most successful prints, dramatic and vibrant. Although there is
nothing referential of Japan in the work, the confident handling of the
semi-abstract girder forms, and the lively texture of the sugar-lift, remind
one of Hokusai's nice balance between stylised elegance of form and
toughness of organisation.
Nan Youngman's 'Steel Works, Ebbw Vale' of 1953 is one of the finest works
on the exhibition, both distanced and moving. The little figures in the
painting, overwhelmed by the industrial landscape, are ciphers and not the
stylised mannequins of Lowry, whom, at a brief glance they seem to invoke.
Where Lowry reduces urban and industrial decay to faux-nave games,
Youngman's technical control allows her to imbue the scene with dignity and
melancholy. A much later work, 'Path to the Sea' of 1976, exhibits the same
combination of awesome technique and evocation of mood; here the simple
composition and pale palette is handled with great delicacy and restraint,
Lilian Holt is also very well represented with a glowing, pulsating painting
of broad and paint-loaded strokes evoking 'City Construction, Night'.
Urbanism has been central to the modernist project of the 20th century, so
it is not surprising that many of the women on this exhibition have used the
city as their subject matter. There is also a very fine charcoal drawing of
David Bomberg from 1928 - to my mind a more searching, competent drawing
than Bomberg himself ever produced - which raises questions about the
relationship between men and women artists. It is well documented that
Lilian Holt's commitment to her partner David Bomberg and her family took
precedence over her career as an artist. Part of the problem, as Dr Deepwell
points out in the catalogue, is not so much that 20th century women artists
have been excluded from an established profession as the fact that 'Being an
artist is frequently seen as being, and popularly mythologised as, more of a
vocation than a profession.' We all know that one can assume multiple roles
as well as participating in a profession; but vocations are decreed by a
patriarchal world to be singular and indivisible.
The customs of the art world are in many ways as mysterious and fixed as the
rules of Trobriand Island Cricket. Deepwell deconstructs an awful lot of
them in this subtle little exhibition. Whereas the art world judges artistic
success by the venues and frequency of exhibitions, Deepwell investigates
the other, equally significant ways, in which her 10 artists have engaged in
20th century art - through teaching; through participating in the war effort
(although only Evelyn Gibbs was 'officially' commissioned by the War
Artists' Advisory Committee which favoured male artists); through organising
artists groups and historically-significant campaigns.
Ten Decades is not a competitive or a combative exhibition, polarising the
activities of male and female artists, nor does it bemoan the historical
lack of opportunities for women and present them as victims. Instead it
poses interesting questions through its intelligent presentation of a
rarely-seen body of work.

<TEXT>
ARCADIAN INTERNATIONAL has concluded all the financing arrangements
necessary for the development of the Hotel Grande Ferme at Gressy-en-France
near Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris.
The development comprises a 92-room four star hotel in the style of the
18th-century pressoir which, until recently, stood upon the site and will
contain conference, seminar and leisure facilities.
The total project cost will be about FFr105m (Pounds 10.59m) and will be
financed by a combination of equity, long-term debt and leasing.
Arcadian has signed an agreement with W Finance, a subsidiary of Athena and
part of the Worms et Cie Group for the provision of the required equity for
the project of FF40m. W Finance will take 62 per cent and Arcadian will take
38 per cent. Agreement has also been reached with COPARC, an insurance
subsidiary within the Worms et Cie Group for the provision of the required
long-term debt.
The demolition to enable construction to begin was started on February 20
and the construction phase starts this month. The hotel, which is due to
open in September 1993, will be built north-east of Paris between Charles de
Gaulle Airport and Euro Disney.

Peter Stafford is returning to London from his native Manchester to become

months. He replaces Michael Blackburn, who is retiring after 38 years with
the firm.
Stafford will co-ordinate the work of the firm's 16-strong policy-making
board. He will also be involved in raising Touche's public profile, and has
already stirred the pot by echoing the firm's views that regulation of
auditing should be wrested from the professional accountancy bodies and
given to an independent organisation.
As managing partner at Spicer &amp; Oppenheim in the late 1980s, he negotiated
the firm's merger with Touche in 1990, before heading back to Manchester as
a senior partner in the local Touche office, to specialise in audit and
investigations work.
'I have lived a double life between Manchester and London for many years,'
he says. He is likely to continue commuting between the capital and his home
in Cheshire, but while in office he will probably have to put on ice working
on one of his more consuming hobbies: restoring an antique launch he bought
some years ago, and is hoping to convert from petrol to steam engine.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spotting who is on the fast track at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation needs the same sort of skills as a sinologist these days. Unlike
most modern financial institutions Honkers and Shankers does not reveal the
ages of its executive team, let alone their first names, in its annual
report. So it is impossible to get a feel for who is over the hill, on the
way up, and what to call them if one ever bumps into them at a cocktail
party.
Now that it has even stopped publishing the names and responsibilities of
its general managers in its annual report, it is well nigh impossible for a
passing headhunter to spot likely talent lurking just below the boardroom
table.
Occasionally students of form get a lucky break. The Midland offer document,
for example, broke with tradition and let it be known that Messrs J E
Strickland and F J French are both called John. They sound like they could
be important but the bank is hazy about their ages, so it is hard to tell
whether they are about to be put out to grass or are chairman material.
K R Whitson, 49, is another name to conjure with. Having joined the bank in
1961, he first came to prominence in the City when he was made chief
executive of the group's UK business in November 1987. In 1990 he was posted
to the US to be executive director of the group's troubled Marine Midland
operation and now he is handing over his Marine hat to Canadian Jim Cleave.
Does this mean that Whitson is being promoted? The bank is as inscrutable as
ever. All it will say is that Whitson's next appointment will be announced
in 'due course'. Since he has done his statutory 30 years he could retire if
he wanted to, but then that applies to most of the top executives.
The next main board appointments will be worth watching since they could
give a clue as to who will take over from chairman Willie Purves, 60, who is
already long past the chairman's normal retirement age.
If Whitson is leapfrogged by T W O'Brien, 44, then it is a sure sign that
the current chief executive of the group's UK operations is a man to watch.

stage of Glasgow airport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airport operator BAA is to award the contract for the next stage of
development at Glasgow airport to BALFOUR BEATTY.
The Pounds 37m contract is for the design, management and subsequent
construction of new international facilities at the airport.
This forms the next stage of an overall development that is expected to cost
around Pounds 60m and will be built in phases to match passenger demand. The
development will include a new international pier to accommodate up to eight
wide-bodied aircraft, new taxiways and aircraft aprons and an extension to
the west end of the existing terminal building to give better services for
international passengers.
Detailed design of the project will commence immediately and construction is
expected to start in the spring of 1993 with completion two years later.
The new development will be the second stage in extending and improving
facilities at the airport, which has seen a big rise in its international
traffic following the government's announcement of an 'open skies' policy
for Scotland in March 1990.
The new facility will improve the airport's capacity from the current 5.5m
to 10m passengers a year.
Last year over 4m passengers passed through the airport.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mark Summers, previously chairman of Hill Samuel Private Client Management,
has moved to James Capel, responsible for business development within the
investment management division.
'TSB (Hill Samuel's parent) had been taking quite a tight grip on us and one
of the things they decided to do was to put the private client investment
management operation into a newly created Knightsbridge private bank.' He
disagreed with the strategy, and was anyway invited to take early
retirement, after 31 years at Hill Samuel.
Summers, 53, says that 'with children to educate and so on, I was looking
for a house that could utilise my experience and it seemed that James Capel
possessed very much the same ethos as we had'.
His task is to increase public and professional awareness of James Capel's
private client investment operation where funds under management have
increased from Pounds 300m six years ago to Pounds 2bn today.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC STRUCTURAL CONCRETE (TSC), part of Tarmac's building materials
division, is already working on a Pounds 4.2m order to manufacture thousands
of reinforced precast concrete units forming walkways in the Channel Tunnel.
When completed it will provide four walkways - being fitted both sides of
the twin-bored rail tunnels - just over halfway to France.
The company has now won a Pounds 3.2m order to continue the four walkways
all the way to the French terminal.
In total TSC is manufacturing 84,000 units, 46,000 for the first contract
and 38,000 for the second - each about two-and-a-half metres long and
weighing about one tonne.
Half of them, for one side of each tunnel, incorporate service ducts and
include manufacturing 126,000 slabs to cover the ducting.
Work on the second contract has justed started, for completion at the
beginning of next year.
This will involve producing and delivering over 1,000 units a week and they
will be manufactured both at Henlade and its sister plant at Lound,
Nottinghamshire.
Tarmac Construction's newly-launched European division is celebrating the
start of its first building project on mainland Europe.
The division, which was launched at the beginning of the year, is
construction manager for a FFr30m (Pounds 3.02m) leisure complex in Picardy.
L'Espace Culturel et Sportif is a multi-use building being developed in the
centre of the town of Albert in the heart of the Somme.
The centre comprises a 600-seat theatre, gymnasium, offices/meeting rooms,
covered garden and support facilities.

The Association of British Factors &amp; Discounters reported a 12 per cent
increase in the volume of client companies' turnover in the first quarter of
1992 compared with the same period of last year.
The turnover of association members rose to Pounds 3.75bn from Pounds 3.34bn
reflecting both an increase in the number of companies using the services of
members and growth in the turnover of existing clients.
The association, whose members provide cash to their clients against
invoices, said the increase was a sign that small and medium-sized
businesses were starting to recover from the recession.

When it launched the new fund, which will back buy-outs and buy-ins valued

A tough fund-raising climate has prevented several recent funds from

Fed up with paying auditors' fees? One answer could be to register your
business as a US limited liability company, according to Robert Coleman of
International Corporate Compliance.*
Registration under company legislation in the state of Wyoming does not
involve a company paying US taxes, provided it has no US shareholders and
does not do business in the US, but it does avoid the need for a UK (and a
US) audit.
Companies must still file accounts with Companies' House and a bank can
still register a charge against the business so US registration is not a way
to escape the scrutiny of UK creditors. Nor is it a tax fiddle, says
Coleman. International Corporate Compliance, itself a US limited liability
company, is run by Coleman and David Sinclair, both accountants.
It has had about 25 clients, including companies in the fields of financial
services, property development and engineering, seeking US registration
since launching its service at the end of last year.
Basic registration and one year's charges cost Pounds 390 plus VAT.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Payments code wins prompt
response - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 400 companies have signed up for the prompt payment code launched by
the Confederation of British Industry two months ago. Firms which pledge
support for the code agree to set the terms of payment at the outset of a
deal and to stick to them.
They also promise to provide suppliers with clear guidance on payment
procedures and inform them of any disputes immediately. A total of 380
companies have pledged their support including Anglian Water, BAT
Industries, Cadbury Schweppes, Esso UK and Whitbread.
However, small business owners want the government to do more to tackle the
problem of late payments but many appear reluctant to do anything to improve
the position themselves.
Six out of 10 small businesses want the creation of a special government
office to deal with late payment claims while 56 per cent want a code of
payment practice which companies would have to adhere to, according to a
survey by Barclays Bank.
But many small businesses appear complacent with 46 per cent admitting to
doing nothing about the problem compared with 42 per cent which followed up
late payments promptly. Twenty-three per cent of the 500 businesses polled
said late payments had created severe cash flow problems.
In a separate survey by National Westminster Bank, 40 per cent of business
polled said they were not being paid on time compared with almost 50 per
cent of those surveyed in July 1991.

MR PADDY ASHDOWN, leader of the Liberal Democrats, will today announce a
limited reshuffle of his parliamentary team in which he will promote younger
MPs.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the 29-year-old MP for Truro, is to be given a new post
covering campaigning and communications after what was seen as a strong
performance, particularly on television, during the general election.
Also set for a change of role is Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty
and Skye and the party's 30-year-old president. He is to surrender his
health portfolio and support Sir David Steel, the foreign affairs spokesman,
on European topics.
A full post-mortem into the Liberal Democrats' election result will not be
held until after this week's council elections, the party said. In spite of
Mr Ashdown's widely praised general-election campaign, the party saw its
number of Commons seats drop to 20 compared with 22 won by the Liberal/SDP
Alliance in 1987. Its share of the vote fell from 23 per cent to 18 per
cent.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Australian interest rates set to decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S official short-term interest rates are expected to fall by one
percentage point to 6.5 per cent today, in spite of indications that
recovery from 18 months of recession is already under way.
Economists said strong growth in building approvals and a higher than
expected current account deficit in March were unlikely to dissuade the
Reserve Bank from announcing the cut at its monthly meeting.
Most thought the bank had little option in the face of pressure from the
federal Labor government and its allies in the Australian Council of Trade
Unions (ACTU).
Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said last week that the publication of
figures showing 1.7 per cent inflation in the year to March had removed any
obstacles which stood in the way of a reduction.
The unexpectedly low inflation outcome added to pressure for a cut of one
percentage point rather than the half point cut previously under
consideration.
Mr Bill Kelty, ACTU secretary and a member of the Reserve Bank board, argued
strongly in an interview published yesterday that the larger cut was needed
to ensure that the recovery gathered strength.
The authorities showed no concern about the March balance of payments
figures, which showed a seasonally adjusted deficit of ADollars 938m (Pounds
399m), compared to a revised ADollars 625m in February.
Mr Dawkins said the figures showed the full year deficit was likely to
undershoot the government's budget forecast of ADollars 14bn, compared to
ADollars 15.7bn last year.
He also pointed to a 2 per cent increase in exports as evidence of the
improved competitiveness of Australian manufacturers. However, merchandise
imports rose by 3 per cent, reducing the merchandise trade surplus by
ADollars 46m to ADollars 428m.
The government also announced yesterday that building approvals had risen by
6.9 per cent in March, the third increase in four months. The number of
approvals in force is now 24 per cent higher than in March 1991.

FT  05 MAY 92 / 'Religious war' threatens to erupt in Philippines poll: God
is fast becoming an important factor in the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIGION is fast becoming an important factor in the Philippine election
campaign with Cardinal Jaime Sin, influential leader of the Roman Catholic
archdiocese of Manila entering the political fray.
The cardinal sent out a pastoral letter on Easter Sunday urging his flock to
reject 'oppressors and plunderers' standing in next Monday's election.
Among the seven candidates for president are a number who were associated
with the autocratic government of Mr Ferdinand Marcos, deposed in a 1986
popular uprising, whom the cardinal had supported.
He followed his Easter call with sharper exhortations against voting for
certain candidates. Although he has not so far identified those he is
opposing by name, it is widely believed that the prelate has been referring
mainly to Mr Marcos's once-powerful widow, Imelda, and the business tycoon
Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, the best known of Mr Marcos's so-called cronies who
were granted vast privileges when he was in power.
The cardinal's more recent harangues have included the non-Roman Catholics
among the candidates: Mr Fidel Ramos, former defence secretary who is being
supported by President Corazon Aquino, and Mr Jovito Salonga, former Senate
president.
Cardinal Sin's plunge into the political arena was preceded by speculation
that the Iglesia ni Cristo, a home-grown Christian sect, was planning to
back the candidacy of Mr Cojuangco, support that was formally declared last
weekend by Bishop Erano Manalo, the INC supreme minister.
Some political analysts are wondering whether these events are not leading
to a 'religious war' at the polling centres. Also, the Catholic Bishops
Conference of the Philippines, has apparently not been united behind
Cardinal Sin's moves. A small number of bishops in the southern Philippines
has openly criticised his 'meddling' in politics.
About 85 per cent of the 62m Philippine population are Roman Catholics. The
INC, on the other hand, is estimated to have about 1m-1.5m voters, a number
which could be significant if the election is close.
Some of Cardinal Sin's critics have questioned his imposing moral guidelines
on his people while his church continues to receive donations raised from
the gambling casinos operated by the government. It is also a question
whether the influence the church is becoming used to wielding will not make
it difficult soon to contain its leaders to the pulpit.
Among the presidential candidates, Mr Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of
Representatives, has been the only one not affected by the cardinal's
tirades. Indeed, in an interview with a local newspaper last February
Cardinal Sin said his 'personal choice' was Mr Mitra, a man who epitomises
for many the traditional politicians, disparagingly called trapos (old
rags), who buy constituents' loyalty with measured largesse.
So what has Mr Ramos, the administration candidate, done to deserve the
treatment he has been receiving from Cardinal Sin? In the view of some, as
head of the now-defunct Philippine Constabulary, widely viewed as the most
unruly sector of the military during the Marcos regime, Mr Ramos is seen as
responsible for human rights violations, including against Catholic priests.
Catholic lay leaders say it was the Mitra party's firm stance against
artificial birth control that swayed the cardinal's support.
The INC, which staunchly supported the Marcos administration, , has also
been directly influencing government policies. Last July, for instance, it
threatened to hold a mammoth rally on Manila's streets if the Aquino
government did not reduce fuel prices. A compromise was worked out for the
government by Mr Mitra, and the INC dropped its plan after fuel prices were
reduced, but at rates much lower than those demanded by the sect.
Next week's election will be closely watched not only for the contest among
the seven candidates but among the interested religious leaders.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Big capital increase sought by Asia bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLE of the Asian Development Bank is likely to be scrutinised closely
by its shareholders in the industrialised world following the bank's request
for a large capital increase to support lending over the rest of the decade.
Bank officials say capital will need to be more than doubled to cope with
projected demand for loans. However, the developed countries which provide
the bulk of its capital backing are likely to question the bank's lending,
which is principally to public sector projects in a few countries.
Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, the bank's president, told its annual meeting in Hong
Kong yesterday that a capital increase was an 'urgent priority' and called
on member countries to agree on its size and timing before the end of the
year. Officials concede, though, that little real progress can be made
during a US election year as the US is the largest shareholder, jointly with
Japan, and allocation of new funds for international development
institutions is traditionally difficult to secure in Washington.
The bank has not needed a capital replenishment since 1983 as the rapid
economic growth of some members has led them to stop, or significantly
reduce, borrowing, and to speed repayments. As a result, its loan portfolio
is concentrated among a relatively small number of countries.
Indonesia alone accounts for Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 3.55bn), or 34 per cent
of ADB loans outstanding, and India, Pakistan and the Philippines a further
44 per cent between them. China has recently stepped up its borrowing and
accounts for 5 per cent.
Although rapid economic growth is expected to continue in Asia, ADB
officials forecast that demand for loans will grow at 12-15 per cent during
the rest of the decade, particularly to support urgent infrastructure
improvements. New financing demands will come from Vietnam when a US ban is
lifted, and from Cambodia and Mongolia.
This would necessitate a commitment of Dollars 25bn-Dollars 32bn by
shareholders to replenish capital, since total loans outstanding of Dollars
21bn are now approaching subscribed capital of Dollars 23bn and ADB lending
cannot exceed subscribed capital. The US and Japan have each subscribed 15
per cent of the bank's existing capital and each accounts for 12.3 per cent
of voting power.
Shareholders may seek a heightened commitment to promotion of private sector
development from the bank.
The bank's needs for capital to back concessional lending, received by a
larger number of the bank's poorer members, are not covered by the latest
request.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Clinton attains his finest hour: Democratic frontrunner sets
out his vision for the presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW ORLEANS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER or not Governor Bill Clinton's campaign for the presidency strikes
gold, he may reflect when it is over on the high and low water marks on the
long road to the White House or back to Arkansas.
If so, he would surely conclude that one of his finest oratorical hours took
place in New Orleans at the weekend. On Saturday, less than 72 hours after
Los Angeles had erupted in flames, he delivered a speech which defined as
well as any why he wanted to be president and of what sort of country he
wished to preside over.
'Of course I want to be president,' he said. 'But, more important than that,
I want you to think of what kind of citizen you want to be.'
The 'you' in this case were members of the Democratic Leadership Council,
who are very much Mr Clinton's sort of people - professionals, committed,
successful. Rev Jesse Jackson once unkindly called the DLC the 'Democratic
leisure club' and, judging by the number of its members toting golf clubs
off the charter flight last week, it was impossible to deny he had a point.
But it was also impossible to deny that Mr Clinton spoke with real feeling.
He did so without the benefit of a prepared text or teleprompter, relying
on, but not referring to, his hand-scrawled notes. While, after so much
campaigning, no speech can be said to be wholly spontaneous, the performance
served to remind how good a public speaker Mr Clinton can be.
The traditions of southern oratory are not lost on him.
He set out his stall early. 'Thomas Jefferson once said that the crisis of
slavery is a fire bell in the night. The crisis in Los Angeles is now our
fire bell in the night.'
His alarm was over race, fear and social division.
It was one thing for the nation to unite in response to a crisis, be it the
Gulf war, the assassination of a public figure, or Magic Johnson, the
basketball player, contracting the HIV virus. 'But when the crisis passes,
when we go back to the day-to-day ordinary living of life, I say we are not
a community.
'We should be afraid, my fellow Americans. But we must face our fears and
stop running from them.' And this could only begin with the recognition of
'the hard truth' that race was at the root of much of this.
'White Americans all too often fear that violence has only a black face.
They see it on the news, they see it in their movies, they are gripped by
the isolation of their own experience. Blacks, too, often fear that too
often violence has a black face - and no one cares.'
What happened in Los Angeles was 'the plaintive cry of millions of Americans
who know there is no community today'.
But this was not the bleeding heart liberal Clinton, or the professional
governor with a million programmes for every problem, or the politician
seeking to assign partisan blame. Indeed, he blamed his own party as much as
the Republicans for having let the country down.
Of the Democrats, he said: 'Too often people think we haven't paid as much
attention to the victims of crime as we should have. Too often they think we
have clung to putting their tax money into programmes year after year,
whether they work or not. Too often we have heard members of our party say
that those who seek to reform the welfare system are the enemies of the
poor.
'Too often we have had a leadership in our nation's capital paralysed and
divided, mirroring a country all too divided. And when that happens, we all
pay.'
He conceded that, as a politician, his credibility was not high. 'People say
you are a politician, how can I believe you?' There was no answer unless
people were honest with themselves, honest about race and crime and honest
enough to say that 'here is what the leaders should do and here is what the
people must do'. Without that ingredient there could only be frustration.
With it, he had some ideas: better community policing, community service,
not incarceration for the youngest and least violent offenders, serious gun
control ('you cannot make the case that a kid's need for an assault weapon
is protected under the constitution of the United States'), strengthening
families, including forced extraction of delinquent child support payments,
and turning schools into meaningful experiences.
A lot of what he said derives from his personal experience; he was the child
of a broken home, but brought up inside a strong extended family. He sends
his daughter to a racially mixed state school in Little Rock and lived
through, as a student, the 1968 urban riots in Washington.
Perfection is, of course, unattainable and he clearly has not always
attained it. But that does not mean he is insincere or cannot legitimately
dream.
'What is killing us today is that millions of Americans get up every day and
do not believe tomorrow will be better and do not believe they can make a
difference.' In New Orleans he eloquently set out the case that neither is
necessarily so.

SOUTH KOREAN officials led by Mr Huh Sung, assistant foreign minister, left
Seoul for Los Angeles yesterday to discuss compensation for Korean residents
who suffered losses in the riots, Reuter reports.
Mr Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Democratic party, also led a
28-member team to Los Angeles to gather information and discuss compensation
measures with officials there.
South Korean students chanted anti-American slogans outside the US embassy,
demanding that Korean residents in Los Angeles be compensated for riot
losses.
China told the US yesterday to put its own house in order after the race
riots in Los Angeles before telling Beijing to clean up its human rights
record.
'You apologists who proclaim the importance of human rights, waving your
clubs condemning and interfering in other countries' internal affairs - why
don't you open your eyes and look at your own domestic situation?' the
People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, said.
'It is a terrible irony that in this country which boasts of its human
rights, white policemen's brutality can be deemed innocent and black people
suffer insult,' it said.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Germany's iron lady faces fight for her survival: Resentment
is growing against the president of the oTV public services union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strike banners flap and the pickets cheer as Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies
climbs back into her red Mercedes. The president of the oTV public services
union winks, waves and whirrs off to continue her daily round: a barricaded
bus depot, a closed rubbish dump, and on to a picketed town hall.
The television pictures roll on, scanning heaps of rotting garbage and
traffic jams.
For the past eight days they have presented a neat composite portrait of a
Germany sweating out its first national public sector strike in 18 years,
overlaid with a cameo of a tough, competent union leader - a woman perfectly
at ease in a man's world. One of the boys.
Not quite. Despite the genuine picket-line solidarity and the admirable
efficiency of the strike, 'Our Monika' is in a bit of a jam. Today's battle
with a determined government will probably be followed in short order by a
struggle for her own survival as the only woman leader of a big German trade
union at leadership elections in June.
Her election in 1982 when, as now, the German economy was stuck in a rut and
public spending was under screws, was greeted as a revolutionary change of
tack in the conservative, male-dominated trade union world. As a 40-year-old
middle-class university graduate and former speech writer for ex-chancellor
Mr Willy Brandt, she had broken through the grass-roots ranks of career
unionists cluttering the oTV hierarchy.
Her lack of traditional credentials earned her the epithet 'the faceless
woman'. Surrounding herself with cool-thinking technocrats, she has since
won a reputation within her Stuttgart headquarters as an effective manager
and consensus-builder. She has been rewarded with charges by regional
officials that she has kept too much power to herself; the union, instead of
delegating more control to the regions, has become more centralised and less
flexible.
The value of efficient central control is evident in the meticulous
management of the current strike. But her own plans for reorganisation of
the union, a cumbersome apparatus representing the interests of some 2.3m
white- and blue-collar workers with about 400 different job descriptions,
have made little headway. Accompanying hopes that regional and sectoral
branches would be given more autonomy have been dashed, and resentment is
growing.
She has also shown herself to be out of step with senior leaders of other
unions on key issues. She has hesitated over proposals to restructure and
toughen up the DGB union association, the equivalent of Britain's Trades
Union Congress, and been reluctant to mobilise her members in pursuit of
shorter working hours, the main aim of most unions in the past few years.
More importantly, in the light of the approaching leadership elections, her
critics now accuse her of misjudging the economic and political climate when
she put forward this year's demand on pay and other benefits. The oTV claim,
a package worth almost 11 per cent, was the highest in the current wave of
demands.
'We stumbled into these negotiations as if they were a common-or-garden pay
round,' says Mr Michael Wendl, a senior officer in the Bavaria branch, and
one of her most persistent critics.
Come June, Ms Wulf-Mathies is unlikely to be accused of missing the signals
of dissent from her regional rivals. And anyone thinking of putting in a
claim for her job should be careful not to underestimate the capacities of
the new hierarchy she has built up in Stuttgart, and the picket-line
popularity she has so carefully cultivated during the current strike.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): Builder of the permanent, not the
ephemeral - Profile: Gordon Wu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE cannot be too many chief executives of large companies who listen to
Faure's Requiem while sitting at their desktop computer studying the latest
financial projections for their company, but then Gordon Wu is no ordinary
chief executive.
In Hong Kong today, where so much money is made simply by shuffling paper,
what marks out Mr Wu is that he is a builder of the permanent, not the
ephemeral. When many of his peers' creations are levelled in 10 years to
make way for the next glossy and marble-clad tower block, people will still
be using Mr Wu's roads, riding on the railway he built and using the
electricity from the power stations he constructed.
Mr Wu is the managing director and the largest shareholder of Hopewell
Holdings, a company which started life with Mr Wu as a Hong Kong property
developer in the late 1960s but, since the early 1980s, has become one of
the biggest private sector developers and builders of power stations, roads
and railways in China and south-east Asia.
The transformation of Hopewell is the result of this protean manager's drive
and imagination, aided, in no small part by the support of his bankers, in
particular the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and his shareholders.
Mr Wu, whose company is valued at around HKDollars 17.7bn, manages his
empire from the top floor of the Hopewell Centre in the
not-quite-so-fashionable Wan Chai district of Hong Kong island. His office
has a slightly donnish air; most available wall space is covered with
book-filled shelves, pictures, and his sound system.
Mr Wu was born on December 3, 1935, in Wan Chai, not a half a mile away from
his current office. He is the seventh of nine children and his parents'
third son. His family, like the district in which he was born, were of
humble origins.
His father, who died last year, was also born in Hong Kong. He was a taxi
cab driver who progressed from owning a half share of one cab to owning a
fleet of 378 by the time Mr Wu helped him sell his company in 1969. He
supported Mr Wu throughout his early years in business, and Mr Wu speaks of
him with respect bordering on reverence. A large photograph of his father is
prominently displayed in his office.
His early schooling was with the Jesuits; later he attended Princeton
University, New Jersey, where he read engineering. 'I did all right at
school. But I was never a serious student. At Princeton I graduated with a
gentleman's C plus.'
The 1950s was the time when the US was at the peak of its power; a
'blue-skies' optimism infused the country and it clearly affected Mr Wu. He
left the US with the desire to earn a million dollars and the belief that
with money 'you have selective power: you can afford to make mistakes, you
have that extra margin for safety'.
Mr Wu returned from the US to Hong Kong in 1958. For the next four years he
worked first for a private engineer/architect and then for the Hong Kong
government's works department - all to get a certificate that would entitle
him to be included on the government's list of accredited architects.
In the summer of 1962, with this achieved, he went to his father with a
business proposition. Mr Wu wanted to become a property developer, but a
developer with a difference. He wanted to own the land, design the building,
build it and either sell it or manage it. In short, he brought vertical
integration to property development.
'My father thought the idea was good and he put up HKDollars 6m. The first
building was a 10-storey apartment block; the land cost HKDollars 250,000
and I got back 100 per cent of the cost in two-and-a-half years. I did
several more, always recycling the money I made into the next project.'
There was one characteristic of the business career of Gordon Wu in the
1960s and early 1970s: crisis, but crisis overcome through detailed
planning. Most of the crises were outside his control - bank runs in 1965,
the Cultural Revolution in 1966/67, the stock market collapse in 1973 - but
each time he was able to persuade his bankers to support him. And the
reason? Because he was always able to present them with a coherent vision of
the future.
Take his first crisis, the one of 1965 which was precipitated by a run on
two of the colony's leading Chinese-owned banks, Ming Tak Bank and Heng Seng
Bank.
'I banked with the Hongkong Bank - my father banked with it and encouraged
me to. The bank runs precipitated a 50 per cent drop in property values.
Cash flow was in great jeopardy.
'Within a week of the runs I went to see Peter Hutson, chief accountant of
the Hongkong Bank. I explained to him our position and presented him with a
10-page memorandum explaining our cash flow position and what we needed to
keep the company viable: a HKDollars 3m loan. With that we could get
through.
'He read the memorandum and in five minutes he said we could have the money.
Two months later I saw him and he told be if I had come to see him a week
later the funds would not have been available.'
Mr Wu's relations with the Hongkong Bank have been close and enduring. His
point of view is simple: 'Keep nothing from your banker and work out your
problems together.'
He repeated this procedure again and again. In the summer of 1967 a crisis
of a different sort presented itself. His father announced he was going to
retire. This threw the 34 year-old Mr Wu into a state of temporary
depression. He looked at his life and figured he had accomplished nothing.
'I couldn't ask my father for money as my brothers and sisters would make
the same demand. So I asked him to guarantee a loan for HKDollars 15m
instead.
'If I made it, then the guarantee would be academic; if I didn't I would
write it off against my inheritance. He agreed and I ran all the way to the
Hongkong Bank.
'Willie Purves was chief accountant then (he is now chairman of the bank)
and the date was December 1, 1969. Willie is a straight talker, no bullshit,
no nonsense. I put the HKDollars 15m into property. With some friends (still
directors of Hopewell) I founded Hopewell Holdings.'
Mr Wu's relationship with Mr Purves, forged in those early years, has been
of great importance to him. When Hopewell was taken public in 1972, Mr
Purves was asked on to the board. When, in 1986, Mr Wu needed a large loan
to allow him to take up the rights in a Hopewell's HKDollars 5.8bn rights
issue, Mr Purves, by then chief executive and chairman-designate of the
bank, had approved it before Mr Wu even approached Hongkong Bank.
Gordon Wu's decision to change from property developer to builder of roads,
bridges, railways and power stations was the result of one big mistake.
In 1979, when property prices in Hong Kong were rising sharply, Mr Wu
decided to diversify. He thought the local market was overheated and
unsustainable. At that time he viewed the property market as a combination
of supply/demand and location. Today he realises that he missed one key
factor: growth in personal income.
'At that time China had opened the door and I thought it must present better
opportunities than Hong Kong,' he says.
'So I decided to do something else and infrastructure seemed to be shielded
from many commercial risks: you don't start to construct a power station
until you have sold all the production first. Y K Pao didn't build ships
before someone had already agreed to buy them. A super highway is the same
thing. Infrastructure is safe.'
That was the beginning of his now famous super-highway which, when completed
will link Shenzhen to Guangzhou and Guangzhou to Zhuhai. It was also the
beginning of his involvement in the development of power stations. He has
built one and is now constructing a second and, by the end of this year, he
plans to announce a third.
He has repeated his success in constructing power stations in China with the
building of one in the Philippines. But his most imaginative project is the
one just beginning in Bangkok. When it is finished Bangkok will have a badly
needed mass transit railway. The railway will be elevated and on top of it
will run an expressway for cars. The cost: USDollars 3.2bn.
As is characteristic of most great ideas, Mr Wu's solution for Bangkok's
urban transport problems was born of necessity and, not a little
frustration.
'I got stuck in a traffic jam for a couple of hours. There were five of us
in the car. We were in Bangkok to look at building a power station. It was
August 1989.
'I said if traffic was a problem it can be cracked. There was a wide railway
reserve going through the city and Stewart (Elliott, his long-time British
associate) said why not use that.
'No sane person has invested money in a railway this century. But if it were
elevated and covered so a freeway could go over it and we could develop the
adjacent land then it might work.
'We put the proposal down on paper and sent it to the minister of transport.
He immediately came to Hong Kong and invited us to Bangkok. They had their
technical people look at it they gave us the green light.
'The hitch was it had to go out to tender. My heart sank, it was our idea
and now we would have to let others try for it. The government decided to
make it a quick tender and required that bidders deposit USDollars 60m.
There was only one bidder.'
Physical work on the project started last month with work on the foundations
for the elevated transport system. The whole system will be constructed in
five stages taking an estimated eight years to build.
Hopewell will make money out of developing property adjacent to the railway.
The opportunity missed in Hong Kong in 1979 will not be repeated in Bangkok.
As Mr Wu points out, supply/demand favours the developer in Bangkok, incomes
of the Thais are rising rapidly and he has the locations - they are right
next to the railway he is building.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (12): Good year for regulators -
Financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS has been a good year for Hong Kong's beleaguered regulators. After
three years of battling prominent vested interests and each other, the
Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Stock Exchange finally
formed a common front and made moves to clean up and develop the local stock
market.
For a city with a history of laissez-faire, whereby the rich have been left
alone to get richer, there has been a surprising amount of support for the
regulators' successful moves to block unfair practices, such as the moves to
take private the Evergo and Allied groups, this year.
The Stock Exchange's policies of tightening up listings regulations and
focusing on a broader more China-oriented market place, have also attracted
praise.
The main catalyst of this changed approach has been the reform of the Stock
Exchange Council. This represented the sweeping away of the old club
atmosphere at the Exchange and the introduction of a wider ruling body,
without the vested interests that had been its former hallmark.
The battle over the Exchange reforms was not easily resolved. Former
Exchange deputy-chairman Mr Philip Wong is widely seen as being the catalyst
for the SFC's victory.
Mr Wong attempted to legalise preferential share allocations for Exchange
council members last year. The move was to have been retrospective, because
Mr Wong was anxious to clear his name, following evidence he had made use of
this dubious perk during the reign of jailed former Exchange chairman Mr
Ronald Li.
Mr Wong's move was eventually blocked, but it stood out as a glaring example
of how the council needed to be protected from control by vested interests.
Since this bitter resolution, the relationship between the two regulators
has become almost amicable. This has been partly due to some convenient
timing, which has seen the resignation from the Stock Exchange of its chief
executive Mr Francis Yuen, followed by the departure from the SFC of Mr
Yuen's long-standing foe Mr Robert Owen, the founding chairman.
Mr Yuen, the ambitious managing director of Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers,
took up the helm of the Exchange at 36 and was the product of the
free-wheeling Hong Kong corporate world.
Mr Owen, by contrast, was a former British diplomat and director of Lloyds
Merchant Bank, who headed an expatriate-oriented Watchdog. The two corporate
cultures would not merge. But the successors to the two chief protagonists,
Mr Paul Chow at the Stock Exchange and Mr Robert Nottle at the SFC, are both
technocrats rather than politicians. They have succeeded in ushering in an
era of co-operation and progress which few would have believed possible,
even a year ago.
'We are low profile. We believe we are there to work, instead of creating
public rows,' said Mr Chow.
Mr Nottle said he considered the Commission to be in an evolutionary phase,
as it passes its third anniversary on May 1. 'In this phase, we are shifting
the focus from correcting the problems of the past, to meeting the
challenges of the future.'
He argued that to rebuild an appropriate framework a number of steps needed
to be taken which 'were not popular with some of the Exchange members', but
he said in moving forward, the SFC would be involved in projects where there
was 'a commonality of interest'.
'In terms of the turf, the Exchanges and clearing houses recognise the role
of the Commission as an oversight regulator and a direct regulator in
certain areas,' said Mr Nottle.
The Stock Exchange has taken over primary responsibility for listing
matters, following more than two years of dual responsibility.
With the management energy being transferred from politics to the two key
areas of market development and minority shareholder protection, significant
advances have been made.
Investor protection has always been a concern. The tendency for Hong Kong
companies to be managed and controlled by sizeable family shareholdings,
with few wholly-independent directors to stand in the way of family
interests, minority shareholders have been subjected to numerous corporate
atrocities.
One such, the Evergo privatisation of Chinese Estates, was described by the
independent advisers to the minorities as 'wholly inadequate', but was voted
through, in spite of vociferous opposition from minority shareholders.
However, an aggressive campaign by the Stock Exchange and SFC led to the
lodging of an affidavit with the Supreme Court of Bermuda voicing concerns
about the vote. The offer was suddenly withdrawn.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Blue collars swapped for white - In
a decade, manufacturing output has fallen significantly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS largely a matter of nuance.
For the government's critics, Hong Kong does not have an industrial policy
worthy of the name. But for Mr TH Barma, acting secretary for trade and
industry, such a charge is a nonsense.
'We do have an industrial policy,' he insists. 'We have a policy of
intervening as little as possible in the marketplace. We see our role mainly
as facilitating but we do not intervene to offer direct subsidies and we do
not have any predetermined notion of what industries should or should not
exist in Hong Kong.'
Whether from neglect or design, Hong Kong has undoubtedly adopted a
laissez-faire attitude towards economic growth in stark contrast to most
other economies in the Asian region - most notably, Singapore. For this
reason, Hong Kong is held up by many as an example of the wonders of
entrepreneurialism in an environment of unleashed market forces.
At one level, the success of the policy is incontestable. As Mr Barma says:
'Over the past 30 to 40 years Hong Kong has had a remarkable rate of growth.
With very few natural resources we have become a major trading entity and
are now ranked 10th in the league table of industrial powers.'
But at a deeper level, there is room for doubt. The policy prescriptions of
the past are not always the ideal blueprints for the future and many voices
are now being raised urging the government to do more to stimulate growth in
higher value-added sectors of the economy.
As Hong Kong moves from being a predominantly manufacturing to a service
economy, industrialists argue that Hong Kong needs to create more effective
'knowledge' industries which require original research and development.
Since the beginning of the 1980s, manufacturing output has fallen from
almost 30 per cent of GDP to below 18 per cent. And employment in
manufacturing industry has fallen from 900,000 to 650,000. 'We are rapidly
changing our blue collars for white,' as one Hong Kong industrialist
expresses it.
But the fear is that Hong Kong will be left behind in the general upgrading
of Asian economies that is currently taking place. The government has a
greater role to play in taking the lead but, in the estimation of at least
some industrialists, it is in danger of avoiding its responsibilities.
Mr James Tien, head of the Textiles Council, says: 'The government's policy
of non-interference may have been a good thing in the 1960s and 70s but not
now. It is directionless but they dress it up in better terms and call it
non-interference.'
Officially, the government accepts the need to change and encourage further
investment in 'strategic' sectors, such as electronics. The Industry
Department has recently set up a HKDollars 200m fund to support investment
in industrial research on a matching dollar-for-dollar basis. It intends to
invest in research projects before they are mature enough to attract other
forms of venture capital.
'We are coming in at the ground floor rather than at the mezzanine level,'
as Mr Barma explains it.
The Hong Kong Productivity Council, which is subvented by government to the
tune of HKDollars 100m a year, also helps to disseminate existing research
more widely throughout industry helping to lift levels of productivity. And
the government has recently established a University of Science and
Technology to raise levels of technological expertise in the colony.
In some areas, the Hong Kong government has had a considerable history of
being highly interventionist. It has long believed it is government's
responsibility to create the framework in which entrepreneurialism can
thrive. And so, for example, it subsidises about half of all domestic
housing in the colony thereby helping to reduce labour costs. It has also
played a substantial role in creating the necessary industrial
infrastructure as the vast Port and Airport Development (Pads) project amply
testifies.
But when critics of the government's industrial policy become too vociferous
and claim all this still smacks of too little too late, its supporters
rejoin by pushing the unofficial line that it does not matter anyway because
of the remarkable fusion of economic activity that has taken place between
Hong Kong and China.
This line of argument suggests that Hong Kong can defer the day of economic
reckoning because of the vast untapped pools of cheap labour it can call
upon in China. The rate of expansion in Guangdong province has been
prodigious: Hong Kong companies now employ about 3m workers in mainland
China, which has recently superseded the US as Hong Kong's biggest trading
partner.
In this scenario, Hong Kong will act as the service centre for the Chinese
hinterland channelling investment into the region and marketing its exports.
Mr Ronald Chao, managing director of the Novel Enterprises textiles group,
expresses a widespread analogy when he says: 'I think Hong Kong will become
like New York and Shanghai like Chicago.'
For Hong Kong companies, the appeal of developing businesses in China is
easy to see because of the enormous cost advantages. Many industries,
particularly in toys, watches and electronics, have largely uprooted their
factories in Hong Kong and reopened them on the other side of the border.
Ms Christina Cheung, director of Wah Shing Toys a Hong Kong company which
has made just such a move, says wages in the toy industry in mainland China
are only one-eighth to one-tenth of those in Hong Kong. The rental price of
land is only about HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 2 a square foot in China
compared with HKDollars 7.50 to HKDollars 10 in Hong Kong.
Her views about the economic development of the region are typical of many
industrialists. 'I have very strong confidence in the future of China. Once
they open up and all the people get in touch with the living standards in
the western world and how good a life we have in Hong Kong then they are not
likely to go back to the old system,' she says.
But such developments throw up new challenges for the Hong Kong government -
not least how to ensure by discrete diplomacy that the US does not revoke
China's Most Favoured Nation status, a move which would have a devastating
impact on many Hong Kong businesses.
Mr Dennis Ting, chairman of the Hong Kong toys council, says the withdrawal
of MFN status would increase the import duties on Chinese-made toys from 7
per cent to 70 per cent. 'It would kill our industry,' he says.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): Coming clean on hazards to life -
Hong Kong faces a vast and uniquely complex set of environmental challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORT walk down Wong Chuk Hang road in Aberdeen should be enough to
convince even the most hardened sceptic that Hong Kong faces a vast and
uniquely complex set of environmental challenges.
Along both sides of the street, a score of high-rise factories produce a
terrible clatter and pollute the air with noxious fumes. The continual
chatter of nearby construction works and the flow of traffic adds to the
cavernous din.
But just behind, a string of flats run up the hill and local residents
scurry across the road, hands clenched firmly to their noses and ears.
Such scenes are typical in Hong Kong where the dense urban population, a
virtual absence of planning restrictions and the colony's explosive
industrial growth have combined to produce environmental problems which are
not just aesthetically displeasing but life-threatening.
'In Hong Kong we had industrial chimneys located five metres from someone's
bedroom window. I have no doubt that people were sent to hospital and some
even died because of sulphur dioxide poisoning,' says Robert Law,
deputy-director of the Environmental Protection Department.
The great challenge has been to identify the most serious of the multitude
of environmental threats and determine who should be responsible for
addressing them. So far there has been a surfeit of bickering between
government, business and environmental groups but a shortfall of effective
action to tackle the issues.
Certainly, the government has appreciated the scale of the problems and has
begun to construct a framework for their resolution. In June 1989, the
government issued a White Paper on Pollution which catalogued the main
threats to Hong Kong's environment.
It identified the fact that each day the colony generated 5,000 tonnes of
garbage, 2m tonnes of sewage and industrial waste water, 600 tonnes of
sulphur dioxide, 200 tonnes of carbon monoxide, and 300 tonnes of nitrogen
oxides to say nothing of noise and other wastes generated by industry.
The White Paper sketched out a 10-year strategy for dealing with these
environmental problems by a combination of persuasion, legislative
enforcement, and investments in infrastructure projects, such as a massive
scheme which will pipe treated sewage out to sea instead of dumping it in
Victoria Harbour.
The Environmental Protection Department, which was entrusted with
implementing the legislation, has seen a substantial increase in its budget
and staffing, which has grown in 10 years from 20 to 1,000.
The government can point to some conspicuous successes. Sulphur dioxide
emissions have been cut by more than 80 per cent since the introduction of
fuel regulations in July 1990. The amount of pig effluents contaminating the
water supply has reduced sharply following a policy of buying out polluting
farms.
But in spite of such efforts, the government has continued to attract fire
from industry and the environmental lobby groups who argue it lacks the
resources and aggression to do an effective job.
Mr Peter Illig, director of the local branch of Friends of the Earth (FoE),
says the government is nowhere near stringent enough in enforcing its
policies. 'I see a lot of carrots but not enough of the big stick which
compromises the integrity of the legislation.
'Why have these issues been around for so long and addressed in the West but
not tackled by the most dynamic city in Asia? The government is always
behind the eight ball,' he says.
Other organisations have also been critical of the policies and have
attempted to tackle some problems themselves. One is the Private Sector
Committee on the Environment, a group of 16 companies which aims to promote
'market environmentalism'.
Local legend has it that the initiative stemmed from William Purves, the
chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, who decided
'something must be done' about the environment after being appalled by the
mass of floating rubbish in Victoria Harbour which he could see from his
office window.
But since its establishment three years ago, the committee has broadened its
remit by setting up a Centre of Environmental Technology which provides
advice on pollution control equipment for small businesses and supplies
venture capital funds for various environmental projects.
Mr George Cardona, from HKSBC who chairs the committee, says: 'The
underlying theme of this organisation is that if you can harness the profit
motive you can clean up the environment a lot faster than by government
action. Many things done elsewhere by governments are done by business in
Hong Kong. It is quite natural for the corporate sector to take a lead.'
But such initiatives cut little ice with the FoE, which views market
environmentalism as an inherently flawed concept. 'The market will not solve
the problem; the market is one of the problems. Pollution is one of the
direct effects of the industrial process which functions in a market,' says
Mr Illig.
He believes it is essential to maintain the pressure on industry and
government by raising awareness of environmental issues among Hong Kong's
inhabitants. 'If there is no governmental environmental priority it has to
come from the local population. Everything that happens between now and 1997
is critical,' he says.
Although FoE's 1,600 members are primarily from the expatriate community,
other environmental organisations, such as Green Power and the Conservancy
Association, have been more active in stirring up the consciences of the
Hong Kong Chinese.
But Mr Law, of the EPD, believes attitudes have already changed
substantially over the past few years and there is now more of a consensus
for tough action. 'Everywhere around the world you see that as disposable
income grows so do expectations about the quality of life,' he says.
In the meantime, the sewage bubbles through manhole covers after heavy rain,
teachers still use megaphones to talk to their classes, and local residents
say you can tell the season's fashions by the colour of the dyes leaking
into the rivers.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (8): Material threats to exports - The
textile industry has been hit by rising costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG, the home of cheap clothing manufacturing for decades, has rapidly
been pricing itself out of the market.
Exorbitant land costs, labour shortages, and worryingly high levels of
inflation have eroded the clothing industry's competitiveness and turned
buyers' attention to lower cost manufacturing centres in southern China,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
Such cost pressures have not been unique to textile and clothing companies
yet - unlike manufacturers in the toys and electronics industries - they
have been unable to relocate in low-cost China because of the 'country of
origin' quota restrictions imposed by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and
various bilateral trade agreements.
In the absence of a loosening of the labour market through an inflow of
foreign workers, the rising cost pressures will not be easy to reverse. Many
in the textiles and garment industries are pessimistic about the future for
manufacturing in Hong Kong believing it has already become the centre of
'last resort' for many buyers.
Mr James Tien, vice-chairman of the Textiles Council who also runs the
privately-owned Manhattan Garments, says: 'Our industry's prices are already
the highest in the region and I take a dim view of the future because of the
high inflation rate. It will be very difficult for the garment industry to
survive if we take a 12 per cent hike in wage costs each year.'
Mr Ronald Chao, managing director of Novel Enterprises, adopts a similarly
downbeat view. 'If there were no quotas you would not see any textile
production in Hong Kong,' he says.
At first impression the erosion of Hong Kong's competitiveness is a serious
problem because the clothing industry represents the colony's biggest
employer and export-earner. Last year 223,840 workers - or more than
one-third of all employees in the manufacturing sector - were employed in
the clothing industry. Exports of HKDollars 75.8bn made garments the biggest
exporting industry in Hong Kong, accounting for one-third of the total.
The textiles industry ranks as the third biggest export earner, accounting
for Dollars 17.6bn or 7.6 per cent of total domestic exports and employing
62,438 workers.
Although these industries are clearly under threat they will not be
eliminated overnight. Hong Kong is sheltered from the full force of market
pressures because of the international quota agreements that operate in many
clothing categories and which are only marginally modified from year to
year.
'Because Hong Kong was an early starter it has a historical advantage over
the newcomers, which have to start from zero quotas,' explains Mr W B Lam,
company secretary of Winsor Industrial, Hong Kong's biggest integrated
textile and clothing company. 'In one way it limits Hong Kong's growth but
on the other hand it protects us from our competitors.'
Hong Kong companies have also tried to escape international cost pressures
by moving from the commodity end of the clothing market into higher
value-added sectors - as shown by a decline in exports in volume terms but
an increase in dollar terms.
But industry observers argue that there is a limit to this evolution. The
industry's infrastructure has not been built on the basis of low-volume
high-value production and Hong Kong lacks the design skills and creativity
to rival France or Italy as a centre of high fashion.
Individual clothing companies have reacted to changing market conditions in
typical Hong Kong fashion by showing great flexibility and diversifying into
other fields.
Some companies, which have been sitting on valuable industrial real estate
have transformed themselves into property developers by turning textile
factories into office blocks. Manhattan Garments, for example, now derives
two-thirds of its profits from property with only one-third from clothing
manufacturing. Lai Sun, which built up a big business exporting jeans to the
US, has now diversified into property, retailing and hotels.
Other companies have sought to take advantage of the quota system itself.
Because textile products are all but worthless on the international market
without the authorisation to export them, quotas have become as valuable as
gold dust. Some textile companies, which have high quota allocations because
of a long history of manufacturing, now make more money from selling their
quotas to other manufacturers than they do from making products themselves.
A string of 'quota brokers' have also sprung up creating a grey market for
the necessary export documents.
If the whole industry shows as great a flexibility as many of the individual
companies then the future is probably not as bleak as some imagine.
In the longer run, as the quota system fades away Hong Kong companies will
be able to establish a greater presence in other low-cost countries and
southern China - much as Novel Enterprises is already doing by building a
textiles factory in Shenzhen, just across the border in Guangdong province.
This joint venture between two Hong Kong, two Chinese and one Japanese
partner is rated a big success by its founders and is stepping up production
from 3m yards a month to 4 1/2 m yards. Labour and land costs in China are
less than one-fifth of those in Hong Kong, although electricity, water and
transport are becoming increasingly expensive.
Of course, it is not only Hong Kong companies that can take advantage of the
economic flowering of China but overseas companies still face considerable
obstacles to doing business.
As Mr Billy Hung, a director of Lai Sun garments, says: 'When you go to
Guangdong you do not have a phone line, the only language is Chinese, you
have to sit in a dingy 1950s' Chevrolet on a bumpy road for five hours
before you get to the factory and at the end of a long day there is no
hotel.'
He argues that Hong Kong will retain its importance in the industry by
acting as a clothing enrepot with close ties to China, excellent
communications, a knowledgeable labour force, high language skills and the
sheer convenience of 'coming here and seeing everything'.
Mr Jim Brown, who heads a 64-person buying office in Hongkong for Next, the
UK fashion chain, tends to agree. Although he says his company is
increasingly buying clothes from other countries in the Asian region it is
unlikely to move to another centre. 'Manufacturing of some higher quality
and higher priced garments will always remain in Hong Kong but basically it
will develop into a service centre for China,' he says.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (7): Ambitious plan takes off - The new
airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYMBOL of renewed confidence in the future of Hong Kong, or simply a
monument to the British Empire, the Dollars 46bn Chek Lap Kok airport has
become an astounding reality in 1992, after 10 years on the drawing board.
The tropical island site is already flattened and new contracts are being
issued in abundance. As the most ambitious single infrastructural project
ever undertaken in Asia, companies have arrived from all over the world to
snap at airport-related contracts amounting to HKDollars 20bn in 1992 alone.
These have already resulted in substantial controversy, with Hong Kong
subsidiaries of UK companies receiving the bulk of the consultancy contracts
for the core airport programme, to the ire of the local press. The terminal
design contract also went to the most expensive bid on the short list, the
British Mott Consortium, for HKDollars 536m.
Further difficulties have been encountered over the principal 1,248-hectare
Chek Lap Kok site preparation contract, where bids have been between 20 per
cent and 50 per cent higher than the government estimate of HKDollars 10bn.
Since the project uses close to 70 per cent of the available world dredging
fleet, dredging prices have been raised mercilessly. Engineers claim this is
a situation which should have been foreseen. The Provisional Airport
Authority is having to review the contract to find ways of cutting costs.
But the myriad of international construction companies touting for business
in the colony seem in the main satisfied with the performance of the PAA and
the government in its handling of this ambitious project.
'You have to adapt the project itself to the capacity of the industry. And
on this basis, we are satisfied with the way it is being handled,' said Mr
Michel Betant, managing director of Dragages et Travaux Publics (Hong Kong),
which has been a large competitor in the tenders so far.
Accusations of national bias have often emanated from the offices of
unsuccessful bidders and the PAA is adamant it has developed a selection
process as rigorous as any to be found in other such projects.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), the body introduced in
Hong Kong to battle against rampant graft in the colony, has been called in
to observe the tendering process.
'It is as independent as we can get. It does not in any way favour any
national interest, except to say we want people who know how to do work in
Hong Kong. That is the key, along with value for money,' said Mr Richard
Allen, chief executive of the PAA.
The airport is designed to cater for Hong Kong's transportation needs beyond
2040. Mr Allen argues: 'There is nothing new about this project, except for
the size and duration. It is bigger and has to be built in a shorter time.'
Phase one of the project, aimed to be completed shortly before the handover
to China on July 1, 1997, will create capacity for 35m passengers a year.
Phase II, to be finished in 2040, will be able to accommodate 87m annual
passengers at 120 aircraft gates. This compares with the capacity of the
existing airport at Kai Tak of 24m passengers, which is expected to be
reached by 1993.
Linked to the Airport Core Programme are some large infrastructural
projects. These include the 1.3km Tsing Ma bridge, linking Northern Lantau
Island with the Mainland, the high-speed rail link which should traverse the
32km distance to Central Hong Kong in close to 20 minutes, and a highway
running along the sparsely populated North Lantau coast line. The total cost
of these is estimated at HKDollars 112bn, compared with the original
estimates of HKDollars 99bn.
The PAA is solely responsible for the activities on the airport island, but
much local attention has been focused on the contract for the 'Gateway to
China' Tsing Ma bridge. The key competitors for this contract are Hyundai
Engineering and Construction of Korea and a consortium led by Trafalgar
House of the UK.
The Korean bid was in the region of HKDollars 2bn lower, but the company
claims to have been unfairly picked on to provide special guarantees which
have not been demanded from the other consortia.
The bridge is one of the most crucial contracts for the project and the
government has made it clear that it is not prepared to risk taking on a
contractor which may not be able to complete on time.
The government is faced with a difficult decision, but there are signs that
it is planning to guillotine the Hyundai bid due to financial risk, when it
announces the contract award in mid-May. This could create a political
uproar.
The appointment of the Trafalgar House consortium will also provide
ammunition for those arguing that the airport is a last-ditch effort by the
British government to cash in on its colony and support its ailing
construction sector.
One displeased body could be the Chinese government itself. China Road and
Bridge is Hyundai's only partner in the project. Beijing may be keen to
exploit politically any indications of mis-handling by the Hong Kong
government.
But given the depth of financial difficulties in which Hyundai finds itself,
following its chairman's move into opposition politics in South Korea, the
government will not be short of counter-arguments.
Trafalgar House has one significant advantage, but this was the result of
the government design. The bridge is to use parallel wire cable, for which
only Japan has the technology.
It has become apparent the technology will be readily available only to
consortia with a Japanese element, which excludes Hyundai. Critics cite this
as another error of judgment by the government. Consortia have suggested an
alternative construction method to get round this.
The bridge is just one important aspect of the project which will be
resolved in the next few months. The PAA will have to progress with the
financing of its part of the project. It is to raise HKDollars 20bn,
although with a guaranteed income stream (it will receive income from Kai
Tak from a fixed date in 1997, to cover for any potential delays with the
replacement) this is not expected to cause difficulties. The Mass Transit
Railway Corporation will also shortly issue consultancy contracts for its
airport rail link.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Battleground for 1995 election
drawn - The day party politics came to the colony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU thought that Hong Kong was a place administered by Britain in which
domestic politics played little or no part then you had better change your
mind, or else you are about to be mugged by reality.
For 148 years of Britain's rule of its Far East colony this may have been
the case, but September 15, 1991, will go down in the history of Hong Kong
as the day on which the power of Britain's colonial government began to
wane. It was the day when party politics was introduced to Hong Kong and it
was also the day Hong Kong's future masters in Beijing came to rue.
Those elections returned 18 democratically-elected politicians - 12 of whom
fought the election under the banner of Martin Lee's United Democrats; 21
members representing 'functional constituencies', such as lawyers, trade
unionists, and teachers; 18 members appointed by the governor, and three
occupied by top civil servants.
Just how Hong Kong's politicians arrive at a modus vivendi with the colonial
government will determine the extent to which the colony's transition from
British to Chinese rule is smooth or rough, difficult or easy.
So far the omens are decidedly mixed. At present the colony is ruled by a
theoretically all-powerful governor who takes advice from an Executive
Council (ExCo) consisting of permanent civil servants, and appointed pillars
of the community, both Chinese and expatriate.
This government, however, holds no majority in the local legislature - known
as the Legislative Council, or LegCo - and its legitimacy to govern is
becoming increasingly questioned by not only those who were democratically
elected last September (and who form a de facto opposition) but also,
implicitly, by some of its own appointees.
'In the past policy was decided first in discussions which reached consensus
and then we went public,' says Alan Lee, an appointed member of the LegCo
and a member of the governor's ExCo. 'Now it's discussion, differences of
opinion, debate and vote. Consensus politics has gone; that is the reality
of the situation.'
The government's room for manoeuvre is severely limited. Its ability to
alter the constitution of Hong Kong is limited by the Basic Law - drafted
and passed into law by China - which has taken as its template for governing
the colony after 1997 the political system as it was in the late 1980s.
This is the so-called 'executive-led' government which prevailed for most of
British rule in Hong Kong. But the executive has been weakened by the
introduction of partial elective democracy last September. The Chinese
drafters of the Basic Law did not anticipate the consequences of last year's
elections and it is not wholly clear if Britain did either.
This situation was graphically demonstrated by LegCo's reaction to the first
budget presented by Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary.
The budget appeared astute; its key details were carefully leaked to the
local press and its proposals had all the hallmarks of a government which
had read the United Democrats' election platform and was attempting to
implement some of it. The corporate tax rate was raised, soothing noises
were made about social programmes, and personal allowances were raised by a
greater margin than inflation.
The LegCo debate was, however, acrimonious and for a time, it looked as
though the budget would not be passed. It was only passed after Mr MacLeod
made what in any other parliamentary jurisdiction would have been a fatal
concession: he promised to lower taxes for the lower and middle classes in
his next budget.
Senior government officials now conceded that they were wrong-footed by
LegCo's response. 'We thought it a balanced, middle-of-the-road document
which balanced social concerns with economic needs,' says one. 'Even though
it was that it still produced a split. This is a reflection on the state of
politics rather than of substance.'
The only option left to the government is to try and move closer to centre
of politics in the colony in an attempt to limit the area of dissent as far
as possible. 'We can't bulldoze our way through any more,' says the
official.
Government officials rightly note that politics in Hong Kong is not
characterised by the extremes of left and right. There is a broad consensus
in the colony about what has made Hong Kong rich and prosperous.
But that said the familiar arguments about how to distribute the national
wealth are there (as the budget debates testify), and there is a brewing
controversy concerning the legitimacy of the government, and a
politicisation of the electorate taking place.
Martin Lee's United Democrats, who won a majority of the
democratically-contested seats last September and won the support of most of
the others, are not shy of reminding the government that they are the ones
who won the people's mandate last September.
This is an argument which government officials privately concede but one
from which they understandably shy. It remains unclear, however, whether
those who voted for the United Democrats did so with the hope that it would
challenge the government and China as much as it has.
But even the government's natural supporters openly recognise its dilemma.
'The Government can't claim it has the support of LegCo on policy or on the
law-making process,' said one. 'The Government doesn't have a government
party; it can't have and does not have a majority in LegCo.'
This is just a foretaste, however, of what the government will have to face
in the coming year. Looming large is the issue of electoral reform. It is an
issue which divides LegCo, a committee of which is studying the problem, but
it is one which may well have reverberations in Westminster and possibly
even in Washington.
In advance of the 1995 elections the battleground is already beginning to be
drawn. Alan Lee is devoting this summer to drawing up a constitution for a
new business-oriented party to be formed out of the Co-operative Resources
Centre - a grouping which counts 16 LegCo members among its number, and four
ExCo members.
Pro-Beijing interests are also mustering their force. Mr Tam Yiu-chung,
vice-chairman of the pro-China Federation of Trade Unions, has announced his
intention to form a party. This will marry the grass-roots organisation of
his union interests with business interests represented by the 'One Country
Two Systems Research Institute' run by the late Sir Y K Pao's son-in-law Dr
Edgar Cheng.
Separately, the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association, which represents
mainland companies in Hong Kong and is directly controlled from Beijing, has
made claim to one of the nine extra 'functional' constituencies that will be
created for the 1995 elections. Its application is expected to be
successful.
The contestants are readying themselves for the race. Just how level the
playing field will be has yet to be decided.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (6): Reform poses a dilemma - Debate
over electoral options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will be called upon to decided whether, in 1995, Hong Kong is
allowed to elect 20 representatives to the Legislative Council with
western-style fairness, or whether other interests, representing China and
the business community, will be given an advantage.
Which way Britain jumps turns on the question of how much democracy Hong
Kong wants on the eve of its hand-over to China
The answer to that question will dictate an important area of the political
landscape post-1995 and beyond.
Liberals, who point to the United Democrats' success at last September's
elections, can fairly claim that the people have spoken. The social and
political policies the Democrats enunciated won the day; the more democracy
the better to safeguard the interests of Hong Kong's people, they say.
Those to the right, representing business and pro-China groups, argue that
what is needed is a return to the status quo. They emphasise economic
growth, stability and dialogue, not confrontation with China.
Government officials question whether the Hong Kong Chinese want full-blown
democracy and the difficulties from China that would bring in its wake.
Foreign diplomats concur: 'There is a recognition of a need to reach an
accommodation with China to protect their well-being; I am not convinced of
a broad desire for democracy here,' observes one.
The nine constituencies returned 18 of LegCo's 60 members; in each
constituency voters were able to cast two votes. Martin Lee's United
Democrats won 12 of the 18. The number of directly, or democratically,
elected members will rise to 20 in the 1995 plebiscite.
The government has made it known that it sees only three alternatives: 20
single-seat constituencies; 10 two-seat, two-vote constituencies; or,
multi-seat one-vote constituencies. The first two options are favoured by
Hong Kong's liberal politicians, the last named by China and local
conservative interests.
On the LegCo committee of 12 studying reform, only four were democratically
elected; the remainder were either appointed by the government or elected by
'functional' constituencies, many on an uncontested basis.
Those groups who were unsuccessful in last year's direct elections - the
Beijing-backed candidates and those representing business - see electoral
'reform' as a way of improving their chances in 1995. They opt for
multi-member constituencies with voters given only one vote.
The electoral reform process will be one of the most difficult for the
government to manage. It is likely to come under pressure from all sides and
not all can be pleased at the same time.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): A state of near limbo - China
relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS before Britain is due to hand back Hong Kong to China relations
between the two over the colony remain in a state of near limbo.
Little progress is being made either by the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) - the body charged with co-ordinating and negotiating the
transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China - nor, it would seem, in the
six-monthly meetings between the foreign ministers of both countries.
The events of June 4, 1989 - the Tiananmen massacre  - and their
international aftermath have cast a long, dark shadow over Anglo-Chinese
relations. The visit by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, to
Beijing last September secured a HKDollars 114bn airport and related
infrastructure projects, but it does not seem to have resulted in much else.
If this were not worrying enough another factor has been added to problems:
the power struggle in Beijing. Chinese officials - already under
instructions to teach the Hong Kong government a lesson for letting people
take to the streets at the time of June 4 - are keeping their heads down.
These officials are in no mind to take the initiative in negotiations lest
they incur the disfavour of a leadership yet to be determined.
Furthermore, many of the officials China has put forward to lead the
negotiations are not seen as having much political clout in Beijing. Lu
Ping, the head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office of the State
Council, is seen as a highly intelligent official but one who lacks the
seniority of his predecessor - the Long March veteran Ji Peng Fei  - and
therefore his access to the highest level of decision-making in China.
The upshot of this is that, to the consternation of the Hong Kong
government, the work load of the JLG mounts. There still remains to be
processed some 400 international treaties relating to trade - bilateral and
multilateral. Some derive from Hong Kong's dependent status on the UK others
have been signed in the colony's own right. Many are obscure - such as the
European convention on pallets, which agrees an international standard for
the size of pallets - but they are part of everyday life and to ensure their
post-1997 legality have to redrawn.
Other issues before the JLG are the stuff of high politics. They include:
Air services agreements. The Chinese are stalling, they say, because the UK
will not show them secret annexes to the agreements. Britain believes that
CAAC, the aviation monopoly in China, is using its considerable influence in
Beijing to frustrate agreement being reached. CAAC wants access to Hong
Kong's airways and the airways beyond, they say.
Military lands. There are 19 military sites in Hong Kong. The British want
to vacate many before 1997, thereby leaving the Hong Kong government free to
develop them. It wants to know from the Chinese which sites the People's
Liberation Army needs. The Chinese position is that it wants them all;
Britain has offered five so far, including HMS Tamar, the headquarters of
British forces in the colony.
According to one British official: 'They are being too greedy and we can't
yet see a deal that is to the advantage of Hong Kong.' However, hopes are
that the Chinese will compromise. Mr Anthony Galsworthy, Britain's senior
representative to the JLG, hinted at the UK's preparedness to compromise at
a press briefing after the JLG meeting in March. 'We should not expect to
get 100 per cent of what we want,' he said. 'This is a negotiation."
The heyday of Anglo-Chinese relations is looking more and more like the
period between the signing of the Joint Declaration in late 1984 and June
1989. Since then the Chinese government's attitude toward the British has
reverted to type. The UK is regarded with suspicion and is seen as wanting
to denude Hong Kong of its wealth before June 1997 while, at the same time,
leaving in place structures which will perpetuate British influence.
The main reason for this distrust is, from Beijing's point of view, the
failure of the UK's client government in Hong Kong to crack down on
movements in the colony which advocate democracy on the mainland. From the
Chinese point of view a failure to crack down is an implicit endorsement of
their activities. China sees these groups as a threat; some of them gave aid
to pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in 1989.
To the suspicious Chinese the development of local democracy in Hong Kong
has also been a considerable worry. It is now clear to many that China did
not anticipate the effect that a change to electoral politics would have on
the ability of the Hong Kong government (and by extension its post-1997
clone) to govern.
Last September's elections have changed the face of Hong Kong politics from
a cosy, consensual style of autocracy (the style of Hong Kong government
China thought it would inherit) to a fractious, argumentative and
party-based competitive style of politics. Many newly-elected local
politicians have challenged the legitimacy of the colony's 'executive-led'
government.
The consequence for those who have to negotiate Hong Kong's future with
Beijing is unenviable. Recently British negotiators have detected the
formation of a new line emanating from Beijing. One has dubbed it the
'doctrine of no change' - meaning the Hong Kong government cannot alter the
way it does things, or the machinery of government.
If it tries the wrath of heaven descends. It is now commonplace for senior
Chinese officials to comment publicly and provocatively upon Hong Kong
government policy. This is deeply unsettling to the government - to unsettle
is probably the motive  - and the colony as a whole.
Recently there have been high profile interventions about the government's
plans to 'corporatise' Radio and Television Hongkong (that is, change RTHK's
status from that of a government department to a statutory corporation) and,
more worryingly, the government's annual budget. Concerns about inflation
and the new airport are frequently aired and, earlier this year, Beijing,
without consultation, appointed 44 local worthies to advise it on Hong Kong
affairs.
The Joint Declaration speaks of the need for closer co-operation during the
second half of the transition. Britain has agreed to consult on these issues
but has resisted Beijing's demands that it become involved in the detail of
plans.
The outlook, therefore, for Anglo-Chinese relations is mixed. Resolution of
some outstanding problems can be expected. By the end of this year the power
struggle in Beijing may have produced a clear winner, and this may lend some
security to the position of officials, especially those negotiating Hong
Kong's future. A new, more positive, line may emanate from Beijing.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (3): Plans for a another miracle -
Inflation is a side-effect of the structural changes in the economy
</HEADLINE>

HONG KONG'S role as service centre for and gateway to China should ensure
continued prosperity in the face of its rapidly diminishing manufacturing
sector. But in the longer term, its consistently high inflation may become a
serious concern.
Inflation is an inevitable side-effect of the structural changes taking
place in the economy. The traditional manufacturing sector has rapidly moved
to take the benefits of cheaper land and labour across the border in
Guangdong, creating a greater demand for workers in the more
labour-intensive service sector.
Demand for labour has been further enhanced by Hong Kong's role as regional
hub and springboard for investment into China. This has all taken place
against a backdrop of almost full employment, high emigration and one of the
lowest birth rates in the world.
A fall in the Hong Kong inflation rate from its April 1991 peak of 13.9 per
cent to an estimated 1992 average of 9.8 per cent might suggest there is
already a downward trend.
But out of the forecast 2.5 per cent decrease in inflation in 1992, 2 per
cent is directly attributable to increased indirect taxes introduced in
1991. The figures are therefore artificial and businessmen are beginning to
accept that double-digit inflation will become a matter of course in the
lead up to 1997.
The handing out of some HKDollars 20bn worth of contracts for the new
airport in the first six months of 1992, combined with an economic upswing
in the second half of the year, will put further pressure on prices.
Inflation is the main negative point in an otherwise optimistic economic
scenario. The phase of low growth and high inflation that followed the
disastrous consequences of Tiananmen Square and the Chinese austerity
measures of early 1989 are being replaced by a sharp trade-led economic
upswing.
Growth in Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) slowed to 3 per cent in
1990, hit by the effects of the Gulf crisis, but the China factor enabled it
to accelerate by a healthier 4 per cent last year. A number of economists
expect it could rise to 6 per cent this year, compared with a government
forecast of 5 per cent; while corporate earnings growth for the 33 Hang Seng
Index constituent companies is expected to exceed 20 per cent this year.
The increase in foreign investment in southern China has encouraged a
significant boom in its highly competitive export industries; these products
have been processed through Hong Kong and its deep water port, resulting in
a substantial increase in the level of re-exports.
The demand for services in Hong Kong has also reflected developments in
China, as the colony has acted as the stepping off point for international
investors. A recent survey indicated there were 880 regional representative
offices in Hong Kong, with 26 regional headquarters set up in the first five
months of 1991.
Finally, there has been a substantial pick-up in tourist arrivals, following
the downturn that accompanied the invasion of Kuwait.
Against these factors, the inflation rate might seem a minor irritant. Some
economists even argue that the differential between inflation and interest
rates, is beneficial, since it has encouraged greater capital expenditure.
There have been sizeable negative effective interest rates and so far asset
inflation has been focused only on specific areas such as residential
property.
Unlike the manufacturing sector, services compete on more than price and
Hong Kong has in its favour the China factor. But in the long term, Hong
Kong could see multinational companies relocating to other regional centres;
while tourism is strongly linked to the cost of services. Inflation
therefore remains a very real concern.
With the evolution of Hong Kong's economy from manufacturing to services,
concern over the competitive position of the territory's export sector
becomes less important.
In 1991, total domestic exports increased by 2.3 per cent to HKDollars
231.04bn; re-exports jumped 29.2 per cent to HKDollars 534.84bn. This
underlines the speed with which the economy has relocated basic labour
intensive manufacturing to the Pearl River delta, instead concentrating on
servicing those displaced industries.
The manufacturing sector accounted for 31 per cent of the territory's GDP in
1970. By 1990, this had fallen to 16.7 per cent, although there has been a
substantial increase in capital spending in industry, to maintain
productivity against rising labour costs.
The trend away from manufacturing is continuing, with re-exports accounting
for almost 74 per cent of total exports in February.
Southern China has been the fastest growing economy in the world over the
past decade and as service centre for this region, Hong Kong's demand for
labour can only increase.
The government made a feeble attempt to influence inflation through interest
rates in May 1991, when it bucked the US trend by raising Hong Kong interest
rates by 1 per cent.
The result was to create the widest margin between the Hong Kong and US
dollar in the eight-year history of the pegged exchange rate. Interest rates
had to be brought down after five weeks.
The government claimed the exercise was a success, but economists pointed
out the increase in the money supply resulting from interest rate induced
capital inflows, may have offset any minor improvement.
Since interest rates have subsequently been discounted as a realistic tool
in the battle against inflation, increasing the supply of labour has to be
the most obvious choice, given the number of lesser-paid workers across the
border.
But this is rather more politically sensitive, since it raises concerns from
the trade unions over the impact of labour imports on local wage rates.
The Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong commissioned a study
on local inflation late last year and concluded 'high inflation threatens
Hong Kong's economic success and has socially divisive effects on income
distribution'. The report claims labour importation, combined with fiscal
discipline and a sensible policy on property inflation, would help address
the root of this problem.
The government has reacted positively. In January, it increased the number
of foreign workers that can be imported, from 13,000 to 25,000. This should
have a substantial impact on wage inflation.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (1):  On course for the transfer - Hong
Kong is thriving as it prepares for reversion to Chinese sovereignty in
1997. Business confidence has returned, tourism has revived and a huge
airport project is under construction.  Simon Holberton examines the mood in
the colony awaiting the arrival of a new governor in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's newly-appointed governor, arrives in the
colony in July he will find that, five years away from its reversion to
Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is thriving. Just a year ago the colony was
in the doldrums: a bitter fight with China over colonial government's plans
to build a huge airport was under way; the Gulf War had depressed tourist
arrivals; and the colony's first partially democratic elections were
looming.
Yet, in a way which underlines the skittish, manic depressive nature of the
place, business confidence is now at it highest level for three years. The
'airport problem' was solved with Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister,
going to Beijing last September to sign the deal; tourism has picked up;
and, more importantly, southern China's economic expansion, which continues
at an exceptional pace, has come to dominate local business sentiment.
In one year share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange have risen by
nearly 40 per cent; so, too, have property prices. These singular rises in
asset prices - aided, to be sure, by a lax monetary policy  - underline the
brimming optimism of Hong Kong. The colony expects to grow by more than 5
per cent in real terms this year, after a 4 per cent real expansion in 1991,
and nearly 3 per cent in 1990.
To judge by the stock market, property prices, and bilateral trade with and
investment in China, Hong Kong appears to have come to terms with its future
ruler. The economic integration of Hong Kong with China is, considering that
it has occurred just over the past 10 years, nothing short of astonishing.
This integration is most visible in the way Hong Kong's trade has changed
over the past six years. During that time Hong Kong has reverted to a role
it occupied before the Second World War: that of entrepot for China's trade
with the outside world.
Last year, Hong Kong exported goods with a value of HKDollars 765.8bn; of
these HKDollars 534.8 were 're-exports', more than 80 per cent of which
related to trade with China. But for the re-export trade, Hong Kong would
have a visible trade deficit with the rest of the world because it is
becoming more of a service area and transferring some of its manufacturing
to south China.
The change in trade flows has had a corresponding impact on the colony's
economy. Manufacturing's share of gross domestic product and employment has
fallen, while the service sector - trade processing, communications,
shipping - has grown.
This change in Hong Kong's economy could not have happened without the
historic change of course China embarked upon in 1979. Deng Xiaoping,
China's paramount leader, opened the country's door and Hong Kong's
entrepreneurs rushed in.
Today, Hong Kong's factory owners in Guangdong - the Chinese province
bordering the colony - employ between 2m and 3m workers; Hong Kong supplies
China with an estimated 40 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings by
virtue of Chinese goods flowing through the colony, earnings of mainland
companies in the colony and remittances by local people to families still in
China; and, Hong Kong is the source of 60 per cent of foreign investment in
China.
Yet, in spite of the extraordinary economic integration that has taken place
over the past decade, China, at a political level, divides Hong Kong society
and politics. Come June 30, 1997, Hong Kong will be welcomed back into the
bosom of a country which, at best, nurtures ancient attitudes to civil and
political rights, and which for millennia has been ruled by an iron fist.
Although the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future which Britain and China
signed in September 1984 and the Basic Law which the Chinese parliament
passed in April 1991 provide for the maintenance of Hong Kong's way of life
and a 'high degree of autonomy', the colony's citizens have continued to
vote with their feet, seeking the protection of foreign lands and the
passports they offer.
There have been cases of Hong Kong Chinese returning to the colony but this
is hardly surprising given that their most popular destinations - Canada,
the US and Australia - have all been suffering economic downturns. Bored and
under-employed they have returned with their insurance policy - their
passport  - tightly gripped.
They have come back to a growing economy and to a place where last
September's elections for the Legislative Council have changed the political
landscape. Politics is no longer conducted in clubs but now in full public
view. The government, in the past rarely held accountable for its decisions,
now finds it has to make a case for its policies, from bus fares to
taxation. It faces a continual barrage of complaints from elected
representatives and pressure groups.
The government finds itself caught between forces pulling in opposite
directions. On the one hand there is a group of local,
democratically-elected politicians who implicitly challenge the colonial
government's legitimacy. They, having been elected, claim a right to have
their policies taken seriously and adopted.
On the other, in a curious reversal of fortune, is Beijing. It is keen that
the government retains its position of dominance - because it wants the
post-1997 government to inherit that dominance - and snarls each time the
colonial regime appears to accede to local demands.
Somewhere in the middle is a group of largely appointed politicians,
generally of the conservative stripe, some of whom sit in the legislature
and on the governor's Executive Council, or cabinet. They wish to retain
Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalist system, are suspicious of their elected
brethren whom, they claim with some justice, wish to spend the colony's
wealth before it is earned. This group also seeks a non-confrontational
policy towards China, believing that it is better to work with the future
ruler than to antagonise it.
Mr Patten will have to chart his course carefully. Broadening political
representation in his cabinet is one not entirely risk-free way, but is an
option which if skilfully handled could repay handsome domestic dividends.
If successful it could take a lot of the rancour out of domestic politics.
In drawing the sting, however, from the domestic body politic he risks
inserting it into the tender hide of China. Beijing has already begun to
agitate on electoral reform; Mr Patten can expect more.
Beijing wants an extra seat in the 1995 legislature for its Hong Kong
business association, via one of the nine new 'functional constituencies' -
'rotten boroughs' by another name. This may prove a useful bargaining chip
for him to cash in, in the ensuing contest over electoral reform.
Yet Mr Patten's main task is to preside over the peaceful transfer of Hong
Kong to China in 1997. His key point of contact on the Chinese side will be
Mr Zhou Nan, the head of Beijing's unofficial embassy in the colony. A man
neither popular with his staff nor with the people of Hong Kong, Mr Zhou has
proved difficult for the British to deal with since his appointment after
the Tiananmen massacre of June 1989.
In the absence, however, of a replacement to match the new governor's
seniority, Mr Patten will have to deal with him as best he can. He will also
have to deal with Mr Lu Ping, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
of the State Council, and China's most senior official in charge of
day-to-day Hong Kong Affairs.
Mr Patten, with help from London, will have to give a kick-start to
proceedings within the Joint Liaison Group - the Anglo-Chinese forum in
which issues regarding the transition are decided. Although much was
achieved by the outgoing governor Lord Wilson, the list of what needs to be
done is daunting. Mr Patten will have to marshal all his considerable
political skills to achieve a breakthrough.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (7): Pilot on the
bridge - Integrated computer control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By XUELING LIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW COMPUTER simulations for the shipping industry are coming very close to
the advanced systems used by the aerospace sector. The simulations use a
complex mathematical model linked up to large screen with computer generated
images.
Standing on a 'bridge' the pilot uses a joystick or wheel to manoeuvre his
ship through a computer-generated harbour landscape projected on a 140
degree wide screen.
Tricky and sometimes dangerous situations, such as berthing a giant pleasure
cruiser or towing a 1.5m ton offshore platform, can be tried out on the
simulator in safety.
The simulations developed by the Danish Maritime Institute, which is one of
the best-known research institutes in northern Europe, are far ahead of
those usually found in navigational schools.
Normal simulators can offer only standard vessels and harbours. Using the
DMI simulation system, the pilot trains on an exact copy of the harbour and
the ship that he will be sailing, with the simulator ship reacting with all
the characteristics of the real vessel.
This is possible because of a special mathematical model which is built up
from data on the detailed properties of the specific vessel, harbour and
environment supplied by the customer and fed into the computer.
'Pilots from Singapore who came to Denmark to train on the simulator said
the computer-generated skyline and harbour of Singapore was so accurate that
it made them homesick,' says Mr Stig E. Sand, general manager of DMI's
Marine Simulations Department.
Features such as different lighting, because manoeuvring in daylight or at
dusk is very different, or changing the viewpoint, such as looking at the
bridge's side while checking on the distance to the berth during docking,
can also be built in to the simulation system.
Training of crews is only part of what the simulator can be used for. The
DMI simulator was used in studies of how a bridge over the the Great Belt in
Denmark, which is the main entrance to the Baltic Sea, would affect sea
traffic.
The waterway is used by about 18,000 north/south-going ships every year and
48,000 east/west-going ferry crossings parallel to the proposed bridge every
year. Surprisingly, tests on the simulator with pilots test-sailing ships
under the computer-generated bridge showed that the cable bridge planned
would be too narrow and dangerous for shipping traffic.
A suspension bridge is now under construction over the Great Belt which will
be the longest free-standing suspension bridge in Europe.
Detailed port studies have also been made on the DMI simulation system. For
example, at the busy Dover crossing, the simulating system was used to
develop the optimal placing of the ferry berths so ferries could sail in and
out efficiently and safely. In Singapore, which is the world's busiest
harbour, the simulator was used to evaluate the Pulau Brani terminal and the
channel configuration.
'The efficiency and safety benefits of our simulation system are obvious.
But another important advantage that is often overlooked is the
psychological impact of the simulations. They help the port authority, the
consulting harbour engineer and the navigators to see the problem more
clearly than they have ever done before so they can reach a solution which
can satisfy their conflicting interests,' explains Mr Arne Hasle Nielsen,
Director of DMI.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (8): Vessels that
need more brains and less brawn - High technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By XUELING LIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AGE of high-tech shipping has arrived. The largest reefers in the world
can now be sailed by a single man because of the clever application of
advanced computer technology.
In the old days, when labour was cheap and technology levels were more
primitive, there was little push to update the technology used in the
shipping industry. Large vessels built even in the last five years still
need a crew of 20 men or more to keep the ship sailing.
The problem is that in the wealthy industrialised world, skilled manpower is
expensive. The cost of employing a Danish seaman, compared with his
south-east Asian counterpart, will always have the European coming out the
loser. For some time, the only solution open to European shipping companies
wanting to stay competitive has been to employ low-wage crews.
According to the Danish shipyard and computer specialists behind the most
modern fleet of reefers to be built in the world, the new solution is not
more cheap brawn but more brain. Under the special technology development
project called 'Project Ship' sponsored by the Danish Ministry of Industry,
the Danish shipyard, Danyard, worked for four years with the ship automation
company Soren T. Lyngsoe (STL) and 15 specialist suppliers to build the
'simplest, most efficient vessel in the world.'
In the past, several men were needed on the ship's bridge round the clock to
keep an eye on the different functions of the vessel; checking on the route
or looking at weather forecasts.
With a research budget of DKr25m, STL created a system where navigation and
monitoring and control of machinery could be integrated in a single computer
system which could be run by one man.
In the four new reefers, which were built for the Lauritzen Shipping Group,
all important machinery is linked to the computer system which keeps check
at all times on what is taking place on the vessel. A single man stands
watch on the bridge in front of control panel which resembles an aeroplane
cockpit. Using one screen alone he can see the entire status of the vessel.
Safety levels were a vital aspect in developing the new ships because lower
manning levels are often connected with more accidents on conventional
vessels.
'In other systems the alarm is on its own and can block other pictures or
information. We put in four lines at the top of the screen which are
dedicated to alarms and watch stations which will not disappear no matter
what buttons you press by mistake,' explains Mr Niels Otto Wind-Jensen,
sales manager of Lyngsoe-Valmet Marine, which is the arm of the STL group
which specialises in marine automation and communication.
The Integrated Ship Control computer system developed by STL has four levels
of redundancy. This means that the system runs with two parallel computers.
For critical machinery there is a direct electric connection between an
operator panel and the machinery component. If a screen blacks out, the
operator can go immediately to a new station.
As a final resort, the operator is able to go down to a set of emergency
controls which are purely electrical and have no connection to electronics,
and control the machinery by physically pressing the button at the faulty
pump.
The system is also built with a 'dead man's alarm' which is set off if the
officer on watch were to collapse.
The computer notes every time a control lever is touched or if the radar is
adjusted but if there is no activity for a pre-set number of minutes an
alarm is automatically set off which, if the watchkeeping officer does not
acknowledge, triggers a fresh alarm to bring assistance.
The 16,600 dwt reefer, the 'Ditlev Lauritzen,' which was the first of the
series has proven that the new technology is not just impressive on paper
but workable in real life. After two years of test sailing, the Danish
Maritime Authority has given the nod for the crew to be cut to only six men.
'It is true that the demands on the crew are greater and you need highly
educated officers. But it is interesting to note that theexperienced
officers are just as enthusiastic about the new systems as their younger
colleagues, because once they have learnt them, they find computer
automation is a real help,' says Mr Wind-Jensen.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (5): Lindo
technology lands Saudi oil tanker order - How computer-aided design has paid
off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a remarkable day for Danish shipbuilding when the Odense Steel
Shipyard at Lindo - known locally as the Lindo Yard  - won an order to
supply three 310,00 dwt oil tankers to Saudi Arabia's Vela Inter- national.
Lindo won the order in February against competition from Asian yards,
hitherto thought to be unbeatable when it comes to this type of ship.
It was also a lesson to a group of five European yards, from Spain, Germany
and Italy, which have been working on a design project to bring back the
construction of supertankers to Europe. The consortium, however, has
estimated that European yards cannot be competitive with a subsidy of under
13 per cent of the contract price. The subsidy on the tankers being built
for Vela will, in effect, be just over 2 per cent.
The factors which enabled Lindo to win this order are, according to Kurt
Andersen, a naval architect and Lindo's managing director, a combin- ation
of high technology and well-trained employees.
Lindo is one of the most technologically advanced yards in the world. This
is partly because the yard is able to build relatively large ships in a
relatively long series, conditions which make investment in advanced
technology viable. If other Danish yards do not use such advanced technology
at all stages of the production process, it is because they do not believe
that the investment would pay off.
The most up-to-date robot cutting and welding systems are in use at Lindo,
but what makes the yard outstanding (it is not the way of managers of
companies in the A. P. Moller group to boast too openly of their
achievement, so Mr Andersen merely says that Lindo is 'one of a number of
yards which is in the front rank') is its computer-assisted design and
manufacturing system.
The ships now under construction at Lindo were designed on the computer
system. Models and conven- tional drawings have been dispensed with. The
system also handles the planning of the complete production process,
involving the acquis- ition and use of around 400,000 components per ship,
in metic- ulous detail. The system at the same time controls the cutting and
welding robots, and when the ships are being fitted out there is two-way
communic- ation between terminals on board the ship and onshore.
As an illustration of the advances which technology has brought to Lindo,
the yard handles about the same quantity of steel as it did 20 years ago,
but there are now 2,200 employees compared with 5,800 in the early 1970s. In
the past four years the yard has improved productivity by 30 per cent, and
Mr Andersen has set an annual 6 per cent improvement target after learning
that a leading Japanese competitor was out to raise productivity by 4 per
cent a year).
But technology is not everything. 'The essential thing for us is that we
have a large group of people who have shipbuilding under the skin and who
are able to work with the best available tools,' says Mr Andersen. The rapid
increase in productivity has not caused friction between the management and
the work- force. Relations have usually been good at Lindo in any event, but
in 1986 the order book was so thin that it looked as if the yard might have
to close. Without the improve- ment in productivity, which new technology
has brought with it, there might have been no jobs at all at Lindo.
Good labour relations facilitate a two-way contrib- ution to improving
product- ivity at the yard. A prog- ramme, known as 'removing the stumbling
blocks', is in process, which is designed to ensure that human resources are
used with as little waste of time and effort as possible. Removing the
stumbling blocks requires people on the workshop floor - if that is the
right expression for a shipyard  - to draw attention to and help to
eliminate the obstacles to an ever-smoother production process.
'High technology is important, but it alone does not suffice: it is people
together with high technology which do the trick,' says Mr Andersen. The
impressive advances in productivity at Lindo (and other Danish yards) have
earned an extra bonus - the respect of the politicians.
There was a tendency in the 1980s to dismiss shipbuilding as a low
technology business which no self-respecting indus- trial country need
bother itself with. 'This has changed,' says Mr Andersen. 'The politicians
no longer look down on ship- building and recognise that even in its high
technology form the industry provides a lot of jobs for well-educated
workers and engineers.'
Lindo's total order book is currently worth about DKr9bn and will keep the
yard busy until mid-1995. It is currently building a series of six 'feeder'
container vessels for A. P. Moller, seven double-hulled (not just
double-bottomed) 280,000 dwt oil tankers for Moller and three 310,000 dwt
single-hulled tankers for Vela International are the yard's next task.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (6): The largest
reefers in the world - Lauritzen's role in the 'ship of the future'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL but highly qualified crew is not only operationally the most
satisfactory; it is also the safest,' says Mr Ole Rendbaek, managing
director of the Lauritzen Group's Danyard, in Frederikshavn, Jutland.
He has a vested interest in this philosophy, as Danyard has built the four
largest and technically most advanced refrigerated cargo vessels ('reefers')
in the world for the group's shipping company, J. Lauritzen, which operates
one of the world's largest reefer fleets.
These 16,600 dwt giants, with a cargo capacity of 765,650 cubic feet, are
approved for a crew of six and sail with a crew of seven or eight. The four
reefers were the upshot of a ship development project initiated by the
Ministry for Industry back in 1987 - 'Project Ship'.
The ministry's idea was to develop high technology ships, with low manning
requirements and a high degree of manoeuvrability. The project was carried
out over three years with the participation of 22 Danish companies and two
international classification societies. The ministry contributed DKr25m to
the project and the participating companies another DKr20m.
Lauritzen took up the opportunity to participate in this 'ship of the
future' scheme, after hesitating about being the first to introduce new
technology and in spite of uncertainty about the final cost (in the event,
money was not made on the first three new reefer vessels produced at
Danyard, but the fourth, as well as subsequent ships in the not entirely
identical series now being built for other owners did produce a positive
return).
The project had an important spin-off for Frederikshavn's other yard, the
Orskov Yard, which has adapted Project Ship technology into the small
container carriers (feeders) in which it currently specialises. 'Our ships
are not quite so advanced as the Project Ship vessels,' says Mr Niels Orskov
Christensen, whose father founded the yard in 1958 and whose 29-year-old
son, trained as a naval architect, has just joined the firm. 'But we took
over a lot of knowledge from Project Ship and put it to practical use.'
The 10,000dwt container vessels from Orskov, which look remarkably imposing
when in the process of construction on stocks in the yard, sail with a
complement of 10, including cook and cabin boy. The outstanding
characteristic of the Project Ship vessels is the integrated ship control
systems, designed by electronics company Soren T. Lyngsoe, using
state-of-the-art information technology, for navigation and supervision of
the engine room and the cargo holds so that all supervision and control can
be carried out from the bridge by one person.
The ships are the 'one-man reefer,' in the language of Danyard's promotional
material: 'Total one-man control of all ship functions, port to port, is now
a reality.' Since for long periods there may be only one man on the bridge,
an alarm system is activated if no controls are touched over a predetermined
period of time, and a second alarm goes off if the first alarm yields no
response. Non-bridge functions are also designed for one-man operation, such
as the rams for opening and closing hatch covers on the main deck and
between decks, operated by a one-man remote control unit, the deployment of
pilot ladders and the mooring winches.
The Lauritzen Group, with a 1991 turnover of DKr13.1bn, net profits of
DKr420m, assets of DKr15.5bn and equity capital of DKr3.8bn, could well be
described as the complete maritime conglomerate. Mr Sven Dyrlov Madsen
Group, chief executive, refers to the group's 'synergising sisters'.
The group includes J. Lauritzen Shipping, which in addition to a large
reefer fleet operates a big fleet of small gas tankers, more than 30 bulk
carriers, five offshore drilling rigs and a small fleet of tankers. It also
incorporates DFDS, the shipping and transport group which operates passenger
and freight services on the North Sea and an extensive European onshore
haulage business. On the industrial side, in addition to Danyard, the group
includes Sabroe Refrigeration and Aalborg Ciserv. Sabroe is a specialist in
industrial refrigeration and the world's leading supplier of refrigeration
systems for reefer vessels. It was thus heavily involved in the four Project
Ship reefer vessels, for which it designed what it claims to be the market's
most sophisticated refrigeration system.
The refrigeration system is controlled by Sabroe's fully-computerised
refrigeration control and management system, which provides for complete
scanning of plant performance and hold conditions. The system is a
windows-based menu system, which means that relatively little training is
required before a person with no knowledge of computer technology is fully
competent to operate it.
New additions to the Sabroe family are Klinge Cool and Lanng &amp; Stelman,
which produce cooling systems for seaborne containers and electronic control
systems for cooler containers and marine engines. Aalborg Ciserv is a
leading producer of boilers for marine and other industrial purposes. The
group has a long tradition in the building and repair of ships. It also
provides a complete marine maintenance service, winning a long-term contract
last year to service the motors and machinery on the four new Lauritzen
reefers. The repair and maintenance service operates from 25 locations
around the world.

fleet - Profile of a shipping group leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE 36 columns under 'Moller' in the Copenhagen telephone directory,
but as far as most Danes are concerned there is only one Mr Moller. His full
name is Maersk McKinney Moller.
Mr Moller runs the A. P. Moller shipping, shipbuilding, oil, gas and
manufacturing group, which operates one of the world's largest
privately-owned merchant shipping fleets and is by far the largest Danish
industrial enterprise. The group was founded by Mr Moller's father, Arnold
Peter Moller and grandfather, Captain Peter Maersk Moller, in 1904.
Under Mr McKinney Moller's stewardship, the group has grown steadily
stronger and larger. Turnover in 1991 was DKr23.4bn, equity capital
DKr16.2bn, and assets DKr30.2bn. The market value of the group's twin parent
companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg, is about DKr39bn.
The A. P. Moller fleet, which sails under the Maersk name and is easily
recognisable by the seven-pointed star against a blue background, comprises
about 150 vessels, ranging from container ships, through crude oil tankers,
gas carriers, car carriers, roll on/roll off ships and bulk carriers, to
offshore supply and service vessels (but no passenger vessels). Maersk also
operates a fleet of about 50 oil drilling rigs and barges.
Mr Moller, who will be 79 this year, is still very much in control and takes
a detailed interest in the group's multifarious activities. However, in
1991, Mr Moller, who has no son to follow him, announced that he will be
withdrawing 'in a couple of years' and he appointed Mr Jess Soderberg as the
senior partner and his eventual successor.
Mr Moller expects and receives the complete loyalty of his staff, who
respond enthusiastically to the tough demands made upon them by the head of
the group. The country's politicians are not always so amenable to Mr
Moller's wishes.
At the start of the crisis which led to the Gulf War, while political
Denmark dithered about the extent of the country's support for the campaign
against Iraq, Mr Moller made space on ships from his fleet available to the
US government, free of charge, to ship military equipment to the Gulf. It
was his personal means of thanking the Americans for past generosity to
Europe, as well as a well-timed side-swipe at the Danish politicians for
their tardiness.
He caused a few raised eyebrows at home after declaring publicly his
uneasiness about the fact that, under the Maastricht treaty on European
union, Denmark will be sacrificing part of her hereditary sovereignty and
that 'a much larger and gradually rather aggressive Germany' will become
more dominant.
Some of those who want Denmark to vote against the ratification of the
Maastricht treaty in the referendum that the country is holding on June 2
thought they had found an unexpected ally, but Mr Moller has disappointed
them. In one of his very rare newspaper interviews, he made it clear in
April that, despite some misgivings, he recommended a 'Yes' to Maastricht.
Mr Moller has been involved in some dramatic clashes with the country's
politicians. That happened most recently when a majority in the Folketing
(parliament) in February turned down a Moller development plan for North Sea
oilfields.
In a letter to his employees, he described the two politicians responsible
for the decision as incompetent and went on: 'Both gentlemen speak
frequently, often incorrectly, and in conflict with facts of which they
should be aware.'
Nobody has ever been heard to cast doubt on Mr Moller's competence. The
group's growth over the years is the proof.
'Constant care', a phrase coined as the group's watchword by Arnold Peter
Moller, is regularly cited by Mr Moller as the watchword for everyone
working for Moller companies. But it has been supplemented by a more modern
phrase as a guide to performance: 'Zero faults.'
It is not good enough to achieve 99.9 per cent success, for, as Mr Moller
points out, with only 0.1 per cent errors the heart will still miss 32,000
beats a year.
The spirit of Mr Moller's approach to his employees is caught well by the
following quotation from his annual new year address to the staff at the
Copenhagen seafront headquarters of the group:
'It is, however, already certain that 1992 is not going to be an easy year
for us. We will have to work hard, get up early, tighten our belts and make
a contribution second to none  .. Our domestic expense base is higher than
that of most of our competitors, and it is only through greater competence,
more ingenuity, continued diligence and, dare I say - constant care  - that
we will be able to hold our own.'
It will be the surprise of the year if they don't hold their own.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (4): The new
alliances - A look at the companies' prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BASIC conditions for operating shipping under the Danish flag are good.
The main worry now is that freight markets are weak, says Mr Peter
Bjerregaard, managing director of the Danish Shipowners' Association.
Mr Bjerregaard's remarks are reflected in statements from the companies in
their 1991 annual reports.
There is, in particular, considerable excess capacity in the world container
liner business, and this has led over the past year to several new
co-operation agreements between shipping companies in an effort to
rationalise services. For the companies, rationalising means that every ship
should carry as many containers as possible.
The big Danish operators have been much involved in these new alliances. A.
P. Moller's Maersk Line entered into co-operation with the American company
Sea Land last year in the Pacific, where these two companies have a combined
market share of around 20 per cent.
The co-operation involves a container slot charter arrangement. Both
companies, however, maintain their own marketing systems and door- to-door
delivery systems. At sea, the arrangement means better utilisation of
tonnage. There are more direct sailings from the main ports, shorter transit
times (which reduces storage time), fewer port calls and co-ordinated use of
feeder services. It adds up to a better services at lower costs without
requiring new investment.
In Europe, Maersk has joined forces with P&amp;O to improve services between
Europe and the Middle East by a new service that is due to start operation
later this month. Maersk is also one of the 12 shipping companies which
recently announced a new system designed to reduce losses on North Atlantic
trade.
The East Asiatic Company, which operates 33 container vessels in liner
services in the Pacific, between Europe and south-east Asia, and between
Australia and Asian ports, also operates co-operation agreements on all its
main routes. In 1991 it established a new co-operation with Scotland's Ben
Lines under the name EACBen, for transport between Europe and south-east
Asia, in which EAC has a 66 per cent share.
The service, operated out of EAC's UK headquarters at Sevenoaks, Kent,
involves nine vessels and weekly sailings. This year a link was established
with America's Atlantic Container Lines for the transport of US freight to
south-east Asia via Europe on EACBen vessels.
While prospects for 1992 are regarded with some misgivings by the shipping
companies, their 1991 results were good, though varying considerably over
the year (some types of transport benefited from the Gulf War) and between
different types of ship.
The A. P. Moller shipping group, officially known as Tankers and Liners in
Partnership (it is a partnership between APM's twin parent companies, D/S
Svendborg and D/S 1912), reported an increase in turnover from DKr16.82bn in
1990 to DKr20.18bn in 1991. Gross profits (profits before depreciation)
increased from DKr1.71bn to DKr2.32bn. The year's investments in shipping
totalled a colossal DKr5.3bn.
APM predicted in its preliminary statement on 1991 results that this year's
results were likely to be significantly below those of last year.
The East Asiatic Company's transport division, which at the end of 1991
operated 33 container vessels, 11 product carriers and 18 bulk carriers,
increased turnover from DKr3.55bn to DKr4.50bn and gross profits from
DKr587m to DKr925m. An 'unsatisfactory' result is forecast for 1992 as a
consequence of falling freight transport from south-east Asia to Europe.
J. Lauritzen Shipping increased turnover from DKr2.35bn to DKr2.82bn and
gross profits from DKr440m to DKr591m, and the Lauritzen Group's other
transport company, DFDS, operator of Scandinavian Seaways on the North Sea,
increased turnover from DKr5.04bn to DKr5.33bn and profits (after net
financial items) from DKr111m to Dkr150m.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (2): Loans work
better than subsidies - A financing system that keeps the industry afloat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By XUELING LIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTEAD OF resorting to cash hand-outs, Denmark has chosen an innovative
form of ship financing to keep its shipbuilding industry afloat. For, unlike
their European counterparts, Danish shipyards do not receive direct cash
subsidies.
'We believe that we have the best system. In contrast to Sweden and Germany,
where funds were pumped directly into the yards, which gave them no
incentive to become more efficient, our system supports the shipping
companies and not the yards. So Danish yards have been compelled to
improve,' explains Mr Stig Kaare Lyngsie, senior vice-president of Danmarks
Skibskreditfond (DSF).
The Danish system is on offer to shipping companies of any nationality
wanting to build new ships at Danish shipyards. It works through a
combination of indexed loans, carrying a maximum rate of interest of 5.5 per
cent all told, and OECD loans at 8 per cent over eight and half years. DSF
provides financing of up to 80 per cent of the contract price, which often
is arranged through a partnership financing system that provides
hard-pressed Danish taxpayers with a tax break.
For the indexed loans the owner can choose either a rate of interest of 2.5
per cent with an indexation of a maximum 3 per cent per annum or a rate of
interest of 4 per cent with an indexation of a maximum 1.5 per cent per
annum. The indexed and OECD loans are funded by bonds issued by DSF and sold
on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
Government support enters into the picture more in the form of a guarantee
than an immediate subsidy. The government promises to make up any difference
between the indexation of the loan and the bond. This means that in periods
of low inflation, which the Danish economy has enjoyed for the last three
years, the government pays almost nothing in this guaranteed subsidy.
'We are very safe,' explains Mr Per Schnack, DSF treasurer, 'because our
capital adequacy requirements are high at 10 per cent compared with the
mortgage credit institutions which need 8 per cent. Last year we were
actually at 27 per cent.'
DSF finances nearly all commercial ship building in Denmark. Today the fund
has a portfolio of 500 ships or about 0.75 per cent of the world shipping
fleet. 'We are one of the largest pure ship financing organisations in the
world,' says Mr Lyngsie.
The fund is secured by guarantee capital of DKr300m provided by the Danish
central bank and members of the Danish Bankers' Association, the Danish
Shipowners' Association, the Association of Danish Shipbuilders and the
Danish insurance association.
The subsidy element in a ship built at a Danish yard varies with the
financing system used and the date of delivery of vessels on order. If index
loans only together with OECD loans are used to finance up to 80 per cent of
the contract price, - the maximum permitted under international agreements -
then the subsidy element may be as low as 2.2 per cent on ships for delivery
in 1994. That would depend, however, on the rate of inflation and market
rates of interest.
If partnership financing is used together with the other financing forms,
the subsidy element would then rise to the maximum 9 per cent of the
contract price as permitted by the EC at present.
The partnership system (similar to the widespread Norwegian one known as the
k/s or kommandit system) is the most frequently used financing system where
a group of small investors provides the financing for a project.
Investors buy or help finance the building of a ship and are then paid via a
bare boat charter party of the vessel. Because of the large number of
investors - it can be 5,000 or more for a single project - the partnership
schemes have been able to finance major shipping projects.
But the real attraction for investors has been a deferred payment of tax
because of the special status of these partnership systems rather than
profit made directly from the investment.
Rules to cut back the tax benefits of the schemes have gradually been
introduced by the Danish parliament which has been increasingly concerned
that the tax break was too generous. According to OECD calculations the
system is also equivalent to a subsidy of 5 to 6 per cent. That has proved
enough for Denmark's politicians to take the plunge and put an end to this
type of financing. Now, new partnership schemes can only be set up for the
building of new ships in Danish yards which must be delivered before the end
of 1995.
By 1995 government subsidised loans such as those made by DSF and the
partnership schemes will have disappeared. DSF is sanguine about its future.
'There is massive need for financing all over Europe because of the age of
the shipping fleets and we have already seen great interest in our market
loans,' says Mr Lyngsie.
The only mourners of the passing of shipping subsidies in Denmark will be
the Danish taxpayers.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (1): Yards that
stay ahead - Even without the benefits of direct cash subsidies from
government, the Danish shipbuilding industry has developed into the biggest
in Europe (and the world's third largest). Its growth has been aided by a
recovery in Denmark's merchant fleet
</HEADLINE>

DANISH shipyards have never received direct cash subsidies from the
government. When they found themselves in difficulties in the late 1970s,
and again in the mid-1980s, they had to improve their productivity or go to
the wall, which was indeed the fate of three of the larger yards.
The six big yards which are left have demonstrated their fitness for
survival. With an order book at the end of 1991 of 1.9m gross tonnes, the
Danish shipbuilding industry is the world's third largest after Japan and
Korea, and the biggest in Europe.
Nobody in the industry seems to have any regrets about Denmark's policy on
subsidies. On the other hand, they are extremely concerned by the subsidies
paid to yards in other countries.
'Denmark is a special case,' says Mr Kurt Andersen, managing director of the
A. P. Moller group's Odense Steel Shipyard, at Lindo on the island of Funen.
'This is the only country in Europe where everyone in the industry wants the
abolition of all subsidies.'
That consensus goes deep, since it is shared by the government and the
industry's trade unions, as well as the ship owners and shipyard
managements. Danish yards have, of course, been subsidised, but the
subsidies have always been rather lower than in other countries and the
subsidies have not gone directly to the yards but through the ship financing
system, which means that the yards have always had to maintain a competitive
edge in order to win orders. 'We have had to run a little faster,' as Mr
Andersen puts it.
The yard at Lindo is a good example. It is widely acknowledged as one of the
world's top-rank yards, perhaps more advanced than any of its competitors in
the use of computer-assisted design and manufacturing systems. It has
demonstrated its efficiency by the fact that it is the only yard in Europe
to have built very large crude carriers since the early 1970s.
In February this year it won an order for three tankers of about 300,000 dwt
each for Saudi Arabia's Vela International, thus showing that it is able to
compete with the Asian shipbuilders.
If the Danish shipyards are doing well at present, it is because Danish
shipping, with which the fortunes of the yards are inextricably mixed, has
also enjoyed a recovery. This, of course, has much to do with international
demand conditions, but the Danish maritime industries would not have survied
the 1980s without some sensible policy decisions.
Rising costs caused a dramatic decline in the fleet under the Danish flag in
the mid-1980s. The decline was stopped by the establishment in 1988 of the
Danish International Ship Register (DIS). Since then, the number of ships
under the Danish flag has increased by 35 per cent and employment on board
by 50 per cent, says Mr Peter Bjerregaard, managing director of the Danish
Shipowners' Association.
Personnel on board DIS-registered ships are paid a net wage or salary, ie,
they pay no income tax and receive wages approximately equal to what a gross
salary less income tax would be. DIS ships can also employ non-Danish
seafarers.
The DIS terms were strongly opposed by the Danish Seamen's Union, but
according to Mr Bjerregaard, employment of Danes on board has increased
since the DIS was established, especially of officers, but also of seamen.
The Danish Seamen's Union disputes that claim, but, says Mr Bjerregaard,
that is because owners are taking on more and more skilled workers,
typically members of the Metal Workers' Union, instead of traditional
seamen, so there are fewer members of the Seamen's Union on board.
A second important change took place when the DIS was established. Manning
scales were dropped and instead the authorities now approve manning levels
on the basis of the safety and operating requirements of the individual
ships. This means that most modern large container vessels sail with a crew
of seven or eight as opposed to 13 or 14 before. 'We operate under good and
flexible legislation,' says Mr Bjerregaard.
The maritime complex, or 'Blue Denmark' as a Ministry for Industry report
called the sector last year, has a total turnover close to DKr50bn and
employs about 35,000 people in shipping, shipbuilding and associated
manufacturing and service companies.
The Danish fleet at the beginning of this year comprised 600 vessels,
totalling 5.3m grt and 7.9m dwt. In 1991, there was a net increase in the
fleet of 43 ships totalling 285,000grt/478,000dwt. The tonnage under the
Danish flag was 1.35 per cent of the world gross tonnage.
Danish owners had on order at Danish yards on January 1, 1992, 58 ships and
one coal barge totalling 1.34m grt, plus 21 ships, two oil drilling rigs and
two barges totalling 313,000 grt at foreign yards. The orders at Danish
yards were worth about DKr11.6bn and at foreign yards DKr5.6bn. In addition,
leasing companies had on order at Danish yards 13 vessels totalling 356,000
grt, worth about DKr4.1bn.
Gross income by Danish shipping in foreign trade increased from DKr23.29bn
in 1990 to DKr27.57bn in 1991 and net income increased from DKr4.75bn to
DKr8.21bn. Net shipping earnings last year accounted for about a sixth of
Denmark's DKr50bn trade surplus.
The fleet under the Danish flag includes 42 container ships with a TEU
(20-foot container unit) capacity of 113,000, or 6.5 per cent of world
container capacity and the sixth largest container fleet. This, however,
underestimates the real size of the Danish container fleet: A. P. Moller's
Maersk Line fleet alone has a container carrying capacity of about 150,000
units; the East Asiatic Company operates 33 container vessels, with a total
capacity of 28,000 units, but only six of these vessels are under the Danish
flag.
Another jewel in the merchant fleet is the J. Lauritzen fleet of
refrigerated cargo vessels, totalling about 50 vessels, including the
world's largest, with a cargo capacity of 765,000 cubic feet, but with such
advanced computer controlled operational systems that they sail with crews
of only seven. They were built at the Lauritzen Group's Danyard shipyard at
Frederikshavn, Jutland.
The Danish shipyards had an order book worth about DKr18bn at the end of
1991, but this was increased by about DKr2.5bn when the Odense yard gained
an order to supply three 310,000 dwt tankers to Saudi Arabia's Vela
International this spring.
The yards have a turnover of about DKr7bn a year. Employment in the
shipyards is about 9,500, a third of what it was 20 years ago, but an
improvement compared with the low point of only 8,400 in 1989. Only about 10
per cent of the work carried out at the yards is repair work; the rest is
new building.
The six larger yards - Odense Steel Shipyard, Danyard, Burmeister &amp; Wain,
Svendborg Shipyard, Orskov Shipyard and Aarhus Flydedok - are able to build
a wide variety of ships.
In addition to large tankers, the Odense yard has built a large number of
container-carrying liner vessels for A. P. Moller. Bulk carriers are
Burmeister &amp; Wain's speciality. Danyard's recent programme has includes the
largest refrigerated cargo vessels (reefers) in the world, Orskov's current
programme is for smaller container carrying vessels (feeders) and Aarhus is
building chemical carriers.
The shipping and shipbuilding companies are backed up by around 100
companies with a turnover in maritime-related business of about DKr6.5bn,
according to the Industry Ministry. They include such diverse companies as
Soren T. Lyngsoe, a supplier of electronic equipment, Hempel's Marine
Paints, Aalborg Ciserv (marine boilers), Sabroe for refrigeration equipment,
MAN-B&amp;W for large two-stroke marine diesel engines, and Nordisk
Gummibaadsfabrik, which produces and supplies 80 per cent of the lifeboats
on board Danish ships as well as exporting all over the world.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Collecting: Colnaghi returns to its Gallic roots - A new
venture by the famous fine art dealer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT WEEK, ten years after opening its New York operation, the London fine
art dealer Colnaghi is opening premises in Paris in an effort to prise apart
the strangely undeveloped French market in Old Master paintings. The
company, starting off in a small ground floor and basement room next door to
the Hotel Bristol, is in the middle of the Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore and
could not be better placed. The street may have nothing like the
concentration of picture dealers found near London's Old Bond Street but
Colnaghi is next door to leading furniture dealers Didier Aaron and
Jean-Marie Rossi, within a few yards of the offices of Sotheby's and
Phillip's, and within walking distance of Christie's. Italian emigre Paul
Colnaghi founded his firm 200 years ago  - a few hundred yards due east on
the same street, as it happens - selling scientific instruments and books in
a shop called the 'Cabinet de Physique Experimentale'. The French Revolution
forced him to move to London. The director of the new gallery is
Hungarian-born Christof Lazar, who worked as an investment and merchant
banker before becoming the only non-Briton to join Colnaghi, nearly three
years ago. Since then he has worked out of his flat next to the Bristol,
testing the French market to see if it was suitable. When the Faubourg Saint
Honore premises became vacant, Colnaghi seized the opportunity.
'The fact we are opening does not mean the market is good. It's an
experiment to begin with. We are starting it in a modest way and will go on
to set up as a French company if it proves worthwhile. I'm not so sure we
would have looked for a place on somewhere like Quai Voltaire, for example.
But we would have been mad not to take these premises,' Lazar said.
In this minimum-cost operation, Lazar will have only one French employee
working with him. He will have to consult the Colnaghi Library in New York
and all restoration and framing will be carried out in the firm's workshops
in New York and London. Lazar will look after a modest stock of 30 paintings
in the ground floor room and a dozen or so drawings in the basement.
Although French collectors buy mainly French works, Colnaghi's choice will
mirror the range it sells elsewhere and comprises only about one third of
French artists along with more difficult to sell Italian and religious
subjects.
Lazar says he intends to get into the French market by getting French
clients to know Colnaghi better, while also exploring both the Latin
American clientele that passes through Paris, and Europeans.
Despite all its high-powered dealers in furniture and art objects, Paris has
never had Old Master galleries as important as Colnaghi. Galerie Marcus,
established in 1937 near the Drouot salerooms, has a large stock of charming
but not quite top quality 17th to 18th century works, much appreciated by
private collectors and museum curators, Other, formerly very active, family
firms like North European specialists Leegenhouek on the Quai Voltaire and
French 18th century dealers Galerie Cailleux, however, have been hit hard in
their ability to buy at the high prices Old Masters command on the
international market.
Unlike London or New York, Paris has no organised auction season of Old
Master paintings and dealers themselves are inconveniently scattered around
town. But the city has potential. Eric Turquin, who has worked as an auction
house expert in Old Master paintings in Paris, set up his own gallery in
1989. Bruno Meissner, the highly reputed Old Masters dealer from Zurich,
opened a showroom in the city in autumn 1990, when Dutch-born Bob Haboldt, a
former director of Colnaghi New York, also chose to set up an independent
business on the Fauborg Saint Honore.
'I was looking for a central base in Europe with easy access to countries
which have clients, rather than be isolated in London. To run a successful
Old Masters business nowadays you need to be able to buy as well as sell and
France remains one of the great sources for paintings. A lot of material in
the UK is very well known, especially to the auctioneers, who generally get
in there first. But here there are unknown works in people's sitting rooms,
misattributed or not attributed at all,' Haboldt said.
Lazar senses similar opportunities. 'We hope to find paintings privately and
not just go through auction houses. A lot of great pictures have come from
France and you still have people here who are unaware they have something of
great value on their walls. And you can make more discoveries in Drouot
salerooms than you ever could at Sotheby's or Christie's. In the meantime,
we are getting warm support from competitors, who are very happy to see an
old-established firm with an international reputation coming to Paris.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / Collecting: Youth and beauty prepare for the new season -
Italy's top art and antique fairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO IMPORTANT international art and antique fairs take place in Italy. One,
in Florence, is staged in the 15th century Palazzo Strozzi, its interior
extravagantly garlanded with flowers and studded with potted trees, its gala
opening, which hails the start of the autumn season, a crush of long titles
and short skirts.
The younger Milan Internazionale dell'Antiquariato, a biennial event and
staged in alternate years with the Palazzo Strozzi fair, takes place in the
less glamorous Halls 19 and 20 of the Milan Fair Ground.
'The venue may not be so beautiful,' says Franco Sabatelli, president of the
Italian Federation of Art Dealers (FIMA) 'but it lends itself much better to
an art fair.' More important, it is at the heart of the commercial centre of
the wealthiest region of Italy, and one of the richest in Europe.
This year sees the 11th Milan fair (on until May 10), organised by EXPO CTS
in collaboration with the Milan Chamber of Commerce and the under the
auspices of FIMA and the local society of art dealers. While last
September's Palazzo Strozzi fair squeezed 60 or so dealers into its
labyrinthine Renaissance interior, Milan is host to some 130, and offers
spacious stands. Sabatelli is not alone in believing that the quality of
exhibits will be higher than in Florence - and indeed greater than two years
ago.
There are, however, a number of Italian dealers who also believe that the
quality of dealer, as much as exhibit, is too uneven - a polite way of
saying that too many participants are simply not up to scratch. A few have
registered their dissatisfaction with the vetting procedure - always a vexed
issue at Italian art fairs - by deciding not to exhibit this year.
Noticeable at this year's event, and last year's Palazzo Strozzi fair, is
the growing internationalisation. From Antwerp, for instance, comes the
illustrious Bernard Blondeel; Galerie St Honore comes from Paris;
Lingenauber from Dusseldorf; Elvira from Madrid; Bruno Scardeoni from Lugano
and Newhouse from New York. Most of the outsiders come from Britain:
Ciancimino, S. Franses, Sarti, Bernard Shapero Rare Books and Trinity Fine
Art. That said, the fair remains essentially an Italian event. Like all
Italian fairs, no more than 15 per cent of exhibitors are non-Italian.
While the increased foreign participation is not universally popular - in
the same way that the foreign quota at Grosvenor House displeases some of
the British trade - foreign dealers bring the advantages of new blood and
fresh goods to the restricted home market. So many of Italy's 70 or so
regional fairs simply show the same deck of objects constantly reshuffled.
Moreover, it is a means of strengthening the selection of Old Master
paintings on show, inevitably the weakest part of any Italian antiques fair.
The fear of important pictures being 'notified' by the state, which would
prevent them from being legally exported, discourages dealers from
reproducing them in catalogues or taking them to fairs. Milan and its newly
prosperous hinterland no doubt also account for the predominance at the fair
of decorative and not too demanding pictures, and of expensive Lombard
furniture.
This wide-ranging fair also embraces silver and jewellery, Oriental and
tribal art, ceramics and glass, 19th century painting, the 20th century,
sculpture and objets d'art, and carpets, tapestries and textiles. A number
of dealers are taking particular trouble this year, perhaps because Italian
collectors are at last beginning to feel the effects of world recession or
are alarmed to realise that they are among the few still actively buying
works of art.
Individual stands reflect the range of most dealers in Italy where
specialisation is relatively unusual. That diversity characterises the
stands of a number of the foreign exhibitors, too. Trinity Fine Art, for
instance, which has offices in London and Milan but its two directors in
Rome and Paris, offers a wide selection of paintings, from a gold ground
altarpiece by Cosimo Rosselli to a lively bozetto by Valerio Castello, some
30 Old Master drawings, an Algardi bronze, Roman silver by Antonio Arrighi,
plus terracottas and maiolica.
Sarti is there for the first time to show that the company sells far more
than just furniture or Italian works of art. Its 48 sq m space is filled
with 15th and 16th century Italian paintings, plus the likes of a Russian
malachite candelabrum, a Spanish marble tempieto table centre, as well as
furniture, French, Dutch, Irish and Italian. While Scardeoni brings Garofalo
and Mola, the French and German dealers field Northern masters. A particular
strength of the fair is its textiles, with Blondeel and S. Franses joining
the ranks of Battilossi, Halevim and Eskenazi. For some reason, northern
Italy boasts a disproportionate number of the world's top carpet dealers.
Even here there is diversification. Blondeel, for example, also brings
Limoges enamels; Eskenazi, alongside a group of rare 18th century Eastern
Turkistan rugs and classical 16th century carpets, Chinese Tang Dynasty
figures and 17th century Japanese sculpture.
In 1990, the Milan fair brought in some 40,000 visitors, and more are
expected this year. Added attractions are a series of lectures on
collecting, with contributions from such respected art historians as Alvar
Gonzalez-Palacios and Alfonso Perez Sanchez, and guided tours (some in
English) on specific aspects of collecting. The fair exhibition documents
the recent restoration of the 13th century frescoes in the Capitolino of
Sant'Ambrogio in Milan which was sponsored by FIMA. The restored frescoes
will be unveiled on May 6.

FT  02 MAY 92 / England's knight of the square table: Leonard Barden and
David Spanier chart the rise of England's king Dominic Lawson was in his

THE appeal of chess is as much physical as cerebral. It is a game of
emotion, face to face, an outlet for aggression, which briefly satisfies
winners but can totally unnerve and exhaust losers. Chess as a kind of
mathematical struggle, a formalised and ritual logic, is an illusion.
Nigel Short sees chess as a violent, often painful battle of egos. Short
used to have a detached technical view of the game but that altered with
exposure to the bruising personality war among top grandmasters.
Anatoly Karpov, who Short beat in Linares, held the title for 10 years from
1975-85, between the abdication of the eccentric American Bobby Fischer and
the crowning of the present champion, Garry Kasparov. He had never lost a
match except for his epics with Kasparov.
Short demolished him, in spite of losing the first game when Karpov
contemptuously refuted the Briton's carefully prepared gambit. Short
attributed his success to keeping calm and not rushing his response. Instead
he adopted the same Fabian tactics which Kasparov had used against Karpov in
the Moscow winter of 1984-5, grinding out a series of marathon endings.
Karpov is 40, his stamina suspect; and it showed in game six when he gave
away his queen, the worst blunder of his career.
Short has already campaigned for the world title for almost a decade. Twice
previously he was eliminated in earlier rounds, but this time he has
survived a qualification tournament in Manila, plus elimination matches in
London and Brussels. He now meets Jan Timman of the Netherlands, the other
finalist to emerge from the candidates matches. Their series, inevitably at
Linares, will determine who becomes the first Westerner since Fischer to
challenge for the title. Garry Kasparov's title defence will be staged in
Los Angeles in August 1993.
The revival of British chess is a phenomenon which in any outdoor sport
would have attracted banner headlines. It began in 1976 when two English
players, Tony Miles and Raymond Keene, achieved the grandmaster title, which
guarantees entry and an appearance fee for top events. The GM title has
since been diminished by inflation, but at the time it implied performing
well against the top Soviets. Miles is still competing around the world,
while Keene is a prolific writer on the game - his latest book,
appropriately, is Nigel Short World Chess Challenger (Batsford Pounds
10.99).
Grandmasters need to be competitive sportsmen who can also absorb a vast
bank of knowledge of opening moves and strategies. The state-supported
Russians had full-time coaches, specialist journals and card indexes on
potential rivals. In the 1970s Batsford and Pergamon began to publish books
with new analysis, while former British champion Bob Wade built a research
library at his Blackheath home which proved a match for the analysts in
Moscow's Central Chess Club on Gogolevsky Boulevard.
The global chess boom after the Fischer-Spassky match, together with
Britain's early successes, inspired a talented generation of teenagers. In
the 1930s the Russians had given their rising stars special coaching, games
against visiting champions, and early opportunities. The British Chess
Federation decided to follow suit, and to start still younger at primary
age. Teams of children competed in weekend congresses and played as an
England junior squad against the Soviets who visited the annual Hastings
congress. The significant year was 1976 when Viktor Korchnoi, then the world
No 2, met a team of 30 boys and girls at a school in Islington. Eight of
them later became GMs or masters, but after a six-hour battle Korchnoi lost
just one game, to his youngest opponent, Nigel Short. The BCF published
world age ratings showing Short as the world's best 10-year-old; the
corresponding list for age 12 had at the top the Soviet junior champion,
Gary Kasparov.
The Russians have always been good at chess. Its popularity goes back 1,000
years in Russian culture, and before the Revolution the great tournament of
St Petersburg 1914 was held under court patronage. Both Marx and Lenin were
enthusiastic though very amateurish players. One of Lenin's aides was
Nikolai Krylenko, who believed chess could be a cheap character-building
influence in the revolutionary struggle.
The result was official encouragement and state funding for chess at all
levels of society. World champions Emanuel Lasker, Jose Capablanca and Max
Euwe visited the USSR, competed in great tournaments at Moscow and
Leningrad, but had to struggle against massed teams of schoolboys.
Capablanca was persuaded to visit Leningrad on his free day at the Moscow
1925 tournament, and lost to the city's star junior Mikhail Botvinnik, 14.
Next day, back in Moscow, the exhausted Capa lost to his Soviet opponent.
Chess gamesmanship is an ancient art.
In 1948, Botvinnik himself became world champion, the leader of what
propagandists called the Soviet school of chess which has dominated
international play ever since with a brief interruption by Bobby Fischer.
The USSR Chess Federation received a generous budget from the sports
authorities and grandmasters were among the elite permitted overseas travel.
Compared with this, the UK chess boom of the 1970s operated on a shoestring.
Yet while better financed sports failed to produce a home-grown champion,
chess discovered an entire generation. There was basic state support for
some overseas travel, but the seed money came from Jim Slater and Lloyds
Bank. Slater, the financier, added Pounds 50,000 to the 1972 world title
prize fund which persuaded Fischer to play Spassky. Then he offered Pounds
15,000 for the first five British grandmasters, a stimulus to Miles, Keene,
and their contemporaries. Finally he provided funds to help juniors. Shown
some photos of rising talents in 1974, Slater pointed to Short's picture and
said 'That's the boy to beat the Russians.'
When Slater had to drop out in the late 1970s, Lloyds Bank took over. By now
the rising talents were in their teens, needing opportunities to qualify for
GM and master titles or official world rankings. The first Lloyds Bank
sponsorship was a clock match where Karpov met the ten best juniors, led by
Short. Four later became GMs. The Lloyds Bank Masters, held annually since
1977, gives up to 50 boys and girls the chance for adult international
honours. By 1980 Britain had more juniors with world rankings than any other
nation.
In 1978 England beat the Russians for the world under-26 championship. Miles
and Keene were followed as GMs into the national team by the Oxbridge
mathematicians John Nunn, Jonathan Mestel and Jon Speelman. This coincided
with sponsorship from private bankers Duncan Lawrie, which provided the
national team with fees, hotel facilities, and Wade's secret files on
rivals. The effect was dramatic. At the 1970 olympics England were outside
the top 20. During the 1980s, with Short an established member, the England
team won the silver medal at the chess Olympics three times in succession,
finishing tantalisingly close to the Soviet team in Dubai in 1986. The
Russians only scraped home when Kasparov won the last game to finish.
The break-up of the Soviet Union means that many strong GMs will represent
Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and the Ukraine. The opportunity is
growing for England to emerge as world champions.
Short grew up in the mining town of Atherton, near Bolton, where his father
David was in public relations and his mother a teacher. Both grandfathers
worked down the pit. Nigel learnt the game at six, insisting on being taught
after watching his father teach his older brother. He improved quickly and
his father asked if Nigel could join the local Bolton club. The secretary
replied that there were no facilities for such a young child, who anyway
ought to be in bed by the time the meetings started. David's response was to
advertise in the local paper and start his own chess club in Atherton, which
later defeated its more eminent rival.
Short rose rapidly. At 12, he was the youngest British championship
finalist. At 14, he tied for the title; at 15, he was runner-up to Kasparov
for the world under-20 championship. There was a hiatus in his mid-teens
when he unwillingly completed his formal education at Bolton School. Even so
he became the world's youngest international master while emerging with
indifferent O-levels. By 19, he was the youngest GM; from then on, the
targets were Kasparov and Karpov.
Short is endowed with a resilient temperament, essential for surviving in a
highly competitive sport. Superficially, he takes a light-hearted, slightly
cynical, approach, and likes to give players schoolboy nicknames - Korky,
Noggy and so on. High calibre opponents are 'smart', to win is to 'give a
guy a good tonking'. But he strives to be objective about his games and has
political ambitions (once SLD, now Conservative) for when he eventually
retires from chess. His wife and the recent birth of a baby daughter have
given his life a stability that many professional chess players never find
time for.
As the world title has become more of a realistic ambition and less of a
dream, Short has become harder. He makes no secret of the fact that he not
only wants to win, he wants to crush his opponent,the same attitude and
phraseology which Fischer used in his heyday. He said in a recent interview
with Dominic Lawson: 'I am getting much more pleasure out of humiliating a
guy. It is a warped sense of pleasure . . . you play these people over the
years - the Soviets particularly, and they are warped, twisted and mean.
They won't spare you any pain. So when you get a chance to inflict suffering
on them, I get a kick out of it. So now I like to play positions when I can
torture the guy slowly. Slowly is important.'
Short could become the UK's first chess millionaire. Although there is
little money in chess on the weekend tournament circuit, at the top the
prizes are huge. The purse for the Karpov match was SFr150,000, (Pounds
55,760) divided five-eights and three-eights between winner and loser. In
the final round of the Candidates, he can expect twice as much. The winner
will also collect the Dollars 1m a German computer company is offering for
the first player from outside the old USSR to reach the final. The prize
fund for the final will be Dollars 4m.
Short said: 'It's true players have to scrimp and save in chess these days.
But once you reach the last eight of the world championship, the money
becomes pretty interesting.' Kasparov himself is reputed to charge a Pounds
20,000 fee for anything from a simultaneous exhibition to a computer
endorsement.
Short's success will have a positive impact on chess in Britain but it will
not in itself reverse a trend of diminishing sponsorship and tournament
opportunities.
'I am not sure that chess administrators can do anything fundamentally to
change things,' Short says. 'I don't think the economic climate is to blame.
We had a boom in the '80s and the number of tournaments did not increase.'
What chess in Britain needs is a winning personality at the top: in Nigel
Short it has found one.

FT  02 MAY 92 / England's knight of the square table: When Nigel Short beat
former world champion Anatoly Karpov inthe world chess semi-final this week
Dominic Lawson was in his corner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FIVE minutes before Nigel Short's decisive final game of his match against
the former world champion Anatoly Karpov, I was sitting with him and his
second, the Czech-born Grandmaster Lubosh Kavalek. My own stomach was aching
with tension - and I was not the one about to face destiny or despair
against a Russian with a machete for a brain.
The world now knows that Short won, to clinch the world championship
candidates' semi-final by six games to four. This put him within one match
of meeting Garry Kasparov for the world title. But at the time Short was
only too well aware that a win for Karpov in the last game would have tied
the match and forced a speed chess playoff - the chess equivalent of the
penalty shoot out.
Short had his own way of coping with the tension: he grabbed his
much-travelled guitar and began playing a punk song: 'I don't care.' When he
stopped Kavalek said 'OK. Good. Now you must have piss.' I agreed with
Kavalek that Nigel did need to have a moment of peace before the most
important game of his life. 'No, not peace, piss,' said Short's trainer. He
was simply trying to make sure that his charge did not waste time emptying
his bladder during the game.
In fact this routine was unvarying before every game. Similarly Kavalek  -
who was Bobby Fischer's second in the 1972 match against Boris Spassky -
always woke Nigel at 11.30am - and the three of us would take the same walk
around the town of Linares singing the same song: 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen
go out in the midday sun'. Then we would eat lunch at exactly 1.30pm in the
same restaurant, and Nigel would order the same dishes every day. Dinner
would also be governed by routine. The point, as Short explained, was this:
if every aspect of normal life is deliberately made mind-numbingly
predictable then all thought and capacity to absorb stress is devoted to
chess, and Nigel could sit down at the board against Karpov with the maximum
of mental energy.
This all sounds very rational, but routine is closely linked to
superstition, and in my experience superstition is endemic among chess
grandmasters. Nigel's took relatively mild forms: certain tables in
restaurants were thought to be lucky, because we had sat at them before a
victory. Karpov's superstition amounted almost to a disease: he did not like
to play on a Monday; he would not wash his hair unless he lost a game -
fortunately he lost quite a lot in the match. And for the final game Karpov
wore an immaculate blue suit that he only wears during particularly vital
games. He calls it his 'executioner's suit', according to his great rival,
the world champion Garry Kasparov.
Nigel's biggest concession to irrationality was, on our walks, to enter the
main Catholic church in Linares, and, in spite of his professed atheism, to
offer up a prayer before each game. Once I asked him what he was praying
for. 'At first I said 'please God let me win this game', but then I realised
that was asking too much. So instead I asked 'God, please give me the
strength to beat this shit-head'.'
Yet science rather than religion was at the heart of Nigel's victory. The
depth of his preparation astounded not just me but also the grandmaster
pundits. Kavalek's tennis player forearms were constantly bulging with the
strain of carrying around a 120 megabyte computer containing - so he told me
 -1m games of chess. Karpov's games were logged in fantastic detail,
evaluating his successes and failures by openings, middle game positions and
endings. At a switch of a button Karpov's games would appear on the plasma
screen of the computer in diagram form.
Nigel would spend hours glued to the flickering screen absorbing the
complete history of his opponents's chess psyche at enormous speed: each
game would last about a minute, with Nigel only occasionally muttering to
Kavalek 'Let me see that in slow motion' and the pieces began to move at a
speed which my naked eye, at least, could follow.
The benefits of this were seen especially clearly in the wonderful eighth
game, the best of the match, and one of the most brilliant ever at this
level. Nigel took only an hour for all his moves. Karpov had used that much
time by his 18th move, at which point Nigel, so he later told me, was still
in the analysis prepared for the game.
This is not to say that Nigel's success is all about hard work. He is a
chess genius, as we all suspected when at 12 he beat a former 12-times
British champion, Jonathan Penrose. But last week he has proved what we also
know from other sporting champions: that genius without discipline is only
an elegant way of finishing second.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Italians sail into yachting history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIANS' fanatical interest in sport has suddenly expanded from a narrow
diet of cycling and football to embrace sailing.
Yesterday the yacht, Il Moro di Venezia, and its crew became instant
national heroes as they beat New Zealand off San Diego and won the right to
challenge the Americans for the America's Cup. This is the first time in
almost 30 years a European challenger has reached the run-off of the top
event in yachting.
In little more than a week, Italy has been swept by 'Moromania' as growing
numbers of people have stayed up late to watch the final eliminating races
live from California. At a time when Italy appears rudderless, without
either a government or a president, the sight of a perfectly synchronised
crew steering Il Moro triumphantly through the Pacific swell has offered a
welcome contrast.
But this is not the only reason for the country's fascination with the
America's Cup. Behind the Italian challenge lies a boardroom drama involving
the divorce last July of Mr Raul Gardini from Ferruzzi, which he built up in
the 1980s to become one of the leading private companies in Italy.
A keen sailor, Mr Gardini decided in September 1988 to go for the America's
Cup, creating Tencara, a tailor-made company to supervise research,
development and construction of Il Moro at a new boatyard near Venice.
Tencara was able to draw on the far-flung resources of Ferruzzi,
particularly its special fibres and advanced materials divisions controlled
by its chemicals subsidiary, Montedison.
When the Ferruzzi family finally decided to part with Mr Gardini's
flamboyant services, the America's Cup project was a potential
embarrassment. At least Dollars 22m (Pounds 12.4m) had been spent amid
considerable publicity. Four models of Il Moro were already in the water at
San Diego where the 100-strong team had established a base in October 1990.
The fifth, which won against New Zealand this week, was already launched.
After much soul searching, Ferruzzi decided to continue but with a Dollars
40m cap on boatyard costs and a slimming down of the original project. The
decision was justified by hopes of profitable spin-offs from a combination
of high-profile publicity and the heavy investment in state-of-the-art yacht
design and construction facilities.
Mr Gardini, who remained in charge of the project, thus retained an
industrial link with Ferruzzi-Montedison (his wife is a Ferruzzi).
Il Moro has been pioneering special light carbon skins for the 27-metre hull
and has developed a distinctive dark-coloured carbon fibre-based material
for the sails. Almost 75 per cent of the vessel is made from advanced
composite materials and only 1 per cent wood. Only 20 years ago, America's
Cup challengers were 50 per cent aluminium and 30 per cent wood.
Never before in the America's Cup has a competitor been sponsor, designer
and builder. With competition costs and advertising, plus some overruns, the
cup will cost the Italians close to Dollars 100m - almost four times as much
as any other competitor.
Success has brought the two camps together and eased the pain of last July's
divorce which saw Mr Gardini and his wife obtain a Dollars 386m pay-off.
There is only one jarring note to nationalist euphoria over Il Moro: the
skipper, Paul Cayard, is an American. But then that famous son of Genoa,
Christopher Columbus, hired himself to the Spanish 500 years ago when the
Italians failed to back his bid to discover the Americas.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Mitterrand criticises Peugeot for cutting jobs while in
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand launched a sharp attack yesterday on
job losses at Peugeot, the country's largest privately owned company, in a
move likely to worry others seeking to cut their workforces.
His outburst came in a Labour Day radio interview arguing for strong
European social policies. It was triggered by a row between Mr Jacques
Calvet, Peugeot's chairman, and Mrs Martine Aubry, labour minister, over
funding of early retirement pensions for the latest Peugeot workers to lose
their jobs.
It is 'intolerable to think that big companies . . . live by bragging over
the billions they make every year, and at the same time shed their
personnel', said Mr Mitterrand. 'Let them at least arrange things so that
their employees receive their share of the profits . . . One just asks them
to be fair and to consider that their profits are not simply theirs,' but
that profits 'belong to all those who take part in the business - the
workers, the employees, the others'.
Mr Mitterrand's remarks are a reminder of his distaste for excessive
profit-making and recall his attack two years ago on stock market investors,
whom he criticised for making money while they slept. That speech was widely
held responsible for sending equity prices into a slide. The bourse was
closed yesterday for the May Day holiday and reopens on Monday.
The attack also underlines Mr Mitterrand's uneasiness about job losses
generally. Unemployment, now at 2.8m, or just under 10 per cent, stubbornly
refuses to recede, contributing to the decline in the ruling Socialists'
popularity and their humiliation in the March regional elections.
The government has all the less sympathy for Peugeot's arguments only a
month after it reported a FFr5.5bn (Pounds 550m) net profit for 1991,
although this was a 40 per cent decline.
Mr Calvet argues that the carmaker needs to lose 1,427 jobs at one of its
main plants as an essential part of its strategy to match Japanese
productivity.
The detail of the dispute is over how much Peugeot should contribute to the
pensions of 685 workers, who have been scheduled for early retirement by the
company, and how much should come from the government.
The government says it will accept the early retirements only if Peugeot
pays a larger share of the cost than it was expecting.
The row is as much financial as moral, because the government is facing a
large deficit on its social security budget and wants to restrain early
retirements or make companies pay a larger share of the bill.

GERMANY'S trade unions stepped up their verbal onslaught on the embattled

workers promised 'rougher and broader' strike action next week.
Airports, including those at Berlin and Dusseldorf, are expected to be hit
by the strikes from Monday. There could be power cuts on the railways and
interruption in television broadcasting, the oTV public sector union warned.
At the same time, leading members of the government were locked in
recriminations after last week's upheavals, following the announcement of
the impending resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as foreign minister.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Bavarian Christian
Social Union (CSU), accused Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister and
vice-chancellor-designate from the rival Free Democrats (FDP), of 'impudence
and effrontery' in calling for more budget cuts.
Mr Waigel was responding to a 16-page document from Mr Mollemann, warning of
huge new budget costs from German unification, and calling for cuts in areas
such as social spending.
Mr Waigel said in a letter that it was 'shameless' because the economics
ministry was itself asking for a budget increase in 1993 well above the
government's 2.5 per cent ceiling on growth.
He did not reply to Mr Mollemann's budget calculations, that unification
will cost an additional DM50bn up to 1995, because the figures are still
being considered inside the finance ministry.
In spite of the divisions in the coalition, there is no sign of central
government willingness to negotiate with the public sector unions. The
unions have been on strike for almost a week, seeking a 9.5 per cent pay
rise. There are indications, however, that the states and local authorities
led by the Social Democrats want to make a new offer.
May Day rallies across the country brought support from other key union
leaders. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, of the 4m-strong IG-Metall engineering
workers' union, pledged his own workers' readiness to strike further in
support of a separate pay claim.
'If the employers want a fight, then they will get a fight,' Mr Steinkuhler
said.
Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, militant leader of the oTV, said the public sector
strike, which has already brought public transport and refuse disposal in
most major towns and cities to a standstill, would now get 'broader and
rougher'. So far the employers have refused to go beyond a 4.8 per cent
offer.

FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK at record high as
Nikkei weakens

<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE and index-related selling weighed on the Nikkei average, which
closed marginally lower in light trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell 87.32 to 17,303.39, down 1.36 per cent on the
week, after moving within a narrow range of 17,273.38 and 17,453.73. Volume
rose slightly from 220m shares to 230m.
Advances led declines by 527 to 427 with 182 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks lost 4.05 to 1,313.41. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.67 to 1,065.96.
Trading centred on short-term activity by dealers, while share prices also
fluctuated on light arbitrage-related activity prompted by a weak futures
market.
Institutional investors remained absent ahead of the long weekend. The
market will be closed on Monday and Tuesday.
Some market participants are hopeful that the market will turn up after the
Golden Week holidays. An official at Nippon Life, the leading life assurer,
said the downside was limited and there could be a slight increase in
volume. However, the spate of corporate earnings announcements starting in
the middle of this month could depress sentiment.
NEC, the electronics company, fell Y40 to Y1,000 after reports that it would
announce its second downward earnings revision for the fiscal year ended
March. Other electronic blue chip issues were also lower, with Hitachi down
Y11 to Y839 and Matsushita Electric Industrial retreating Y30 to Y1,410.
Dealers sought speculative favourites. Bio-technology related issues firmed,
with Okamoto up Y40 to Y1,210 and Morinaga Milk adding Y14 to Y784. Plant
engineering companies were traded on reports of an increase in projects in
south-east Asia. Chiyoda rose Y90 to Y1,570 and JGC added Y30 to Y1,930.
Housing companies advanced as some investors were encouraged by the slowing
decline in housing starts figures. Housing starts for March fell only 2.3
per cent from the same month last year, adding to hipes that the residential
property market was close to touching the bottom. Taisei Prefab Construction
added Y80 to Y2,340 and National House Industrial rose Y30 to Y1,700.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 40.08 to 19,846.64 in volume of 12.4m
shares. Small-lot buying by foreign investors and investment trust funds
supported the index. Short-term trading lifted Shimano, the bicycle maker,
by Y70 to Y1,370.
Roundup
HONG KONG recorded an all-time high while other Pacific Rim markets were
mixed. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Manila were closed.
HONG KONG rose over 2 per cent ahead of a half-point cut in interest rates
which was announced after the market had closed. The Hang Seng index closed
up 114.64 at 5,484.21 for a 2.8 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was
HKDollars 3.56bn from HKDollars 2.78bn.
Comments by a Chinese official that the country's economic reforms will
continue also improved sentiment.
Commercial and industrial stocks led the day's gains, followed by property
shares. Hutchison and Cheung Kong both rose 80 cents to HKDollars 17.40 and
HKDollars 23.40 respectively. Among the banks HSBC put on HKDollars 1.06 to
HKDollars 41.50 while Hang Seng Bank improved HKDollars 1 to HKDollars
43.25.
AUSTRALIA continued to advance. The All Ordinaries index finished up 9.3 at
1,665.2, a 3.4 per cent rise on the week.
Turnover was ADollars 270m.
Among blue chips showing gains, News Corp rose 38 cents to ADollars 19.58
and BTR Nylex gained 11 cents to ADollars 2.78.
Banks remained strong: National Australia Bank rose 8 cents to ADollars
7.76, the Commonwealth was up 4 cents at HKDollars 7.60 and ANZ gained 4
cents to ADollars 4.48.
Coles Myer rose 8 cents to ADollars 12.48 following an analysts meeting
earlier in the week.
NEW ZEALAND was weaker as Telecom came under pressure. The NZSE-40 index
fell 3.44 to 1,460.60 for a gain of 0.36 per cent on the week. Turnover was
NZDollars 31.6m.
Telecom closed down 6 cents to NZDollars 1.96, the first time it has closed
below NZDollars 2 since its privatisation last July.
Fletcher Challenge continued to perform well, gaining 3 cents to NZDollars
3.50. Fay Richwhite eased 5 cents to 62 cents on news that New Zealand's
America's Cup challenger had been eliminated from the series. The shares had
climbed to NZDollars 1.20 earlier this year.
Independent Newspapers, in which News Corp of Australia has a 49 per cent
stake, advanced 5 cents to NZDollars 4.70. Brierley Investments closed 1
cent stronger at 96 cents.
Resources stocks were not as strong: BHP rose 2 cents to ADollars 14.20
while CRA fell 4 cents to ADollars 14.34.
SEOUL rose on buying of large-capitalisation shares. The composite index
gained 4.40 to 620.37, up 4.1 per cent on the week. Turnover was Won446.5bn
from Won491.1bn.
Hyundai Motor rose Won800 to Won19,200 while Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries
closed Won800 higher at Won18,100.
TAIWAN was stronger. The weighted index added 48.99 to 4,545.18, for a gain
of 1.45 per cent over the week. Turnover was TDollars 19.3bn from TDollars
15.9bn.
The paper sector led the rise, followed by textile, financial, food and
cement shares.
Taiwan Cement rose 50 cents to TDollars 66.50, Hua Nan Commercial Bank
climbed TDollars 1 to TDollars 103 and President Enterprises rose TDollars 1
to TDollars 51.50.

Wall Street
A ROUND of sell programmes pushed US stocks lower yesterday, but trading was
quiet as traders headed home early amid fears that violence would spill on
to the streets of New York in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, writes
Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 23.03 to close at 3,336.09, with only
177.4m shares changing hands on the big board. Declining issues led
advancing by 908 to 775. Among other market indices, the broadly-based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 2.43 at 412.52 while the Nasdaq composite slid
0.54 to 578.14. On Thursday, the Dow advanced 25.94 to 3,359.12.
There was some uneasiness following an unexpectedly weak purchasing
managers' index report for April, which fell to 51.3 per cent from 54.1 per
cent in March. The market had expected the April index to advance to about
55 per cent.
Shares in Chrysler continued to lose ground in the wake of the company's
unsatisfactory first quarter results. The stock closed at Dollars 18 1/2 ,
down Dollars  7/8 , after falling Dollars  3/8 a day earlier. Ford lost
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 1/8 , after sliding Dollars  3/8 on Thursday and
General Motors eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 , on top of its previous
Dollars  7/8 decline.
In the pharmaceutical sector, Glaxo Holdings' American depositary receipts
fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 25 1/2 . The stock had advanced Dollars  7/8
on Thursday on news that the oral form of the company's migraine drug had
received UK regulatory approval. Among other drug company issues, Merck slid
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 143 3/4 , American Home Products added Dollars 1 to
Dollars 78 1/4 and Pfizer lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 70 7/8 .
The sell-off in insurance issues continued, with General Re, the biggest US
reinsurance group, sliding Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 78 5/8 , Cigna losing
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 51, Travelers off Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 and
Aetna down Dollars 1 to Dollars 41 5/8 . Only American International Group
bucked the trend, adding Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 83 1/2 . AIG's strong first
quarter profits were overshadowed by General Re's warning that its
underwriting results would probably be disappointing for the remainder of
the year.
Among entertainment stocks, Walt Disney firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 146
after PaineWebber upgraded its rating. Paramount Communications slipped
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 in thin trading.
In the secondary market, Western Capital Investment soared Dollars 3 5/8 to
Dollars 13 1/4 on news that the Colorado-based Savings &amp; Loan had agreed to
be acquired by First Bank System for Dollars 150m. On the big board, First
Bank fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 25 3/4 .
Trading was also active in Synergen, which climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
39 after the company posted a first quarter loss of 2 cents a share against
14 cents a year earlier.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed. The TSE-300 composite index added 1.5 to close
at 3357.06 in volume of 23.3m shares. Among active issues, Morgan Financial
Corp was flat at CDollars 0.055, Rogers class B gained CDollars  1/8 to
CDollars 13 5/8 , Encor eased CDollars 0.01 to CDollars 0.33 and Corona

FT  02 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling slips on rates moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was very thin trading on the foreign exchange markets yesterday as
most of continental Europe was on holiday, writes James Blitz. But sterling
captured most attention as the Bank of England signalled through its money
market operations that it may wish to see a cut in UK base rates by at least
 1/4 per cent next week.
As news filtered out from the UK markets in the morning, sterling dipped to
DM2.9291, although one economist said that this had more to do with traders
speculating on another hike in German interest rates rather than uncertainty
in the pound. In the afternoon, the pound picked up again but still finished
at DM2.9300, down from a previous close of DM2.9325.
According to Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at Citibank in London,
the prospect of a  1/4 per cent drop in UK interest rates would strengthen
the pound rather than weaken it. 'A drop of  1/4 per cent would show that
large base rate movements will not be a prominent part of UK policy in
future,' he said. In the past, the British government has regularly
signalled adjustments in rates by a half or one per cent.
The dollar continued to suffer on European markets after America's political
and economic difficulties had lost the currency some ground in overnight
trading.
Asian markets had pushed the dollar down to DM1.6430 on rumours that the
Federal Reserve was about to ease interest rate policy still further.
By yesterday afternoon in London, the dollar was skidding further to test
support around DM1.6400, as the market chose to focus on the negative
aspects of yesterday's economic data from the US.
Both March construction spending and the Michigan University consumer
confidence survey showed stronger growth. But they were outweighed in the
market's eyes by a surprising fall of 51.3 in the National Purchasing
Management survey in April as opposed to 54.1 in March.
By the time trading had opened in New York, confidence in the dollar was
being tested further by news of the continuing riots in Los Angeles. One
currency dealer in San Francisco said that the rioting was adding to the
negative dollar sentiment now. Investors, he said, were concerned about
potential financial pressure on municipal and federal governments from the
costs of rebuilding and from tourism loss.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6410, down over a pfennig from its
previous close of DM1.6525. In early trading in New York, it was testing the
downside of DM1.6355. The US currency was also down on the yen, closing in
London at Y132.70, down Y133.35 on its previous close.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates shaved again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England yesterday gave what many dealers regarded as a clear
signal that it wants to see a  1/4 per cent cut in UK base rates next week.
For the third successive day, it shaved dealing rates at the long end of the
discount market, triggering corresponding falls in rates in the interbank
and futures market.
In early operations, the Bank bought bills in Bands-3 and -4 at rates 1/16
lower than those agreed the previous day. It bought Pounds 2m of Band-3
bills at 10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent and Pounds 8m of Band-4 bills at 9 31/32 -
15/16 per cent. On the two previous days, the Bank had also reduced the
rates at which it bought bills at the long end.
After posting a shortage of Pounds 2.01bn in the morning, the Bank also
bought Pounds 2bn of repurchase agreements for resale to the market on 8 May
at 10 13/32 per cent.
Rates in the interbank market fell as the market discounted a  1/4 per cent
cut in base rates next week. The rates for 3-month money fell from 10 1/2 -
3/8 per cent on Thursday to 10 3/8 - 1/4 yesterday. Rates for overnight
money also fell to 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent.
In the futures market, the June Short sterling contract ended at around
89.86 having closed on Thursday at around 89.72. That closing figure
suggests that the market believes that interest rates in June will be at
around 10.14 per cent.
Many dealers saw these reductions yesterday as a process by which the Bank
might get the foreign exchange market accustomed to a gradual decline in
trading rates in the UK's money markets. 'The authorities are leading money
rates gradually down while at the same time keeping an eye on sterling's
position within the ERM,' said one senior dealer at a discount house.
However, some city economists believe that a cut in rates next week may be a
risk. 'In Germany, the Bundesbank may increase rates in the near term and
there is speculation that they will do so at the Bundesbank General Council
meeting next Thursday,' said one city economist. There is also a fear that
the retail price index in Britain due out on May 15 may show a rise in
inflation, undermining any interest rate cut.
In Frankfurt, the money market was closed yesterday for the May day holiday.

Dollars 1bn.
It will manage the fund, raise cash from institutional investors through a

FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Trainer loses most from Classic fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILURE this week of Classic Thoroughbreds, the Irish bloodstock
company, is likely to cost Mr Vincent O'Brien, the renowned trainer, up to
IPounds 2m, or Pounds 1.82m sterling.
Other big losers in an experiment to bring the arts of stock market punting
to the turf include: Mr Michael Smurfit, the packaging magnate; Mr Robert
Sangster, the Vernons Pools boss; and millionaire Mr John Magnier. All are
estimated to have lost up to IPounds 1.4m each.
But it is perhaps Mr O'Brien, trainer of racing legends such as Nijinsky and
The Minstrel, who will suffer the most. Not only did he hold the biggest
stake, at 12 per cent, but Classic's failure to produce more than one big
winner from its stables will leave the 75-year-old trainer's reputation
somewhat diminished.
When the company was put out to pasture this week, it offered its 4,500
shareholders a mere 5.25p per share, compared to the 1987 flotation price of
30p.
It was almost prophetic that Classic chose October 1987 for the flotation
date. Since then, a series of troubles have beset its horses.
The first year saw its best horse put down, while in 1989 Classic Fame and
Saratogan failed to live up to their early promise and a virus swept through
the stables. The following years were little better and punters' patience
was tried further by the dramatic collapse in bloodstock prices.
Classic's one claim to the big winner's circle in 4 1/2 years was its 40 per
cent stake in Royal Academy.
This week, the only horse left in the once lively stable of 47 was Classic
Music. Mr Michael Walsh, company secretary, reassured callers that the
lonely racer would not be put down, but rather put out to stud where it
could pay its way until a buyer comes along.

FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Bank is left on the sideline as two
suitors make secret approaches - The battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH clearing banks are no longer a species protected by the Bank of
England. To be more precise, they cannot rely on the Bank to protect them
from a takeover, although the Bank will intervene in a bank's affairs if
there is a threat to its depositors' interests.
This is one lesson from the remarkable story of the secret negotiations
between Midland Bank and Lloyds Bank and between Midland and Hongkong Bank,
which took place between December last year and March. These negotiations
culminated last week in Lloyds' announcement that it was proposing to pay
Pounds 3.6bn to acquire Midland, as a challenge to a formal Pounds 3.3bn bid
made a fortnight earlier by Hongkong Bank.
Midland published part of this story in a letter sent to its shareholders
yesterday. The Financial Times has pieced together the rest of the narrative
from interviews with bankers involved in the talks.
Lloyds had been doing research on the logic of buying Midland since early
last year. It did not tell Midland it was interested in buying it until the
end of November.
Detailed discussions on a possible deal then started immediately between Mr
Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds and architect of the takeover plan,
and Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive.
Mr Pearse and Mr Pitman are both lifetime career bankers, with more than 80
years experience of the industry between them. Mr Pearse, at 58, is two
years younger than Mr Pitman.
Though they are involved in the first takeover battle between two English
clearers, their careers are a paradigm of the British banking tradition.
They became bank clerks straight from school, stayed loyal to their
employers for decades and gradually rose through the ranks.
They are both strong-willed individuals and tough negotiators. Their main
financial advisers are also renowned in the City for being extremely
determined. Mr Pitman is being helped by Mr Andrew Tuckey, the chairman of
merchant bank Baring Brothers Mr Derek Higgs, a managing director at
merchant bank SG Warburg and dubbed by competitors as the 'bruiser', is Mr
Pearse's aide.
Mr Pearse was disappointed that Lloyds had made the approach. In the
previous March, he had moved banks for the first and only time in his
career. The Bank of England had asked him to leave Barclays, where he had
been finance director, to become chief executive of Midland, which was then
at the low point of its fortunes.
Sir Kit McMahon, Midland's then chairman, had hoped to merge his bank with
the Hongkong Bank. But the deal had not materialised at the end of 1990, as
had been hoped. At the same time, a collapse in Midland's profits forced it
to become the first clearer since the 1930's to cut its dividend.
The Bank felt it would be sensible for Sir Kit to retire early. Mr Pearse
took on his executive duties and Sir Peter Walters, former chairman of BP,
became Midland's chairman.
Mr Pearse had hoped to do the job for at least two years. By the end of 1991
he had become convinced that measures taken to boost productivity were
paying off and that it had a future as an independent organisation.
Mr Pearse felt it was 'slightly odd' - as he now says - that Lloyds should
have made its approach. The day after Lloyds made contact, he went to see Mr
Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England.
Mr George said he was powerless to intervene. The competition authorities
might question whether it was in the public interest for two big banks to
combine. But this was not an issue to be considered by the Bank.
There was no suggestion that depositors' funds would be at risk as a result
of a link-up between the two. Mr George said the Bank could not interfere in
a question which was more properly the concern of both banks' shareholders.
Lloyds wanted access to Midland's detailed accounts, to carry out a process
known as 'due diligence' to assess what it should offer to acquire Midland's
shares. However, Midland felt it would be premature to give this information
to a competitor.
Instead, Mr Pearse said Lloyds would have to wait until after its financial
results were published, on February 27, before making its offer.
Negotiations on the structure of the deal continued, with Mr Pearse finding
time for very little else. At the end of the year it was agreed that Lloyds
would make a formal bid proposal to Midland's board of directors at a
meeting fixed for March 13.
In the meantime, Mr Pearse had to face the delicate task of informing
Hongkong Bank what was going on. Since the end of 1987, Hongkong Bank has
owned just under 15 per cent of Midland's shares and it has two of its own
directors on the Midland Board, including Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's
chairman.
In mid-January, Mr Pearse told Mr Purves that it had received a takeover
approach, though he did not mention that the potential bidder was Lloyds. He
told him so that Hongkong Bank could decide whether it wanted to sell its
stake or revive its takeover plans.
In early February, Hongkong Bank said it did not want to sell its shares. Mr
Purves said he would be interested in a takeover, but detailed discussions
could not take place until after its financial results were published on
March 10.
Midland slotted Hongkong Bank into the same negotiating timetable as Lloyds.
Hongkong Bank was also told it would have to make its formal proposal to the
Midland board on March 13.
At the same time, Midland informed Lloyds it had a rival suitor. Both Lloyds
and Hongkong Bank were able to deduce the identity of their challeng-er.
Midland asked both of them to give a commitment that if Midland's board did
not opt for their bid that they would not make a hostile takeover attempt.
Lloyds listened but did not give any response to this request.
Then in early March came a display of brinkmanship by Lloyds. On Sunday
March 1, Mr Pitman hinted to Mr Pearse that it might make an announcement
that it was in takeover talks with Midland.
However, it was only the following evening that Lloyds told Midland it was
definitely going to make an announcement and that this would be made at 8am
the following day. Lloyds had even made arrangements for its chairman, Sir
Jeremy Morse, to be interviewed by the BBC Today Programme using its radio
car.
Then at 9pm Mr Pitman rang Mr Pearse. Lloyds' reason for making the
announcement, Mr Pitman said, was that it was concerned there might be a
leak, since so many bankers and their advisers knew what was going on.
Mr Pearse was not happy. He was concerned that the disclosure would be very
unsettling to the banks' customers and its employees. That would be a price
worth paying if Lloyds was making a firm bid which stood a good chance of
success.
But at that stage, all Lloyds would have said was that it was interested in
bidding. It would not have put a price on Midland's shares. Nor was there
was much indication about whether the competition authorities would have
allowed the takeover to take place.
Mr Pearse did not know whether Lloyds was planning to say what role he would
have in the combined business at the press conference it was organising for
the following day. But he pointed out to Mr Pitman that there was a clause
in his contract with Midland that allowed him to quit, giving just six
months notice, if control of Midland changed hands.
Mr Pearse then spent a frantic two hours telephoning Midland's directors to
tell them that the announcement was imminent. He then went to a small
appartment in the City owned by Midland for directors' use. There he
telephone Mr George, to tell him what was coming.
However, Mr George was ahead of him. He informed Mr Pearse that Lloyds had
changed its mind about making the announcement. Mr Pearse had to telephone
all his fellow directors again.
Banking sources say that the Bank of England put no pressure on Lloyds to
change its mind on making the announcement. Although the Bank may have
shared Midland's anxiety that an announcement by Lloyds at this stage was
not playing by Marquess of Queensbury rules, it did not feel it could
intervene.
However, Mr Pitman interpreted Mr Pearse's statement about his contract as a
direct threat to resign - and he felt that would be damaging to his bank's
chances of success. He therefore cancelled the announcement and agreed to
adhere to the original negotiating schedule.
Both banks continued to work on the detailed proposals which they would put
to Midland's board on Friday March 13. At the same time, Mr Pearse, with the
help of the accountants Price Waterhouse and his finance director, Mr
Richard Delbridge, was preparing a separate presentation on the merits of
Midland remaining independent.
The fateful Friday morning arrived and Midland's directors gathered for the
meeting. However, they did not meet at the bank's distinguished
Lutyens-designed headquarters at Poultry in the City. To pre-empt rumours
which would inevitably be stimulated by the arrival at Poultry of Sir Jeremy
Morse, Lloyds' chairman, and Mr Pitman, they went to Warburg's offices.
Lloyds said it would be prepared to offer one of its shares, then worth
400p, for each Midland share (its subsequent proposal is to offer one share
plus 30p). The commercial rationale for the deal was to cut costs by closing
1,100 of the combined banks' branches. Lloyds expected that at least as many
of its branches would be closed as Midlands' - possibly more.
Mr Pitman also also said that Midland's directors would be given the lion's
share of the top jobs in the combined business. Mr Pitman would be chief
executive. But Sir Peter Walters would be the chairman. Mr Pearse would be
deputy chief executive, in line probably to succeed Mr Pitman. Mr Delbridge
would be finance director and Mr Brian Goldthorpe, Midland's deputy chief
executive, would be in charge of the corporate banking department.
For the presentation by Hongkong Bank, the Midland directors returned to
Poultry. Mr Purves is a regular visitor to Midland, so his presence at the
headquarters that day would not have aroused outsiders's suspicions.
He offered one share and 80p of loan stock for each Midland share (in its
later published offer, it proposed one share and 100p of loan stock). At the
time, that was worth slightly more than the Lloyds' offer at 410p, but the
difference was not great enough to be the determining factor in Lloyds'
board's choice.
There was a third presentation, by Mr Delbridge, on the merits of Midland
remaining independent. The Price Waterhouse study concluded that there was
no doubt about Midland's ability to survive and prosper on its own. But
shareholders could not expect their shares to yield a return - in the form
of a share price rise and dividends - equal to what Hongkong Bank and Lloyds
were offering for some considerable time, perhaps two years. So Midland's
board felt they could not vote for independence.
In the end, they plumped for Hongkong Bank for two reasons. They preferred
Hongkong Bank's promise to invest in the business and expand it. But they
were also concerned that Lloyds' takeover would be blocked by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority. They had taken advice
on this issue from a leading barrister, an economist and from other legal
advisers.
At 6pm the Midland board returned to Warburgs and delivered the news to a
disappointed Mr Pitman. Sir Jeremy was not present.
The secret war was now over. On March 17 Midland and Hongkong Bank announced
their nuptials. Last Tuesday Lloyds said it wanted to break up the
engagement and carry off Midland itself. Battle had commenced.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Wounds run deep: America's racial tensions are at snapping
point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I recently visited Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's mountainside home in
Charlottesville, Virginia. The graceful villa commands fine views over
rolling countryside and seems the perfect shrine for a statesman steeped in
the liberal values of the 18th century Enlightenment.
Reading the glossy brochure for visitors, however, I came across the curious
word 'dependencies'. Every plantation, it said, needed 'dependencies to
provide the many services required for the operation of the house and farm'.
The word, of course, is a euphemism for slaves: even today Americans recoil
from the thought that Jefferson, the man who declared all men equal, lived
in such glorious style only because he owned scores of slaves.
The US has come a long way since Jefferson's day. But the hypocrisy of
America's founding fathers has many echoes in modern society. The nation's
laws proclaim the equality of the races, but every economic and social
indicator points to continuing inequality. For America's black community,
the acquittal by an all-white jury of the white policemen in the Rodney King
trial is just the latest proof that the 'system' is rigged. Nobody believes
that a jury would have reached the same verdict had Mr King been white.
In trying to understand continuing racial tension, it is crucial to recall
that serious attempts to address black grievances are extremely recent. The
Civil War of 1861-65 ended official slavery, but blacks remained effectively
subjugated in the south for another century. It is astonishing to think that
as recently as the early 1960s, during the presidency of John F Kennedy,
blacks in the south faced South African-style apartheid.
Many of the parents of the Los Angeles rioters will vividly remember the
days when southern blacks were prevented from voting, obliged to eat at
segregated lunch counters and forced to sit at the back of buses. In parts
of the US, therefore, this is the first generation of blacks to enjoy the
basic civil rights long taken for granted elsewhere in the civilised world.
Blacks have made economic and social progress since riots shook US cities in
the late 1960s. The most encouraging sign is the emergence of a black middle
class. The War on Poverty launched by President Lyndon Johnson helped
enormously - not because Great Society social programmes worked particularly
well but because they involved a huge expansion of federal and state
government payrolls. Blacks gained many of the new white-collar positions,
thus entering the middle class.
In the private sector, blacks have made less progress. They represent 12 per
cent of the population but account for only 3 per cent of physicians and
lawyers. Nearly a quarter of buses, however, are driven by blacks.
The relative success of a minority of blacks, moreover, masks daunting
problems for the majority. The median household income of blacks is still
only about 60 per cent that of whites - almost exactly the same ratio as in
1967. The proportion below the official poverty line has fallen from about
42 per cent to 32 per cent, but this is still nearly three times the white
poverty rate.
Economic deprivation on its own might be manageable. But despondency about
the condition of black America reflects a growing awareness that blacks form
the core of nearly every social problem.
Take the issue of family breakdown. Some 56 per cent of black families are
headed by single women, three times the ratio for whites.
The figures on crime are no less gloomy. Blacks account for 45 per cent of
the total prison population - four times the ratio suggested by their
relative share of the population. They account for 43 per cent of arrests
for rape, 55 per cent of solved murders and 69 per cent of reported
robberies. More young blacks are in jail, or on parole or probation than in
college.
These crime figures perhaps help explain why the white suburban jury in the
Rodney King case decided that any level of violence by the police is
justified. Middle-class whites long ago fled the cities for the suburbs. But
obsessional concern for personal security continues to rule the lives of
many affluent whites, who appear oblivious to the fact that the bulk of
crime is black on black.
The perplexing problem is how to move forward. In a recent Washington Post
poll, 85 per cent of blacks and 79 per cent of whites rejected the view that
discrimination against blacks was no longer a problem. Liberals respond by
demanding that greater efforts be made to 'atone' for the original sin of
slavery. They support affirmative action programmes which encourage colleges
and companies to take blacks even when better qualified whites have applied.
Some middle-class blacks, however, have begun to challenge the wisdom of
such policies. An eloquent exposition of the new conservatism is given in
The Character of Our Race, a recent collection of essays by Mr Shelby
Steele, a black literature professor. Mr Steele's life history parallels
that of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Like Mr Justice Thomas, he
overcame extreme deprivation, achieved academic and professional success and
then found himself estranged from his own race.
His argument is that the civil rights movement of the 1960s was essential in
its day: without confrontation, blacks might never have achieved full civil
liberties. However, aggressive 'we are not treated properly' attitudes are
no longer appropriate, because they solidify blacks in their historical role
as victim. In the view of Mr Steele and other black conservatives, most
formal obstacles to black advancement have been removed. The main problem
now is blacks' own lack of faith in themselves. They must thus accept more
personal responsibility for their own advancement and stop relying on
collective action by pressure groups.
There is some truth in his message, harsh though it will sound to most ears.
One of the striking findings of sociologists is that most blacks do not
believe the 'American dream' applies to them. In schools black children who
study hard are jeered at by their peers for 'acting white'. Perversely, it
seems that you can prove yourself in many poor black neighbourhoods only by
failing.
The public sector could be less passive. It would make sense to pursue
policies that favour not a particular race but compensate for big and
growing differences in income and wealth. The most effective policy for
influencing life chances is education. In a nation that purports to provide
equal educational opportunities for all, it is indefensible that the funding
of schools should be so heavily dependent on the wealth of particular
neighbourhoods.
Violence in response to what appears a travesty of justice cannot be
justified. But the fires in Los Angeles must be seen, at least in part, as a
reproach to mainstream America. President George Bush talks of a kinder,
gentler America, but the truth is that the nation has yet to heal wounds
that date from the earliest days of the republic.

Sir, Gerald Cadogan is to be congratulated for his report, 'Theatres in old

new heritage minister, take an interest in making more of the remains of the
original Globe Playhouse.
Not only should the minister take active steps to reveal more of the site to
provide greater archaeological research but he, and all others concerned,
should plan for future public access and, thus, put in place for common

Sir, You carried a small news story, 'Investment performance' (April 29)
which regurgitated performance details from institutional managers gathered
by Equity International.
It should come as no surprise to a newspaper of your standing that
institutional managers did not out-perform the FT Actuaries All Share Index
last year. The principal reason for this was that we were not investing to
beat that index.
Pension funds are correctly and wisely broadly diversified with investment
in many parts of the world.
Over the long term, this is expected to reduce risk and enhance performance.
We do not put all our eggs in one basket and I am most surprised that you

FT  02 MAY 92 / Nationwide miners' strike urged over closure of pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to close Markham Main, the South Yorkshire pit troubled by
an industrial dispute, the corporation said yesterday.
The announcement came after a two-month dispute between British Coal and the
National Union of Mineworkers over the future of the pit at Armthorpe near
Doncaster, which employs 700 men.
Mr Arthur Scargill, union president, called yesterday for a national miners'
strike in protest at the planned closure.
'I think it's an appalling decision, but not a surprising one,' he said on
BBC radio.
The dispute started in March after British Coal announced plans to employ
private contractors at the mine. Miners at the pit resisted the move and
last month won backing from the Yorkshire area of the NUM, which voted by a
narrow majority to stage selective strikes in protest at the introduction of
contractors.
Using contractors was part of a plan to improve profitability at Markham
Main, which has lost Pounds 30m over the past five years. British Coal said
the pit had lost a further Pounds 1.8m since the dispute began.
British Coal argued that only specialised contractors could do the
tunnelling work required to switch from the traditional mining methods to a
more advanced system. The Yorkshire area of the NUM condemned British Coal's
decision, and was angered by the fact that the corporation's representatives
walked out of a meeting with unions immediately after announcing the
closure.
'The entire meeting, with all its grave consequences for the workforce at
Armthorpe, lasted no more than four minutes,' said Mr Ken Homer, general
secretary of the Yorkshire area.
The closure will leave the Yorkshire area with just 21 pits compared with
the 50 it once had. Markham Main will be the first pit to close this
financial year, while 15 closed in 1991-92.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Workers of the world disunite over holidays: Richard Evans
explains why the standardised Eurobreak is still some time away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLAINT is no longer heard that the UK has fewer bank holidays than
anyone else, although this remains broadly true. The difficulty now is to
cope with those we have.
The arcane formula used by the churches to fix the date of Easter has
produced a closer bunching of public holidays than usual this spring. Having
just returned from the late Easter break we are about to celebrate May Day,
and then the spring bank holiday - previously Whitsun - will loom at the end
of the month.
The main culprit is the May Day holiday, which was introduced in 1978 by Mr
Michael Foot, then employment secretary, in honour of organised labour and
the right to strike. It remains a mystery why so symbolic a gesture to
proletarian internationalism survived the Thatcher years.
An added confusion over May Day is that while it is celebrated throughout
most of continental Europe on May 1, in the UK the holiday is on the first
Monday after May 1.
There could now be a revival of pressure for a more even distribution of
holidays, either with the introduction of another bank holiday in the autumn
or the transfer of one from the spring.
This idea is backed by the tourism and leisure industries as it would extend
the holiday season and encourage people to take an autumn break in Britain.
The suggestion of an October bank holiday was put forward last August by a
National Economic Development Council committee, but it was received coolly
by both the government and the Confederation of British Industry. The
Department of Employment said an extra day could damage the country's
competitiveness. The CBI said employers favoured the unbroken production run
between late August and Christmas.
The government's reluctance to transfer or to add another bank holiday may
surprise other European countries, which manage to remain competitive while
having more public holidays.
The world league table is headed by Egypt with 22 public holidays and Brazil
with 19. Even the dedicated workaholics of Hong Kong have 16, followed by
Belgium with 13 1/2 , Japan, Spain, Portugal and Greece with 13, Luxembourg
with 12, Germany, France and Italy with 11, the US and Denmark 10, and
Holland and the Irish Republic nine.
The UK has a modest eight, but here again there is confusion, with
variations between England and Wales on one hand and Scotland on the other.
In England and Wales there are New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday,
May Day, the spring bank holiday, August bank holiday (the last Monday in
August), Christmas Day and Boxing Day.
The Scots dispense with Boxing Day and Easter Monday but add January 2 to
their Hogmanay break, and generally take the August bank holiday on the
first Monday of the month. Some Scottish cities pick differing dates for
their spring and August breaks, however, which make them less disruptive
nationally.
The phenomenon of bank holidays started to relieve the tedious grind of
desk-bound clerks. There were as many as 40, usually in honour of saints,
until 1830, when they were pruned to 18. In 1834 there was a further
reduction to four - Good Friday, May 1, November 1 and Christmas Day.
The idea of holidays by order was then formalised by Lubbock's Act of 1871,
which enabled the banks to shut on four days a year without suffering any
penalty for not paying bills which fell due on those days.
Different traditions developed across Europe, and harmonisation of public
holidays has not been seriously discussed within the European Community.
The problems are apparent: For example, VE Day commemorating the end of the
Second World War is a holiday in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, but
not in Germany. Similarly, some religious holidays are rated very
differently in Roman Catholic and Protestant countries.
Whatever else might be standardised, the era of the Euroholiday is not yet
in sight.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Spens allowed to re-open fight for an acquittal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD SPENS, former corporate finance managing director at Henry Ansbacher,
the merchant bank, was yesterday given leave to challenge the refusal to
grant him a formal acquittal after the collapse of the second Guinness
trial.
A High Court judge granted him leave to seek a judicial review of Mr Justice
Henry's refusal to give him a formal not-guilty verdict on the fraud and
false accounting charges he had faced, or to order that the Pounds 400,000
costs Lord Spens incurred before being granted legal aid should be paid out
of public funds. However, Mr Justice Macpherson said that, while he
recognised that Lord Spens felt a sense of injustice and had an arguable
case, 'I do not wish it to be thought that I believe there is much strength
in this case.'
The second Guinness trial was halted in February because of psychiatrists'
concern that Lord Spens' co-defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate
finance director of the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, could no longer
adequately defend himself.
Further prosecution of Mr Seelig was halted by a nolle prosequi, a decision
which stayed proceedings against him but was not an acquittal. The Serious
Fraud Office decided that in the circumstances, it would not be fair to
proceed further against Lord Spens.
In March Mr Justice Henry said that an order staying proceedings against
Lord Spens, with the charges left on the file, not to be proceeded with
without the court's permission, would put him in the same position as Mr
Seelig.
Refusing to grant Lord Spens a costs order, Mr Justice Henry said he had
brought the prosecution on himself by not consulting the Takeover Panel when
asked by Mr Seelig to recruit share supporters for Guinness under
indemnities against loss.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Injunction granted in publishing dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE increasingly bitter row over the future of Duckworth, the publisher,
moved to the High Court yesterday, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, a 26 per cent shareholder in Duckworth,
obtained injunctions against Mr Colin Haycraft, Duckworth chairman, and Mr
Stephen Hill of Lica Development Capital, an industrial development capital
group.
It is believed the injunctions prevent Mr Haycraft and Mr Hill talking to
potential investors or talking about the issues involved to the press.
In March, Mr Haycraft was sacked as chairman and chief executive of
Duckworth and locked out of the company's premises.
He returned last month after raising enough money to exercise an option that
took his shareholding in the company to 70 per cent.
In recent weeks Mr Haycraft has been trying to find new investors to secure
the future of the company.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Benn backs Scargill defiance
</HEADLINE>

   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY BENN yesterday joined Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National
Union of Mineworkers, in calling on trade unionists to defy new laws planned
by the government.
Mr Benn, a member of Labour's national executive and MP for Chesterfield,
ridiculed suggestions that the party could become electable only by severing
its links with the union movement. He warned that such a course would result
in it disappearing like the Social Democratic party.
Mr Scargill, insisting that the Labour movement could not passively wait
another five years for the end of Conservative rule, said: 'Workers have to
defy Tory government legislation, and if that lands us in jail so be it.'
Mr Scargill forecast that if union leaders did not give a positive response
by opposing legislation to impose cooling-off periods and other measures to
deter strikes, the workers themselves would 'take it into their own hands to
take action'.
He stressed that he would support 'anything and everything' to stop the coal
industry being privatised.
Mr Benn, who contended that Labour would have won the election if it had
fully backed the campaign against poll tax, said he would support strikes in
defence of rights entrenched in the United Nations charter through the
International Labour Organisation.
The revised statutory code of practice on picketing, which seeks to deter
unions disciplining any of their members who cross a picket line, took
effect yesterday.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Jordan talks of single union for engineers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL Jordan, president of the new merged Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, yesterday raised the prospect of a further merger to
create a single union for blue and white-collar workers in the engineering
industry.
Speaking after the first executive meeting of the AEEU, formed out of the
AEU engineers and the EETPU electricians, he said that 'any rational person'
could see that it made sense to talk about common links with MSF, the
technical and finance union which organises most white-collar workers in the
industry.
Mr Jordan added: 'It is not really sensible to talk about this just after
the current merger but anyone can see that it makes sense in the
longer-term.'
The AEEU will set up a white-collar section and seek to compete with the MSF
but it is unlikely to have much success. The AEEU also gave notice that it
would be using its new influence to force structural reform of the Trades
Union Congress.
Assuming that the old EETPU section of the union is allowed back into the
TUC, from which it was expelled in 1988, the joint union will be paying an
annual affiliation fee to the TUC of Pounds 1.2m.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the new union, said yesterday: 'Quite
frankly we don't get value for money.' And a senior EETPU official said that
some sign of 'serious reform' at the TUC would be useful before the members
vote on whether the new union should be affiliated or not.
Reformers such as Mr Laird and Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general
union, have been arguing that with the advent of the 'super-unions' the TUC
should radically concentrate its activities into areas like European
lobbying, health and safety, and training.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Civil servants are urged to reject deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 1,000 civil servants could get pay rises of about 25 per cent
under the terms of an offer made yesterday to middle-ranking staff. The
NUCPS civil-service union said it would recommend that members reject the
offer, worth 4.5 per cent on the pay bill.
A significant minority of staff would receive only the 4.1 per cent
cost-of-living element. Most would receive around 4.4 per cent, including
performance-related pay.
The substantial rises for 1,000 civil servants - all executive officers at
the bottom of their grades, earning between Pounds 7,854 and Pounds 8,180 -
include compensation for loss of annual increases guaranteed under the
current pay structure.
The union will debate whether to call for an industrial action ballot,
including strikes, at its conference on May 12.

FT  02 MAY 92 / SNP will conduct 'referendum' on home rule today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN unofficial 'referendum' on Scotland's constitutional future is being
staged today by the Scottish National party in what it sees as a
familiarisation exercise for the full-scale referendum it hopes will be
staged next year.
People will be asked to fill in a ballot paper offering a choice between the
status quo, independence within the EC, and a devolved parliament. Choices
will be numbered under a preferential voting system.
'We want to show how straightforward it will be to let the Scottish people
decide their future,' said Dr Allan Macartney, SNP vice-president, 'and
demonstrate the huge level of enthusiasm for the referendum initiative.' The
party would not claim that the sample was representative.
The SNP is using next Thursday's district council elections to campaign for
a referendum. SNP-controlled district councils - Angus in Tayside is
currently the only one - will be committed to trying to organise a
referendum next year through the local-government machine, but funded from
outside sources.
Other opposition parties and Scotland United, a fringe cross-party anti-Tory
grouping, also want a referendum.
'Scots have a second chance on May 7 to vote in the light of the general
election campaign,' Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said yesterday.
But the SNP's 'second chance' approach has been condemned by Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who said in Edinburgh on Thursday:
'They are basically saying that April 9 was not good enough - 'you gave us
the wrong answer, go out there and try again'. I think that is an outrage.'
Local elections should be about local government, he said.
The SNP has been encouraged by a System Three opinion poll in yesterday's
Herald newspaper showing the party's support at 25 per cent, three points
more than its vote in the general election. Labour was down three points on
the election outcome at 36 per cent, the Tories were up one point at 26 per
cent and the Liberal Democrats down one at 12 per cent.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Unions' political links may take cover after race for top
job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour leadership election has accelerated the timetable for reform of
the link between the unions and the party, with the argument increasingly
between a complete break and a radical scaling down of the union role.
Union leaders have privately been scathing about the way the Labour party
has organised the election, and party leaders have been equally critical of
the way some union leaders have been publicly toying with their electoral
college votes and refusing to ballot their members.
The strained personal relations between Labour leaders and union bosses
bodes well for the radical reformers. But the largest group of union leaders
 -currently embracing the GMB general union, the AEEU engineering and
electricians' union and the Nupe public-service union - want to hang on to
some institutional link.
Even the most conservative voices in the party and the unions accept that
the unions must be removed from the electoral college that will elect the
new leader. Mr Bill Morris, leader of the leftwing TGWU general workers'
union, does not want to go much further than that and he says that
abolishing the block vote at the party conference could be 'disastrous'. But
he, along with the left in the unions, is outnumbered by the more bold
reformers.
Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, said yesterday that the 'block vote
has to go'. Like Mr John Edmonds at the GMB and Mr Tom Sawyer at Nupe, Mr
Jordan wants to keep some formal link but he says it must be one that
'prevents the unions dictating policy to the Labour party and a possible
Labour government'.
The unions operate at several levels in the party - through the block vote
at conference, through the electoral college, through seats on the National
Executive Committee and reserved places on the policy review bodies, and
through influence in local constituency parties.
Quite what leaders such as Mr Jordan and Mr Edmonds do want to hold on to,
beyond the excitement of wielding some power in an important political
party, is not clear although Mr Edmonds stresses moving the unions'
'common-sense' influence on party policy to local level away from the glare
of the party conference.
The number of people supporting a complete divorce is quite small and
largely restricted to those in the Labour camp, but the argument that union
influence could remain strong but indirect - through shared values and
through continued financial backing - could gain supporters over the coming
months.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Smoke lifts from leadership battlefield: The conduct of the
contest offers some pointers to Labour's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMOKE of battle cleared sufficiently over Labour's leadership contest
yesterday to allow a quick survey of the terrain over which the 10-week
campaign will be fought.
Binoculars, however, may come in handy. Even for Labour activists, the
policy differences between Mr Bryan Gould and Mr John Smith are ultimately
slight, if interestingly nuanced.
To the public at large - suffering acute political indigestion from the
general election and now faced with the May 7 council polls - the whole
business is as irrelevant and remote as the next general election.
Yet the narrow parameters of debate are themselves an important factor in
the way Labour addresses its future.
The distinctions between soft-left (arguably Mr Gould's label) and old-right
(Mr Smith's) are increasingly smudged by eight years of Kinnockite
orthodoxy. Furthermore, as one senior official at party headquarters put it
yesterday, the days of dream tickets and delicately balanced cabinets have
gone.
'In 1983, the Kinnock-Hattersley ticket was essential to build a bridge
across a sharply divided party,' he said. 'Neil's legacy is that no such
bridges are necessary any more.'
But is that strictly true? A colleague added perceptively that it was
unfortunate that the rules had not allowed Mr Ken Livingstone to run in the
electoral college on July 18. He could have served as a a focal point for
the old hard left, some of whom will undoubtedly use the party's autumn
conference to blame Labour's fourth successive election defeat on an
insufficiently socialist programme.
For Mr Smith's camp, this week was more successful than last, when his
faltering opening declaration attracted widespread jibes that 'Smithism'
represented little more than more of the same.
In his 'manifesto' launch on Thursday, the shadow chancellor demonstrated
that his Highland hill-climbing had left him sufficiently supple-jointed to
straddle part of the Gould agenda as well as a portion of the political
centre ground to Labour's right.
By endorsing the goal of full employment - an aspiration of totemic
importance to the left - while calling for a deep-rooted re-evaluation of
tax policy and universal benefits, Mr Smith broadened his base
magisterially. His proposed Commission on Social Justice, open to
independent advice and Liberal Democrats alike, also held a door ajar to
advocates of a full-blown realignment of the left.
At the same time, Mr Smith threw a portion of his famous caution to the wind
by restating his commitment to a redistributionist tax policy. This time,
however, it is sensibly qualified by the notion that this must be limited to
what political resources - voters' tolerance - allow.
By taking a harder line on the unions' role in the party, implicitly hinting
that the block vote should go, he also stole some of his rival's political
clothes.
Mr Gould will need enormous energies to turn the leadership race around. His
camp claims strong support in the constituencies and is jubilant at the TGWU
general union's refusal to offer Mr Smith a clear commitment, but the odds
remain firmly against Mr Gould.
In the deputy leadership race, there is everything to play for. Mr Gould's
claim for support will be fuelled by many union general secretaries' fears
that a vote for both Mr Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett looks too much like a
stitch-up - an impression that could accelerate the assault on the block
vote.
The so-called 'sweet-and-sour' Smith-Gould package is already attracting
endorsement from leftwingers who believe a little creative friction could
generate the imaginative leaps Labour so desperately needs.
But the 64 MPs' nominations for Mr John Prescott, who yesterday won the
backing of the New Statesman, indicate that he is by no means an also-ran.
Blunt-speaking, blue-collar and Yorkshire are credentials that still carry
weight, even in the new model Labour party.
For those still agonising over the election defeat, the danger of the
leadership contest is that it postpones a post-mortem that will ultimately
be more shallow as a result.
Labour, they argue, should take rapid and dramatic steps to persuade the
public that deep-rooted change is under way - yet another policy review is
not enough.

A week before the King trial decision, another verdict that caused outrage

of a young black woman was sentenced to probation instead of jail. A

juice. As the girl left the store the grocer shot her in the back of the

FT  02 MAY 92 / Violence in the US: Tough action to quell anarchy across US
 -Police arrest 1,400 in San Francisco's Bay area
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAYORS and police chiefs across the US yesterday stepped up efforts to quell
the spread of the violence that struck the city of Los Angeles in the wake
of the surprise acquittal of four police officers accused of assaulting
Rodney King, a black motorist.
In the worst incidents outside Los Angeles, the centre of San Francisco was
swept by destruction and looting on Thursday night as peaceful protests
against the King trial verdict, led primarily by student groups, were joined
by multi-racial youth gangs. But police were quick to respond.
Over 600 San Francisco police backed by reinforcements from several
surrounding counties arrested around 1,400 people in the Bay area, and Mayor
Frank Jordan ordered an immediate curfew, as the city authorities sought to
preempt any possibility of a spiral of violence.
Black leaders in many other regions reported a deep sense of anger and
frustration after the King verdict, but only in a handful of other cities
did protests spill over into violence.
Mobs of 200 or more rioted in Atlanta and Seattle, and in Las Vegas
firebombs were thrown at two police stations and a police officer was shot
in the leg. Police said they found a charred body in the wreckage of a burnt
out shop.
Shots were also fired in Tampa and Birmingham, and arson was reported in
Pittsburgh.
City leaders yesterday were keen to act quickly to head off any possible
escalation of violence, warned by the experience of Los Angeles how quickly
the police could lose control.
The incidents in Las Vegas and Atlanta, although severe, were on a much
smaller scale than the widespread rioting that struck California, but these
two cities followed the lead of Los Angeles and San Francisco by ordering
overnight curfews and by calling out the National Guard.
On Thursday night, the vigorous police response in San Francisco contrasted
with the images of Los Angeles, where helpless policemen had looked on as
looters ransacked shops.
Elsewhere, police and shopkeepers took precautions to guard against the
possibility that demonstrations could run out of control. In New York, many
workers were let off work early on Friday afternoon, turning the city into a
ghost town in anticipation of a closed down and nervous shopkeepers
barricaded their windows.
Last night hundreds of black, white and Hispanic protesters rampaged through
the streets of Lower Manhattan. They broke windows and smashed taxis. Cars
were overturned in Greenwich Village. Several people were arrested. Earlier
another swarm of protesters shouting 'guilty' tore through Washington Square
Park.
Several arrests were made after 200 people demonstrated in Times Square and
in Harlem black protesters pulled two white men out of a truck stabbing one
in the back.
Although rage over the decision in the Rodney King trial began the riots in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta and other cities, the sparks
fell on dry tinder.
The rioters and looters are not all black, nor are they all minorities. Many
riots have been led by gangs of poor youths from the inner city ghettos of
America, striking out and grabbing what they can in the midst of chaos.
Black leaders yesterday looked for ways of channelling the anger that many
blacks felt after the King verdict.
In Cleveland, for example, a youth leader named on television a number of
police officers regarded as persistently racist. 'If the leadership follows
through on it, that kind of thing could cool things down considerably,' a
local black politician said.
Many other cities, however, contain several of the ingredients for violence:
depressed inner city neighbourhoods, youths with little education and less
hope of employment, and heavily armed street gangs.
Meanwhile the rest of the world has reacted with a mixture of emotion and
trepidation to events in the US.
William Dawkins writes from Paris: The Los Angeles riots are a symptom of
the US administration's insufficient attention to social problems, French
President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday.
'I do not want to give advice, out of respect for this great country, but as
you are asking my opinion, I think there is an absence of social legislation
and protection,' Mr Mitterrand said.
The 'scandalous' court acquittal of four white policemen filmed beating a
black motorist was partly to blame, but poverty was the root cause. Wherever
there is poverty 'there will always be incidents and there will always be
injustices,' said Mr Mitterrand.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Violence in the US: Black leaders demand action from Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BLACK American civil rights leaders told President Bush yesterday that
failure to address the underlying conditions behind the Los Angeles riots
could mean years of trouble in the nation's inner cities.
Speaking after a White House meeting, Rev E V Hill, of the Mount Zion
Baptist Church in Los Angeles, said the president had been told there was no
problem in the world, including narcotics and aid to the Soviet Union, that
was bigger than the racial tension in America's cities.
Asked if he trusted the president to take the right action, Rev Joseph
Lowery, of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, acidly replied: 'He
is the only president we've got'. Quoting Rev Martin Luther King, he urged
Mr Bush not to be consumed 'by the paralysis of analysis'.
Rev Lowery, with others nodding agreement, called on Mr Bush to empower a
federal grand jury to investigate the beating of Rodney King. He said the
president had not ruled this out.
Benjamin Hooks, of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured
People, said the question of police brutality could not be avoided. He
demanded that the attorney-general proceed immediately with a federal
prosecution of the King case.
John Jacobs, of the National Urban League, declared: 'This is not just an LA
thing'. Arthur Fletcher, of the Civil Rights Commission, said what was
happening 'touches every household in America'.
The message from all of them was that nothing less than a fully-fledged
action programme would suffice. Mr Hooks, saying it was 'encouraging we
could even have this meeting with the president,' declared this was 'a
defining moment in the history of the country'.
Absent from the meeting was probably the most political of all American
black civil rights leaders, the Rev Jesse Jackson, who said he had not been
invited. He was visiting riot-torn areas yesterday.
It was also noteworthy that Hispanic and Asian minorities, also much
affected by the riots, were not represented at the White House meeting, an
indication of the enduring influence of the black civil rights leaders in
Washington and of the extent to which, rightly or wrongly, what happened in
Los Angeles and elsewhere is seen principally as a black issue.

violence subsides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is hard to think of two politicians on the surface more different than Mr
Tom Bradley, mayor of Los Angeles, and Mr Pete Wilson, governor of
California.
The mayor is black, bulky, a Democrat, a cautious consensus builder and, at
75, near the end of a distinguished political career that has spanned 19
years running the state's biggest city, two attempts at the governorship and
serious consideration, in 1984, as a vice presidential candidate.
The governor is white, trim, a Republican, a born-again activist and, at 58,
very much in his political prime, having served as mayor of San Diego, in
the US Senate and since the start of last year running the nation's biggest
state. He is on everybody's shortlist as a presidential candidate in 1996.
Yet these are two men in whom surface appearances are deceptive. What has
been striking in the 48 hours since Los Angeles erupted has been the
identity of their opinions. Both have made no bones of their disbelief at
the acquittal of the four police officers and both have warned that
continued rioting will bring the full retribution of the law.
Mr Tom Bradley is known locally as the 'Teflon mayor,' on whom, like Mr
Ronald Reagan, no mud sticks. The son of a Texas sharecropper, a lawyer and
former policeman, he is credited with keeping the lid on the volatile Los
Angeles ethnic cocktail.
But he is also given credit for ensuring that downtown Los Angeles at least
did not suffer the physical decay of so many other American cities. He
encouraged external investment in the urban centre, especially from the
Japanese.
He has been criticised for not reacting sharply enough when the King beating
hit the television screens in March last year and for not instantly calling
for the removal of Mr Daryl Gates, the controversial police chief. But he
did convene a special commission that produced a damaging report on the
police department's practices and, finally, he did this March call for Mr
Gates's retirement.
Mr Pete Wilson was considered cautious too, when he took over the
governorship at the start of last year, but no longer. For his tenure has
been remarkable for his breaking with Republican orthodox doctrine in his
assault on the state's fiscal crisis. He is now seen as the state's most
interventionist and innovative governor since Mr Pat Brown, Jerry's father,
in the early 1960s.
The Wilson formula has been, astonishingly for a Republican forged in the
Reagan era, to increase taxes. Moreover he did so by working with, not
against, the Democratic majority in the state assembly.
He describes his philosophy as 'activism in a preventative way.' There was,
perhaps, no way that he, or Mayor Bradley, could have prevented the
spontaneous combustion of Wednesday night in Los Angeles but it is obvious
that both are going to be active in seeing that it comes to an end.
What happens after that, however, will be a bigger test of their
capabilities. Success or failure may add lustre or tarnish the mayor's last
years, but it may also determine whether the governor makes it to the White
House four and a half years from now.

The Purchasing Managers' Index, one of the first clues to how the economy

Although any reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES preparing for the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in June have come up
with a compromise proposal that seems likely to pave the way for agreement
on a global warming convention.
Mr Jean Ripert, the French delegate chairing negotiations at the United
Nations in New York, said the US had agreed to a draft which would set
non-binding guidelines for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
Agreement on this issue, which has until now pitted the US against the rest
of the world, would open the way for President George Bush to attend the
summit. He is the only major world leader so far not to have agreed to
attend.
Environmentalist groups yesterday complained that Mr Ripert's draft
represented an intolerable watering down of efforts to curb greenhouse gas
emissions.
The EC has until now insisted on a treaty which by the year 2000 would cap
emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, at 1990 levels.
President Bush has refused to accept specific targets and timetables, but
his administration says that actions the US has already taken will result in
cuts in emissions of all greenhouse gases by 7-11 per cent, close to the
reduction needed to stabilise at 1990 levels.

INSURANCE losses from riots in Los Angeles and other US cities could reach
Dollars 1bn, according to early estimates.
Farmers Group, one of California's biggest insurers, provisionally estimated
its losses at Dollars 50m, much less than the Dollars 130m it paid out in
the recent Oakland fire disaster near San Francisco.
Other insurers said it would be next week before they had an accurate
picture of the situation. Allstate, one of the country's largest
property-liability insurers and a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck, said claims
had started to trickle in, but it was often impossible to get close enough
to buildings to assess damage.
Mr Nicholas Balcombe, of loss assessors Balcombe Group, the UK affiliate of
Adjusters International, which has offices in Los Angeles, expects insured
losses, including the cost of consequential losses, to reach Dollars 1bn.
A second firm of loss adjusters, Maxon Young, also expects insured losses at
this level.
The London insurance market, which provides reinsurance for a number of US
companies, could also be affected.
An executive of one leading international broker, said: 'We have already
identified some severe impact to London.'
The Insurance Information Institute, a New York-based industry grouping,
said more insurance was in force in urban areas today than at the time of
the riots in the early 1960s.

FT  02 MAY 92 / New times, new comrades new May Day in Moscow

<TEXT>
'It's the First of May here, what's wrong with that?' was the defensive
splash headline yesterday in Pravda, the former main organ of the former
Communist Party of the former Soviet Union. Its defensiveness was compounded
by being placed next to a lead story which reported glowingly on a
demonstration in Warsaw 'For work and Bread]' organised by . . . Solidarity,
which Pravda had anathematised for most of the past decade.
New times, of course, mean new comrades: the former Communists who marched
in modest numbers (about 10-15,000) in Moscow yesterday found, when they
arrived in Red Square, that they were in the midst of a street party which
the authorities had organised for orphans, and were surrounded by
advertising hoardings, including a striking one proposing holidays in the
Canaries - a genuflection to one of the party's sponsors, the Spanish
Ministry of Tourism.
It was the first First of May with no top Communist on the Lenin mausoleum:
no banners on GUM, the vast department store (many departments, no stores):
no obeisance to the Gods of 19th century historical materialism. Last year
they got rid of the tanks: Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Party general
secretary, had stood on top of the tomb waving listlessly at a ragged
procession. This year, the 'workers' had to fend for themselves.
'Where are the workers?' asked one crone carrying a picture of Lenin. 'I
don't know, taking it easy,' said an onlooker. 'They should be here]' said
the crone, waving a portrait of the Workers' Best Friend. 'Their life is
being destroyed, they should be here]' Certainly the march spoke in their
name. Organised by the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions (there are many
such bodies now) it singled out the slowly developing capitalism for attack.
'Privatisation: the millionaire's fiance and the workers' grave' (it rhymes
in Russian); 'Down with the dictatorship of the Mayor of Moscow and the
President: up with the dictatorship of the Workers' Councils'. A man in a
car screamed through a loudspeaker: 'Privatisation: a foreign word for a
foreign process]'
In other cities, turnout was smaller. In Ukraine, the Socialist Party,
successor to the Ukrainian Communist Party, advised its members not to
demonstrate because they had nothing to celebrate. Even on a fine May Day,
the old forces again showed their inability to capitalise on the economic
grievances of the masses. Worst of all for the old Communists, the march
showed they had competition on the left. Young Trotskyites handed out
leaflets from the Spartacist League which called for the workers to arise.
Privatisation is one thing: but when Trotskyists appear, the game is
probably up. Capitalism is back.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Kabul becomes target for new 'Great Game'
</HEADLINE>

   KABUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN the week since the Mujahideen rebels seized power, Kabul has become both
the target of a regional scramble for power, and an island in a fragmented
nation ruled by local warlords.
In the regional power struggle, Pakistan and Iran are competing for
influence in a new Afghanistan that will provide a long land route to the
prized former Soviet central Asian republics. Saudi Arabia, flush with oil
dollars, also is seeking a voice in Kabul.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has openly acknowledged his interest
in re-opening the pre-1917 trade route between Tashkent and Peshawar.
This week, he pressed the point by flying in with his army chief of staff,
Asif Nawaz, and intelligence director, Javed Nasir. Also aboard the aircraft
were Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief Prince Turkhi Bin Al-Faisal and 60
Pakistani journalists.
Less openly, Iran has made clear its interest in fostering a loose,
Persian-speaking union which it would like to see include northern
Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
The official Pakistani visit was seen as the opening salvo of an expected
stiff competition. It was an attempt to say: 'We have got here first'.
'This is a kind of signal to others, including Iran, that 'we have
established ourselves',' said an Asian diplomat. 'We don't know what Iran's
reaction will be.'
In this evolving competition following the end of the 13-year war,
Afghanistan has again assumed its historical role as a crossroads for
greater powers seeking regional influence and corresponding wealth.
Northern Afghanistan has undetermined but estimated rich deposits of
emeralds, gold and lapis lazuli. A toehold here could make it easier to
establish stronger contacts with Uzbeks, Tajiks and Turkmens over the
border, where there are large deposits of uranium, oil and natural gas, in
addition to a huge cotton crop.
'For all three countries, Afghanistan is vital as a stepping stone to
Central Asia,' said another diplomat. 'Whatever happens will have
repercussions on the rest of the region.' The scramble for power is
occurring amid the confusion of Afghanistan's new domestic struggle.
Kabul's power over the countryside appears to have unravelled to its worst
state since before 1880, when, after decades of instability, the then Emir
Abdul Rahman patched together the whole of Afghanistan under his rule.
The main cities and small villages in the countryside have come under the
control of figures who are effectively local warlords.
In western Herat, the local strongman is Ismael Khan, a former army officer
who defected to the Mujahideen early in the war. In the southeastern capital
of Gardez and Khost, the strongman is Jalalludin Haqqanni.
The potential of regions simply spinning off in their own direction, Herat
toward Iran, Soviet Central Asia, and Jalalabad and Kandahar toward
Pakistan, suddenly has become more than just a fear, since bankrupt Kabul
can offer little inducement to remain in its domain.
In such a confused state, the fruits of the end of the war could simply be
more years of misery for the Afghans, diplomats and Afghans have said in
interviews in the past few days.
'Apart from the boundaries of Kabul, the country is totally fragmented,'
said a European diplomat. 'You go from village to village, and there is a
different Mujahideen commander in each one.
'Who will pay the people (to remain loyal to Kabul)? If you don't pay, they
will try to grab everything for themselves.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / Violence plagues Kenyan transition: Over 200 are killed in
Rift Valley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   CHAPAKUNDI, WESTERN KENYA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FACE down and bent over double, the lifeless body of Mina Njogu lies in a
wet field full of ferns on the fertile slopes of Chapakundi, a remote
farming village in western Kenya.
Falling raindrops glisten off his grey hair and beard. A rusty home-made
arrow head sticks out of his neck. His head is covered in four-inch deep
cuts made by axes and machetes which ended his life.
Yesterday, five days after he was murdered, his body still lay uncollected,
one more victim in Kenya's mounting death toll from bitter tribal violence.
At least 200 people have been slaughtered in the hills and forests of
Kenya's Rift Valley in the past two months in the worst explosion of ethnic
conflict in the country since independence in 1963.
The violence threatens the country's transition from one-party rule to
multi-party democracy, coming under further strain today with the
long-awaited return to Nairobi of Mr Kenneth Matiba, a leading government
opponent.
Supporters are expecting an enthusiastic crowd to welcome Mr Matiba, a
former cabinet minister, who was arrested in 1990 and detained for nearly a
year before being allowed to leave Kenya for medical treatment in London.
The conflict has pitted president Daniel arap Moi's Kalenjin tribe against
the Kikuyu, Kisii and Luhya tribes. Traditional rivalries have been
exacerbated by high population growth and growing competition for land, and
fears among the Kalenjin that they will lose out if the presidency changes
hands.
The main street in Chapakundi is littered with clothes, empty suitcases and
home-made wooden shields. Mr Geoffrey Muturi, a Chapakundi resident, says
hundreds of Kalenjin warriors, dressed only in shorts, their faces covered
in warpaint, and armed with machetes and bows and arrows, first attacked the
village last Saturday. In three days of fighting they killed at least 20
people, burned homes and looted shops.
On Monday they forced everybody to drop their possessions on the dirt road
and flee to nearby towns. Mr Muturi says the fighters also destroyed title
deeds to land and identity cards which enable people to vote in elections.
The same pattern of violence was repeated in the villages of Kaplamboi,
Saosa, Korofa, and Olenguruone.
Yesterday, all along the muddy roads leaving the areas of the clashes,
hundreds of scared people, mostly Kikuyus and Kisiis, were still struggling
on foot weighed down with heavy sacks stuffed full of whatever possessions
they could carry on their heads.
They are joining what has become an exodus of at least 20,000 people who
have abandoned their homesteads and farms and fled to the makeshift camps
being set up in nearby towns, mostly by the Catholic church.
Last March, Kenya's Roman Catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter accusing
the government of instigating the violence. Opposition leaders have claimed
a pretext is being sought to declare a state of emergency and delay
elections, perhaps indefinitely.
Impending political change in tribal composition and the presidency has
stirred deep fears.
Fears are widespread of an escalation in the conflict as more lives are lost
and the elections, which must be held before next February, approach.
One of the greatest fears is that the clashes will spread to the
multi-ethnic towns and cities. Last week, a Kalenjin man found carrying
arrows was stoned to death in downtown Nairobi by an angry mob.

FT  02 MAY 92 / EEA treaty to spur hot debate on bigger EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OPORTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNATURE later here today of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty,
giving seven more countries effective half-membership of the European
Community, looks like accelerating a hotly-contested debate on its
enlargement.
The main formal business on enlargement, for foreign ministers of the Twelve
at their regular six-monthly meeting, is to join their counterparts from the
seven European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries in signing the EEA
pact. This needs ratification by EC and Efta parliaments by the end of this
year so that the plan, extending the single EC market to Efta, can be
effective next January 1. The chief hurdle will be a Swiss referendum.
But three Efta states, Austria, Sweden and Finland, have already applied for
full membership. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has warned that
his report on the institutional implications of enlargement for the June
summit in Lisbon will shock existing member states.
At this weekend's meeting he may be asked to expand on his emerging idea of
upgrading the Commission into a more powerful political executive, whose
head would be elected by the European Parliament and which would be
accountable to that body and the European Council, as EC summits are known.
As yesterday's meeting began, an official of the UK, which takes over the EC
presidency in July, warned that for Mr Delors to launch another big debate
so soon after the Maastricht treaty, 'could stop the whole show'.
The UK believes the EC must focus on issues such as future financing and
membership of the EC. But Commission officials are frustrated at the way the
rotating presidency system overstretches small countries, such as Portugal
at present, effectively to steer the Community. The emerging Delors plan is
not to replace the presidency, but create a more powerful EC executive in
foreign and economic policy-making. Its head could act as de facto EC
president, leaving the national presidencies a more ceremonial role.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Lloyds branches may be hit worst in Midland takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK may close more of its own branches than those of Midland if it
succeeds in buying its UK rival, Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive,
claimed yesterday.
As Midland fired its first serious shots in its battle to ward off Lloyds'
takeover proposals, Mr Pearse said he expected Lloyds would have difficulty
in maintaining the morale of its staff during the takeover struggle.
Midland wrote to its shareholders to say it prefers the Pounds 3.3bn bid
made by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
Mr Pearse said that when Lloyds and Midland were having secret takeover
talks between December last year and mid-March, 'we were told that more
Lloyds branches would be closed than ours'. Lloyds was then discussing the
closure of 1,100 of the banks' combined 3,745 branches.
However, when Lloyds announced on Tuesday that it wanted to pay Pounds 3.6bn
to buy Midland, it said the takeover would involve the closure of 1,000
branches. Lloyds said yesterday no decision had been made on whether more
Midland or Lloyds branches would be closed.
Meanwhile, Bifu, the UK banking union, threatened disruptive industrial
action as a last resort to protect jobs. Mr Leif Mills, the union's general
secretary, said: 'It is a possibility that various forms of action might
take place, if all else fails.'
The union will not take action while it is continuing its campaign to have a
Lloyds bid for Midland blocked by the competition authorities. Bifu now
believes that 30,000 jobs would go if the takeover goes ahead, rather than
the 20,000 Lloyds' estimate.
Mr Pearse, meanwhile, rejected suggestions that Midland turned down Lloyds'
initial takeover approach because directors wanted to protect their own
jobs.
'Under Lloyds' original proposals, we would have filled most of the top
jobs', he said. Lloyds had planned, he said, that Sir Peter Walters,
Midland's chairman, should become chairman of the combined banks.
Mr Pearse would have been deputy chief executive. Mr Richard Delbridge,
Midland's finance director, would have been the combined banks' chief
executive.
Lloyds said it was putting the finishing touches to the submission it will
make to the Office of Fair Trading on why Hongkong Bank's bid should be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, if its own bid is
referred there.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Bush orders 4,500 troops to riot-torn Los Angeles: Pledge of
'necessary force' to quell violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush last night ordered 4,500 soldiers and marines to use
'whatever force is necessary to restore order' to the riot-torn city of Los
Angeles.
In a television broadcast to the nation, Mr Bush condemned the two days of
violence that followed the acquittal of four Los Angeles policemen accused
of beating Mr Rodney King, a black motorist.
'There can be no excuse for the murder, arson, theft or vandalism that have
terrorised the people of Los Angeles. The wanton destruction of life and
property is not a legitimate protest'.
Mr Bush's remarks came as the toll of human life, property and business
continued to rise. As many as 38 people, almost all black, are reported dead
and more than 1,000 injured, making it the second worst race riot in the US
this century, after the 47 killed in Detroit in 1967.
Yesterday disturbances spread to several other US cities, including Las
Vegas, where the National Guard has been called out, San Francisco, New
York, Atlanta and Seattle. None assumed the proportions of what has happened
in Los Angeles, although the police in San Francisco made some 1,400
arrests.
In New York last night hundreds of black, white and Hispanic protesters
rampaged through the streets of Lower Manhattan. They broke windows and
smashed taxis as riot police attempted to stop them. Several people were
arrested.
President Bush said he had found the videotape of Mr King's beating
'revolting,' but urged Americans to respect the process of law, 'whether or
not we agree with the outcome.'
'The verdict on Wednesday was not the end of the process,' he said. 'Federal
action in this case will be expeditious and will be fair. It will not be
driven by mob violence.'
Mr Bush's order had the effect of activating 3,000 infantry and 1,500
marines that had been on standby since morning. They may now fan out into
the streets of Los Angeles.
He said he had committed the troops - from a staging area near the riot-torn
city - and 5,200 state National Guard forces already on under federal
control because 'incidents of random lawlessness and terror' were still
going on.
He said the troops and guards had been placed under a single, unified
command under the overall supervision of General Colin Powell, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Mr Rodney King, whose videotaped beating by police officers set off the
rioting, yesterday made an emotional appeal for a return to calm. 'I just
want to say: can we all get along? Can we stop making it horrible for the
older people and the kids? We'll get our justice. They've won the battle but
they haven't won the war,' he said.
Although the officers who beat Mr King were acquitted on criminal charges of
assault, Mr King still has a civil lawsuit pending against them. In
addition, Mr William Barr, the US attorney general, said a federal
investigation of the possible violation of Mr King's civil rights was being
'aggressively pursued'.
Estimates of damage in Los Angeles were reported by the Mayor's office to be
as high as Dollars 550m (Pounds 310m).
Yesterday sporadic rioting and looting spread to parts of Los Angeles
unaffected on the first night, including Hollywood and Beverly Hills, and a
thick pall of smoke from hundreds of fires still hung over the whole area.
Some of the sharpest confrontations centred on Koreatown, about two miles
west of the downtown area. Korean shopowners armed themselves with pistols
and rifles and shot at bands of looters marauding through the streets. In
Seoul, President Roh Tae-woo called for additional protection for Korean
natives in Los Angeles.
The focus of violence began to change early yesterday from looting to
attacks on the police. Three policemen were shot and a paint factory, daubed
with anti-police graffiti, was set on fire. All schools in Los Angeles were
ordered to close again in spite of concerns that young people, who might
otherwise be at school, were roving the streets and adding to the problems.
Mr Bush's decision to deploy extra resources was taken after two White House
meetings, the first of which involved his domestic advisers, including Gen
Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and the second with black
civil rights leaders.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the presidential spokesman, repeated the president's
call for 'understanding and reason' saying 'anarchy must not prevail'.
The president's approach to what has happened in Los Angeles is fraught with
political risk in this election year. On Thursday he had expressed a similar
'understanding' for those frustrated by the verdict in the King case and
promised an investigation that could lead to a federal prosecution of the
acquitted policemen. But he later spoke only of the threat to law and order
posed by violence and it is now far from clear that a federal prosecution
will materialise.
Mr Bill Clinton, his likely Democrat opponent in the presidential election,
has also had to fine-tune some of his comments.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Bank signals early rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, JAMES BLITZ and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES BY the Bank of England suggested yesterday that the government is set
next week to sanction a cut in base rates by up to half a point in an effort
to strengthen faint signs of recovery.
The signals, which took the form of operations on money and gilt-edged
markets, came amid fresh signs of a weak upturn in housing and retailing.
The Bank's moves suggest Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, has decided to
capitalise on sterling's recent strength by acting quickly on base rates,
now at 10.5 per cent, rather than wait for further evidence that the economy
may have turned up after the election.
They also indicate Mr Lamont intends to gamble against the possibility of an
imminent rise in German rates. There has been speculation that the
Bundesbank might tighten rates - perhaps when its council meets on Thursday
 -in an attempt to force down wage and price inflation.
In the Bank of England's money market operations yesterday it cut - for the
third day - the rates at which it lends to the money market through the
purchase of long-term bills.
It also announced the issue of Pounds 800m of short-dated 8.75 per cent
gilts, maturing in 1997, when markets reopen on Tuesday. Given the rising
gilt market, the bonds are unlikely to find buyers unless the Bank cuts
rates on Tuesday or soon after.
Meanwhile, the Nationwide Building Society said its house price index rose
by 0.7 per cent in April, only the second increase in 10 months. The
society's estate agents reported house viewings up about 35 per cent on last
year. Even so, the average house last month was valued 3.7 per cent lower
than in April 1991.
As for retailing, the British Retail Consortium said revenues at many big
shops had been higher than expected last month.
Speculation about a rate cut pushed down the three-month interbank rate by
about 1/8 point to some 10 1/4 per cent.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Interview: The opera diva who moves in mysterious ways -
Singer Josephine Barstow explains the importance of theatre in an operatic
setting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH OF the finest theatre today occurs in opera. True, there are still
singers who just stand and deliver, some of whom are big stars. But some
opera companies have built their house styles around their sheer theatrical
vigour; and some operatic artists belong more truly in a theatre than
others. One of these is the soprano Josephine Barstow. Though she makes
successful recordings, she is best seen live.
John Copley, who has directed her in several of her finest interpretations,
has said that she could be a member of the National Theatre. Even 18 years
after I first saw her in opera, I cannot forget some of the moves she made
onstage then - how musically and psychologically acute they were. So, when
we met, I asked her about how she conceives the physical side of a role.
'I like to find a physical shape to a character. Salome is lithe. She's
snake-like. And I know how Tosca moves: she's very sensual; she has great
consciousness of her body. Especially in Act I, she's sexual, with men. It's
in her body. She has a powerful body; singers often do.'
Does she work on keeping fit? 'Not really. I have a bicycle which I often
ride to work in London. And in the country I ride. I have two careers, you
see. I also run a stud farm in the country.
'In Sussex I have dogs, cats, ducks and 25 Arabian horses. And I really do
go to the animal world for ideas. Salome is one of my cats. And animals help
me with Tosca. She's not very intelligent. She gets very jealous, and I take
ideas from a horse or a dog - animals that can be very jealous. Or a
new-born foal: that's Natasha in War and Peace. With Natasha, I think of the
shoulders. That's the secret. She has these short sleeves, and this dress
that falls. The shoulders must be so lovely, and the head moves against them
in this lively way. You can have a thick waist in dresses like that. She's a
foal, you see. I was so angry with Tolstoy] At the end of the novel, he
describes Natasha as a cosily, happily married mum. She's too rare, too
special a type for that.'
Barstow is today a leading figure in London opera; in one week last summer
she sang Odabella in Verdi's Attila at Covent Garden, Katerina in
Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk at the Coliseum and Puccini's Tosca
at Earl's Court. She has sung many roles abroad. Does she have any fixed
business for a role? 'Well, for that Tosca I had to. But ideally, no, I
reconceive everything for a different staging when conditions permit.'
She has no muscle memory of specific movements, but sums up each role
quickly, in physical and psychological terms. Odabella in Attila is 'a
warrior. Quite tight.' Minnie in La Fanciulla del West 'belongs in the
country. She's loose-legged, loose-armed. There's space. The people in that
opera - their bodies are used to working, to effort. A bit of the John
Wayne. Minnie's the nearest to me.' The 300-year-old Elina in The
Makropoulos Case 'has, like Tosca, a physical power over men. Which she's
fined down. She's quite in control of it. The hardest thing is the way she
rapidly declines at the end. But she gets intimations of the disintegration
before. I used to try to get it by shivering, a quite involuntary shudder.
She doesn't recognise it. And, like Ekaterina in Lady Macbeth, she's grown
out of all the social graces. She doesn't bother about what she says. That's
something I love in her.'
Ellen in Peter Grimes? 'She is a still lady. She belongs to the village. To
people who can't understand. The opera is about society not understanding
Peter - who represents the artist, a homosexual, whatever. Her own tragedy
is that she can't break away from that. She does bravely dictate to herself
and her own society. But when the chips are down, she fails Peter; she is
not equipped to cope. She's an ordinary mortal. And that's quite
interesting.'
Amelia in Un Ballo in maschera, torn between loyalty to her husband and her
guilty love for the king, 'is quite still too. Her stillness comes from
struggling to keep control of herself. It comes from pain, and from her
struggle to control pain, her own endeavour to control what's happening. I
just love Verdi heroines because you know how they think. And yet that gives
you great leeway. Amelia is a gentle, honourable woman struggling with a
moral problem. She's not on parade.'
Unlike Elisabeth in Verdi's Don Carlos. 'You never see Elisabeth happy -
except in the first act, at Fontainebleau. She's a French princess who
marries the Spanish king. With such a character, you express emotion by
details - flickers of fingers. She wouldn't betray herself by a change of
physical shape. But in the bedroom, when she faints, then you see her own
shape. It's her husband's bedroom, after all, and she's dressed differently,
in her night clothes.'
Violetta, the consumptive Lady of the Camelias in Verdi's La Traviata, is a
role with which she has been associated for many years. 'I first did her
long before I had the farm. My Violetta was very Garbo. I was just crazy
about Camille. I loved Garbo's posture there. And her laugh]' Barstow
demonstrates the lifted head, the revealed throat, the radiant face. 'But I
couldn't really do that, so I cut that. Garbo could have played all the
first act to perfection.
'Then when I prepared the 1973 Coliseum production, John Copley established
a train of thought in me. A lot of the movement came from that. He gave me a
wonderful relaxation at the beginning of Act II. It's such a brief moment,
and he had the idea of having me enter with a basket of flowers and a hat.'
How about Act II, scene 2 - the party scene? 'She's stiffer-backed there.
(Garbo again]) She's trying to hold herself together.'
And Violetta's consumption? 'We studied it medically speaking. We thought of
blood coming up into the mouth. And the feeling of heaviness. She's
incredibly tired. Then suddenly you get a spurt of energy.'
What about another consumptive role, Mimi in Puccini's La Boheme? "Anyone
can make an audience weep in Mimi's death scene. The trick is to make them
cry in Act III; and, above all, in Act II of Traviata. And it's a success if
I've stopped the audience applauding. Because then they're thinking. That's
the triumph.'
She has sung one Wagner role, Sieglinde in The Valkyrie. 'What's interesting
there is the suspension of time. Being allowed to take time  - to let it
happen. There's not just time to move, there's time just to look across the
room.'
One of the roles she has sung most is Richard Strauss's Salome. What of the
long Dance of the Seven Veils? 'My first Salome was here, at English
National Opera, and the dance couldn't have worked in any other production .
. . There's no way that I can do a real dance. Frankly, that music, at that
length, would be hard even for a ballerina. I like it if there's more of a
plot to it, with mime. That's what Harry Kupfer, in East Germany, wanted. He
has this idea that the dance refers to features of Salome's whole story. But
I'm not a dancer. You can tell if people can dance from the look of them.
Dancers are neat, and I'm not.'
In the same composer's Der Rosenkavalier, she graduated from the youthful
male role of Octavian (the Knight of the Rose) to that of his female lover,
the Marschallin, a woman who is past her first youth. 'Octavian is simple.
He's always there. It's one of the most exhausting roles I've ever played.
But I didn't really find him very interesting. I love the role of the
Marschallin so much; and I'm glad that doing Octavian gave me a chance to
see the Marschallin at first from outside. Both of them share the same
upbringing: that class, that eighteenth-century world. None of these
characters are inelegant. It's a very particular part of the world, a
particular city, a particular decade. And the Marschallin - she's too
perfect]'
Is there a difference in the way the Marschallin and Octavian carry
themselves? 'He's a man; she's a woman. The costumes tell you so much. You
see the outlines of his legs. He sits in a chair so as to display his
calves. With her, it's the shoulders and the chest. The costume dictates how
you should move. I wouldn't have been considered right in that era. I'm more
physically close to Natasha.'
One of her most remarkable roles has been Katerina in Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk. Here she murders to get and keep what she wants. In Act Three of
David Pountney's production for English National Opera, she has a long and
phenomenal passage when she sits completely still, while singing; then
remains totally still, when listening; then, slowly, she rises and moves
towards a character who has been taunting her, and fights her until they
drown together.
'What I found difficult was why Katerina was so malignant, vindictive. I
didn't understand. Finally I decided that she tells you. Her last few words
are: 'There's a black lake in the forest, black as oil.' For me, she's
talking about something she's decided in herself. I understand, so I just
let it happen.'
I asked about the difficulty of stillness onstage. 'I'm getting better at
that. I'm making more happen within the stillness. In Lady Macbeth the rest
of David's production moves; I'm the still centre. I learnt economy there.
Not crossing every T, dotting every I. Leaving the audience to make up their
own minds. The less you do, the better. The concentration's inside. I tried
to keep this black centre going.'
I asked about one more Verdi heroine, the poignant Leonora in The Force of
Destiny, never free from the conflict between love and her family's
opposition even after years in solitude. 'Oh, I don't know what to say about
her now. It's been quite a few years since I sang the role, and I'd have to
delve down to find her again.' I remarked that she is due to sing the role
again this September at the Coliseum, in a new production directed by
Nicholas Hytner. She brightened. 'Yes. So it's just as well I've forgotten
how I used to do her.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / Bomber Harris: 'a tactless choice'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norbert Burger, Mayor of Cologne, explains why a statue of the RAF's wartime
Bomber Command chief, Sir Arthur Harris, should not be unveiled by the Queen
Mother on May 31.
THE PRESENT period of European history should make us think twice about
raising monuments to heroes of past wars. The members of the European
Community have agreed to scrap borders between each other. We want to live
in friendship with our neighbours. This is a unique achievement in European
history.
We must, of course, accept that Adolf Hitler in 1939 started a war
unprecedented in its scope, its brutality and its outcome. We must hope that
the Second World War will indeed remain unprecedented. In the past
half-century the face of the world and the face of Europe have been
transformed. Enmity between Britain and Germany has given way to friendship.
Contacts between British and German people flourish on every level. One good
example is the partnership between Liverpool and Cologne, a link which
celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. Together with a delegation from
Cologne I paid a visit just a few weeks ago to our English partner city on
the Mersey. We have particularly strong ties in culture, art and sport. It
is a symbol of how things have changed for the good.
I do not anticipate that this friendship will be spoiled by the planned
unveiling of the statue. of Sir Arthur Harris. But I cannot say I am happy
about it. I heard about the plan last year. I wrote in October 1991 to Sir
Christopher Mallaby, the British ambassador in Bonn, and to Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, then German foreign minister, to say that it would be wrong to put
up such a monument. I had the feeling that old wounds which had healed could
be torn open again.
I want to clear up any misunderstandings about this. I have no intention of
suppressing memories of the war. I certainly do not want to unleash tones of
revanchism. There is absolutely no doubt that Hitler's Germany started the
war. Germany takes responsibility for it. I made this point clear recently
when opening an exhibition commemorating the '1000-bomber attack on Cologne'
on May 31 1942. My words were: 'We must not forget: Carpet bombing aimed
above all against civilian populations was first planned and carried out by
Germans.' Nazi Germany's attacks on Warsaw, Rotterdam, Belgrade and, above
all, Coventry, provide the evidence for this.
In the night of May 30/31 1942, Cologne was the target of around 1,000
British aeroplanes, which dropped more than 100,000 incendiary bombs and
around 1,000 high-explosive bombs, above all on the city centre. According
to the official figures, 470 people died during the night. More than 5,000
were wounded and around 100,000 were left homeless. In addition to this,
Cologne lost a great deal of its substance. The city lost its face. Many
historic buildings were destroyed.
Sir Arthur Harris, the supreme commander of Royal Air Force Bomber Command,
was responsible for the military and strategic planning of this first 1,000
bomber attack. I am very worried that this monument will idealise a man who
was partly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and
for the destruction of many cities.
It is a moot point whether attacks on civilian populations made strategic
sense. I believe that the victory over Hitler's Germany came not because of
bomb attacks on civilian targets, but through the fronts opened in the
Soviet Union, Africa and France, and as a result of the air battle over
Britain. But even if the bombing offensive is ascribed a different
significance, it has to be acknowledged that no other inventor or executor
of instruments or actions of mass destruction has had a monument raised in
his name. And rightly so.
No monument has been erected to Einstein on account of the development of
the atom bomb. And certainly this has not been done for the generals and
bomber crews who dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It could be
argued that these actions ended the war more quickly and avoided further
innocent victims. None the less, no-one - perhaps because of guilty
consciences - wanted to put up monuments to those who carried out the
bombing.
All this explains why I am against the statue. We are trying to build a
Europe of peace and friendship. It is particularly unfortunate that this
monument is being unveiled precisely on May 31 - the anniversary of the
attack on Cologne.
It is much more sensible to use this day to commemorate all the victims of
the Second World War with an ecumenical church service. Such a service is
taking place in Cologne and there is also one in Canterbury, to which I have
been invited. We must extend the hand of friendship to each other. And we
must build a peaceful future for the whole of Europe.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Kate Adie's army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE kept a low profile this week, mainly from a desire to avoid the
luminous and exhausting presence of my executive assistant, Miss Lee. Kate
Adie she is not, for which I am grateful. How I sympathise with the Libyans.
But the Kate Adie tendency - shrill imperiousity, horrible vivacity, an
overweening elegance - is fast gaining ground among the 14m women in Britain
who happen to be over 40, including Miss Lee.
Yesterday was especially difficult for it was the first day of May, and we
all know what Kate Adie acolytes do on May 1 if they live in Notting Hill
and are equipped, by genes or medical science, with all that terrible
energy: they don their Jaeger gardening clothes and make copious notes from
the Reader's Digest Gardening Year - a planner's guide to what needs doing
when during the full revolting cycle of the modern gardening calendar.
You would be surprised at the amount of work called for in a Notting Hill
garden in May. Everything needs attention: lawns, roses, dahlias,
chrysanthemums, irises, alpines, water plants and algae, heathers, hedges,
fruit, herbs, patios, slugs.
Yesterday, Miss Lee launched her annual campaign against slugs, aphids and
caterpillars. Also next door's cat. She mixed several vats of poison and
took down her flame-thrower.
Before exiting to the garden, she looked in on me. 'Michael,' said Miss Lee.
'Apart from having your hair cut and cleaning your shoes and starting,
however timidly, to do something about the state of the dining room windows,
what is your game-plan today? Are you writing any words, dazzling us with
any pensees?'
I explained that my main task of the day was packing my suitcase for my
drive to Cesky Krumlov, and rounding up all the books I was at present
half-way through. 'You would be surprised,' I said, 'how many books I am at
present half-way through. They include Elegance, by Helen Bullock. It is
about women over 40 - how, at that age, they are sleek, chic and at their
peak.
'It is riveting,' I continued. 'I now feel I can hold my own whenever the
conversation at a dinner party, as it were, turns to blepharoplasty,
mammoplasty, abdominoplasty or liposuction. I have discovered yoga and earth
dancing; the role of riboflavin; the importance of homestyle, workstyle,
lifestyle and skill development; the truth of the dictum 'Every woman has
clothes but not every woman has something to wear', and why taking a lover
is cheaper than psychoanalysis and healthier than gin when it comes, quote
unquote, to beating marital mid-life blues.'
Miss Lee was furious. 'Who gave you that book?' she demanded.
'The Books editor,' I said.
'He had no right to do so. Anyway, I thought people at the FT were supposed
to write about the reverse yield gap and bankers' follies. Why are you
permitted to write rude pieces about the Olympics or flit off to Nasa so as
to describe the search for extraterrestrial intelligence?'
'Miss Lee,' I said. 'Most of my colleagues do write about the reverse yield
gap or bankers' follies. Subjects like that are known as the core. But the
editorial affairs of the paper are governed by polymaths, renaissance men,
who have determined that the FT's full cosmography should include the
occasional piece on extraterrestrial intelligence or sport or food or
travel.
'These subjects are known as the froth. That is the technical term. I am a
specialist in froth. And under certain improbable circumstances the froth
could be held to include riboflavin and liposuction.'
Miss Lee smouldered. 'If you're so cute,' she said, 'perhaps you ought to
read Chapter 14 of Elegance,' on which note she gathered up her equipment
and swept out to her slugs.
I glanced at Chapter 14. It is entitled Menstyle. It's just what you'd
expect. It includes a list of the 10 things about men that drive women
barmy: unreliability, absenteeism, lying, irresponsibility, helplessness,
stuffiness, dullness, laziness, cruelty, deafness. I did a quick check -
Test Your Manliness With Marks Out Of 10, that sort of thing. My average
score per category was 9.85. Pretty virile, huh?
'Miss Lee,' I shouted. But my cries were drowned by the roar of the
flame-thrower.
Elegance, by Helen Bullock, is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on May 7,
Pounds 16.99.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Switched on to suicide - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B. A. YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL PROBLEMS liable to affect the young people who listen to Radio 1
(sex, drugs and so on) are sometimes treated there with the same
understanding as they pay to more everyday concerns. On Wednesday of this
week, Mark Goodier presented the first of four sessions on the current
problem: suicide.
This is now the third commonest cause of death among our under-25s, and for
every death there are 20 attempts. Two examples were examined, a boy and a
girl, neither of whom had given any warning. Wisely, we heard not
psychiatrists' but family voices, the kind of voice that would be easily
accessible to the sufferer. The programme centred on the need to discuss
distress with others - if not a friend or relation, then the Samaritans. The
Samaritans' number was given constantly during the programme, 0345-909090.
It is always available.
Older listeners should have heard New Men into Wild Men (Radio 4, Thursday).
Nigel Farrell bravely joined a weekend test of the principles laid down by
Robert Bly for the American Men's Movement. They seek to restore the
masculinity men lose by subjection to parents, fathers especially. Physical
exercise is evidently not the answer, but day-long drumming and dancing,
blowing out, hard, 'to expel the angry child', and, most of all, listening
to stories. Stories about the faults of fathers, mostly, but also made-up
stories, like the long saga of the pig-herder and the princess. Well, there
were 110 men with Farrell, and each paid Pounds 300, so watch out for the
new masculine men. Rachel Yorke (feminine) was producer.
Sydney Smith, the subject of Radio 4's four-part Wednesday feature by
Roderick Graham, Trumpets and Foie Gras, was called 'one of the best of
men', not for drumming but mainly for his wit. He rates a page and a half in
The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, and he made sure that his wit reached
the right people, inviting them if necessary to such items as his lectures
on Moral Philosophy ('the most successful swindle of the season,' as he put
it).
Wit is an ideal latchkey into a radio feature; but there was more to Smith
than fun. In the first programme alone, he has been to Winchester and Oxford
(hating both), been a tutor, a curate or better in three counties (as
compelled by the Clerical Residency Act), married, worked on the Edinburgh
Review, begun campaigns against the game laws and for Catholic emancipation.
Never a statesman, not even a bishop, Smith was listened to and admired, as
he still is, in Robert Lang's convincing performance. Jane Morgan directs
these enjoyable programmes.
Of Hamlet I have already written. Perry Pontac's absurd Hamlet Part II
(Radio 3, Monday) had nothing in common with it but iambic pentameters and
all those names. Seltazar, a Danish ambassador, returns after absence abroad
to find everyone he (and we) knew is dead. He marries Claudius's bastard
daughter and resolves to seize the throne. Enter the Ghost, still alive and
keen to resume his reign. So Seltazar re-murders him; but the Ghost, having
foreseen this, has poisoned him. If they really needed a Part II, why not
Alethea Hayter's Horatio's Version (Faber, 1972), very funny, and actually
based on Hamlet?
A Different Woman (Radio 4, Tuesday) was by Perry Pontac in a slightly
better vein. Ageing plastic surgeon Dr Bratcher (Peter Jeffrey) marries his
ugly, stupid servant Melda (Alison Steadman), intending to turn her
surgically into a beauty and so earn himself a reputation. Successfully
beautified, however, she naturally elopes with the first more attractive
chap to ask her. Not a bad joke, though only extended to 30 minutes by
Pontac's way of making lists of everything. Richard Wortley directed both of
these.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Lepage catches the blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU want to see a truly pretentious, self-indulgent bit of theatre, hurry
to the Cottesloe where there only 16 performances of Needles and Opium,
described as 'a new solo piece written, performed and directed by Robert
Lepage'.
One line in the text just about sums it up: 'Jean-Paul Sartre doesn't live
here any more.' The monologue goes on: 'In other words, he's been dead for
about 10 years,' and, here I begin to paraphrase, 'but since the caller
didn't believe me, I told him to call back later.'
The date is roughly accurate. Sartre, the French playwright and philosopher
whose name will be forever coupled with existentialism and Simone de
Beauvoir, died in 1980. You can be forgiven for thinking that he disappeared
many years earlier. It is remarkable that anyone should wish to bring him
back.
Also making a comeback is Jean Cocteau, another French writer described in
Needles and Opium as 'the prince of French poets'. On the strength of a 20
day visit to New York in 1949, on the aeroplane back to Paris he wrote a
'Letter to the Americans' telling them that the new world was not so bad
after all: it had such wonderful jazz. 'I know that bible trumpet, that
trumpet dear to black people,' Cocteau explained. 'When Louis Armstrong puts
it to his lips the sound rises to an angel's cry. What does this cry mean?'
Lepage may be trying to tell us.
At the same time as Cocteau went to the US, Miles Davis was making his first
visit to Europe. He was even more impressed by the old world than Cocteau
was by the new. He met Sartre, Picasso and Juliette Greco and was so
miserable about returning to America that on the flight home he was unable
to speak. This, one supposes, is the Franco-American synthesis: American
jazz and French intellectualism. One day, we are told, a bit of Davis's lip
fell off into his trumpet 'like sperm into a womb': It was the birth of the
Miles sound.
Of the two good things in this production, one is the playing of some of the
Davis music in the background. The other is the versatility and charm of
Lepage as he leaps about flying the Atlantic and talking on the telephone.
The rest is dire. A lot of the action, such as it is, takes place on screen:
from behind the scenes come the recurrent sounds of a female orgasm.
Lepage is director of French Theatre at Canada's National Arts Centre and
has a high international reputation. On the evidence of Needles and Opium he
is living in the 1960s, when he might have been thought adventurous. One
looks forward with curiosity to his production of A Midsummer Night's Dream
at the Royal National Theatre in July. At least he will have better
material.
In repertory at the Cottesloe in association with Cultural Industry Ltd.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: All eyes on Mayfest - A preview of the Glasgow
galleries participating in this month's festivities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE few years since its inception, Glasgow's Mayfest has become an
important fixture in the British cultural calendar. Natural civic pride and
rivalry apart, it is hardly yet the equal of Edinburgh as an international
festival of the arts, but who would now say, with enthusiasm on the one
side, and complacency on the other, that a full reversal of the relative
positions was impossible?
So far as the visual arts are concerned, the issue is already nicely
balanced. Glasgow may not yet boast the major exhibitions which Edinburgh's
museums have always the good sense to offer at festival time, with the city
full of visitors. But that effort is usually qualified by a wish to distance
it from the Festival as such, opening particular shows well beforehand and
running them on long afterwards. As for the Festival authorities, their
current advance literature is innocent of any reference to the visual arts
at all.
But Mayfest has always integrated the visual element into its programme.
This year there may be no single outstanding offering, but across the
spectrum, from public to private, some 15 galleries are participating, with
all but two of them open by this weekend, and a further eight listed in
association.
To try the flavour, I visited four shows, one of which, at the Collins
Gallery (22 Richmond Street: until June 6), with the opening due on Friday
night, was on Thursday morning but a flurry of carpentry, paint and
wallpaper and a gleam in the artist's eye. 'Access', by Jim Buckley, is to
be an installation that takes further the images he first developed in his
sculpture. This he based on the old peepshow principle, making boxes with
interiors that proposed their own imaginative scale and reality.
Here, in one darkened gold-papered room, Buckley has set into the wall four
large display transparencies taken from the boxes he showed in Kunst Europa
in Germany last year, the images imagined, richly decorated, sanctuary-like
interiors. The other room, white and light, holds seven peepholes through
which to view photographic details of actual architectural interiors found
in the city itself.
Cyril Gerber was the first dealer to bring modern and contemporary art to
Glasgow, and he stands naturally at the heart of Mayfest. At his personal
gallery (148 West Regent Street: until May 23) he shows Benjamin Creme, a
Glaswegian painter now 70 but long neglected. The work here is of the 1940s,
when Creme was taken up by the emigre Polish painters Josef Herman and
Jankel Adler then living in Glasgow, and the 1950s when he was in London and
one of the circle of Minton, MacBryde, Colquhoun and others. The figure
drawings and paintings are especially interesting, sophisticated in their
modernism, after Braque and Matisse, yet direct and personal in feeling and
character.
Up the road at his Compass Gallery (178 West Regent Street: until May 21),
Gerber is showing the recent work of a most distinctive Scottish
print-maker, Elspeth Lamb. With her 'Cornerstones', she offers us the fruit
of a recent visit to Mexico where she was particularly taken both by the
popular festivals of the Day of the Dead and the ancient architectural
carvings and hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza, Teotihuacan and Quetzalcoatl.
But what makes her show remarkable is not so much the imagery as the medium
by which she has developed and quite literally expressed it. Making the
paper herself, saturating the pulp with pigment, she at once simplifies and
concentrates the image while impressing it into the very fabric of her
material. The paper is itself the image: and rich and dense and beautiful
too.
The Transmission Gallery (28 King Street) is a co-operative run by a
changing committee of five artists to show not their own but the work of
artists they would wish to see. Throughout May it offers a group show - a
collaborative relief-cum-lightwork by Paul Maguire and Simon Starling,
consisting of three isometric cubes, small, medium and large, described by
white neon tubes; four cibachrome prints of a leather holster, by Michael
McDonough; and a set of of ironically dispassionate photographs of taped and
sand-bagged windows, taken in Zagreb last November by Donald Urquhart.
Small, black and white, the format insistent in its simple frontality, the
plastic bags oddly disturbing in the way they are heaped and trussed, they
are rather impressive.

<DATELINE>
   THE RAMBERT tradition of finding new choreographers
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
as old as the company, and hence as old as our ballet in this century -
continues with this week's creative workshops at Riverside Studios. Six
dancers from the company have produced new work. In commenting upon such
shorn lambs, critical wind has to be tempered. That these debutants have
made dances worth showing to the public is in itself an achievement. An
awful lot of nonsense litters the modern dance scene. (I treasure the memory
of Marie Rambert storming out of one performance in the 1960s, tossing away
her programme with a ringing declaration of 'rubbish', as a proper
response). The present Rambert editorial process has saved us from anything
too embarrassing, and though the new works are uneven, none disgraces the
company name. Solos by Glenn Wilkinson and Gary Lambert were evidence of the
influence exerted by Laurie Booth. Both creators are plainly taken by the
curving lines of dynamics that mark Booth's choreography for himself. Both
extend this manner in terms of their own considerable technical skills.
Wilkinson's dance looks lighter in musculature, movement oiling over the
stage (though he seems occasionally to have been trapped into awkward
transitions). It is mercurial, attractive. Lambert's solo is set to rap
poetry, whose images provide occasional pauses and gestural references for a
dance that is exact in its phrasing, stimulating (and taxing) in its flow of
energy. Both pieces are well worth watching.
I liked, too, Sara Matthews' Passing Through which has the audacity to use
the andante from Beethoven's 'Ghost' trio. Seven dancers in pale costumes
cross the stage, return for solos and duets, and their movement never
offends Beethoven. It is quiet, contemplative dance, with particularly
touching work for Jacqueline Jones and Paul Old, particularly well done.
Impossible to expect the choreography to reveal even part of what the music
does, but the matching of mood for mood is sensitive,and the movement is
fluent, grateful to watch.
Two studies, by Colin Poole and Sarah Worsop, were necessary exercises by
apprentice talents, but I found Mark Baldwin's Gone altogether more
considerable. Using Grieg piano music, he offered a series of half-serious,
half-mocking movement sketches that sat with an off-beat appositeness upon
the music's naivetes. Lee Boggess behaved like a strange bird; Amanda
Britton drew unexpected shapes; other dancers ran, posed, were caught up in
a secret world of games and relationships. There were moments that seemed
bland, but Mark Baldwin is a choreographer. And as a traveller's note, let
me again record that Hammersmith's abominable metro station and underpasses
is a hell-spot, dangerous, confusing, hideous.
Rambert Dance Company workshops continue at Riverside Studios until May 2

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Pop goes Covent Garden - Off the wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
THERE IS just a chance that this week saw the end of one of the arts world's
more depressing annual rituals - Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the
Royal Opera House, explaining away yet another nasty deficit for Covent
Garden.
This does not necessarily mean that Isaacs has finally had enough of the
constant bitching about the Garden and is returning to the more peaceful
world of commercial television, but that there now seems to be the will on
all sides for one final heave to settle Covent Garden's funding problems.
Actually 1991-92 was not too bad for the Opera House - a shortfall of Pounds
1.6m on a turnover of around Pounds 45m, contributing to an accumulated
deficit of Pounds 3.3m. Isaacs had been over optimistic in trying to solve
the financial problem by raising seat prices during a recession. Lower
attendances - 88 per cent capacity for opera, 82 per cent for ballet -
accounted for Pounds 1m of the shortfall. The rest came from another of
those niggling industrial disputes, this time involving the orchestra, which
seem to have disappeared from the rest of British industry.
The Arts Council has given Covent Garden four years to wipe away its
deficit. It hopes to deliver Pounds 1m of it in 1992-93, mainly by cutting
overheads and expenses and saving on production costs. Isaacs argues that he
has raised income from box office and sponsorship to the practical limit,
reducing Covent Garden's dependence on subsidy from almost 60 per cent of
turnover to 38 per cent. Now he is placing the future of the Royal Opera
House in the hands of consultants.
Two such scrutinies are currently under way - one organised by the Arts
Council and led by Lady Warnock, one commissioned by Covent Garden itself
from Price Waterhouse. When these are completed at the end of the summer,
some sort of deal should materialise. No doubt a few management flaws will
be exposed; some savings, perhaps involving more redundancies, pinpointed.
Covent Garden will wield the axe, and the Arts Council will promise more
money - over a period.
Of course, in arts subsidy terms it will seem like a great deal of money.
The Royal Opera House already gets Pounds 17.8m a year, much to the fury of
smaller arts companies. Finally divesting itself of the Birmingham Royal
Ballet could make the sums seem more reasonable.
But these days the final decision does not rest with the Arts Council. It
will be the gift of David Mellor, the new Secretary for National Heritage,
who is not known as a great lover of the Opera House. Fortunately an even
more powerful figure, the Prime Minister, bolstered by his wife, believes
that London must have a world ranking opera house. This should clinch the
deal.
In the meantime, financial stringency means that Covent Garden has produced
an attractively popular programme for 1992-93: the Glyndebourne production
of Porgy and Bess; the rarely seen Stiffelio by Verdi; and two cut price new
production's, Handel's Alcina and La Damnation de Faust by Berlioz. The
revivals have an obvious box office appeal and include Tosca, Fidelio,
Otello and Madama Butterfly. There are also appearances by Pavarotti,
Domingo and Carreras - who, despite nightly fees in excess of Pounds 12,000,
perform wonderfully at the box office, which is where the big dramas of the
season will take place.
*
Has there been a dramatic sea change in the fortunes of Sotheby's and
Christie's, who fight tooth and nail for supremacy in the world antiques
market? Until the mid 1950s Christie's was traditionally dominant. Then
Peter Wilson drove Sotheby's to the fore and in the last decade the
entrepreneurial skills of its new American boss Alf Taubman extended its
lead.
But in 1992 Christie's keeps on capturing the star lots and is certainly now
the larger in the UK and Europe: it could end the season as the leading
auction house in the world. In recently weeks it has sold a copy of
Audubon's Birds of America for a record Pounds 2.3m; disposed of the Vung
Tau cargo of sunken Chinese porcelain for Pounds 4m; brought in made a
record Pounds 4.6m from the Compton sword collection; and sold a Canaletto
to Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.12m.
It is now poised to do better in the sector that Sotheby's pioneered so
prosperously - Impressionist and modern art. Can it really be just two years
ago when a Van Gogh sold in New York for Dollars 82.5m? Since then it has
been downhill all the way. Estimates on some the Impressionists and Modern
pictures on offer this May in New York are up to 50 per cent lower than on
comparable art in 1990, sometimes more.
But at least the salerooms are prepared to risk offering important pictures.
Here again Christie's has the edge, testing the market with a painting that
provides a wonderful snapshot of current demand. Renoir's 'La Loge' is a
smaller, less finished, version of the famous painting in the Courtauld. In
1989 its German owner paid Dollars 12.1m for it. It now carries an estimate
of Dollars 6m-Dollars 8m - and the reputation of Impressionist art.
Even more hangs on Braque's 'Atelier VIII', his great late painting, which
has an estimate of up to Dollars 10m and will set the tone for 20th century
art. It has a curious history. Braque sold it to the collector Douglas
Cooper on the understanding that it should never leave France. In 1972
Cooper adopted a young American, Bill McCarty, and left him the bulk of his
fortune. McCarty-Cooper lived off the bequest but has now died of AIDS and
the Braque is to be sold off in New York.
By Christie's, of course.
*
The Washington, nay the American, art establishment was rocked by the
surprise resignation of the patrician Carter Brown from the directorship of
the National Gallery of Art. Then came the shock news that the favoured
successor, John Walsh of the Getty Museum at Malibu, had declined to take
over. Rusty Powell of Los Angeles County Museum of Art will now be the new
director.
*
Anyone seeking signs of the end of the recession should look no further than
Brooks classic car auction on Thursday. Prices of classic cars have been in
free fall since 1989. Now there are signs of a remarkable revival. A 1933
Alfa Romeo sold for Pounds 462,000 and a 1956 Jaguar D-Type for Pounds
429,000. Neither had a reserve: they just had to go, making the prices quite
extraordinary. Even Ferraris were selling. Brooks is unusual among the car
auctioneers in allowing prospective buyers to test drive some of the lots on
offer. This seems to have converted potential buyers into keen bidders.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Selling off the family chateau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARIS antique dealer Bernard Steinitz, purveyor of the very best in
18th-century French furniture, has been forced to sell off his country home,
a Loire chateau no less, plus its entire contents, at considerable speed.
Steinitz, who at the end of June opens new five-storey premises on Grafton
Street in London and a new office in New York, says he had to sell the
chateau to raise cash for yet another venture, a large auction house complex
he plans to build in the Paris suburb of Saint Ouen.
Steinitz, who caused a stir in the Paris art world this month by resigning
from the powerful group of antique dealers known as 'Les Antiquaires a
Paris', bought the 18-room Chateau Saint Paul de Cornillon 20 years ago
complete with its furnishing. Perched on a rocky outcrop overlooking the
Loire, the castle was built in the 13th century and restored in the 17th and
18th centuries.
Steinitz has put the property in the hands of estate agents and asked
Jacques Tajan of the Paris auction firm Ader Tajan to sell the contents. The
sale will be held in the castle during the last week of May. About 1,000
items will go under the hammer, a third of them top-quality furniture which
Steinitz has acquired over the years. Experts are still on the spot
inspecting the lots and a catalogue will not be ready until ten days before
the auction, but Tajan gave an early and extremely cautious estimate of
around Ffr20m for the whole lot.
Most of the furniture is 17th and 18th century. Outstanding items include 12
Louis XIV chairs in extremely fine condition, Henry IV chairs with original
embroidered covers, Savonnerie carpets, 17th-century Cordoba leather wall
hangings, period wood panelling of which Steinitz has the largest collection
in the world, and a number of very fine French and Flemish cabinets.
For the past two years Steinitz has worked from a sumptuously-furnished
'hotel particulier' on the Faubourg Saint Honore. The site he plans to
develop is some five acres of workshops and warehouses he bought from the
firm Wonder in 1986 at Saint Ouen, to stock and restore furniture. At the
time Wonder was in the hands of multi-millionaire businessman Bernard Tapie,
last month appointed minister of the Town by president Mitterrand, and
Steinitz has been quick to scotch rumours that the new member of the
socialist government has played any role at all in his venture.
At the end of last year Steinitz finally obtained planning permission to
build a large auction house, along with restoration workshops and office
facilities for a transport company, plus a bank and a hotel. The whole
scheme will employ a total of 1,000 people and the local council is
supplying new roads. Steinitz says he aims to benefit from the new relaxed
French legislation on auctioning to create an art market centre of European
dimensions.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING ON video recently Errol Morris's new film based on Stephen
Hawking's A Brief History Of Time (Palace), I noticed that - no, no, wait,
let me first explain the Andrews Theory of Time.
The first principle of this is that there are only so many hours in a day.
The second is that time is curved, so you can meet yourself watching A Brief
History Of Time before or after you thought you had finished watching it.
Let me explain. Firstly, I had seen much of Errol Morris's film before, in a
film about the making of Errol Morris's film. The project was set up by
Steven Spielberg who does not skimp on pre-publicity. Secondly I glanced at
the Radio Times and discovered that what I thought was an exclusive video
premiere (rara avis]) is on Channel Four for all to see this Sunday at 8.30.
pm.
So I shall not pre-empt your enjoyment beyond commending Morris's skilful
interweaving of the biographical and scientific-philosophical in expounding
Hawking's life and ideas. However, these thoughts about Time have stayed
with me. Over recent days I have laid the scientific basis for a new
understanding of Subjective and Objective Time. Take an everyday household
example. Have you noticed that when you drop a boiled egg on the floor time
simultaneously contracts and expands? Your whole life appears to flash
before you, in only a few seconds, as you see your breakfast destroyed by a
chance accident.
In video-watching this Subjective Time - extending or shrinking according to
the intensity of the viewing experience offered - can be enhanced or negated
by a volitional use of Objective Time. For instance: my favourite video
releases this month are Cecil B DeMille's biblical epic Samson And Delilah
(CIC), Jean Renoir's great tragicomedy of manners La Regle Du Jeu
(Connoisseur), Jocelyn Moorhouse's teasing tale of a blind photographer
Proof (Artificial Eye) and Spike Lee's edgy race-war comedy Jungle Fever.
The minutes seem to fly by in these films, even though the viewer's hand
will frequently arrest time to replay a favourite sequence. What is more,
time can be made to move backwards. In Samson And Delilah I replayed Victor
Mature's destruction of the Temple of Dagon in reverse. Ever since I was a
child I wanted to do this: to see the million-dollar Paramount pillars rise
again from the rubble. And in Moorhouse's brilliant Australian fable about
the blind leading the sighted - the unseeing young hero fools the spiteful
girl helper who tries to trip up his daily life - I could retrace the subtle
suspense steps by which the director herself leads us on.
The opposite is also true. However much you fast-forward through insomnia
cures like this month's The Rookie (Warners), a dud Clint Eastwood cop
opera, or Millennium (Warners), a certifiable sci-fi romp, or The Package
(Virgin), in which Gene Hackman tries to win the Cold War before anyone can
tell him it is over, time does not travel any faster. Indeed time appears to
become slower while the viewer's own activity rate, vis-a-vis the remote
control module, accelerates.
These videos are known as Black Holes and should be avoided. Concentrate
instead on the fact that we live in an expanding universe, as Stephen
Hawking demonstrates, and the video market obeys the cosmic rules. Many
films that used to be a certain length on the large screen are now, yes,
longer on the small. Take Aliens: The Special Edition (Fox). Available in
this form for only three months, James Cameron's monster movie starring
Sigourney Weaver now contains 17 extra minutes of ravening, jaw-dripping,
thoroughly enjoyable horror.
This principle of longer video versions for home viewing is borrowed not
from Einstein or Hawking, I believe, but from Washing Machine Theory. If you
go to a launderette (equivalent of a cinema), you expect to have your
clothes washed and dried in 90 minutes max. But at home - what is the hurry
and where are you going? - your machine can take three hours to cleanse the
same load. As I pointed out recently on another page, we live in a new age.
Different movies for different viewing modes; and with video, uniquely, you
can be your own editor, programmer and projectionist.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST memory of the original D'Oyly Carte company is of a ramshackle
Ruddigore during its final season at the Adelphi in the Strand, when the
orchestra scratched and scraped its way through the score and the prompter
was the person who usually got in with the best lines first. The next day it
was announced that the company was closing for good.
At the time that was a punishment that seemed to fit the crime. Now the
'New' D'Oyly Carte Opera Company has taken up the Gilbert and Sullivan
inheritance. It has new headquarters in Birmingham and new productions to
counter the charge that it is trying to revive an operatic corpse. Like its
predecessor, it also goes on the road and this week arrived for a season in
London at Sadler's Wells.
The two shows it has to offer are The Mikado and The Yeomen of the Guard.
Although they prove to be very different evenings, they have one quality in
common, which is a decidedly better standard of musical preparation than was
heard during the dying gasps of the old D'Oyly Carte, with a strong chorus
and reasonably alert orchestral playing. No need for the Mikado to deal out
any executions there.
Unfortunately the productions are up and down - in the case of The Mikado
thumbs down, right from the beginning. The place is Japan, as it should be,
but with modern fixtures and fittings. Everything is slick with Japanese
high-tech precision. The routines work to the split second. The smiles flick
on and off at the touch of a switch and the characters are as heartfelt as
comic automata. The controversial ENO production may have put the show in a
wrongheaded setting, but at least it had people one could care about.
Reaction is likely to be conditioned by the way one responds to Ko-Ko, who
comes on enveloped in an imposing cloak which opens to reveal nothing more
than a pathetic, pint-sized wimp in pink leggings. From then on Fenton Gray
works overtime to get a laugh and by the end you are exhausted, even if he
is not. John Rath's Mikado and Jill Pert's Katisha are nearer the mark. But
there is something wrong with a Mikado when one does not care whether
Yum-Yum and Nanki-Poo get it together or not.
There are few affectionate smiles on the way in that production. But if The
Yeomen of the Guard invites still fewer, it is because the work itself is
less sharp in comic content and Andrew Wickes, the producer of both pieces,
this time shows a more sympathetic understanding of his subject. In the text
the Tower of London is described as 'the cruel giant in a fairy-tale' and
the designs by James Hendy, atmospherically lit, catch just the right
Victorian Gothic quality.
The cast includes many of the same singers, with John Rath again resonantly
imposing as the Lieutenant and Janine Roebuck a warm Phoebe. Terence Sharpe
sings strongly as Sergeant Meryll and Gary Montaine makes Shadbolt a less
odious creature than usual. In short, the relationships work and the comedy
is natural. For those who look upon two G&amp;S shows in a week as too much of a
good thing, this is the one to choose.
Sadler's Wells (071 278-8916) Season runs until May 16

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Poetry cut down to size - The protagonists of
'Imagism', Ezra Pound and Hilda Doolittle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN DID the modern movement in literature actually begin? Virginia Wolfe
had a ready answer to that question: 'On or about December 1910,' she wrote,
'human character changed.' Not human character itself, of course, but the
way it was represented in the language of literature. And the agent that
changed? A tireless American literary entrepeneur-cum-poet by the name of
Ezra Pound, and the movement in poetry that he created in 1912 called
imagism, which was celebrated in a series of events at the South Bank last
weekend as a part of its continuing festival, Towards the Next Millennium.
The young Ezra Pound had arrived in London in 1908 for the express purpose
of sitting at the feet of WB Yeats, the only poet of value in the
English-speaking world, in his opinion. Edwardian London was no place for a
young, energetic poet-to-be - the feeble energies of the 1890s were spent;
poetry seemed all lush and loose, the piping of mindless Swinburnian muzak.
Pound set about to change all that.
By 1912, he had formulated a set of principles for the writing of a new,
more vigorous kind of poetry that would be equal to the demands of a new
era. These principles would have an enormous influence upon the way poetry
would be written and discussed throughout the 20th century. In Pound's
opinion, there were three cardinal virtues: precision - poets must be
precise and concise in their use of language; vers libre - free verse should
be used as a way of freeing the poet from the trammels of dead metrical
structures; but, above all else, the poet should employ hard, clear,
concrete images. Abstract formulations had had their day.
The movement was brought to birth in the British Museum tea rooms in June
1912. Pound had been joined in London by fellow Pennsylvanian poet Hilda
Doolittle, a childhood friend. He asked to see some of her poems and,
leaning over her shoulder, he corrected them in accordance with his new
principles. Then he signed them for her: 'HD Imagiste'. A movement was born;
and so was its most representative poet.
HD remained faithful to the principles of imagism for most of the rest of
that decade. Her poems were just what Pound seemed to have ordered as a
tonic for the scribbling tribe: hard, clear, and short. In spite of the fact
that they were usually set in Grecian landscapes and concerned themselves
almost exclusively with figures out of Greek myth, there were no needless
ornamentations, no quaint devices and no archaism. And HD, the Hellenist,
espoused and sponsored by Ezra, became a fashionable commodity in Edwardian
London, where Greekness seemed to be everywhere: it was modish to go about
in sandal-shod feet; to purchase sculpture with Greek curls; and to be seen
reading Andrew Lang's translations of Homer.
The French spelling of 'imagism' as 'imagisme' is instructive. Some of the
theoretical justifications for the new movement derived from the philosophy
of Bergson and the practice of the French symbolist poets, and Pound himself
was probably pleased to have coined a name that had just a touch of Parisian
eclat - it would help to Europeanise him. Had not HD herself called him
'immensely sophisticated, immensely superior,' but also 'immensely rough and
ready?'
The Imagist movement waxed and waned for a decade, firstly under Pound's
brief tutelage, and later under that of Amy Lowell, an American poet of
uneven talent whom Pound heartily despised - perhaps because she was his
equal in energy and influence. Pound called her movement 'Amygism' and
condemned her for prolixity. And yet for all her faults as a poet she had
the good editorial sense to publish the verse of DH Lawrence, James Joyce
and William Carlos Williams in the Imagist anthologies that appeared later
in that decade.
The imagist movement itself had petered out by the end of the decade - but
the influence of its principles upon poetry and literary modernism endured.
It became the norm in both England and America for poets to write short,
concisely expressed lyric poems with hard, clear images at their emotional
epicentres; but, equally importantly, imagism fed into the way in which
novelists approached the task of writing their fiction.
Ulysses seems like a concatenation of hard, bright images when viewed in the
light of those principles; some of the greatest passages from Women in Love
derive their impact from the way in which DH Lawrence seems to make the
images of natural things speak for themselves. And it is also to be blamed
and praised in about equal measure for much of the notorious obscurity. of
20th century poetry, from TS Eliot's Waste Land to Pound's Cantos - those
super-imagistic exercises in which all pretence at discursive, linking
commentary has been abandoned almost entirely, to the shock and bewilderment
of a thousand uninitiated A-level candidates.
The poetry and prose of Ezra Pound are published by Faber and Faber. The
poetry of HD is available from Carcanet Press.

THE ARTS OF THE THIRD REICH
by Peter Adam
Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 24.95, 322 pages
'YOU artists live in great and happy times. The Fuhrer loves artists,
because he is himself one] Oh century of artists] What a joy to be part of
it,' raved Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's Propaganda Minister, when the Nazis
came to power in 1933. But the truth was that German culture was never so
barren as during the Third Reich. Not one significant artist or writer lent
continuous support to the regime, and almost every major intellectual or
cultural figure, from Brecht and Beckmann to Freud and Mann, fled the Reich
by 1939.
This book tells the story of the art that remained. In the visual arts, the
battle lines were boldly drawn in 1937 with the two Munich exhibitions,
degenerate art and the great German art exhibition. The first aimed to set
the German public against 'Bolshevik-Jewish' modernists like Chagall, Grosz,
Kokoschka and Klee, by cramming their work together on walls daubed with
graffiti slogans such as 'Insults to German Womanhood' and 'The Niggerising
of the Visual Arts'. It was a sensational hit, attracting far bigger crowds
than its companion exhibition, a showcase of Nazi-approved paintings of
Aryan nudes, brawny peasants and Bavarian mountains.
It is these latter pictures, unknown today, that are reproduced here. Adam
discovered them hidden in vaults and archives, and his catalogue forms a
devastating record of narrow and reactionary themes and flat, wooden
execution: youths bringing in the harvest; soldiers waving farewell to their
Alpine homes; chillingly perfect gods and goddesses. The iconography is
rooted in Nazi ideals: from Adolf Ziegler's blond maidens in 'The Four
Elements', which hung in Hitler's drawing-room (the French ambassador
rechristened it 'The Four Senses - Taste is Missing') to the giant
neo-classical 'Seven Deadly Sins' starring Chamberlain and Churchill as
gluttony.
Nationalism, nostalgia, a return to rural values, Hellenism, romanticism:
the intellectual backcloth to these paintings reflects cultural ideas
widespread across late 19th and 20th century Europe. But Hitler played on
specifically German strands - the volk heritage, revivals like the
Nibelungen myth, the racist current in Wagner, Nietszche and the German
super-soul. Anti-international feeling after the First World War was crucial
to Hitler's appeal and he manipulated it in his cultural policy: in a time
of social despair he united the big city, with Jewish commerce and
international art as the common enemy. So out went Velasquez with 'The
bastard types Spain is so full of' and Gauguin's 'black girlfriends', along
with modernism, cubism, Dadaism.
Adam's roll call of who was in and out of favour is illuminating, but his
woeful text, repetitive, banal and incoherently argued, misses the crucial
implications of his research. How, he asks every few pages, could the
artists have collaborated? But the point was that they did not: all artists
of stature fled. Only a few older painters of rural scenes, which Hitler
perverted for his own means, and hack painters of propaganda pictures,
remained.
The exceptions were the architects. Some of Albert Speer's models, and
Sagebiel's design for Tempelhof airport, are innovative and original. Hitler
lost his artists because he tried to turn them into reactionary mouthpieces,
but kept his architects because his mammoth ambitions for German cities and
his bottomless coffers gave them unlimited scope which, as Speer said later,
led them to turn a blind eye to the atrocities making this possible. Adam
acknowledges no difference between either the quality of the work or the
motivation here. But even Goebbels and Goering lamented the feebleness of
Nazi painters - Goering collected forbidden Gauguins and had portraits of
his children painted by Otto Dix, who was condemned in the degenerate art
show. Speer was by contrast honoured as one of the most powerful men in the
Third Reich.
Finally, although Adam does not touch on the theme, his book is about the
importance of art. The Nazis banned Expressionist paintings because the
despair and violence and anguish they represented told disturbing truths;
yet Hitler knew the power of culture and was concerned that his hoped-for
renaissance of German art was not forthcoming.
This is a book to buy for the illustrations, which catalogue the aesthetic
results of a murderous regime, and to take along as a companion to the
reconstruction of the 1937 degenerate art exhibition, now in Berlin. The
juxtaposition demonstrates one of the most positive aspects of political-art
history: but with a few exceptions, great art has always stood out against
terror and on the side of humanity.

CLAIRE CLAIRMONT AND THE SHELLEYS
by Robert Gittings and Jo Manton
Oxford Pounds 20, 292 pages
'I WOULD willingly think that my memory may not be lost in oblivion as my
life has been,' wrote Claire Clairmont in old age. As a shadowy figure on
the margins of the Romantic circle that included Shelley, Byron and Mary
Shelley, she has usually been presented as a brief digression in other
people's lives. But, ironically, she spent much of her own life writing
herself out of literary history and suppressing 'the disastrous hauntings
that seemed inseparable with my name.'
If Claire is remembered at all, it is as rather a pain in the neck - tagging
along with Shelley and Mary when they eloped to France, or driving her
beloved Byron up the wall. This sympathetic biography by the late Robert
Gittings and his wife Jo Manton is designed to dig beneath the unattractive
image - which was first put about by Mary Shelley's manipulative
daughter-in-law - and to rehabilitate Claire as an individual in her own
right. Yet despite Jo Manton's valiant attempts to give equal weight to
Claire's later, rootless career as a governess, the first 24 years, narrated
by Robert Gittings, remain the most compelling.
Born in 1798, the illegitimate daughter of prosy, capable Mrs Clairmont,
Claire's life took off at the age of three when her mother married the
notorious radical William Godwin. His house was always full of books and
ideas, and one of Claire's earliest memories was of listening in terror,
from behind the sofa, to Coleridge reading aloud from The Ancient Mariner.
It was an outwardly happy, if irregular, household, with a mixed bunch of
children. Claire's closest companion was her elder step-sister, Mary.
Claire's role in the triangular relationship which developed when Shelley
fell for 16-year-old Mary and the three of them ran away together is hard to
pin down. Though Gittings seems certain that Claire never slept with
Shelley, all three were entangled in an intensely complex matrix of mixed
emotions. Where Mary was depressive, Claire was volatile, sometimes to the
point of hysteria. Shelley, hero-worshipped by both, was histrionic.
However mutually supportive they were capable of being, Mary and Claire had
a difficult relationship marked by suppressed rivalry. Though Gittings only
hints at it, it seems likely that Claire's next adventure  - introducing
herself into Byron's lee - was motivated in part by a sense of
competitiveness with her step-sister.
If Shelley was glamorous, Byron was a superstar. And, like hundreds of other
teenage girls, Claire wrote him a fan letter. Unlike most, however, she was
as direct as she was persistent and, booking a hotel, she invited him to
spend the night with her. Byron never regarded her as much more than a
one-night stand, and was only persuaded to prolong the relationship by the
prospect of being introduced to Shelley, whom he found fascinating.
But Byron's desertion of Claire and his insistence on having sole custody of
their daughter Allegra, who died aged five in an Italian convent, shows him
to have been neither true nor honourable.
Allegra's death was soon followed by Shelley's. Claire was doubly
traumatised. Her decision to cut herself off from her family and take up the
nomadic existence of a governess, living among strangers first in Russia and
then all over Europe, and religiously hiding her past from those she met,
suggests someone afraid of getting too involved in relationships for fear of
being hurt. However sophisticated and self-possessed she appeared in
company, her inner life, though buried, seems never quite to have recovered.
Perhaps because they are at pains to rescue Claire from the charge of being
'hysterical', levelled at her both by Byron and by later generations of
Shelleys, Gittings and Manton stress her independent spirit and vitality of
character. But though not into psychoanalysis, it is interesting how her
more neurotic, vulnerable side keeps surfacing.
It is easy to be tempted into lurid fantasies about the Shelley circle, and
to see its members as larger-than-life actors in a tragic melodrama  - which
is how Mary's daughter-in-law, guardian of the Shelley shrine, seems to have
wanted to portray them when she offered a life-sized marble Mary supporting
Shelley's naked corpse to the embarrassed vicar of St Peter's, Bournemouth.
By allowing an undercurrent of unheroic emotional confusion to penetrate
their portraits of Mary and Claire, Manton and Gittings have succeeded in
humanising them.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Books: Reflections on Spain / A look at the plethora of
books triggered by Columbus and the Barcelona Olympics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN THERE be anyone who has failed to notice that this is Spain's year?
Publishers are determined to remind us. Columbus, Seville, Barcelona - by
the end of 1992 Spain will have spun full circle and returned to its former
empire glory.
Robert Hughes, art critic of Time magazine, has written an enjoyably
irascible history of Spain's greatest non-Spanish city, Barcelona (Harvill
Pounds 20). His view of Barcelona is, naturally, coloured by its
architectural and artistic past, with wonderfully intemperate side-swipes at
its designer-mania present. Hughes loves Barcelona and Catalonia but his
passion is clear-headed enough to be infuriated by some of the contemporary
characteristics of his beloveds.
Hughes is at his most entertaining when he yokes erudition and ill-humour
together, as when dealing with the Japanese tourist obsession with Antoni
Gaud's unfinished Sagrada Familia: 'Nobody in Barcelona is quite sure why
the Japanese have fixed on Gaud in this way . . . One thing is sure: the
Sagrada Familia is the first Catholic temple whose bacon was ever saved by
Shinto tourism. Not even Gaud, who believed in miracles, could have foreseen
that.'
It is strange that a writer who is both a native Spanish speaker and widely
recognised as a great novelist should have contributed in this Year of Spain
a far less impressive, indeed in some passages quite bonkers, history of
both Spain and its relationship with Latin America: The Buried Mirror:
Reflections on Spain and the New World by Carlos Fuentes (Andre Deutsch
Pounds 20).
The design of Fuentes' book - lots of lavish black and white photographs -
as well as the fact that it accompanies yet another television series,
indicates a coffee-table audience. With a name and pictures you can get away
with anything - at least that seems the assumption. From orgasmic nonsense
over bullfighting ('The matador is a tragic representation of man's relation
to nature, the actor in a ceremony of remembrance of our violent survival at
the expense of nature') to constructing false myths to fit preconceived
views of history (such as sentimentalising Gaud at his death as 'an
anonymous artisan') Fuentes' book is the kind of stuff to give apoplexy to
Hughes. Fuentes promises historical sweep but ends up mailing us postcards
from his sweepings.
Far more entertaining is Barcelonas, by Manuel Vazquez Montalban (Verso
Pounds 17.95). Vazquez is one of Barcelona's leading journalists and author
of books ranging from crime fiction to Catalan cookery. His view of
Barcelona is wonderfully sardonic and off-beat. Vazquez does not much like
the thought of his city's Olympics and points out the social frictions the
Games have exacerbated among the city's poor, many of whose squalid homes
have been bulldozed out of its path.
He has a grim style: 'When Franco's occupying troops entered the city,
fourth on the list of organisations to be purged, after the Communists, the
Anarchists and the Separatists, was Barcelona Football Club.' And he
confirms Hughes' assertion that Barcelonans have a Swiftian scatalogical
obsession, by analysing the sociology of Barcelona's sewers: 'regular visits
to today's sewers would act as a perfect counterbalance to the conceit of
urban man.' Odd, but wonderfully unlike pre-masticated cornflakes.
Gijs van Hensbergen also avoids the cornflake factor in his A Taste of
Castille (Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 17.95). In 1986 he upped sticks and left
England in order to learn how to cook pigs' trotters (and much else) in a
Segovian restaurant. That may not sound a recipe for hilarity but his
Rabelasian adventure could initiate a new sub-genre, the
comic-cooking-travelogue.
Earlier this year the BBC produced a six-part documentary series looking at
the country's history and contemporary condition; Ian Gibson's Fire in The
Blood - The New Spain (Faber/BBC Pounds 17.99) is a by-product of that
series. But as so often with books-of-the-TV-programme, it falls short of
expectations. Not really history, it makes forays in that direction; not
really sociology, it considers how Spaniards view topical matters such as
abortion, feminism and environmental depradation; not a travel guide, it is
written by one of the foremost non-Spanish (Gibson is Dublin-born)
travellers around.
Gibson's other book - Lorca's Granada - A Practical Guide (Faber Pounds
14.99), originally published in Spanish in 1989 - is sadly much less likely
to be promoted. A pity; Gibson is an expert on one of Spain's greatest
artists, and it is a clever idea to present a travel guide to Granada by
tracing Lorca's lifesteps around the city. It is a pleasure to walk the
streets in the company of someone who knows them so intimately.
For those who find their history most accessible through lengthy
descriptions of painting, architecture and other visual arts, Spanish
Journeys - A Portrait of Spain, by Adam Hopkins, (Viking Pounds 16.99) is
required reading. Like Lorca's Granada, what we have here is a novel method
of gauging the development of a culture and a society. But although Hopkins
writes sympathetically of such as Goya and Picasso, his book nevertheless
has a feeling of pre-masticated history. Neither fish nor fowl, it is too
dry, too uninvolved to inflame its passionate subject-matter.
Much of the rest make warm milk-and-oats seem wildly exotic. The Sierras Of
The South - Travels in the Mountains of Andalusia by Alastair Boyd
(HarperCollins Pounds 16.99) might be found charming by some readers, in the
way that jocosity can often be mistaken for wit. But an individual's travel
must have something very special about it in order to have impact today.
If you seek elegant expertise, then Cities of Spain by David Gilmour, (John
Murray Pounds 17.95) is just the ticket. Enlightening and historically
confident, Gilmour's book is the perfect companion piece for any traveller
in Spain. Seville by Sarah Jane Evans (Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 18) is not
imperative, since although she clearly knows Seville well, her writing often
leadenly strives after heights it cannot reach.
Everyone intending to visit Spain for either the Barcelona Olympics or
Seville's Expo should be reminded that, for quality insights into this most
splendid of countries there are still only two surpassing books, published
some 25 years ago; Raymond Carr's history, Spain and Hugh Thomas's The
Spanish Civil War. Sad that no one can quite match them here, though Hughes
and Vaquez Montalban get very close indeed.

THE MACMILLANS
by Richard Davenport-Hines
Heinemann Pounds 18.50, 370 pages
HAROLD Macmillan used to boast that his grandfather was a crofter, and -
having it both ways - that his wife was the daughter of a duke. Like another
British prime minister, Churchill, he had an American mother. What everybody
knew was that the family was in publishing, though apart from being
naturally bookish, he boasted about that rather less.
What few people can have known until the publication of this book, however,
is how grand the publishing business was. In the second half of the 19th
century, it must have been the foremost house in Britain. The Macmillan
brothers, Daniel and Alexander, were friends of Gladstone. They picked up
young authors all over the place. Among their early titles were Tom Brown's
Schooldays by Tom Hughes and Charles Kingsley's Westward Ho], books which
made not only reputations but also money.
Although Daniel died in 1857, Alexander went on to found Macmillan's
Magazine, a monthly publication designed to bring on younger writers like
Matthew Arnold and attract the established, like Lord Tennyson, into the
Macmillan fold. The magazine was spectacularly successful; practically all
the best-known writers of the time contributed.
On Tennyson's death in 1892, the Macmillan family was put in charge of the
funeral arrangements at Westminster Abbey. The entire intellect of England
seems to have been there. 'No one who was present,' wrote the Marquess of
Dufferin, a former Viceroy of India, 'will ever forget the scene, which was
unparalleled in its dignity and splendid significance.'
Apart from discovering authors, the Macmillans promoted publishing as a
business. The Net Book Agreement, which lays down that a bookseller shall
not undercut the retail price set by the publisher, was established as part
of their doing at the end of the century. It still, more or less, exists.
Daniel Macmillan was Harold's grandfather, and it was of his humble origins
that the man who was to become prime minister used to boast. A photograph of
the crofter's cottage where Daniel was born went with Macmillan throughout
his government offices. Yet Daniel very quickly moved south, to Cambridge
and London, first as a bookseller, than as a publisher.
The Macmillan family had long been well-educated, with a tendency to
religious earnestness. Daniel dropped the Baptists and switched to the
Church of England when he put Scotland behind him. And he and his younger
brother Alexander were lucky. Their move into publishing coincided with the
sharp rise of literacy. Other publishing houses were founded at much the
same time: Routledge and Cassell, for examples. George Routledge established
the Railway Library which, Walter Bagehot recorded, sold books 'like
sandwiches'. But it was the Macmillans who, in their list of authors and
their influence, had pride of place.
The remarkable fact about this book is that the story has never been told
before. It is the natural subject for a company history, and it would have
been even better if the Macmillan family had agreed to cooperate. The reason
why they did not seems to be that Davenport-Hines wanted to add a thesis of
his own. That was to explore the misfortunes - disease, premature death and
alcoholism - that have dogged the Macmillans over the years. He thinks that
the Macmillan men - Harold in particular - were given complexes by a
dominating mother.
The family refusal did not deter the author, who used to work in the
Macmillan publishing house. Yet the result is that he has written two books
in one. It is the first 123 pages about the history of the business that are
riveting; the rest is a readable enough account of the life of Harold
Macmillan with the odd attempt at psychological insight. Davenport-Hines
thinks, for instance, that the familiar baring of the Macmillan teeth, which
some saw as an ingratiating smile, was a sure sign that he was on the attack
 -just like an animal. It stemmed from his hostility to his mother.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Books: Private life of the Master / Review of a fresh
appraisal of Noel Coward's life and work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
NOEL COWARD
by Clive Fisher
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 17.99, 288 pages
I SUPPOSE there still are one or two people in their eighties or nineties
who remember seeing Noel and Gertie in the original production of Private
Lives in 1930. Many of us have listened to their surviving recording, now
available on cassette and CD, of the the balcony scene. Somehow even at the
umpteenth hearing it never fails to raise a chuckle or two. No later Amanda
 -not even the wonderful Kay Hammond - could invest the lines with quite the
degree of murderous innuendo conveyed by Gertrude Lawrence. HE: You said
Norfolk was flat. SHE: That was no reflection on her, unless she made it
flatter.
The joke there shifts a gear from marital discord to encompass Coward's urge
to make fun of the female form. It was not finally her lack of talent that
debarred the daughter of Mrs Worthington from a stage career but, you will
recall, 'the width of her seat/ That would surely defeat/ Her chances of
success . . .' The songs, which in his new book about Coward Clive Fisher
tends to undervalue, gleefully describe women who make fools of themselves;
such as the elderly American widow, Mrs Wentworth-Brewster by name, who
discovered (pause) 'just in the nick of time (pause) that life was for
living . . .' and, to the dismay of her family, allowed herself to be goosed
by Italian sailors in a bar on the Piccolo Marina on Capri.
The Master was not just gay; he was - let us face it - beneath the veneer of
charm an old-fashioned male chauvinist pig to boot. In 1985, while he was
making his farewell appearance in London in Suite in Three Keys, Coward gave
a revealing piece of advice to John Osborne:
' 'I understand you've been a very silly boy. You must never trust a woman.'
'But you've so many women friends,' I protested. More than I had. 'No
matter. Never trust 'em and never, never marry them. Which you appear to
do.'' (from Osborne's Almost A Gentleman)
There were, though, as Clive Fisher points out, two or three women who were
of crucial importance in Coward's life. The first and most important was
Violet (nee Veitch) who married Arthur Coward, a travelling piano salesman,
and in December 1899 gave birth to Noel Peirce Coward at their house in
Waldegrave Road, Teddington. He remained devoted to her for the remainder of
her long life. Then there was Mrs Astley Cooper, the Edwardian hostess based
in Rutland, who took up the young Noel Coward before he was famous, and gave
him his first insight into the mores of the country house set (see Easy
Virtue). And lastly there was Esme Wynne, the child performer who trained
with him for the stage.
She seemed all set for success but then abandoned the stage on her marriage
to Lynden Tyson. As Esme Wynne-Tyson she became a devout Christian Scientist
and pursued a new career as a writer on ethical and religious matters.
Fisher's book contains a charming photograph of Noel and Esme during the
First World War. The information Fisher has gathered from Jon Wynne-Tyson,
the publisher, about the bond that formed between Coward and his mother in
these obscure early years sheds a sharp little ray of fresh light on our
hero's hard slog before success came with The Vortex.
Fisher is also able to be much franker than was Sheridan Morley about
Coward's male lovers, notably Jack Wilson, the good-looking American
stockbroker who became (disastrously) his business manager and
(successfully) his sexual partner for many years. Otherwise the biographical
facts are mainly taken from secondary sources: Coward's own autobiographies
and diaries; Sheridan Morley's biography; and the published diaries of
friends like Cecil Beaton. Among the theatre critics Tynan is quoted ad
infinitum and so is Agate, who was Coward's direct contemporary and often
shrewd about his plays.
The value of Fisher's book is partly as a concise biography but more in the
detached view it offers of Coward's whole career. It is the first Coward
book from a member of a generation for whom Coward is now an established
part of theatrical history. This writer about Coward would have been a child
of 10 in 1973, the year Coward died. He is coolly immune to the myth of the
Master woven so assiduously and lucratively by Coward during his lifetime.
From this detached perspective Fisher goes thoroughly through the canon,
dealing perceptively with the forgotten or suppressed plays like the torrid
Maughamesque Point Valaine, with the late half-successes like Relative
Values and Nude With Violin as well giving the smash-hits, Hay Fever, Blithe
Spirit, etc. a fresh appraisal.
In all this Fisher has some valuable apercus on Coward's range of
subject-matter, much wider than you might suppose, and he points to some of
the glaring contradictions in Coward. He was both a cynic and a sentimental
patriot, the utterer of that resounding tear-jerking toast to 'this England
of ours' in Cavalcade but who ultimately opted to live abroad as a tax exile
in Switzerland. And like Rattigan he was a homosexual who was always careful
to play it straight before his adoring public. Fisher pays a handsome
concluding tribute to the 'solipsistic energy' and magical gifts that gave
rise to these discrepancies.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Gardening: Choose your weapons for the holiday weeds - The
killer instinct surfaces in Robin Lane Fox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDENERS cannot complain at the first proper rain for months, but it is
threatening to sabotage my weekend strategy. Whenever the strategy works, I
recommend it: it involves a double act which cuts down effort and keeps me
off my hands and knees.
It is rapidly approaching its last chance in the calendar. In another
fortnight, border plants will have spread sideways: the first crop of weeds
will have seeded itself and the enemy will be in place for a summer on the
offensive.
My idea of a good May Day weekend is to launch the attack first: it is your
last chance for a pre-emptive strike. Hand-weeding bogs down the troops and
limits them to one sector at a time. It may appeal to your instincts for
self-punishment, as if the weeds are somehow your fault. Nonetheless, resist
it and reach for the sprayer instead. I have not the slightest scruples
about spraying wherever possible and I look on its opponents as
non-gardening fantasists who do not even have pacifism's high moral ground
on their side.
Naturally, its effects depend on what you choose to spray. My armoury is
twofold. It relies heavily on glyphosate, marketed in several brands, of
which garden shops are most likely to sell you Tumbleweed. This brand is
satisfactory if you are gardening in a small area, but in my experience it
is not the strongest, is designed for amateurs whom suppliers equate wrongly
with half-wits and is far too expensive for use on a larger acreage.
As a result, I buy Roundup instead. It is sold by agricultural stores and
suppliers to farmers who may be half-wits but are at least thought to be
professionals. It comes in bigger cans but is has greater clout and I do not
mind paying Pounds 50 or so for a serious can which will see me through two
or three years and behave better than any other grass-killer on the market.
Roundup takes up to two weeks to turn the leaves of undesirables a shade of
mildly-pleasing orange. It kills anything with grassy leaves; it wipes out
couch grass; it may take two strikes to destroy a well-entrenched nettle or
dandelion and it may even need three to put ground elder out of action. In
the end, it wins, killing plants right down to the root, unlike that
relatively useless Weedol which simply scorches off the growth above ground.
Roundup's particular merit is that it kills only through the leaf, not the
soil. All you have to do is to aim straight. Aiming is much easier if you
use a spray-pack with an adjustable nozzle: for everyday gardening, I use
Killasprays and I reduce the quantities per acre on the Roundup bottle to
one tablespoon per large-sized Killaspray.
If the chemical hits the soil by mistake it does it no damage whatsoever:
indeed, you can plant it up with fresh stock within half a day of rounding
up the ground. All those long years of hand-cutting turf or forking out
couch grass and dandelions are out of date. You can spray the lot and watch
them turn a brilliant colour before dying totally after a month.
My second weapon works on the opposite principle. Whereas Roundup hits the
leaf, Weedex remains in the soil and prevents those awful crops of annual
weeds. The vital ingredient here is simazine and although it is available in
various brands, for flower-garden work I stick to plain Weedex, not the
Super variety, and follow the instructions about particular types of crop
which resent it.
It is a protective film for fresh, clean ground, but it is not a weapon
against old, invasive weeds. Its proper place is on a bed which you have
carefully weeded already and want to ensure against disaster. If you seal it
with Weedex, you never need to waste much time on all those bits of
chickweed which otherwise germinate in summer and ruin your weekends between
the Derby and Royal Ascot.
To this co-ordinated armoury, alternative gardeners have no convincing
answer. I have used glyphosate for years without any trace of long-term
damage to myself or anything desirable. If I have a complaint about Weedex,
it is quite the opposite: its protection does not always last throughout the
season, especially if the year is wet.
'Organic' gardeners have nothing else as strong, clean and sensible as my
two weapons. They are welcome to try alternative tactics for weed-control,
but it is no use telling me that unwanted weeds are best smothered with
unwanted lengths of user-friendly old carpet.
There are only three obstacles to my double attack. The first is the most
serious: it needs to be launched in showery weather. If either prong fails,
it is almost always because heavy rains washed the chemicals away afterwards
or a long drought stopped the plants from taking them up in time. This
weekend, conditions look highly promising, as the garden is damp and the
rain may abate for at least six hours, the necessary interval. I am planning
a major assault.
Of the other two obstacles, one is my own planning, where I will have to
compromise. This weekend, I also intend to sow outdoors annuals like white
flax and white cosmos daisies where I want them to flower from late July
onwards. If their ground is Weedexed first, they will fail totally.
Do not repeat the mistake of an over-eager reader who was so pleased with
simazine in year one that he put it all over his bare flower beds in year
two and then expected them to grow his light-scented stocks before he left
for late August in the south of France. Chemicals cannot distinguish between
an unwanted weed and a desirable tobacco plant. The only answer is to mark
out safe havens where flower-seeds can germinate and hand weeding has to
continue.
The last of the three obstacles is much more familiar. For the past six
weeks, most of our gardens have been troubled with a tiny white-flowered
weed which is often known as Bitter Cress. It thrives where the soil is
slightly damp; it is about two inches high and in its own wicked way, it is
one of nature's marvels.
This weekend, it is nearly mature and unless you pull it out now it will
spread exuberantly by its own seed-mechanism. As soon as its seed pods are
hard and straight, they are able to catapult seeds at the first touch of a
human hand. It is no use trusting Roundup to destroy it because it will grow
on, seed and finish the cycle before the poison works. You have to pull it
out - and you have only a few last days before it has beaten you.
I rather think that in the next world, avenging angels will bury me in
mounds of it. It has dogged my years of gardening, from early rock-gardening
to hours with a bucket in a German botanic garden where it was pursued with
Teutonic efficiency.
Botanically, Bitter Cress is a type of Cardamine, cousin to a pretty wild
Ladies Smock. In popular German, it also translates as Jumping Jesus. One
touch, you see, and it soars skywards, leaving thousands of future disciples
on the area round the point of contact. This weekend, I am planning a real
Nero of a persecution: having rounded-up the nettles and Weedexed between
the catmint, on Sunday morning I will be sending the last of this particular
Jesus for the high jump.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Gardening: Hunting to save the landscape - Country View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE accustomed to hearing dire news from the countryside. Farming is
highly unprofitable, EC plans to cut subsidies will make business worse. The
principal land-uses are in an unhealthy state and some hill farms with
arable ground are selling for the same price as unenclosed moorland.
Forestry has proved an unattractive alternative. Few farmers are prepared to
risk such a long-term investment. Eco-forestry is being encouraged by the
Farm Woodland Scheme, but offers little prospect for profit.
Set-Aside, conceived as a way of reducing surpluses and satisfying
environmentalists, has proved unpopular. It is applied on about 155,000
hectares, or 3 per cent of the farmable area. Farmers are given money to
cease farming; where corn had grown nature was to take its course.
Nature being what it is this meant that, instead of rolling acres of wild
flowers the virile and invasive weeds, nourished by fertiliser residues,
crowded out everything else. Green fields were made green by fertilisers or
animal manure; without them much summer grass was yellow or brown.
The commonest plant became the thistle. Farmers turned on each other when it
became clear that the prime candidates for the sinecure of Set-Aside were
either the most incompetent farmers, ageing farmers happy to be paid to drop
out, or those on the worst land who at last had a chance to match the
incomes of their better-endowed neighbours.
The solution to the problem of what to do with the countryside is
ready-made: turn it into hunting, shooting and fishing preserves. Which, of
course, is what it originally was. The earliest property rights were hunting
rights. Long before agriculture was more than sporadic pastoral activity in
forest clearings, hunting reserves were thoroughly organised, the primary
rule being protection of habitat. The conservation credentials of field
sports as a land-use are excellent.
A report has been published which says country sports are gaining
popularity.
The independent report, Countryside Sports: Their Economic and Conservation
Significance, was commissioned by The Standing Conference on Countryside
Sports and was published recently.
It says the UK has become a nation of shooters, hunters, stalkers and
anglers. Because of the indeterminate number of sportsmen who practise more
than one field sport the report does not offer a total figure for all
Britain's sportsmen, but there are 3.9m anglers, 850,000 shooters, and
240,000 hunters to hounds. This rustic activity generates more than Pounds
1.4bn annually in direct spending, and employs 125,000 people.
Since 1970 the number of anglers has risen by 1m. In the last eight years
the number of stalkers has trebled and the number of clay pigeon shooters
has doubled. The game yielded by these activities is worth Pounds 38m a
year. The hunting tackle trade is worth Pounds 43m in exports alone.
Taxes on sporting revenues and on the earnings of gunsmiths, ghillies,
gamekeepers and farriers; sales of gun and fishing licences and permits and
business and sporting rates levied by local authorities, contribute Pounds
459m to the public purse. This industry is entirely in the private sector at
a time when other country activities, agriculture and forestry, furiously
subsidised by the state, are losing their meaning.
However, country concerns are less well represented in the House of Commons
than at any time.
Country sports are the preserve not of the elite but of the poorer half of
the community. Dividing participants into four socio-economic groups, the
Standing Conference report finds that 56 per cent of shooters and 68 per
cent of anglers belong to the lowest two groupings. A paltry 15 per cent of
the most affluent participate in shooting or fishing at all.
Even those arguing against the Hunting Bill in the last Parliament used the
principle of freedom of choice as their basis, rather than a detailed
defence of the part played by hunting in rural life. It is time they wised
up. Country feelings run deep, and they throb in the breasts of many
city-dwellers, too.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Gardening: A blooming scrapheap - Arthur Hellyer visits the
Garden Festival, Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GARDEN Festival, Wales, opened yesterday and will continue, seven days a
week, until October 4. It is the last of the five great festivals that
started with Liverpool eight years ago and continued at Stoke-on-Trent,
Glasgow and Gateshead in the intervening years. All have been good fun, all
have reclaimed waste land and handed it back cleared and rejuvenated for
further use by the community concerned and, although I do not think that any
made a profit, it seems sad that there are no more in the pipeline. There is
no time to improvise any stopgap since it takes a minimum of four years to
prepare one on the scale and to the standards we have come to expect. The
Wales festival has been in the making for five years. Not only does the
Welsh exhibition at Ebbw Vale fully live up to those standards but it is
unique in being the only one that occupies a naturally beautiful site. Ebbw
Vale is a small industrial town with mountains on both sides. On the valley
floor there used to be a large steelworks, and its associated slag heaps
were a blot on the landscape. Now only a small part of the steelworks
remains, at the head of the valley, and the slag heaps are a series of
beautiful gardens plus a fine lake and a medley of pavilions. When the
festival is over, they will disappear to make way for a new village, to be
named Victoria, which will provide both living and working opportunities.
Some features of the show will also remain, almost certainly the lake and
possibly the 40 metre-high waterfall which seems to be a perfectly natural
feature of the western mountain side. Gone, I imagine, will be the funicular
railway which at the moment ascends the mountain to a height of 1200ft, from
which there are spectacular views of the 200-acre exhibition site.
On the way up the railway passes a working farm, part of which has been
incorporated in the exhibition. Here there will be demonstrations, including
sheepdog trials. In this part, too, there is a natural woodland walk and a
demonstration of the flora of wetland. If you want a quicker overall view of
the show you can be lifted in a few seconds about 300ft above it in a giant
'sky shuttle'. You can also be drawn around it at ground level in any one of
three land trains, which came to Wales directly from Gateshead where they
had performed a similar function.
A unique feature of this festival is a giant hothouse which has been built
against the mountainside, making use of the natural steep slope of the land.
There is talk of retaining this when the show is over as a permanent feature
but nothing has yet been decided. Part of the endeavour after October will
be to attract new industry to the site and I wonder whether any company
might see a prestigious piece of publicity in retaining a feature such as
this.
There is no easy railway access to Ebbw Vale as there has been to former
national garden festivals and so most people will arrive by road. The
signposting could not be better. I began to encounter the cheery little
joker named Gryff, the festival logo, on the M4 motorway 30 miles or more
away from Ebbw Vale and he reappeared at every junction and roundabout to
point the way.
At the moment the daffodils are almost over in my Sussex garden but still
fully out in Wales. They got more and more numerous as I approached the site
until they burst into a final frenzy of colour in the festival grounds. They
had been specially retarded so that they would be at their peak for the
opening ceremony.
The festival authorities intend to give special significance to certain
flowers month by month: in June to a new bearded iris raised by a local
specialist; in July to the Welsh poppy; in August to a rose named Abraham
Darby, after an Ebbw Vale ironmaster; and in September to the dahlia called
Bishop of Llandaff. There will also be a number of spectaculars to fill the
floral hall with displays of flowers and foliage throughout the festival.
Admission is Pounds 8.50 for adults and Pounds 5.50 for children and senior
citizens. Concessions for groups and families are available, as are season
tickets. It is open from 10 am until 7 pm during May, September and October
and until 8 pm in June, July and August. For further information contact the
Tourist Information Centre, Bagle Brook, Beefeater Restaurant car park,
Sunnycroft Road, Baglan, West Glamorgan. Tel: 0639-823049.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
This fine, hardy perennial has stout stems that creep along the surface and
cover themselves with large, more or less circular, thick-textured,
evergreen leaves. These are glossy and make fine ground cover. In late
winter and spring, the plant produces many stout branch stems bearing
closely-packed, bell-shaped pink flowers. There is an excellent variety
named Puppurea which has red stems and magenta flowers. Both are grown
easily in any reasonably fertile soil in full sun or in shade, but flowers
will be produced more freely with plenty of light.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Property: Bath houses updated - Michael Hanson returns to
one of England's most elegant cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I LIVED in Bath 32 years ago, and I am always pleased to return to this
graceful Georgian city to see how it is faring at the hands of the
developers and the preservationists.
The developers got their way for too long in the 1960s and 1970s, with the
connivance of the city and county councils. In recent years conservationists
have been in the ascendancy.
Today, Bath is bustling. The city of Beau Brummel is looking elegant again:
most of its stone buildings have been cleaned of their two centuries of
smoke and grime. But there is still much to do. Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks,
a London agent, is seeking a buyer for the Empire Hotel, that grand
Edwardian building overlooking Pulteney Bridge and the weir. Bath city
council is offering it for sale on a 125-year lease with planning permission
for its restoration as a 100-bedroom hotel. The city needs it.
Bath is still a civilised place in which to live, and eminently commutable
now that British Rail's inter-city service takes only 81 minutes to
Paddington. That people still want to live in elegant surroundings is shown
by the experience of Johnson Fairchild, a local firm of property developers
going from strength to strength over the past five years, despite the
recession.
'We are a small company doing quality work, and I don't think the recession
has made much difference to the market for quality,' says Brian Fairchild.
'We tackle two or three sizable projects a year and, to be honest, the
margins are better now than they were.'
The company's latest project is the restoration of two 18th century houses
in Great Pulteney Street, on the other side of Pulteney Bridge. The shops on
either side remind one of how medieval London Bridge used to look.
Since the Second World War, these two houses had been converted into 12
rented flats, part of a portfolio of properties in Bath owned by a private
family company. With the help of Angela Crofts, a local architect, building
surveyor Alan Hardiman, and specialist builder G J Gilbert, Fairchild
Johnson restored these Grade I listed houses to their 1792 standard of
elegance - when Great Pulteney Street was one of the most fashionable
streets in England.
Angela Crofts says: 'Over the years, these fine but neglected Georgian
houses had fallen into a sad state of disrepair. The street facade had been
cleaned and restored but, internally, previous multi-occupancy meant that
most of the original rooms were subdivided. There were numerous
old-fashioned kitchens, bathrooms and toilets, some on half landings or in
decrepit extensions to the rear.'
All the architectural details have been restored or replaced. This being
1992, not 1792, refinements such as central heating, modern kitchens and
bathrooms, service lifts and security systems have also been installed.
The result is two fine buildings. One is a whole house of some 7,000 sq ft,
with three principal bedrooms and bathrooms; a two-bedroom staff or nursery
flat on the top floor; three spacious reception rooms; a whole floor with
kitchen, breakfast room, dayroom, and utility room; and another floor with a
whirlpool bath, fitness room and conservatory, opening on to a garden. At
the end of the garden there is parking for two cars. Offers of Pounds
750,000 are being sought for this house by the Bath office of Savills and
local agents Cobb Farr.
Next door, Johnson Fairchild has converted the house into two maisonettes:
four-bedroom apartments, each for sale at Pounds 375,000. One is already
under offer at the full asking price. In the centre of the terrace, with a
tall round-headed window in the drawing room, this is the more elegant of
the two houses, but it was easier to convert than its neighbour, and the
developers did not feel the market was yet ripe for two whole houses.
'Bath is a very small town with a very tight market,' explains Brian
Fairchild. 'We have lived here all our lives, and we know the right streets
 -and the right side of those streets in which to buy property.'
Until five years ago Brian Fairchild was a garage proprietor in Bath. He
sold his business at the top of the boom, and joined forces with Keith
Johnson, a former restaurateur. The third director of Johnson Fairchild plc,
Brett Halling-Brown, is an accountant who has been a tax consultant for the
past 15 years. On the strength of this and their previous successful
projects in Lansdowne Place West, Cavendish Place and elsewhere in the city,
they can now fairly claim to be professional developers.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Property: Opportunity knocks across the Channel - The
post-UK election market for French properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU NAME it, and someone, somewhere in France, wants to sell it to you. The
range of properties is as wide as the spread of prices in a country which
must offer some of the cheapest and most expensive homes in Europe. It also
provides some interesting opportunities.
Has the British election cleared the air and brought cross-Channel buyers
back in force? Many estate agents say it has not; exceptions are at the
extreme ends of the market. One agency, which had been getting remarkably
few calls about middle-priced properties, advertised a Pounds 3m villa at
Vence and inquiries came in right away. Conversely, an agency offering what
it frankly says is 'little more than a pile of stones' from Pounds 7,000 has
had a very busy phase. But further delay on the Channel tunnel - now not to
open until late summer 1993 - may have made the urge to comb the Channel
coast for last-gasp bargains seem less urgent. If you want rock-bottom
prices, Normandy &amp; Brittany Cottages, a London agency, will arrange for you
to visit one of its associates in northern France, which might have
something in at a four-figure sterling price. Those prices, like some wines,
do not travel. The agency, which says that its French properties are more in
demand than most, admits that it is the cheapest that attract most
attention. From its lists Normandy and Brittany Cottages (071-381-4433)
picks a farmhouse at Pounds 15,000. This has a kitchen/dining room with
beamed ceiling and an ancient galleried adjoining barn that would make an
'atmospheric' living room. The upper floor of the house could become two
bedrooms and a bathroom. There is a courtyard, garden and an open barn.
About Pounds 16,000 would buy a terrace cottage in a secluded hamlet. There
is a living room, kitchen, ground floor bedroom and shower room. The attic
has been partly converted to make two rooms. A large farmhouse with
adjoining barn that could be turned into a total of three properties costs
Pounds 19,500, An orchard would probably come with it.
If you plan a major restoration, and that sort of work is not your normal
one, are you sure you can cope? Half-completed conversions are a market in
themselves. Nicholas Masters, a Briton settled 40 miles from Toulouse in a
large old house in farmland, has plenty of experience of renovating
property. He is well aware of the difference between visualising and
actually doing such work, and now runs a small business helping others to
realise their dreams.
Those unversed in the skills of renovation can spend a week at his property
to practice such arts as rendering, tiling and plumbing. People who would
like to see if they can render a wall, tile a floor or handle plumbing can
go along and see what they make of working on a French building. Craftsmen
will advise them, show them the tools to use and the techniques required. It
is not an easy week, warns Masters, but it is rewarding. Working clothes and
warm sweaters are essential. The Pounds 150 he charges for a work-experience
week with full board might be worth every penny, if it saves you going any
further with such a project. For masochists, the number for more information
is 0634-250473.
Should you hanker for an old property, but not the renovation work, Domus
Abroad, a London agency is carving a niche for itself by offering units in
period properties which various keen young British developers are dividing.
Jeremy Harris and Ben Burke, combining architectural and interior design
experience, are about to turn an 18th century stately home north of
Perigueux, in the Dordogne, into 20 apartments which will sell from Pounds
72,000 to Pounds 97,000. There are 12 acres of grounds, with river frontage,
and there will be tennis and boules courts and a swimming pool. Early buyers
can have their apartments tailored to suit their needs. There are bank
guarantees and a ten-year building warranty. Details from Domus Abroad
(071-409-0571).
Numerous chateaux, some elegant, some forbidding, regularly turn up on
agents' books, with creative if impractical suggestions for their use.
Vineyards, too, are a prolific crop. An example includes farmhouse and
picker's cottage, 16 acres of grapes and 50 acres of farmland for Pounds
160,000 (0892-852449).
Money? Just slip into any office of the Woolwich building society in the UK
or its estate agent, Woolwich Property Services, for details of its mortgage
arrangements for property in France. Your inquiry will go straight to Banque
Woolwich in Paris.
How about grants? The French Government Tourist Office in London might be
able to help: write to its Leisure Investment Department, at 178 Piccadilly
W1V OAL. Benefits would, of course, be linked to properties or developments
providing tourist accommodation.
A section of the northern French coastline, running for 65 miles mostly
south from the Channel tunnel opening, is still ripe for leisure projects.
Diana Madoux (who is English) of the Comite Departmental de Tourisme,
Pas-de-Calais (21.83.32.59), says that for small-scale investors the main
area of interest is probably in the purchase of farm buildings and country
cottages for improvement and subsequent rental. She cites schemes where
Gites de France, the French government-sponsored agency, has - subject to
conditions - given grants to British applicants.
Perhaps you just want something new to walk into, for your own use. Not all
French housing developments suit British tastes, but those adjoining golf
courses are usually geared to the international market.
Pont Royal, near Aix-en-Provence, plans to open its Seve
Ballesteros-designed course in June, with the official opening in September.
A cluster of show homes is completed and furnished for inspection, and work
is in hand on more of the planned 850 properties. The project is in a
pretty, rural setting, half an hour from Marseilles airport. Prices are from
Pounds 72,000 for apartments to Pounds 295,000 for a four-bedroom,
four-bathroom villa. L &amp; M Project Management, joint developers with Resort
Group, says the scheme is 'making good progress in a very tough market'.
(Tel: 081-332-0033.)
An hour from Marseilles, along the coast near Bandol, is Golf de Fregate,
where the 18-hole Ronald Fream-designed clifftop course will be playable
from July. One of the development's two 60-unit 'villages' of local-style
villas and apartments has show properties ready and should be completed by
the end of the summer. Agent Hamptons (071-493-8222).

FT  02 MAY 92 / Travel: Six-legged friends in Provence - Nicholas Haslam
watches a tragic mating ceremony in the Vaucluse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE MADE AN unlikely group, gathered on a limestone outcrop high in Provence:
an insurance broker, a management consultant, a retired horticultural
teacher, a nurse and an executive from a large frozen food company. But
then, in addition to the Barbour jackets and sensibly dubbined walking
boots, we did have one abiding interest in common. We were all curious about
natural history and had signed up for a week's exploration of the vast array
of natural habitats in the hills of the Vaucluse. Our guide, Richard
Vulliamy, was a Cornish expatriate who had moved to the region a few years
before. Looking more like a Methodist lay preacher who should be striding
rain-sodden moors to deliver fiery sermons in dank chapels, his enthusiasm
for his chosen land knew no bounds. As we stood gasping after a long climb
over steep limestone cliffs, he pointed out the extraordinary wealth of
habitats that we would be exploring over the coming week. Before us lay the
high summit of Mount Ventoux, dusted by an uncharacteristically early fall
of snow.
In the valleys below we could dimly hear the shouts of shirt-sleeved
workers, toiling in the serried vineyards, getting in the grapes for the
harvest of Cotes du Rhone. 'At one glance', he said, you can see the entire
range of habitats in Europe, from the Arctic through to the Mediterranean'.
Over the next week we left no stone unturned as we pried into the secrets of
the natural history of the area. With binoculars and magnifying glasses
poised, we checked deep rocky crannies and scanned the high hill tops.
With so much to see, each day's walk was given over to a different theme or
species. On the second day, for example, insects were our main target. In
autumn, the hillsides were alive with shameless fecundity as hordes of
six-legged creatures had a last fling before the frosts.
Equally shamelessly, we gathered around a pair of mating mantises, and
watched the smaller male meet his end in flagrante delicto: the female
started eating him before he was halfway. 'They are,' said Richard, 'totally
indiscriminate in their prey. If anything passes in front of their eyes that
looks remotely edible, then it gets eaten.'
Day three found us clambering up a steep gorge alongside a clear running
river. In the heat of summer the Ouveze, on its way to join the Rhone, is a
popular spot for campers and tourists. Now, in autumn, the camps were
deserted, the river banks uncluttered.
We were on the look out for Castor fiber, more commonly known as the
European beaver. I had thought the beaver long extinct in Europe, but
pockets still survive in France and in fact are being reintroduced 'They are
very shy animals,' hissed Richard as we crept through willow thickets in
hope of glimpsing the creature, or hearing the hard crack of its tail on
water.
We saw no animal, unfortunately, but found plenty of traces of their
activities. In one clearing by the river the willows had been felled
systematically, and a large poplar lay forlornly on its side, surrounded by
fresh chippings and with the trunk grooved by the beaver's enormous
incisors.
Janet, a former nurse, came across some bones in the path by the river. She
paled, and held them to Richard for close examination. 'The only bones I've
seen like this before,' she said, 'came from a human hand.' There was a
general intake of breath, clearly audible over the sound of the river.
Richard gave them a cursory glance. 'The hind leg of a beaver,' he ruled. We
breathed again, but Janet carefully buried the bones and did not look too
convinced.
In the evenings, we returned to a gite d'etape, a converted farmhouse owned
by a Provencal chef. As dusk fell over the mountains behind us, we sat in
the courtyard sipping pastis and poring over insect and plant books,
discussing and identifying the puzzles of the day.
Around us, other walkers looked on in amazement as heated discussions about
the genus of a particular plant filled the air, with complex Latin names
bandied about with alarming fluency. One French walker tipped me a wink and
then stage-whispered to his companion: 'Mais vraiment ils sont fous, ces
anglais'.
Unwittingly, the following day, we trespassed onto another French preserve.
The autumn woods of Provence provide a much-prized addition to the French
table, edible fungi, and the whereabouts of the yellow trumpet-shaped
chanterelle, a mushroom that commands a high price in local markets, are a
closely guarded secret.
We were looking for another species altogether when we found a rich crop of
chanterelles spread across the floor of a copse. We picked a few for the
evening meal, and then walked on, passing not far away an old French farmer
who looked with dismay at the plastic bags we carried, and who strode past
with a surly 'bonsoir.' Looking back, we saw him fall upon the mushrooms;
when we passed him again later in the afternoon, his rucksack bulged.
Perhaps the week's high spot was our visit to the Camargue. Only 60 miles
south of our base, the Camargue offers a vast number of lagoons and marshes
in the delta of the Rhone. At that time of year the sky was alive with
Africa-bound birds. In just a few hours we spotted more species than I had
ever seen in years of casual bird watching in Britain. From the privacy of a
hide we saw kingfishers swoop down and egrets and herons patrol the water's
edge. Flamingoes in their hundreds sifted through the muddy waters further
out in the lagoons, and long skeins of geese circled after their long flight
from the north.
A certain sadness hung over us all. Unlike the birds, we could not give way
to instinct. That evening we would be leaving the hills of Provence and
heading north, to grey England and its winter.
Nicholas Haslam travelled to Marseilles c/o British Airways. Fares start at
Pounds 177 return. His week was organised by Provencal Field Study Holidays
of 2 Rose Cottage, Luckett, Nr Callington, Cornwall (tel: 0579-370411),
which organises tours in May, June, September, October and November. Cost,
including accommodation, full board and rail transport from Victoria to
Avignon, starts at Pounds 430, with an optional surcharge for air travel.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Travel: Tricky thoughts aloft - Kevin Rafferty wonders about
airline safety procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN RAFFERTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRCRAFT crashes in which passengers survived, plus news that last year
passenger deaths in air crashes rose, ought to have promoted new
consciousness about air safety. But they do not seem to have done.
The annual 'beauty contests' which ask newspaper and magazine readers or
experts to rank airlines all relate to frills and fripperies - what sort of
champagne the airline serves, how plastic the food is, whether luggage
arrives safely, how wide the seats are. No-one seems to rank airlines by
their safety procedures. Why?
Is it fear of libel - fear that if you accuse an airline of neglecting
proper safety procedures you might be sued, whereas if you accuse it of
serving only IATA regulation cucumber sandwiches no-one bothers? Or is it
fear of tempting fate - that if you point out that Qantas, for example, has
never had a passenger fatality in all its years of flying, even that
exemplary airline will not thank you?
Since the Lockerbie bombing of a Pan Am 747 aircraft, airlines and airports
have generally tightened their safety procedures. It is standard on both
sides of the Atlantic to X-ray all luggage, whether stowed in the hold or
hand-carried.
But in Britain and the US it often seems to me that security operators are
suffering from terminal boredom and are not as alert as, say, those at Hong
Kong's Kai Tak or Singapore's Changi airports, who use twin multicoloured
screens. The prize, if such it can be called, for the sloppiest procedures
goes to Indian airports.
In spite of demanding check-in three hours before departure, India's X-ray
screens are frequently fuzzy and operators more meticulous in ensuring that
baggage and boarding cards have a proper stamp than in conducting effective
checks.
At New Delhi last year, a disaffected catering worker was able to plant an
incendiary device which was only discovered by accident.
No airline matches El Al's thoroughness either in screening passengers and
their luggage or in securing the aircraft itself. Typically, airlines excuse
themselves by saying that passengers would not put up with the time that El
Al takes - but I would rather be subjected to El Al's professionalism than
put up with the perfunctory, always offhand and frequently rude questioning
of British Airways or Air Canada.
A more tricky aspect is how well-maintained the aircraft is. It is not easy
for a layman, even a frequent traveller, to satisfy himself that the
aircraft hasn't got metal fatigue or has been checked for cracks in the
engine.
Equally tricky is whether the pilots know what they are up to. It is not
exactly confidence-inspiring to hear that airports have installed
breathalysers to check whether pilots are drunk before going on duty.
My acid test is to ask airline captains to which airlines they would entrust
their wives and children. The consensus is that Qantas, Swissair, Lufthansa
and Cathay Pacific come through with flying colours.
An Iraqi airforce major told me years ago that Scottish-trained pilots were
the best in the world 'because when you are up there, you have to keep your
wits about you at all times since you never know what kind of weather is
going to hit you - windsheer, nastily packaged clouds, it's all so
unpredictable over Scotland.'
These days there is the complication of whether the captain can cope with
the aircraft computer. One old-time former Royal Air Force pilot said: 'I
pride myself that I am like a bus driver who is in tune with his craft and
can recognise the engine pitch and whether the aircraft feels alright. But I
do feel a bit adrift when I have to give instructions through the computer
since I have no computer qualifications. Colleagues have told of hairy
moments when the computer went off into its own world and refused to accept
instructions.'
The same captain was able to land his 747-400 safely at Heathrow in
near-zero visibility because the RAF had taught him to fly on his
instruments alone.
The most obvious safety checks are those in the passenger cabin, yet many of
the most lauded beauty competition winners do not take them seriously.
Most US airlines are very good, ensuring that luggage does not block exits
or aisles. British Airways is conscientious in checking luggage and
reassuringly repeats its video insisting that passengers smoke only when
seated in a designated smoking area before and after take-off.
My prize for the airline most meticulous in checking on-board safety goes to
Virgin Atlantic. Crew-members peer at every seat row to make sure hand
luggage is actually under the seat or in the overhead locker. Overhead bins
have been fitted with netting to ensure that luggage won't fall out even if
the locker bursts open. Virgin crews get 3.5 days of emergency refresher
training each year, more than many other airlines. Disappointingly, the same
thoroughness does not apply to the Asian carriers which every year walk away
with airline awards. Singapore Airlines, Thai International and, worst of
all, Cathay Pacific, regularly do only the most routine checks, and do them
inadequately.
It is common on Cathay and Singapore Airlines for passengers to stand and
smoke at the rear of the aircraft, often leaning on the emergency door as
they chat and drink. In Cathay's case, one reason for this behaviour is that
the airline puts its youngest and most inexperienced crew at the back of the
aircraft, girls who may be pretty but are scared to tell a full load of
passengers to obey basic safety rules.
As a hardened European steward travelling as a passenger on an Asian airline
observed disdainfully: 'They may be pretty girls, but how will they cope in
an emergency?'
Tanked up on free liquor, perhaps we never think an emergency will happen,
or, if it does, that there is anything that can be done except pray. Yet we
have seen recently that it is possible to crash and break an aircraft
without losing a single passenger - which ought to make us think.

I DISCOVERED Inntravel seven years ago, soon after it began operating, by
joining a cross-country skiing weekend in the Swiss village of Kandersteg.
In its early days, Inntravel advertised in slim black-and-white leaflets
offering skiing and not much else.
Now its brochures are large, colourful and plump with suggestions for those
seeking weekends or short breaks in France, Switzerland, Italy and Norway.
Inntravel is owned by Richard Hearn and his wife, Linda. Hearn used to work
for Wallace Arnold, where he had already recognised a demand for short-break
holidays when he decided to set up on his own. He began with Winterinn in
1984, after taking six months off to study business management on a
government-aided scheme at Durham University.
He and his wife decided to make their base in Helmsley, near York, and
gradually established a loyal clientele, many of whom re-book each year.
They started with 500 bookings. Last year it was about 9,000. 'The average
age of the Inntravel holidaymaker is 45 and upwards', says Hearn. 'They are
usually people who were sporty in their youth but who haven't done a lot
since. Even so, they like the idea of trying something new. They also want a
holiday which is tailored to their needs and don't want to be part of a
large group.'
Some five years ago, when I first went to Kandersteg, the story was rather
different. Since then, Inntravel has moved slowly up-market. Today's
customers are older and richer. They insist on value for money.
Linda Hearn is a young, blue-eyed blonde who looks after three small
children when she isn't dashing about Europe discovering yet another
'characterful' hotel or 'authentic' village. Richard Hearn is small and
slight and sets out his business aims with a mix of realism and high hopes.
'At present, four of us do the travelling and we work from one year to the
next without five- or even three-year plans,' says Hearn. 'I still wake up
and panic each morning. It will probably be a bad day when I don't but we
are incredibly lucky with the hoteliers we work with. They are so
enthusiastic.'
It is this enthusiasm which links Inntravel to many of the inns and family
hotels it has come to consider its own. High on a hillside at Les Alisiers,
in Alsace, Ella and Jacques Degouy mirror the Hearns in age and ambition.
Jacques used to work for a pharmaceutical company in Paris until deciding to
start a small hotel near the village where his wife was born.
Jacques likes to entertain his friends in his own restaurant as well as work
there and is dangerously generous to visitors. Ella, his wife, is shy and
practical. It was Ella who decided to reduce the number of hotel rooms to a
handful, improving and enlarging a few, releasing time to concentrate on the
restaurant. It was also Ella who trained the young chef and it is Ella who
cooks on Sundays and takes the orders every evening while keeping an eye on
the student waitresses.
The rooms at Les Alisiers, like many other Inntravel hotels, are clean,
comfortable and uninspiring. The food on the restaurant's set menu is
wholesome rather than interesting. But the atmosphere is friendly, the staff
helpful and everyone extremely pleasant. It is this esprit which makes
Inntravel, and the small hotels it discovers, so successful.
Inntravel's Inn-Active Summer '92 brochure, to October 31, offers flexible
holidays in France, Italy, Norway and Switzerland for those who want to
travel on foot, by horse or bike. In addition, there are wine-tasting,
sailing, painting and self-drive holidays. There is also a Portfolio
brochure (to October 31), of fishermen's cottages, alpine farmhouses, family
hotels, etc. Inntravel: The Old Station, Helmsley, York YO6 5BZ, tel:

FT  02 MAY 92 / Sport: Two billionaires and their wonder horse - Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK POPHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLEN Paulson is an aerospace magnate whose humble beginnings on an Iowa
farm in Depression America have been translated into significant wealth.
Sheikh Mohammed is one of the four Maktoum brothers who rule Dubai, the
United Arab Emirates state which has been transformed in the last 30 years
through oil.
What both have in common, apart from wealth, is a passion for horseracing.
Each owns half of Arazi, potentially the most exciting racehorse seen
anywhere for 20 years or more.
Arazi is a small three-year-colt who moves incredibly easily and has won all
but the first of his nine races, eclipsing the best horses in Europe and the
US. Today Arazis face his toughest test in America's most prestigious race,
the Kentucky Derby, worth Dollars 985,000 (Pounds 556,000) to the winner and
run over 1 1/4 miles on the dirt before 125,000 fans at Churchill Downs race
course, Louisville, Kentucky.
The French-trained colt is expected to win even though he faces up to 18
opponents. British bookmakers quote him the 4-7 favourite. Arazi would be
the first European-trained horse to win the Kentucky Derby, run today for
the 118th time.
Not many have tried. The US media - 1,250 turf scribes have press
accreditation at Churchill Downs - are staggered that a European horse, used
to racing on grass and trained differently, is set to take their top race.
Paulson, who bought Arazi for Dollars 350,000 as a foal, at the key
Keeneland Sales in Lexington, Kentucky, and routinely has horses trained in
France, insisted that the young horse fly to the US to challenge for the
race he has always dreamt of winning.
He got his way, in spite of selling a half share in Arazi for a reported
Dollars 9m to Sheikh Mohammed, who, with his brothers, has built up the
greatest racing and breeding empire ever seen.
The sale was completed before Arazi made his first trip to Churchill Downs
last November for the Dollars 1m Breeders' Cup Juvenile, in which he came
from last to first with amazing ease, gaining a reputation as a wonder
horse.
If Arazi is successful today (the race starts at 10.32pm UK time), Paulson
wants the colt, sired by Blushing Groom, to stay in America for the
remaining Triple Crown races, the Preakness on May 16 and the Belmont on
June 6.
On the other hand, Sheikh Mohammed has not won an Epsom Derby, in spite of
his enormous expenditure on thoroughbreds, and thinks Arazi should return to
Europe to challenge for the world's most famous Flat race, on June 3.
The man in the middle of this dispute is French trainer Francois Boutin, who
insists on speaking his native language to the US press, although he has
quite adequate English. He has the last say according to the contract
between the two partners.
Paulson, 70, and Sheikh Mohammed, 42, are very different sorts. The former
is an entrepreneur who started out as a 30 cents-an-hour aircraft mechanic
and became a pilot before making his first fortune in the aircraft spares
market and going on to buy Gulfstream Aerospace, which makes luxury
corporate jets, for Dollars 52m in 1978.
Paulson turned Gulfstream round, took it public in 1983 and sold it to
Chrysler for Dollars 636m in 1985. He remained chief executive and
re-purchased the company when Chrysler ran into problems in 1990.
Ironically, Chrysler sponsors the Dollars 5m Triple Crown Bonus for any
horse that can win the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont in the same
year.
Paulson's philosophy is to work harder than rivals, take opportunities when
he can and not dwell on mistakes. He is happy to be in the public eye. His
partner in Arazi, Sheikh Mohammed, who is always surrounded by advisers and
friends, shies from attention.
They met at Keeneland Sales in the early 1980s when both vied to buy the
best foals and yearlings on offer, happily spending millions of dollars.
Paulson, who has splashed out about Dollars 150m on thoroughbreds and has
200 horses in training, says: 'The sales are a bit like going to Las Vegas.
It's a gamble and it's exciting. I like the whole atmosphere and I also like
to be there when my money is being spent.
'When I first got into the horse business in the 1960s, I didn't have the
money to do it right. When we had some success at Gulfstream, however, I
decided the time was right.'
The Maktoum brothers have spent nearly Dollars 400m at Keeneland's main sale
(in July) since 1980, also buying privately and at other sales worldwide.
They buy both horses and aircraft from Paulson.
Sheikh Mohammed, the third but dominant brother of Dubai's royal family, was
educated largely in Britain and has never had money troubles. He has more
horses in training worldwide - 608 - than anyone, and more than that again
in his breeding operation, based mainly in Britain and Ireland.
Because of the prize money structure, US owners have a chance of making
racing pay, something which is almost impossible in Britain, where Sheikh
Mohammed has most of his horses in training.
Paulson regards racing as business-cum-enjoyable-hobby, whereas Sheik
Mohammed, the defence minister of the UAE, prefers to see racing as a sport.
The bloodstock market may have been in the doldrums for the last five years,
but Sheik Mohammed's pursuit of excellence has not slackened. This is much
to the relief of the Kentucky breeding industry, which has provided 89 of
the 117 Kentucky Derby winners and was responsible for Arazi.
Both Arazi's owners have established huge brood mare bands, and soon will be
hoping to breed another Arazi. But horses like Arazi emerge once in 20 -
perhaps once in 50 - years, as today's great Kentucky race is likely to
confirm.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Sport: Two clubs who have cracked their codes - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE not many days when I am torn between watching rugby union or rugby
league but today is one of them. This afternoon I could see the two
outstanding teams at their respective codes in action a few miles from one
another: Bath at Twickenham, where they will try to win the rugby union
Pilkington Cup a week after they wrapped up the league; and Wigan at
Wembley, where they will do the double if they defeat Castleford in the Silk
Cut Challenge Cup, having already won the championship.
Bath and Wigan are 250 miles apart yet joined by their outstanding success
in recent years at the two codes of the oval ball game. Bath have been the
dominant union club in England since the election before the election before
last. This is their seventh Cup final; they have won the previous six. They
have won the league title three times.
Wigan have found success at rugby league more recently. At the start of the
1980s they were in division two and facing bankruptcy. Such is their
transformation that if they win today it will be the third year in a row
that they have collected both of League's top prizes the Challenge Cup and
the Stones Bitter Championship: indeed, it will be their fifth successive
Challenge Cup.
The success of Bath and Wigan is often attributed to players and officials.
Invariably, however, there is one man who is oiling the wheels, whose
thinking sets the patterns, who can be regarded as the moving force of the
club.
At Bath it is Jack Rowell, the club's chief coach, who was recently
appointed coach of England's B squad. Rowell commands respect from his
players while retaining his distance from them. 'An hour with him is worth
five with anyone else,' a supporter said. Why? 'He talks such good sense. He
has one of the quickest minds I have ever come across.'
Rowell's work at Bath is in his free time, unpaid and voluntary. Rugby union
is an amateur game but it has not stopped him bringing the management
techniques and skill he employs as chief executive of Golden Wonder Foods to
the Recreation Field. He works tirelessly with his players, improving their
individual skills, making them more rounded players and thereby of more use
to Bath, making them what Wigan's chairman refers to as the complete
product.
Take Jim Fallon as an example. At Bath he has matured into one of the finest
left wings in the country, fast and, at nearly 15 stone, strong enough to
barrel his way past others. Victor Ubogu, the prop, is another who has been
brought on. As for Ben Clarke, the No 8 who joined from Saracens, he may now
be the best No 8 in English rugby.
Waiting in the wings are young men like John Mallett, the prop, and Audley
Lumsden at full back. One of the reasons for Rowell's success as a
businessman is his success with people. He is a natural pedagogue, a born
teacher and in the past 15 years at Bath he has worked the oracle with
successive captains, from Roger Spurrell to Simon Halliday and now Stuart
Barnes.
The man behind Wigan's rise achieved nothing as a player. For Maurice
Lindsay, Wigan was a cause he wanted to take up. He had the money following
the sale of his bookmaking business and the club was ready for a dose of his
cheerful common and financial sense and commitment. Ring Wigan in the early
evening after the office staff have gone and it is likely to be Lindsay who
answers the telephone.
He is running a multi-million pound business. The players earn an average of
Pounds 90,000; the minimum is Pounds 45,000. Including bonuses, the players
are expected to receive nearly Pounds 2m this season.
To meet this bill and other costs, an income of Pounds 3m is needed. Norweb
(the North West Electricity Board) is the club's main sponsor. Wigan were
always well-supported. Their average gate is more than 15,000, twice as many
as any other League club except Leeds and an astonishing tribute to the fans
and to the players. Thus match receipts make a significant contribution
towards the annual running costs of the club, as do a nightclub, smaller
sponsors and a shop selling associated products.
One of Lindsay's shrewdest decisions was to bring first the New Zealander
Graham Lowe and now John Monie from Australia as coaches. These two men were
at the cutting edge of the game in the Antipodes. Their success with Wigan
has tilted the balance of power towards northern Europe. In the vocational
aspect of his work, Monie echoes Rowell. 'I try to educate players to the
game, to understand themselves and their team mates. I'd like to think that
when I leave here they should all know enough to go on and become coaches.'
At Bath, Rowell has developed a blueprint that has withstood the scrutiny
and copying of coaching administrators at other clubs, such as Barry Corless
at Northampton. 'Orrell are a match for us in commitment, Northampton in the
way they have got the club organised,' says Stuart Barnes, Bath's captain.
'But at the moment and for the foreseeable future we have that ruthless edge
in will and determination.' There is no sign of this waning. They have lost
only two league matches at home since the league's inception.
For that matter, Wigan are in no danger of losing their dominance in rugby
league. Their crushing victory over Warrington last Sunday was their 22nd
victory in a row. Thirteen of their players will tour Australasia with Great
Britain this summer, the highest total ever from one club.
Wigan have swept every trophy except for the Premier trophy, and they could
win that this year. The double was rare enough until they first did it two
seasons ago. A treble would be unheard of, fantastic. But then Wigan are
just that, fantastic. Rugby Union could learn a lot from them.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Motoring: Ferrari - The ultimate executive toy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR MAKERS, keen to let motoring correspondents try their latest products
well away from radars and flashing blue lights, often let them loose on
private circuits.
It is lovely idea, but it sometimes ends with the makers shooting themselves
in the foot.
A car may ride superbly and have courtly manners on the road. Driven
unrealistically hard on a track it can feel blancmange soft, cart-horse
clumsy and desperately unhappy.
Conversely, one that goes like a dream on a circuit might prove insufferable
on a long journey because the tyres would thump and roar badly enough to put
dental fillings at risk and make radio listening impossible. To all but
fanatical enthusiasts, these things matter.
So what does a motoring journalist do? First, hope the new model is to
launched in Germany, where much of the autobahn is still free of speed
limits though a 130 kph (81 mph) maximum is recommended.
Another option, of course, is to enjoy, and then largely forget, a bash
round a circuit.
A third is to break the law on public roads in the service of one's readers
and hope for the best. This I consider no longer acceptable. I am not sure
that it ever was acceptable, although all of us did it when roads were less
crowded and penalty points had not been invented.
But there are exceptions to every rule. The car I sampled in Italy a couple
of weeks ago was absolutely wonderful to drive on a private circuit because
it was the only place one could possibly begin to appreciate its potential.
It was a Ferrari; the new 512 TR coupe developed from the Testarossa. It
looked purposeful, even intimidating. Rather like one of those US spy
aircraft that fly to the edge of space at twice the speed of sound. On the
company's own test track I discovered at last what it was like to drive a
Ferrari untroubled by conscience or inhibited by fear of getting caught.
While clearly a very close relative of the Testarossa, the 512 TR has been
improved in every department. The 12-cylinder 'boxer' (horizontally opposed)
engine located behind the seats has been developed to deliver an
awe-inspiring 422 horsepower at 6,750 rpm. Yet the clutch is surprisingly
light and the ride, on a smooth track at any rate, far less harsh than a
Testarossa's.
When you give the 512 TR its head and the tachometer needle swings round the
dial, the acceleration is not just urgent but violent. The traditional
Ferrari exhaust note - a cross between the bellowing of an enraged bull and
the sound of a sail splitting - has been muted. Massive catalytic converters
needed to make it usable in places like the US and Switzerland are to blame.
At the end of the short straight I had to brake hard at about 125 mph (200
kph) for a series of right- and left-hand hand bends ranging from first or
second gear hairpins to sweeping third-gear curves.
By comparison with Ferrari test driver Dario Benuzzi, who showed me how it
should be done in an even fiercer Ferrari F40, I was driving the 512 TR
quite gently. He left his braking later than I would have dared, peaking at
135 mph (217 kph) on the straight. And he powered his car through the bends
far more quickly and smoothly than I could, steering as much with the
throttle as by turning the wheel.
Even so, I was able for the first time to appreciate the design and
engineering excellence of a Ferrari.
Sadly, little of this is revealed on public roads. On the autobahn, I have
driven Ferrari Boxer Berlinettas and Testarossas at over 160 mph (260kph).
It was exciting, of course, but gave one little idea of the enormous
reserves of handling and roadholding - though it did of the braking - so
expensively built into these cars.
On normal roads full of traffic, I have reckoned Testarossa, which is more
than 6 ft (197.6 cm) wide unpleasantly bulky and been bothered by poor
all-round visibility from the driving seat. Unless one changed gear with
great care, there was a slight crunch every time. The lever still works in a
miniature version of the gate found in old Scammell lorries.
Before driving the 512 TR I had a look round the nearby Maranello factory.
It was an education. I had imagined a cottage industry operation. But since
Ferrari was taken over by Fiat four years ago, money by the bucketful has
been spent on equipping it with the world's finest machine tools and new
production facilities.
By any normal business standards, it cannot possibly be economic, because
only 4,000 Ferraris are made each year. This is partly to keep the market
hungry. But if cars are produced to aerospace tolerances - which Ferraris
are - high volumes are neither possible nor desirable.
Although control ultimately rests with its Fiat paymasters, Ferrari is left
to run its own affairs. Gruppo Fiat clearly sees it as the brightest jewel
in its crown. It hopes that its mainstream products - the Cinquecentos and
Tempras, Lancia Dedras and Themas, Alfa Romeo 155s and 164s - will bask in
Ferrari's reflected glory.
All of which begs a crucial question. When one has bought a Ferrari (prices
from about Pounds 66,000 for a 3.4 litre V8 Mondial to over Pounds 200,000
for the F40, which is just going out of production) what can one actually do
with it?
A scarlet Ferrari - the colour chosen by 90 per cent of buyers - stands out
like a sore thumb. On the rare occasions one sees a Ferrari on a British
motorway it is being driven sedately, mobbed by young sales reps in speeding
Ford Escorts and Astra diesel vans.
The French autoroutes (130 kph or 81 mph limited) crawl with police. There
was a shock for a Ferrari owner unwise enough to drive seriously fast on a
Dutch motorway recently. He was mortified to discover the law allowed the
court to confiscate his car, sell it and hand the proceeds to the
government.
Ferrari people privately concede that most of their cars are bought as
symbols by men (and very occasionally women) eager to demonstrate their
machismo or financial status or both. Rarely, if ever, are they driven in a
manner that exploits the qualities so lovingly and expensively built into
them.
The only way they can legally be let off the leash is through organisations
like Britain's 96 Club (11 Gloucester Road, London SW7 4PP). They rent
racing circuits on which members can purge their motoring systems of
frustration in a glorious, pipe-opening blast.
Ferrari recognises that the day may come when supercars like the 512 TR will
no longer be road legal. Even so, it plans to replace the F40 with am even
wilder dream machine and will launch a new model (not the F40 successor) at
Paris Show in October. Still more are in the pipeline.
The youthful and charismatic president of Ferrari, Luca di Montezemolo, is
confident demand for his cars will continue. 'They are unique . . . and men
desire them as they would a beautiful woman,' he told me. And what if they
cannot drive them on the road any more? 'Then they will use them on a track.
Our strategy will not change,' he said.
I am sure he is right. But it does seem a shame that Pounds 130,000 worth of
magnificent high speed machinery like a Ferrari 512 TR is really no more
than the ultimate executive toy.

eclectic range of crafts and textiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LIVINGSTONE Studio is the sort of place you could spend ages in, simply
admiring the craftsmanship and design of traditional and contemporary
textiles.
The white-washed walls of the Hampstead, London, gallery are adorned with
exquisite garments fashioned from fine cotton, linen and Indian silks. An
eclectic collection of artefacts - such as boldly coloured tapestries,
hand-crafted wooden bowls and platters, and individually designed
plant-holders - is scattered about, complementing the clothing. The high
ceilings and many windows enhance the viewing.
For lovers of art and fashion this could well be the ultimate shopping
experience.
There are no shop assistants hovering around - you can look at your leisure
just as you would observe paintings in a gallery. But should you want to
know more about the exclusive range of items, owners Inge Cordsen and Kate
Crosfield will give a guided tour.
'Just look at the traditional tie and dye work here,' says Cordsen,
displaying a pale gold Indian silk dress which appears to be finely
embroidered. Closer inspection reveals no stitching - hours of detailed
tying and dying have produced an amazing effect of design and texture.
For intricate stitching, Cordsen shows off a hand-made silk appliqued
outfit, comprising coat, dress and trousers. Their most expensive item, at
Pounds 1,147, is a delight to examine and touch.
With Livingstone Studio, Crosfield and Cordsen did what they were strongly
advised against doing - opened their doors to the public in the recession.
Last year, the two embarked on nine months of research - including a
three-month business course for Crosfield and five weeks travelling around
India in search of hand-woven silks, antique shawls and colourful village
handicrafts. In October they had their first exhibition.
Their third exhibition, now under way, features their spring and summer
clothes collection. 'Indigo and ivory' combines textiles and garments of
natural colours and dyes, hand-woven cottons and silks, quilts and cushions,
antique English linens and lace. Space is also devoted to the work of young
British textile artists.
Clothing prices start at Pounds 58 for a hand-finished cotton blouse with
hand-made buttons. A 17th century lace shawl costs Pounds 250, cashmere and
silk scarves Pounds 180, a raw silk skirt and jacket about Pounds 365. Some
clothing items can be made to order and a selection of fabrics is for sale.
German-born Cordsen has been designing textiles and knitwear since leaving
art college in the mid-1960s. Customers for her knitwear range - a business
operated separately from the studio - include Liberty's, Harrods and
companies in Italy and Japan.
Crosfield specialises in collecting antique garments and textiles. The
studio's second exhibition featured 19th century textiles and artefacts from
the Sarakatsani nomadic shepherds in the Balkans, some of which are still on
show.

<DATELINE>
   IF YOU are looking for a present
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
whether for a wedding, a christening, a birthday or an anniversary - it is
worth taking a look at the mail-order company Silver Direct.
A selection of its silverware is pictured below. Nothing it sells is
startling. You will not find in its brochure anything to amaze or wonder at.
What you will find is solid, dependable, classic (if not staid) pieces at
very affordable prices. Silver Direct sells fine-quality silver made into
the sort of everyday articles that most people want at prices that it claims
are considerably lower than most retailers - and a quick check reveals its
claims to be true.
For example, some admirably plain cutlery - Rat Tail design - selling at
Pounds 50 for a place setting (table knife, fork, spoon, desert knife, fork
and spoon) in silver-plate and at Pounds 238 a place-setting in sterling
silver sells in another emporium for Pounds 107 for silver plate and Pounds
354 for sterling silver. Other classic patterns - Old English, Kings,
Queens, Fiddle Thread and Shell, Albany, Dubarry and St. James - are also
available.
Then there are hip flasks (Pounds 185) and pillboxes (Pounds 45), a plain
square silver-plated photograph frame (3 1/3 ins by 2 1/2 ins Pounds 16),
silver and gilt 12 bore salt and pepper shakers (Pounds 129), pure bristle
silver military bushes and combs (Pounds 165) and all the other
appurtenances deemed essential to the solid bourgeois life.
On the more glamorous front there is also a selection of jewellery - safe
and accessible as you would expect (Russian bangles, twisted knot ear-rings)
but nonetheless good value. Nothing in the brochure costs more than Pounds
500.
Part of the reason prices are good is that Silver Direct does not hold a lot
of stock, so orders take between one week and a month to arrive. The other
reason is that Silver Direct has low overheads, no city centre rents and few
staff. For a brochure write to Silver Direct, 3 Crosland Place, Taybridge
Road, London SW11 5PJ. Tel: 071-228-0634.

AS THE price of real pearls soars beyond the reach of all but Eastern (or, I
suppose, Western) potentates, and as even cultured pearls are becoming
increasingly expensive, Cobra &amp; Bellamy has developed a stunning range of
faux glass pearls.
What makes its range more interesting than most is that they are used with
great generosity - no timid little rows of sedate pretend-real baubles,
these are generous strings of slightly irregularly shaped Baroque beads
given special panache by the clasps, all of which are copies of originals
from the 1920s.
Most of the cheaper strings of fakes in department stores are spoiled by
their colour - too bright and too white (mainly plastic) - and by the
give-away cheapness of the clasps. The Cobra &amp; Bellamy 'pearls' are glass
beads with a nacrous coating which apes very realistically the iridescent
sheen of real pearls. The clasps are equally false but equally bold - faux
carved emerald and paste, faux ruby and paste, faux jade and paste stones
are used to create distinctive designs which give zest to the whole string.
Cobra &amp; Bellamy find that though many of its customers are the sort one
might expect to wear only 'real' jewellery, they buy these strings because
they feel so much easier walking around wearing something that cost a few
hundred as opposed to thousands of pounds.
The two strings and clasps photographed here cost Pounds 680 for the five
row necklace with a faux carved emerald and paste clasp set in silver. If
the pearls were cultured and the clasp real they would probably cost Pounds
60,000. The three-row necklace has a clasp of faux jade and paste stones set
in silver and costs Pounds 380.
Cobra &amp; Bellamy is at 149, Sloane Street, London SW1 and at Liberty, Regent
Street, London W1.

FT  02 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: The best platform for dancefloor poseurs -
The shoe sculptures of Michel Perry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU glance around any of the hot Paris nightclubs, such as the Folies
Pigalle or Les Bains, it sometimes seems as though every self-respecting
girl on the dancefloor is wearing a pair of Michel Perry platform shoes.
Perry used to be one of the best kept secrets in Paris. For years the
fashion parties and art openings in the city have been packed with
Parisiennes shod in his spindly stilettos. Now he sells his shoes further
afield to shops such as Joseph in London and Barney's in New York.
What makes the 42-year-old Perry different from most of the current crop of
fashionable shoe designers is that he does not design for a particular type
of woman. 'It's a question of esprit, of attitude,' he says. 'My shoes are
for women of all ages, from girls of 17 to women in their 50s.'
The cast list of his customers bears this out. The funkier styles are
snapped up by super-models, such as Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer, or
by the new generation of French stars, like Vanessa Paradis, the pouting
'tweetiepie' in Chanel's Coco commercial. But Elizabeth Taylor, a star of a
very different vintage, picked up a pair of Michel Perry's while she was
shopping in New York.
His collection is certainly eclectic. The spring range, now being sold from
his pretty pink and yellow shops on the rue de Grenelle in St Germain and
rue de Turbigo near Les Halles, includes elegant '50s stilettos and dainty
mules which could be worn anywhere, however smart, as well as the platforms.
Perry sees his shoes as 'archetypally French, very sexy, always elegant but
with a witty twist'. He takes classic styles such as mules or stilettos and
makes them in new colours - pale pastels for this season  - with distinctive
heels in square or circular shapes. His designs are always idiosyncratic,
but never too much so. 'I like my shoes to be witty, but never to the point
of caricature like some of the young English designers.'
Each collection has a different theme. This summer he was inspired by images
of 'haute couture in the late 1950s' and the 'elegance of Paris after the
war'. For next autumn, he has gone for a 'more decadent look, a little
Moulin Rouge, a little Baroque' with high-heeled boots embellished with the
sort of buckles and straps which would not look too out of place in the shop
windows of the seedy Saint Denis district near his rue Turbigo shop, and a
'Roman Holiday' range of dapper brogues with flat heels and very, very
pointed toes.
His prices are about the same as those of his compatriots, Robert Clergerie
and Stephane Kelian, at around Pounds 150 a pair, and his shoes are made to
a similar standard. All his shoes are made in the same factory near Venice
that he has worked with for ten years. 'It's an artisan sophistique, not too
big and not too small. My shoes designs have so many little details that the
shoes are difficult to make. It is the only place I've ever found that can
do exactly what I want.'
Perry now employs seven people in Paris and makes 30,000 shoes a year at the
Italian factory. His business is expanding - a new shop, his first outside
France, opens in Madrid later this month - but he does not want it to get
much bigger. 'There will only ever be a limited market for my shoes,' he
says. 'In any case, I want to spend my time designing, not trying to be a
businessman.'

IF YOU have seen either of the Rembrandt exhibitions currently showing in
London - whether the paintings and etchings at the new Sainsbury Wing of The
National Gallery, or the drawings at the British Museum - you are likely to
have come away with images that you will remember for ever.
Few of us are in the genuine Rembrandt-owning league, but there are now fine
techniques for reproducing some of the images and The Quintessa Art
Collection has produced some exceptionally fine facsimiles of a few of the
Rembrandt drawings on show.
The prints come beautifully mounted in cream and sepia. All come with
relevant curatorial information and the imprimature of British Museum
approval attached to the back, and prices are exceedingly reasonable.
Two women teaching a child to walk - an exceptionally tender drawing and one
of my favourites, photographed above - measures 10 ins by 9 ins and costs
Pounds 33, mounted but unframed, Pounds 59 framed. Other favourites are the
Study of a Lioness (15 ins by 11 ins, Pounds 40 mounted, Pounds 82 framed),
and Study of a Girl Sleeping (13 ins by 15 ins (Pounds 47 mounted, Pounds 94
framed). From the British Museum gift shop, The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum
gift shop, The General Trading Company and Fortnum &amp; Mason's Stationery

FT  02 MAY 92 / Echoes of Achilles haunt this ancient mystery: Kerin Hope
investigates the evidence for a murder most foul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANCIENT whodunnit has a special fascination, particularly when the gentle
scraping of an archaeologist's trowel unexpectedly reveals the murder
victim.
Nikos Stampolidis has been excavating an early Greek cemetery at Eleutherna,
in the western foothills of Mount Ida on the island of Crete: 'a site full
of surprises,' as he puts it. Not the least of these is a striking
connection between his grisly find and a famous burial ceremony conducted
outside Troy, the ancient city described in Homer's Iliad.
The city of Eleutherna, built in a splendid defensive position on a long
narrow hill cut off by a ravine on each side, flourished from the 11th
century BC until the Romans conquered Crete.
In the 1920s British archaeologists found several striking pieces of
sculpture of the archaic period. When the University of Crete resumed
excavations there in the mid-1980s, Doctor Stampolidis decided to dig on the
steep western slope.
He unearthed more statue fragments - some built into terracing for the olive
groves which now cover the hill - suggesting that Eleutherna was an
important centre of early Greek art. The leg of a finely carved 'kouros,' a
nude figure of a young man, dates from the 6th century BC. It is made of
local limestone, and would have stood almost six feet high.
Four small, delicately worked ivory heads of figurines, perhaps gods or
heroes, date from a century earlier. These were found in one of a
bewildering array of burials in the cemetery, which was used by generations
of city-dwellers from the 10th to the 6th century BC.
Children were often buried in pithoi: Ali Baba-style jars used for storing
oil or honey. Many adults ware cremated on funeral pyres built of neatly
stacked logs of pine or cypress. Nikos Stampolidis says: 'They wore their
best clothes and their jewellery; they were surrounded by offerings and
household goods. Afterwards the bones were collected and cleaned, then
preserved in a covered jar.'
Last summer, while cleaning the remains of one pyre, the excavators revealed
part of another, more extravagant cremation: 'a rich, important man, judging
from the bones of goats and cattle and and a pair of ox horns that were
found - all slaughtered for the burial.'
From one side of the pyre came a surprising find: a curving line of human
vertebrae. Beside it lay a whetstone, a perfume bottle and the neck of a
broken water jar. The leg bones were burned, and the skull was missing.
'Instead we found a double-edged iron knife, broken. It would have been
about 12 inches long.' Studies of the bones by Tina McGeorge, a British
expert, showed that the headless man was about 40 years old and powerfully
built. His spine was forced into an unnatural curve - apparently because his
arms were tightly bound behind his back, perhaps with a piece of wood thrust
in between, to pull back his head. His throat had been cut. 'The man was
killed in a kneeling position, and fell on to his right side. I think his
head was probably tossed on to the centre of the pyre.'
Was it an expiatory sacrifice, an execution, or a ritual revenge killing?
Stampolidis thinks the victim may have been a prisoner of war, executed at
the funeral of the man he killed. From the style of the perfume bottle, the
execution can be dated to about 725-700 BC.
This was the period, some five centuries after the probable date of the
Trojan war, when Homer's epic poems were written down. The execution remains
discovered on Crete vividly recall the scene in the Iliad where Achilles,
the Greek hero, buries his friend Patroclus on a huge funeral pyre, after
slitting the throats of 'twelve noble sons of great-hearted Trojans' in
revenge for his death.
The ritual of execution in early Greece was elaborate. A virgin brought
water in a jar to dampen the whetstone; the knife used to decapitate the
victim had to be broken and immediately discarded. If Patroclus' burial is
anything to go by, Nikos Stampolidis may find more human victims this summer
when he uncovers the rest of the pyre.
'Perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised to discover that some of Homer's
descriptions of the Trojan war were really drawn from contemporary Greek
life.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / The dream of steam that nearly drowned: An epic - and
ultimately tragic - 19th century voyage to chart the mighty Euphrates river
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KITCHING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a remarkable story of two 19th century visionaries, one a novelist,
the other a soldier. Their dream was of a steamboat expedition down the
uncharted Euphrates river: a voyage to match the great achievements of
ancient Greece and Rome.
Two paddle-steamers would be built in England, shipped in parts to the
Syrian shore, transported overland by hundreds of camels or oxen to the
upper reaches of the mighty river, and assembled on its banks. The
expedition, the first full British survey of the Euphrates, was to bring
tragedy, as described in a new book by John Guest*.
First, the two men and their vision. Thomas Love Peacock - a tall, handsome,
novelist friend of the poet Shelley - worked for the East India Company. He
believed the Euphrates could be a commercial route from Britain to India.
His associate was Francis Chesney, a small, wiry artillery
officer-turned-explorer who believed strongly that nothing was impossible.
Later, he was to be hailed by some as the father of the Suez Canal.
The Euphrates expedition was not simply the dream of two men. It was an
attempt by the British government to achieve a geo-political end by
technological means. The objective was to halt Russian expansion in the near
east, which was seen as a threat to India. The instrument was to be a
flotilla of iron-hulled paddle-steamers that would patrol the Euphrates from
the Anatolian mountains to the Persian Gulf.
Peacock was a classical scholar. He knew that, more than 1,500 years
earlier, the Roman emperors Trajan and Julian had led flotillas of
flat-bottomed craft down the Euphrates as far as Babylon in support of their
campaigns.
In 1829, Peacock sent a memorandum to Lord Ellenborough, president of the
India Board, expressing his fear that a foreign power might threaten
Britain's interests by repeating the emperors' triumphs.
Ellenborough decided there should be a feasibility study of the Euphrates
route. Chesney, already 41, was chosen. He completed his survey in September
1832, and met Peacock for the first time in January 1833. His diary records:
'I found that he (Peacock) was deeply versed in the ancient history of the
Euphrates and that he had not only been the first to bring this line of
communication with India forward, but that he had collected in a thick book
every private notice he could find of that river, whether contained in
Gibbon, Balbi, or any other work.'
The two decided to suggest a trial expedition. By late 1834, the dream of
the great river journey was about to come true. Guest writes: 'A plan of
action had already been prepared. Two iron vessels would be built and tried
out in England; six months after placing the order, they should be ready to
be shipped off in frame. The larger one would measure 100 tons and would be
powered by two 25hp engines, while the smaller, designed for the low-water
season, would measure between 60 and 70 tons with two 8hp engines.
'If they were shipped to the Syrian coast, as Chesney recommended, the
voyage would take about 50 days. Five days would be required for unloading
the crates and tracking them up the Orontes to a point near Antioch, whence
camels and heavy wagons could transport the entire 300-ton load in three
journeys to Bir, only 50 miles distant, in a week.
'Allowing 40 days to reassemble the vessels, the initial 1,100-mile trip
down the Euphrates, which would also require time for negotiations with the
Arabs and for laying down coal depots, should bring them to Basra a month
later - for a total elapsed time of 131 days after leaving England.
'The return trip upstream to Bir was estimated at eight to 10 days.
Thereafter, for the duration of the experiment, assumed to be 12 months,
regular trips would take eight days to go up-river and five days to go
down.'
Orders for the steamers were placed with Lairds of Birkenhead. By the end of
1834, the impatient Chesney had named the ships Tigris and Euphrates,
abandoned the idea of sea trials, and begun to organise the packing. He
chartered the 390-ton George Canning to transport the vessels, and loading
was completed by February 1 1835. On February 10, the journey began.
By April, it had reached the Bay of Antioch. Chesney, impatient as ever,
decided to assemble the smaller steamboat, the Tigris, and to test it on the
Orontes river. Riveters, smiths and carpenters were put to work. Two weeks
later it was launched. But it steered badly in the shallow waters of the
river, and Chesney decided to unship the paddles and drag the hull overland
in several pieces to the Euphrates.
Guest writes: 'The expedition's carpenters and smiths, helped by local
artisans and using lumber from the area, started work on building wagons to
carry the heavier loads over the hills.
'Oxen had for centuries provided the power to move things overland, but many
of the bullocks, procured with much difficulty, were ill-adapted to team
work. The most effective means of traction proved to be a combination of
human and animal power.'
It took several weeks for the parts of the Tigris and Euphrates to be
dragged to Port William, south of Bir on the upper reaches of the river. By
autumn, after much activity, the larger of the two ships was almost ready.
The Euphrates was launched on September 26, sliding sideways down a 25ft
slope.
By now, though, Chesney had caught malaria. The weather was worsening and it
became clear that a voyage down the river would not be possible during the
winter. It looked as if the dream might fall apart. But by spring 1836, the
outlook had improved: Chesney was somewhat better and the Tigris had been
launched. It set off downstream on May 4, followed by the Euphrates on May
8.
The journey proved worse than anyone could have imagined. Within days, the
two steamers were hit by a violent storm. Witnesses said it lasted only 12
minutes; yet, the Tigris was wrecked. Guest records: 'In pitch darkness,
almost on its beam ends, the Tigris drifted down the river with water
pouring through the windows, which nobody could close. The engineer remained
at his post and two other men struggled vainly with the windows, while the
rest of the ship's company gathered in silence on the after-deck.'
The order to stand fast was given, but most of those huddled on the deck
were unprepared when the Tigris sank suddenly in 30ft of water. One of the
crew recalled 'being balanced on the awning ropes, with a native holding my
feet and screaming piteously.' Twenty of the 37 people on board died.
On May 24, Chesney told his remaining crew that he had received orders to
disband the expedition by the end of July. Despite that, he was determined,
if his colleagues agreed, to continue the descent of the river.
'Predictably, Chesney's appeal was effective. 'One and all,' he records,
'officers and men at once expressed themselves not only ready but anxious to
second me in every way, and volunteered to forego their expedition pay in
order to lessen our expenses as much as possible'.'
On June 19 1836, 91 days after leaving Bir, the Euphrates steamed down the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway. By now, crates and barrels were being used to eke
out the fuel supply. It anchored at Basra, within sight of the Persian Gulf,
at noon: almost journey's end. After a brief rest, Chesney took the
Euphrates up the Tigris to complete his survey of the two rivers. But his
epic journey was to be in vain. Six years later, in 1842, a report to a
House of Commons committee, based on the experiences of the Euphrates,
declared the river 'not well adapted for the purposes of steam navigation.'
Peacock, his dream in ruins, resumed writing essays and reviews, including
his reminiscences of Shelley. But he never wrote of the project that he had
conceived, promoted and observed for years. He died in 1866, aged 80.
For Chesney, the hot-headed visionary, the dream of the great river never
died. He returned to the Euphrates and become associated with abortive
projects to build a railway up the valley. He died in 1872, aged 83.

3000 years - A new series on the stories uncovered by archaeology

<TEXT>
NATSEF AMUN was a priest in the great temple of Amun at Karnak, near Luxor
in upper Egypt, in the reign of Ramesses XI (1113-1085 BC). He lived a pure
priestly life, taking two baths a day and two at night, and shaving his head
and body daily. He did not wear animal products of wool and leather, but had
linen robes and papyrus shoes like espadrilles.
He died, and was mummified, with his tongue sticking out. The mummy men
worked quickly - we know because his eyes were still in his head - to remove
the vital organs and dry his body before packing it with spices and wrapping
him in more than 40 layers of cloth, both fine linen and dishrags. Then they
gave him garlands of red berries and lotus flowers and put him in an
anthropoid (body-shaped) double coffin and buried him. Three thousand years
later he has come back to life with a full medical dossier, thanks to the
Manchester Mummy Project.
On display at the Manchester Museum until May 23, when he returns to his
permanent home in Leeds Museum, Natsef Amun crossed the Pennines to see the
Mancunian consultants, who specialise in describing mummies and their
ailments. Prognoses are impossible, since these patients are centuries dead.
Like all visits to a new doctor, the first questions about the patient were
who he was and how he lived. The hieroglyphs on his coffin gave his name and
occupation, as the worthies of the Leeds Literary and Philosophical Society
discovered in 1828 when they translated the texts and made a first
examination of him soon after he reached Leeds (via Trieste, Paris and the
Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly). They wrote up their investigation in a 60-page
Account of an Egyptian Mummy.
As a priest of Amun, Natsef Amun's job was to be the scribe/accountant in
charge of the corn offered to, and eaten by, the sacred cattle that were to
be sacrifices for the god's daily feast. The priests ate the steak and other
good food which the god naturally could not eat himself.
The medical confirmed this comfortable, privileged life. A body scan
revealed no degenerative diseases apart from arthritis in the neck and an
early stage of hip osteoarthritis, which today would mark him as a candidate
for a hip replacement.
The scan also showed that his brain had been removed in the usual fashion
during mummification. Then the organs were put in urns, called Canopic jars,
or wrapped in small packages for replacing in the body cavities. Natsef
Amun's surviving organs, including his kidneys, were lost in 1941 when the
Leeds Museum was bombed.
To look at him internally the doctors used an endoscope, a tube that reaches
parts they could not reach. Top of the agenda was to determine why his
tongue stuck out. Did he have throat cancer? Endoscopy suggested he did not.
Had a bee stung him? Possibly. Or was it much worse - had he been strangled?
Scientists could not rule that out. After 3,000 years it is hard to certify
the precise cause of death.
The endoscope also takes tissue samples. They probed the chest, hoping that
the mummifiers had left some bits behind even though his organs had gone. As
mummification is a process of drying the body by packing it with natron (a
natural compound of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate named after the
Wadi Natrun north west of Cairo), today doctors can restore tissue samples
by rehydrating them and fixing them so that they do not rot.
Natsef Amun's samples gave his blood group and his DNA. That can tell the
person's sex - if it is not clear otherwise - and family connections, and
help to identify viral and bacterial diseases.
Next, the Manchester team removed his eye and optical nerve - a medical
triumph, as the eyes do not survive usually - and found hints of neuritis.
His surviving teeth were in good condition. With little sugar in the diet,
cavities were rare in ancient Egypt, but worn teeth were common as sand got
into the flour when it was ground in stone mortars. But he did have gum
disease, and his teeth were badly worn.
There were interesting discoveries around the groin. Natsef Amun would have
been circumcised on becoming a priest, but that could not be checked as his
penis was broken and lost. But there were signs of incipient elephantiasis
(swelling of the legs and scrotum) and atheroma, the blood vessel disease
that can lead to cramps, strokes, heart attacks and gangrene. But as the
Egyptian diet was low in cholesterol, it was not serious.
He died in middle age, says 'Fingers' Fledge, the retired fingerprints
expert of Greater Manchester police, and his hands showed that he had not
been a manual worker.
What did he look like? The scientific team used a scanner to build up a 3D
computerised X-ray image and fed that into a numerically controlled milling
machine, cutting a block of polystyrene. That gave his skull. Richard Neave,
Manchester's master of facial reconstruction who has recreated Lindow Man,
the body found in an Irish peat bog, Philip of Macedon and an unknown man
killed in the Kings Cross Underground fire, got to work with modelling clay
to show flesh thickness, and soon produced a well built man, in his mid-40s,
with a shaven head, and his tongue in its proper place.
At Manchester, bringing mummies back to life is a skill that goes back to
1908. The Manchester Mummy Project has now dealt with many mummies, and as
the home of the International Mummy Data Base, the team helps researchers
find out more about life in early Egypt and how diseases occur and recur.
Support has come from the Wellcome Trust, the British Academy, Kodak, and
Keymark, which makes the endoscopes. However, it costs about Pounds 100,000
to bring a mummy back to life, and the Mancunians are always looking for
sponsors. 'The mummies have their own bank account,' says Dr Rosalie David,
leader of the project and Egyptologist at the Manchester Museum, 'and we
hold concerts for them.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / As They Say in Europe: The missing ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE thing you have to say about the German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, is that he always knows when to move on. He quit the coalition
with the Social Democrats ten years ago when they looked in trouble, and now
he has left Chancellor Kohl in the lurch. As the German Press agency, DPA,
put it, his resignation could not have come at a worse time for the
Chancellor, who was facing the first large national strike in nearly 20
years, the rise of something nasty on the right and a general pessimism
about almost everything.
So the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote: 'An era in Germany's post-war
history is coming to an end, an era which was linked to the name of
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Like nobody else, he embodied continuity over the
years.' It concluded that in Europe, Genscher's weight had increased had
increased since the unification of Germany, which is one way of putting it.
Germany's problems might have been expected to add to the the pleasure of
nations: the media in neighbouring countries find it hard to conceal their
true feelings when Germany faces the kind of trouble that normally afflicts
them. But under an editorial entitled, 'The price of reunification' in Le
Figaro, Georges Suffert said the price was being paid by everybody. 'If the
German government gives in (to the strikers), we should not have any
illusions.' It would mean the end of the hopes of lower interest rates and
maybe worse than that: Suffert quoted Thomas Mann who said Germans show
their lack of maturity in times of trouble.
One country that seems to show some maturity at such times is Russia. At
least that is what the deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar told all of us who
had assembled in Washington as his country was admitted to the IMF and World
Bank. We thought his confidence seemed to border on complacency, but that
attitude was shared by his country's media. Nezavisimaya Gazeta said western
warnings about backsliding over tough fiscal policies were made for
'educational purposes.' The warnings were not meant for national leaders but
for their opponents and supporters. 'In fact, the readiness of western
partners to share their views with the reformers' team is much more vigorous
than necessary.' In other words, please do not bother us with your troubles.
The hero of the last IMF meeting was Grigory Yavlinsky - the top Russian
economist of 1991. He disappeared with Gorbachev but popped up in
Komsomolskaya Pravda. The Russian insouciance was apparent when he wrote
about the Group of Seven aid package that had been promised as a result of
IMF approval for Russian policies: 'The Dollars 24bn assistance might prove
very useful, but only if the country knows how to use the assistance. If the
government is not efficient, wise and reasonable in its use of the credits,
they may bring serious losses. The trust of the people, not the money, is at
stake now.'
Germany and Russia may have dominated the international stage last week but
that did not mean nobody else had troubles. Most problems turn up at IMF
meetings but few noticed the appalling state of affairs in the Netherlands,
or its consequences. The country has an incomes policy but it collapsed last
week and this meant the Dutch finance minister, Wim Kok, could not turn up
for vital meetings. The Dutch have been complaining for years about the way
they are left out of the international decision-making process. The one
forum they do attend is what is irrationally known as the Group of 10, which
consists of 11 countries. It was this group which gave the formal go-ahead
to the western effort to stabilise the rouble and much else. Kok missed
other meetings too. So in NRC-Handlesblad, Roel Janssen wrote: 'Both at the
EC finance ministers' meeting where aid to non-Russia was discussed and at
the G-10 which took an important decision for the first time in years, no
minister from the Netherlands was there.'
The development aid minister, Jan Pronk, was asked about Kok's failure to
come to Washington at the one time he could have made an impact. Jos
Ter-Horst of the Algemeen Dagblad quoted the reply: 'His absence is an
investment in his future presence.'
*****
There was an unusual event in Warsaw last week. Piotr Wojcik, who is
deputy-speaker of the Sejm, the parliament, took part in a demonstration
against parliament. Zycie Warszawy said this was an example of political
schizophrenia. 'In politics, it is not enough to have rights. You have to
persuade voters about these rights. But it does not mean that in
constructing a strong and sovereign Poland, parliamentarians should
demonstrate against parliament.'

<TEXT>
like Annie Bell, about whom I wrote last week - is one of today's bright
young band of cooks who love vegetables and fish but do not eat meat.
Until last Christmas Tomasi was chef-patronne of Frith's restaurant in
London's Soho. When the new year dawned she changed tack, closed the
restaurant and set up her own cookery school, Turnaround Cooks. The move is
a happy one. Sharing ideas as she cooks, and talking over more ideas as you
eat together, suits her better than the restaurant scene where chef and
customers are, for the most part, separated by the service door.
Tomasi is warm, gregarious and generous, an exuberant cook. There is nothing
schoolmarmish about her and her classes are very informal. Nominally they
are demonstration classes rather than hands-on, but I would call them
participative. Her personality, the size of the kitchen and the numbers per
class (15 at most, more often 10) see to that.
At Turnaround Cooks you will find no meek rows of passive audience looking
up to The Cook performing on stage, never getting closer to the food than an
overhead mirrored glimpse. Instead everyone gathers round the stove and
table, close enough to weep when onions are peeled, to share an occasional
splattering of extra virgin olive oil, and to lend a hand with this or that
 -stirring, cutting, kneading or whatever. All the senses are thoroughly
engaged: sight, smell, sound and touch, as well as taste. This is a 3D
cooking experience, charting every nuance of change as a dish progresses
from raw ingredients to serving and eating.
Tomasi's is a contemporary cosmopolitan style of meatless cookery. It draws
its inspirations from the fresh, spicy flavours of places as far flung as
Thailand and the Caribbean, as well as her native Italy. This makes it
particularly attractive to the young, and stimulating for slightly
stuck-in-a-rut cooks who are in search of new adventures, but it is unlikely
to enthuse diehard classicists or followers of haute cuisine.
Most of her courses are one-day affairs, and vegetarian cookery is the
subject of many of them. The chocolate workshop, pasta and bread-making,
fish cookery, Thai cookery, and Italian regional cakes, puddings and
biscuits are other favourite subjects.
Sometimes Tomasi is joined by guest cooks (Anna Del Conte will team up with
her for a series on Italian regional cookery in the autumn) and five-day
intensive courses are being introduced in June. These will include visits to
Brixton, Berwick Street and other London markets to shop for the key
ingredients to be cooked.
A ticket to one of Tomasi's classes might make a splendid present to give to
a godchild or niece. I would probably buy two tickets and go along myself as
well - to spice up my ideas, and because a day in Carla Tomasi's company is
such fun.
The fee (usually Pounds 50 for a one-day course, inclusive of lunch with
wine) strikes me as a bargain, and an added attraction is the location.
Turnaround Cooks' classes are held in London's Notting Hill Gate, in the
kitchens of Books for Cooks, mecca for those with an appetite for culinary
reading.
SPINACH DUMPLINGS IN TOMATO &amp; BASIL BROTH
Carla Tomasi reckons that this lovely recipe is enough to make a generous
main course lunch or supper dish for three people, or a substantial first
course for four.
For the dumplings: 1 1/2 lb spinach;  3/4 lb ricotta cheese; 2 1/2 oz
freshly grated Parmesan (plus a little extra for serving if liked); freshly
grated nutmeg; 2 eggs; a little seasoned flour.
For the broth: 1 x 800g (or 2 x 400g) can(s) of plum tomatoes; 1 teaspoon
extra virgin olive oil; a few basil leaves; 2 garlic cloves; a little
passata (optional).
To make the broth, first sieve the canned tomatoes and dilute with an equal
volume of water (use the empty can(s) to measure it). Add a dash of passata
if the tomatoes are pale, as they may be very occasionally. Chop the garlic
and basil finely.
Heat the olive oil in a roomy saucepan with a large surface area and saute
the garlic and basil briefly over high heat.
Add the tomatoes, simmer gently without a lid for 20-25 minutes and season
to taste.
For the dumplings, first cook the spinach until very tender. Drain, squeeze
out the water and process to a puree. Add the ricotta, Parmesan, a generous
seasoning of salt, pepper and nutmeg, and the lightly beaten eggs. Process
again to mix well.
The mixture will be slack and slightly sticky, too soft to shape into neat,
perfectly round dumplings - which is why the Italians call them malfatti
(badly made or mis-shapen). Do not be put off: the taste and tender light
texture are exquisite.
Chill the mixture if time permits, so it firms up a little. Then, using
oiled or wetted spoons or hands, divide and shape it into soft green blobs
slightly smaller than ping-pong balls. Sit them on a floured baking tray and
set aside until shortly before serving. If refrigerated, the dumplings will
keep for two to three days.
To finish, bring the tomato broth back to a bare simmer. Shake the tray of
dumplings to roll them about and coat them lightly all over with the flour.
Then slide them into the liquid, one by one in quick succession. They will
sink as they dive in and swim to the surface when cooked, about 10 minutes
later. Keep the flame very low throughout poaching: barely a bubble should
break the surface of the liquid.
Lift out the dumplings with a draining spoon when they are ready. Serve them
in warmed soup plates with the tomato broth poured round them, and maybe a
grating of Parmesan sprinkled over them.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Wine: The '91 clarets; a hard year to sell - Edmund
Penning-Rowsell tastes last year's frost-hit vintage and finds it better
than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1991 Bordeaux vintage was written off months before the grapes were
picked, after the devastating frost of April 25/26 last year. The white wine
crop of 42 m hl was the smallest ever appellation controlee in the Gironde.
Red wine production was less than half of the two previous years at 2.16m
hl. With the vintage also affected by heavy rain, is the quality any good
and are the wines worth buying?
The first answer was given at the annual tastings of the latest vintage by
the Union des Grands Crus. The Union represents 120 leading growths, except
premiers crus and a few important chateaux which do not like their cask
samples tasted en masse with the others. I was able to taste all left-bank
firsts and one of the most reliable of the others.
The tastings showed that the 1991 vintage cannot be classed as poor,
contrary to some forecasts, and is better than 1984 and 1987. Helped by the
small yields, the wines have very good, deep colour. The more successful
have enough fruit but at this stage cannot be described as welcoming on the
nose and palate like their two predecessors.
Apart from the top wines, they were hard work to taste, and it was
significant that only 94 of the union's members showed their wines in the
tastings. The Medocs came off best; the Graves, which suffered hail and more
rain, less well; and the St Emilions or Pomerols, by their very limited
representation, demonstrated their problems. The few dry whites shown were
generally good, as were the Sauternes. The others either were not considered
ready to be shown or were probably not being offered en primeur. It is not
improbable that a number of the reds were 'assisted' by some dollops of '90,
not yet bottled; but there is no harm in that.
The Union's wines were shown more or less alphabetically by appellation. The
Medocs were divided into two tastings of 25 and 23 growths. Here are those
that I picked out in the order as arranged. The figure in brackets indicated
the number of wines tasted.
Medoc south (25): La Tour de By, Beaumont, La Begorce, Citran (particularly
successful in the bourgeois range), Angludet, Marquis de Terme and
Latour-Carnet.
Medoc north (23): Clarke, Poujeaux (very fruity), Beychevelle, Branaire,
Gruaud Larose (very good balance and structure), Lynch-Bages,
Pichon-Longueville, Pichon-Lalande, Cos Labory, Ormes de Pez and Montrose.
Red Graves (14): Domaine de Chevalier, de Fieuzal, de France, La Louviere,
Malartic-La-Graviere, Pique-Caillou and Smith-Haut-Lafitte.
White Graves (12): Chantegrive, Carbonnieux (elegant), Domaine de Chevalier
(exceptionally full-bodied, oaky), de Fieuzal (less structure but fine),
Larrivet-Haut Brion, Olivier.
Sauternes (6): Lafaurie-Peyraguey, La Tour-Blanche and Climens (the richest,
best structured).
St Emilion (5): Pavie and Troplong-Mondot.
Pomerol (9): Nenin, Petit-Village, Clinet, La Croix-de-Gay (with an
authentic brown-sugar Pomerol nose) and La Conseillante (elegant, light but
true Pomerol style).
I believe it is a mistake for the first-growths and some leading seconds to
refuse to mix with their social inferiors: as they may not always continue
to sell on their names and reputations. To visit them, individual
appointments must be made. All except Mouton-Rothschild opened their '90s
for me as well, which show how rich and concentrated the '90 vintage is, and
maybe superior to the more trumpeted '89. Listed in the order tasted, my
notes were as follows:
Haut-Brion: fine nose, well-balanced but somewhat light in flavour. (La
Mission-Haut-Brion from the same stable but different cellars had more
flavour and size).
Margaux: very elegant nose, on the light side but very well-balanced - one
of the best; the second wine, Pavillon Rouge, was surprisingly fruity and
engaging.
Lafite: very good colour, like all these firsts; elegant nose, classic style
but rather hard; its associate property in the Bas-Medoc, Cardonne, had an
agreeable oaky aroma, and light but long taste.
Mouton-Rothschild: very big colour, closed nose, but concentrated flavour
and excellent balance - particularly attractive. Its fifth-growth
Clerc-Milon was very fruity and long on the taste.
Latour: very closed on the nose now and with a good deal of tannin, but
plenty of body, and probably the most long-lived (Les Forts de Latour, the
second wine, very similar in appearance and aroma, with lots of fruit).
The Borie family own Grand-Puy-Lacoste and Ducru-Beaucaillou. The former had
colour and plenty of life and fruit, the latter more structure, elegance and
fine aroma.
The position of the '91 whites is simple: they can be excellent, but there
is very little of them. For the reds the problem is of saleability after
three fine vintages and of price. The main encouragement to buy this
controversial vintage must be bargain appeal. Yet the hard-pressed trade
needs the cash-flow of an en primeur market.
In Bordeaux, price comparisons are being made to the 1987 vintage. This
would give 'opening offer' ex-cellar, in-bond prices of around Pounds 220 a
case for the first-growths, Pounds 110 for the seconds, Pounds 60-Pounds 75
for other classed growths, Pounds 50 for many crus bourgeois, and Pounds
35-Pounds 45 for petits chateaux.
But another view is that since the 1990 prices came down 12-15 per cent and
the '91s are better than the '87s, prices should be between the '90s and
'87s. Some claim that only a steep reduction will attract buyers. The
chateaux will shortly have to decide. Lafite, Margaux and Mouton-Rothscild
have already come out at FFr 160 a bottle (Pounds 300 a case in bond). As
the classier '91s are unlikely to appreciate in price in the next year or
two, the only reason to buy them is if one is short of their predecessors
back to '86. But the crus bourgeois and the petits chateaux are likely to
develop fairly quickly, and once initially sold are unlikely to appear again
on merchants' lists in the UK.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A hive of industry in a decaying
urban landscape - Nick Garnett visits a mill where small companies have
replaced the weavers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE late-morning, mid-week train chugs out of Leeds on its slow journey
across the Pennines to Manchester. Linking a city of 500,000 with a
conurbation of over 2m, the two-car rattler has no First Class. Maybe there
is no need. Not one businessman seems to be riding it. Populated by locals
on low incomes, Romanian running shoes, Korean windcheaters, children
clutching cola and crisps, the train descends into the valley bowl which
Bradford inhabits.
The valley side is a landscape of urban blight, the occasional neat and
healthy looking structure poking up from a mess of derelict mills, rotting
house terraces and wide expanses of wasteland. A sign of a local economy too
weak to support the city? Certainly. A slice of what is a national scandal
of inner city decay? Probably. If it was in eastern Germany it would be
number one on the reconstruction list.
The rail bus reverses out of the bowl, bores its way through a long hill
tunnel and trundles down into another hollow in which Halifax spreads out
along the river Calder. Like Bradford, the town has endured the blows of
industrial decline. But it has generated a response unique in Yorkshire. In
a complex of once defunct industrial buildings, business life has been
seeping back.
The former Crossley carpet mill, with its italianate towers, was built in
1857 and was Europe's biggest carpet factory, several high blocks spread
over 35 acres and encompassing 1.25m square feet of covered space. Dean
Clough, as it is known, was finally closed in 1982. Now it houses 200
organisations including many small businesses. 'During the recession we've
had no failures but there's a bit of luck in that,' says Ernest Hall, owner
of the complex. Prince Charles has visited Dean Clough and thinks it is
wonderful.
So how have these little companies been doing and what is exercising their
owners' minds? 'I've been a Conservative voter all my life but I would have
voted for someone else in the general election if there had been anyone else
worth voting for,' says Ian Jickells. 'They have done absolutely nothing for
small businesses. It really annoys me.'
Jickells' company, JI Electronics, designs and makes control equipment, used
mainly in monitoring coal-fired boilers. Jickells is 38 and has no higher
education training in electronics or engineering - a lack of formal
qualifications seemingly prevalent among Dean Clough's businesses.
Nevertheless, JI Electronics, started seven years ago, now employs seven. It
turned over Pounds 160,000 in the year to April 1991 on which it made a
pre-tax return of Pounds 40,000. Sales, though, slid by a third in the past
year.
The condition of British schools really upsets Jickells. 'We see the state
of them. There is one in central Scotland where one boiler has literally
burnt out and the other is just hanging on. Heaven knows what would happen
if that went.' School buildings have been allowed to rot too far, he says.
However, Jickells detects an upswing. 'It was like somebody switching on a
light. It picked up about four or five months ago.' One reason he says is
that local authorities are slipping back into the market for new equipment.
Jickells is unimpressed with aid agencies. 'We've given up looking for
outside help. You lose more in time and money looking for it than you would
gain. There are too many agencies and too many people offering false
promises.'
For many small businesses, mark-ups on luxury goods and services can run
from a 100 per cent to 300 per cent, partly because a lot of small scale
garden designers, picture framers and frock sellers now seek a country
cottage and Audi lifestyle. So the customer must pay. But some businesses
operate in areas where the movement of prices is rapidly downwards, so they
need to run faster just to stand still. Soft Options Computer Systems, set
up in 1985, sells computer 'solutions' and hardware to a wide range of
customers.
'Three years ago it would have been normal to pay perhaps Pounds 2,000 for a
personal computer. Now such a machine is Pounds 900,' says Tony Capuano,
general manager. 'So if you are working on a 20 per cent margin, profits are
much less. You have to fight for every shilling. I keep saying things cannot
get cheaper - and then someone will knock Pounds 200 off the price of a box
(computer kit). It looks as if it will get tighter and tighter until
something gives."
Soft Options, with a yearly turnover of Pounds 900,000, is trying to meet
this challenge by putting together its own computer kits from components
brought from UK wholesalers of Taiwanese and US products, and by
diversifying. Sales of systems for electronic point of sales have held up
well. The company has low borrowings and an overdraft facility of just
Pounds 25,000. 'If we can't afford it we don't buy it. We're in credit more
than debit."
Dramatic shifts in fortunes have swept over Tee Jay Workwear, which
manufactures boiler suits, warehouse coats and other gear for the workplace.
The company was set up in the late 1970s and moved to Dean Clough six years
ago. Turnover fell from Pounds 400,000 in 1988 to Pounds 200,000 last year.
The workforce slid from 35 to 11. 'We were scraping the bottom of the
barrel,' says Jackie Dodd, co-owner of the company with her husband, Trevor.
Since then trade has picked up remarkably, Trevor says, with turnover
expected to be close to Pounds 400,000 again this year. Employment is back
to between 20 and 25 machinists - the Dodds are not sure of the exact
number. What has caused the comeback? 'I wish I knew. I don't,' Trevor says.
However, companies such as Sketchley Overalls are buying more than they were
a year ago.
Since leaving his job as a materials cutter for a large workwear maker, in
the mid-1970s, Trevor Dodd has never attended a business course. 'I haven't
had the time.' Profits were Pounds 20,000 three years ago, but the company
turned in losses for the past two years.
Tee Jay workers are paid an hourly rate of Pounds 2.65. Trevor says the
average (with bonuses) is Pounds 3.50. The thing that worries him most is
the even lower wages paid in other countries. 'All I seem to see in the
market in Halifax is clothing made in Yugoslavia or Poland.'
Gordon Pinder, a former salesman for Unilever, set up a general artwork
company in the mid-1980s: Design It now rolls up a yearly turnover of Pounds
170,000. On this it makes a return of about 30 per cent, including salaries
for the company's two other employees, wife Betty and son Martin. The
company runs a small Mercedes and a BMW.
None of the family took formal training in design work. but customers
include Carlsberg and Thomson Holidays. A lot of business comes from the
entertainment industry, such as the Birmingham Hippodrome and Bradford's
theatres. 'Work has come in just as normal through the recession,' Pinder
says. 'One reason is, I think, that if business is bad some types of
companies advertise more."
Cashflow is a headache. 'People are delaying payments. It has got a lot
worse in the past six months.' A culture of slow payments is taking root.
'We pay now in 60 days instead of 30. If you can't beat them, join them.'
Pinder would like to see legislation on payments. 'If a company did not pay
within 30 days you could add an automatic percentage on to the bill and that
would be legally enforceable.'
Design It does not plan to hire many, if any, staff. 'I wouldn't wish to
employ people because I am not a good manager,' Martin Pinder says.
Diane and Richard Benton, who run their own cleaning company for offices and
factories, Benton Cleaners, faced stiffer competition last year. 'Halifax
only had four cleaning companies, but there are now ten, together with the
multinationals,' Richard says. 'People were getting redundancy money and
thinking they could set up business with a mop and bucket. The market is
cut-throat.' At the same time, demand slid. 'New enquiries from industrial
sites fell to zero for six months last year,' Diane says.
Things are looking better, though. 'It's beginning to pick up quite a bit
and we're getting a lot more enquiries.' Benton Cleaners employs 42
part-timers and a managed turnover of Pounds 130,000 last year, on which the
pair made a 15 per cent return. 'It makes us an average living. We drive
secondhand cars,' Richard says.
The Bentons moved from Peterborough and set up the cleaning company six
years ago. The age and condition of factories in Halifax came as a shock.
'They were ropey,' Diane says. Offices have improved a lot but, apart from
food factories, are there any Halifax production plants the Bentons rate as
smart and clean? 'No,' Richard says.
Andrew Bonnington, chartered building surveyor, has been delighted with
business since starting on his own at Dean Clough two years ago. After
leaving Burton's property division, Bonnington did Pounds 36,000 of work in
his first year, and this year it will be Pounds 60,000, on which he says he
makes a pre-tax return of 65 per cent. The company employs just him and his
wife.
Valuations for estate agents is the only kind of work he will not do. His
main business is advising on building maintenance and refurbishment. A third
of his work comes from Dean Clough itself. 'A lot of other surveyors'
practices have been laying people off. For many of these, fees still come
first and clients second.' Bonnington's hourly rate ranges from Pounds 30 to
Pounds 70, plus expenses.
Gill Wilson, who owns Manor Properties. found a way of protecting her
house-building company by switching in 1990 from entirely speculative
construction to custom-built houses.
'We acquire a site, gain planning permission and then start building only
when we have a client - and he has a large say in the house's design. We
move along like that plot by plot.' The company, which also converts older
properties and whose homes sell from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 500,000, has
been given a leg up because other local builders have been wiped out. 'A lot
of competitors have been eliminated.'
Leslie Smith produces sofa-beds, 'inner tents' for caravans and dormobiles,
cushion cases and wax coats. Leslie Smith has recently come back from
retirement into the business of the same name, to help out his son, Graham.
'Sales of camping equipment are quite good, but for sofa-beds they're
terrible,' Leslie says. The company has been failing to score a profit
recently, and last year's sales slithered to Pounds 130,000 from Pounds
200,000 three years ago. Leslie thinks he can help pull the company back
into shape. 'You can get despondent as things go on. This feeling comes to a
lot of people - but I don't see the point of that.'

There is no Inheritance Tax (formerly death duties) on gifts made by one
spouse to the other. The use of joint ownership to save IT is only relevant
where it is intended to make a gift of a part or all of the half share of
the first to die to someone other than the surviving spouse. A formal
transfer or conveyance into joint names (to hold as tenants in common in
equity) can be used, or a declaration of trust followed by the appointment
of a new trustee.

You can use the power of attorney to effect the transfer, if you register it

surplus payment depending on the gains made during the year and that this
may be taken as shares or as cash?
The quarterly dividends would be liable for income tax in the normal way,
but is it also correct that the surplus distribution would not be subject to
income tax if it were taken as shares, but would be subject to UK income tax
(but not US with holding tax) if taken as cash?
Yes, you are right.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax and house rental
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I MOVED home as a result of changing my job and so I am renting out the
whole of my main residence. I am considering purchasing a second property
for investment purposes and renting one out as well.
1. Can the excess interest on the loan for the second property, over and
above rental income, be used to offset tax on the income from letting my
original home?
2. Does it matter, for tax purposes, on which house the loan for the second
property is secured?
3. Can qualifying expenses incurred in the tax year immediately prior
(1990-91) to letting these properties, and solely related to preparation for
letting, be used as an allowance for tax purposes against rental income in
the current tax year (1991-2)?
4. Can you recommend a thorough text which covers residential lettings in
detail?
The solicitors who acted for you in the purchase will be able to guide you
through the income tax and capital gains tax maze. (Before formally
appointing a firm to act for you, however, it would be prudent to check that
it has someone who is competent in the tax aspects of domestic property
transactions.)
1. Yes; subject to the conditions set out in section 355(l) (b) of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) by virtue of section 355(4).
2. No; it is the use of the borrowed money which matters - not the security
for the loan by virtue of section 354(l).
3. No. However, such expenditure may be deductible in calculating the
chargeable gain when the house is sold, by virtue of Inland Revenue
statement of practice D24:
'Expenditure on initial repairs to a property (including expenditure on
decorations) undertaken in order to put it into a fit state for letting, and
not allowable for the purposes of Schedule A, is regarded as allowable
expenditure for capital gains tax purposes under section 38(1) of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.'
4. You are probably better off talking to your solicitor.
The following free pamphlets from your tax office may be helpful, but tend
to oversimplify the intricate and arbitrary rules laid down by Parliament:
CGT4 - Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses
IR87 - Rooms to let

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The bottom line on life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE MYSTERIES of the life industry were revealed this week with the
publication of a survey of With Profits guides by the magazine Money
Marketing, in conjunction with the actuaries Clay &amp; Partners.
This is not recommended bedside reading for any bar the most chronic
insomniacs. But the fine detail it provides about the future of life
assurance-based investments is invaluable.
An issue often overlooked when choosing an office is its ownership, which
theoretically is all-important. Mutual companies are owned by their
with-profits policyholders and operate solely for their benefit. When
bonuses are paid, all the money which can prudently be distributed will go
to the policyholders as nobody else has a claim.
Proprietary companies have a dual loyalty. While they need to provide as
healthy a pay-out as possible to policyholders, they also have to produce a
dividend for shareholders. This may sound sinister, but the shareholders'
allocation is usually quite small.
The Money Marketing survey provides figures on the share of profits going to
policyholders for 16 proprietary offices. Most stipulate that at least 90
per cent of profits is ear-marked for policyholders. Exceptions include
Pearl, which has a minimum of 80 per cent on its ordinary branch surplus,
and Legal &amp; General, which keeps a strict 90 per cent of its with-profits
surplus for policy pay-outs, with other surpluses at directors' discretion.
In 1990, most offices chose to distribute exactly 90 per cent of their
available surplus. Scottish Mutual and Swiss Pioneer, both once mutuals,
gave 100 per cent of their distributable profits to policyholders.
However, some offices vary - for example, Eagle Star paid out 80.2 per cent
and Legal &amp; General 87.5 per cent, while the figure for Sun Alliance was
91.0 per cent and for LAS 93 per cent.
This might make you rush to invest with a mutual, but further analysis gives
strong reasons to invest with a proprietary office. As Clay &amp; Partners
points out: 'The security of policies may be higher because it is backed by
extra reserves and bonus rates may be more stable.'
A glance at the Money Marketing tables, published last week, shows a
pronounced strengthening by quoted companies. If terminal bonuses are
included, then over a 25-year term for endowments, Commercial Union is
second, General Accident third, Equity &amp; Law eighth, and Eagle Star ninth.
If terminal bonuses are excluded five of the top seven offices are
proprietary, even though on average a tenth of their profits must go in
dividends.
The appeal of endowments is limited, owing to their inflexibility, but
cautious savers looking for security might be prepared to go with a
proprietary office and share some of their funds with shareholders. Their
stolid merits seem rather greater after a bad year for the markets.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Don't slip up on the trip of a
lifetime - How to . . . buy travel insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVEL insurance is almost too easy to get hold of. It comes with package
holidays, with credit cards, and you can even buy it from a broker.
So the danger of leaving these shores uninsured is not great. The problem is
to make sure that you buy the right policy, which covers against a realistic
selection of risks.
That is much trickier.
Any number of things can go wrong on holiday, and you could reasonably hope
to insure against virtually any of them. Insurers might similarly exclude a
large swathe of risks in the small print. Burrowing through the small print
is irksome, as there is a lot of it, but important.
You are also in for an insurance headache if you plan anything hazardous.
Cover for an overland trip to Kathmandu will cost rather more than for a
trip to Majorca.
What do less adventurous souls need? The Consumers' Association suggests
that the following should be a minimum:
Medical expenses cover up to Pounds 250,000 in Europe, and Pounds 1m in the
US and the rest of the world;
Cancellation cover for the cost of the holiday, including the cost of
deposit and charges paid in advance;
Baggage insurance of at least Pounds 1,500;
Cover for individual expensive items such as cameras, if the main baggage
insurance imposes a maximum for single items;
Delays insurance of Pounds 75 - useful if your baggage takes longer to
arrive than you do;
Money and documents insurance of Pounds 400; and,
Personal liability insurance of Pounds 2m for the US, and Pounds 1m for the
rest of the world. This is unlikely to be needed and so it is cheap, but it
could be vital.
Many packages do not reach this exacting standard. However, some may not
need to, as contents and private medical insurance policies often extend
their cover to when you are abroad. So you must read that small print as
well.
What cover is available from the different outlets?
Credit Cards
The travel insurance you will receive with a credit card is useful, and
unless you have a particular aversion to credit, it is sensible to book air
trips, or hire cars, by credit card.
Travel accident insurance will be automatically included with the booking.
However, you will only be covered for injuries or accidents caused while in
transit in transport you have paid for with the card. The injuries will need
to be severe - for example Barclaycard covers only against death, a range of
specified serious injuries and total permanent disability - and a credit
card is not substitute for a full travel insurance package.
The industry standard is Pounds 50,000 cover with a card. According to the
Credit Card Research Group, 11 issuers provide Pounds 50,000 cover, while
two offer more and two less. The range is from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
70,000.
Gold cards require more homework - the total covered ranges from Pounds
60,000 to Pounds 250,000. Some also offer broader travel insurance and more
ambitious 'assistance' services in case you run into problems while abroad.
Again it is best to check the small print, and to assume you will need to
buy more insurance.
Package Holidays
Proceed with caution. The concept of package holidays revolves around the
'quiet life', and cutting your need to shop around for different element of
the package.
But many of the apparently discounted holiday packages borrow a trick from
'discounted' mortgage packages for first-time buyers which make up for
reductions in mortgage payments by over-charging for buildings and contents
insurance. When buying holiday insurance you may well find that what you
gain on the holiday price, you lose in over-priced insurance.
Holiday Which? produced a scathing report on package deals last month,
finding that only four out of 32 operators surveyed offered the minimum
cover required. However, most tour operators are keen, for their own
convenience, to ensure that their customers have a measure of insurance.
The greatest ire was reserved for travel agents. Which? found one trade
promotion urging travel agents to 'cash in on the lucrative (insurance)
market'. Accept an agent's offer with caution.
Independent Deals
Using a broker has much the same rationale as using an independent financial
adviser for an investment product. You might pay more, but you should be
certain of buying a policy which suits your requirements (provided you have
worked them out in advance), and charges should be relatively transparent.
There is a range of holiday specialist insurers, accounting for most of the
Consumers' Association's best buys. These were compiled on the assumption
that travellers were buying the cover listed above, for a two-week trip in
Europe, and a three-week trip elsewhere in the world.
The best buy for Europe was Whiteley (0422-348411) with a Pounds 13.90
premium, followed by Briggs &amp; Hill (0535-606121) at Pounds 15.90, and Royal
Bank of Scotland at Pounds 16.50.
For the US, the best value came from Thomas Cook (Independent) (0733-503222)
at Pounds 44.05, followed by Accident &amp; General at Pounds 44.50 and AT Mays
at Pounds 44.90. Worldwide, the leader is Whiteley at Pounds 34.10. Next
come Briggs &amp; Hill at Pounds 38.90, and Link Insurance At Lloyd's
(0622-692002) with a premium of Pounds 40.
Unusual Risks
This takes you into a different world. The chances are that someone,
somewhere, will be able to insure any risk you are prepared to take, but you
will have to look around, and you will have to spend money.
The 1992 Insurance Buyer's Guide provides information on covering against a
range of disasters. It lists three companies prepared to offer cover for
'activity holidays'. Campbell Irvine (071-937-6981) offers cover over
periods from one week to 12 months. It says premiums will be quoted
instantly for individual risks 'such as scuba-diving, parachuting, hot air
ballooning, ocean sailing etc.' Policies are underwritten at Lloyd's, and
other intermediaries will receive 20 per cent commission.
Crispin Speers &amp; Partners (071-480-5083) says: 'No matter where the clients
are going or what they are doing, the company can cover them'. Minimum
premium is Pounds 150. Policies are underwritten at Lloyd's, with a 10 per
cent commission for other intermediaries.
Hayman Jackson Travel Insurance Services (0730-60222) covers 'anything from
amateur sports to hang gliding, mountaineering and expeditions'. Commission
to intermediaries is 20 per cent.
Special insurance deals are available for adventure holidays, and for group
holidays - for example, Galaxy 7 Policies provides touring and travel
policies for brass bands, marching bands and 'entertainers'.
Be sure that you know what the consequences would be if something went
wrong. For example, those trekking in Nepal should be insured against the
risk of needing to call in helicopter rescue.
War risks bulk larger than they did, as unrest emerges from eastern Europe
to southern California. Several specialist insurers will cover you for war
risks, but last month TSB became the first mainstream company to do so.
TSB has abolished any exclusion from cover due to 'war risks'. This means
that if you were unlucky enough to be in Bosnia-Herzegovina when hostilities
broke out, you would be covered. However, this does not subvert the usual
stipulation that insured people are not reckless. TSB would not be happy to
pay out if you were injured having taken a helicopter tour over Kabul.

<TEXT>
Warning Talbot calculated head depth wrong LAST YEAR, when an early
resolution to the Gulf war led to a strong rally in the stock market, many
directors took the opportunity to sell. Much the same is happening now, only
this time the rally was caused by a Tory victory in the general election.
Directors of Sage Group, the accounting software company, have not had to
endure the problems of most company directors during the last 12 months.
Earnings have doubled over the past two years, as has the dividend. Five
directors sold a total of 480,000 shares at 475p, but two of those directors
exercised options over the same amount of shares as had been sold, thereby
replacing their holdings.
Another huge sale by Trevor Hemmings of Scottish &amp; Newcastle dwarfed the
other deals in our other column. Over the last two months, he has realised a
total of Pounds 24.9m from his holding, but still retains an interest in
just under 16m shares.
Alan Cox, chief executive of ASW Holdings, the steel and wire group, bought
50,000 shares on April 8 at 117p. He bought a further 25,000 shares at
126.5p on April 14 and the shares now stand at 138p.
Four directors of Scantronic, the security equipment company, bought a total
of 435,000 shares at the discounted price of 40p when Automated Security's
stake in the company was placed. At the same time, Thomas Buffet stepped
down as chairman.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Rush to launch equity funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUND management industry is testing the waters in the wake of the
Conservatives' re-election. Managers hope that, with five years of Tory
government ahead, investors will feel confident enough to invest in
equities.
Not all the funds are UK based. The flavour of the month is China. A
Dublin-based China Opportunities fund was launched recently by Hafnia
Prolific and now Jupiter Tyndall has produced a Luxembourg-based China
portfolio. The fund will be the eighth in the umbrella range called the
Tyndall Global Fund (others are high yield, British Lion, Wall Street,
Japan, International, European and Tiger.) The minimum investment is Pounds
2,500 (or Dollars 5,000); initial charge is 5 per cent; annual fee 1 per
cent.
Since there are few opportunities for direct investment in China, those who
want to gain exposure to the country normally do so via Hong Kong companies
which have subsidiaries in the People's Republic. That means exposure to the
Hong Kong stock market - currently at an all-time high. But Tyndall fund
manager Eric Sandlund says that price-earnings ratios in Hong Kong are still
low compared with the rest of the world.
Legal &amp; General has produced a range of unit trust Personal Equity Plans to
take advantage of the new Pounds 6,000 limit. There are four investment
choices: recovery, growth, income and worldwide. The initial charge is 5.5
per cent, and Legal &amp; General says that this is free of VAT, unlike some
other companies' charges. The annual management fee is 1.5 per cent.
Meanwhile Skandia Life, which linked up with the Foreign &amp; Colonial
Investment Trust last year, has established a managed investment trust fund
with Robert Fleming. The fund will invest in five Fleming-managed trusts -
American, Claverhouse, Far Eastern, Japanese and Universal. The fund can be
linked to Skandia Life products.
Providence Capitol is offering the Balanced Growth fund, a combination of
two of its funds - Special Market and UK fixed interest. The fund is
available on both life and pension policies.
The Unit Trust Industry Review &amp; Directory, a guide to the management groups
and trusts in the market, was published this week by Professional and
Business Information. At Pounds 245, it will appeal to the financial adviser
rather than the private investor.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Trafalgar dividend fear - The Week
Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the engineering, construction and property group, warned
last December that its interim dividend was likely to be cut. Analysts are
expecting a halved figure of 4.4p when it announces results on Wednesday.
Pre-tax profit, which fell sharply in the first half of last year to Pounds
51.5m, is thought to have improved to between Pounds 53m and Pounds 55m.
Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar House acquired last June for an initial
Pounds 60m, could have contributed the best part of Pounds 10m to operating
profits in engineering and construction. Progress in that division is again
expected to have offset declines in property and in shipping and hotels.
The Ocean Emerald oil rig, source of Davy's trials, has been completed and
Trafalgar House is hanging on to it until it is paid.
Payment to Davy shareholders of the second instalment of Pounds 54m is also
dependent on wrangles over the rig being resolved.
British Petroleum is still suffering from lower oil prices. Last week's rise
in the oil market will be too late to affect its first-quarter results,
which will be reported on Thursday. It is estimated that the group's pre-tax
profit will drop to about Pounds 70m (excluding stock losses and gains) from
a level of Pounds 521m in the same period last year.
BP has seen a decline in all of its business sectors and is expected to make
another loss in its chemicals division.
Tate &amp; Lyle, the sweeteners group, is reporting results for the six months
to end March on Wednesday. Analysts expect a slight slippage from the Pounds
94.7m reported last time, though not by much.
Falling prices for high fructose corn syrup in the US will have affected
profits from Staley, though there will be a first time contribution from
Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian business bought in June.
Thursday sees full-year results from Sears, the shoe shops to mail order
retailer, which appointed a new chief executive in February.
After interim profits fell from Pounds 62.4m to Pounds 4.6m, weighed down by
heavy exceptional costs relating to restructuring and disposals, profits for
the year to end-January will be well down on the previous year's Pounds
146.9m. Analysts are looking for profits before exceptional items of around
Pounds 92m to Pounds 93m, but this could come down to about Pounds 50m
post-exceptionals.
The final dividend is expected to be maintained, as was the interim, even
though it will be uncovered.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Make the most of National Savings -
Ways of getting an income from the government's tax-free products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY private investors must have considered the tax advantages and
attractive returns offered by National Savings certificates.
The snag is that those National Savings products which offer a fixed return
pay no income for five years; and those which pay a regular income do not
offer a fixed return.
A number of readers have written to ask whether it is possible to obtain a
decent income by cashing in the fixed certificates on a regular basis over
the five-year period.
The problem with such a strategy is that the return on certificates is
carefully slanted towards those who retain their investment for the full
five years. Early encashment means a lower return overall.
For example, on the current 36th issue, the rate of returns are as follows:
during the first year (nil); after one year (5.5 per cent); after two years
(6 per cent); after three years (6.75 per cent); after four years (7.5 per
cent); after five years (8.5 per cent).
The best strategy of all is to buy certificates on a regular basis so that
one can enjoy the full returns in five years time. This is obviously an
approach that can be followed by those who are nearing retirement.
Others who are have already retired will not be able to wait that long,
however. Accordingly I have constructed a number of strategies which use the
certificates for short term income. (All I used was a calculator; readers
can create their own strategies to suit individual needs.)
Each strategy assumes an initial investment of Pounds 10,000. Strategy One
aims to create a level income over the five years while ensuring that the
full Pounds 10,000 is left for reinvestment in 1997.
The fact that certificates are sold in Pounds 25 units makes it difficult to
ensure that the income is completely level. But as the table shows, by
encashing successively Pounds 775, Pounds 725, Pounds 675 and Pounds 625
worth of initial units in the first four years, the investor will receive an
income of between Pounds 814 and Pounds 834 a year.
In the final year (1997), the investor is left with Pounds 7,200 of his
original Pounds 10,000 of certificates. They mature with a value of Pounds
10,826.33, allowing him to take Pounds 826.33 as income and leave the Pounds
10,000 initial capital intact.
The investor would be around Pounds 920 down on the return he would have
made had he kept the full Pounds 10,000 in the certificates for five years.
For comparison, a basic rate taxpayer would have to earn around 10.9 per
cent gross from the building society in each year to get the same net annual
income. A top rate taxpayer would have to earn around 13.7 per cent gross.
The current redemption yields on five year gilts are between 9 and 9.5 per
cent, but these are subject to income tax.
Strategy Two aims for a growing income. As the table shows, this system
produces a somewhat lower return in the early years (by encashing fewer
certificates) but a higher income is earned in 1996 and 1997. By cashing in
successively Pounds 700, Pounds 700, Pounds 675 and Pounds 650, this system
gets an annual increase in income of between 4.4 and 8.1 per cent. Again,
the strategy ensures that Pounds 10,000 is left for reinvestment in 1997.
Overall, this means that the investor is around Pounds 880 down on the
return that would have been achieved by keeping in the Pounds 10,000 for the
full five years.
Strategy Three is designed for those who need the maximum income, and are
prepared to see a capital loss. It is designed to produce an income of
Pounds 1,000 a year, by surrendering certificates worth Pounds 950, Pounds
900, Pounds 825 and Pounds 750 in successive years.
By 1997, this high encashment rate means that only Pounds 6,565 of the
original investment is left. If the investor takes a Pounds 1,000 income
that year, then he will be left with only Pounds 8,871 to reinvest. In
addition, he will have made a return Pounds 1,147 less than if he had left
the Pounds 10,000 in for five years.
What about the other national savings investments? The return on the
index-linked certificates varies, of course, with the rate of inflation so
one could not be certain of the returns achieved. It is therefore uncertain
for those who want to be sure of their income.
The capital bonds are also a difficult case. They are designed to pay 11.5
per cent per annum if held for five years. But although they pay no income
until the five years are up, the investor must pay tax on the notional
interest received each year (a fact which is far from clear in the
advertisements for the product).
So these bonds are best used for income by non-taxpayers. In the first year,
the return is zero; after one year 7 per cent; in the second 8.75 per cent;
in the third 11 per cent; in the fourth 13.75 per cent; and in the fifth
17.3 per cent. So Pounds 10,000 invested now would grow to Pounds 10,700 in
1993; Pounds 11,636 in 1994; Pounds 12,916 in 1995; Pounds 14,692 in 1996;
and Pounds 17,234 in 1997.
Strategy Four aims for a level income from the capital bonds. Bonds are sold
in Pounds 100 lumps, so it is difficult to get a precisely steady income,
but once again, Pounds 10,000 is left for reinvestment. Note an important
caveat, three months notice is needed for early encashment.
By encashing bonds worth Pounds 1,000, Pounds 900, Pounds 800 and Pounds 700
in successive years, this strategy produces a very healthy annual income.
But the investor ends up around Pounds 1,680 down on the returns he would
have achieved by leaving the money in for the full five years.
The new Pounds 50,000 limit (up from Pounds 25,000) for National Savings
income bonds took effect from April 30.

</HEADLINE>

WHEN ALL companies offered the same insurance policy at roughly the same
price, buying household insurance used to be a lot easier. But the market
has become more competitive over the last few years and buyers are now faced
with an array of policies offering different levels of cover at different
prices.
If you live in a certain part of Manchester, for example, brokers will
usually give different quotes for your area - and the cover on offer will
vary. That makes it difficult to compare policies. 'There can be a 300 per
cent variation in price for any given postcode,' says Peter Friend, of
Leslie and Godwin, insurance brokers. 'So the need to have more than one
quotation is very strong indeed.'
Many people may also be dissatisfied with the rise in insurance premiums and
may be thinking of trying to obtain a more competitive deal from someone
other than their usual insurer.
AA Insurance has launched a product service which could help you through the
maze. Its computerised insurance service for building and contents, AA
Homequote, searches out the best price for the same product from among a
panel of insurance companies.
There are presently five insurers on the panel - GRE, Commercial Union,
Bishopsgate, Minster and Municipal Mutual. General Accident and London &amp;
Edinburgh plan to join from June 1 and AA Insurance is hoping to include
others.
Many building societies have a panel, usually of three to six insurance
companies, to underwrite a policy whose price is already determined. This is
not the way the AA Homequote policy works. 'The insurers are competing with
each other to give the best price depending on individual circumstances,'
says AA Insurance. 'Some companies will have had fewer claims in certain
postcodes for certain types of properties, while others will have fared
better in other areas. Those with the best claims records in those areas
will be able to offer the best prices.'
If you own, say, a two bedroomed terraced house in Edinburgh, AA Homequote
will search out prices ranging from Pounds 72 to Pounds 81 for buildings
cover for properties with a market value of up to Pounds 250,000, and Pounds
81 to Pounds 116 for house contents up to Pounds 30,000 under the standard
(new for old) cover.
It is already common to have panels to provide motor insurance and Friend
believes that, 'inevitably, household insurance will have to take the form
of panel. But I would say that five or seven companies is not enough - you
need about 20 to give a good spread.' Noel Privett of AA Insurance says
there should be more insurance companies on the panel by the end of the
year. 'It will increase as appropriate. We don't want to go for numbers, we
want quality.'
The AA Homequote panel gives quotations for AA Insurance's Homesure policy.
The problem of comparing like with like is eliminated but customers should
first note whether the policy is suitable for their needs. In its last
review of house contents insurance, Which?, the Consumers Association's
monthly, rated the AA Homesure policy somewhere between average and good.
Quotations and cover are given over the phone. If the customer goes to one
of AA Insurance's 250 shops, they will be issued with an immediate cover
note.
AA Homequote. Telephone: 0800-900888, extension 8484.
Cornhill Insurance and Blaupunkt, the car radio manufacturer, are so
confident of their Keycard radio security system that they are offering to
replace - free - stolen Blaupunkt radio models which use this system. The
insurance scheme is called 'Double Indemnity.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Co-op takes a stand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOX-HUNTERS may not be welcome, but tree-huggers will be embraced with open
arms at the Co-operative Bank, following the launch of its ethical policy
this week.
The bank has stated that it will no longer take deposits from, offer
financial services to, or in any other way do any business with
organisations involved in a series of controversial activities.
These include the oppression of the human spirit; manufacturing torture
instruments or exporting arms to oppressive regimes; cosmetics-testing on
animals; exploitative factory-farming; blood sports; production of animal
fur; and the manufacture of tobacco.
It will also encourage customers to take an active stance on the
environmental impact of their activities, and will try to ensure that its
own services are not exploited for the purposes of money laundering, drug
trafficking or tax evasion.
The message behind the approach is simple: banks do not simply store
depositors' money, but loan it to other organisations involved in activities
with which the customer may be opposed.
The bank has identified six organisations involved in either blood sports
and/or battery farming among existing customers, which will be told politely
to amend their ways or close their accounts.
Sceptics have been quick to suggest that the Co-op is cashing in on ethics.
A number also indignantly suggest that banks have no rights to preach to
their customers or discriminate against potential recipients of loans.
Terry Thomas, managing director, says: 'We are not pretending to play God
and tell people what their ethics should be. But we are telling them what
our ethics are. We are principled bankers.'
He makes no pretence of the fact that the campaign is a marketing drive
designed to generate considerable new business, and estimates that the bank
will gain at least ten new customers for every one who wants to leave as a
result of the policy.
But he stresses that the bank is committed to the policy in the long-term.
He also argues that it always had an implicit ethical ethos which is now
explicit - a fact which he says is proved by the fact only six organisations
contradicting its policy have slipped through and become customers.
For existing customers, the ethical stance is unlikely to be come as a
surprise. Many joined on principle because of the Co-op's image, reflected
in previous initiatives including a 'customers' charter' launched last year
which ensures that no financial information is given to credit agencies
without express approval.
The bank believes that its 1.25m personal account holders are more
highly-educated and from the upper range of the socio-economic scale than
any other UK bank. It took great care in identifying the issues on which it
is now publicly frowning. Work on the ethical policy began nearly two years
ago, and when a draft was prepared late last year it was circulated to
30,000 customers for their opinions.
Only those issues with which at least 60 per cent agreed found their way
into the final policy. Four-fifths approved of the idea of a published
ethical policy while only 2 per cent strongly disapproved.
While it is modest in size and has the strongest concentration of branches
in the north of England, the Co-op stresses that it offers the same services
as any clearing bank. Among its services are free banking, a telephone
inquiry service charged at local rates, a gold credit card guaranteed free
for life, and membership of the LINK cash machine network which has 5,000
outlets around the UK.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Filing in your tax return? Here's the
form - The yearly chore of Revenue form-filling is here again. Scheherazade
Daneshkhu provides a user-friendly guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
IF YOU have not yet received a tax return from the Inland Revenue, you are
unlikely to get it now. Those who have must find time to fill in their
return for 1992-93, which covers income for the year ended April 5 1992.
It should be sent back within 30 days, although in practice the Inland
Revenue will not levy penalties unless the form is still not returned by
October 31.
Those who have received a form will usually either be self-employed or have
earnings from sources other than their full-time employment. Sometimes the
Revenue sends a tax return form - usually a blue P1 form  - to employees to
check that their circumstances have not changed. Otherwise, most employees
will receive a brown P11 form and those who have their own business, a blue
11 form. Partnerships will receive a pink form 1.
Several key issues need to be addressed: Do you need an accountant?
Employee: If you are employed with a salary of up to Pounds 50,000 and
receive few benefits, you probably do not need help in filling in the form,
unless you are very busy and know that you will never get around to it.
However, if you are a high earner with many perks it may be worth getting
professional help, according to Jennifer Ainsworth, tax partner at Moores
Rowland chartered accountants and president-elect of the Institute of
Taxation. In such circumstances, Ainsworth says there is more room for
technical error and for the Inland Revenue itself to make mistakes.
Perks include a company car, private medical insurance, payment in the form
of gold bullion, or part payment through incentive schemes such as holidays
or clothes. Your employer will have to fill in a P11D form detailing
benefits paid to you but you must also list these benefits in your own form.
Those with a lot of investment income will also need advice.
An alternative to employing an accountant full time is to make a one-off
visit. For a fee, the accountant should check that you have filled in the
form correctly and should spot whether you are missing out on any
entitlements.
Self-employed: The self-employed will almost certainly need an accountant.
The self-employed generally have two sets of tax returns to file - their
personal tax return and that of the business. These may be at different
times of the year, depending on the date chosen to make up the business
accounts.
Businesses with an annual turnover of Pounds 15,000 or more have to produce
accounts to the Revenue. Those who have a part time business, such as
consultancy, will find it worthwhile to have an accountant in order to
establish allowable expenses.
The type of accountant you need depends on the complexity of your accounts.
Large City firms may be highly competent but will be expensive for those
with relatively straightforward needs.
Steven Coleman, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, suggests finding
an accountant from one of its 22 district societies. Call the ICA on
071-606-7060 and ask for the telephone number of the district society
nearest you. Select two or three firms in your area and 'see them all,' says
Coleman. 'Ask what they are going to charge, how quick they will be in
dealing with your accounts and see if you like them.'
The Institute of Taxation on 071 235 9381 will also give details of tax
advisers in your area. Accountants' fees vary widely according to the firm's
size and location. Fees start at about Pounds 20 to Pounds 25 an hour for
country practitioners and go up to about Pounds 100 an hour or more in the
City.
Filling in the form
Peter Wyman, tax partner of Coopers Deloitte and chairman of the Tax Faculty
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, says there are two main problems.
The first is that many people do not claim their full entitlements; the
other is that 'people leave things out, usually innocently. For example,
they forget about a building society account. The Revenue picks it up and
asks them to review their return.'
If their memory is not jogged, the Revenue can take a harder line, assuming
that you have other sources of income similarly left undeclared. The
following points should be borne in mind:
Review the form upon completion to check that everything necessary has been
declared. Taxpayers are obliged to give the Revenue as much information as
necessary for it to judge how much tax they should be charged.
Ainsworth says that sometimes employees fail to list the benefits given to
them by their company. They insert instead 'as returned by the company' (in
the P11D), but this answer risks incurring a penalty because you must list
the benefits you are receiving in your own form. Ask your company for a copy
of the P11D which it will be returning to the Revenue.
Only list details of income for the tax year from April 6 1991 to April 5
1992.
Claim all the reliefs and allowances to which you are entitled. Do not rely
on the Revenue to have the information.
Check your tax assessment for the previous year and if you want to challenge
it, write stating your reason and the amount of tax in dispute within 30
days of the date stated.
Employment income. List all your sources of income, regardless of whether
tax has already been paid on it or if it seems too small to be taxable. Keep
a file containing dividend counterfoils, monthly payslips and the P60 form
your employer sends you listing your total income for the tax year and the
amount of tax paid. Benefits in kind must be listed separately from total
income.
Investment income. If you do not receive bank statements or do not have the
time to add up interest earned during the tax year, your bank or building
society will do this for you and may send you a certificate stating the
amount of interest earned during the year. Most current accounts are
interest-bearing and this will also have to be declared. Ainsworth points
out that for 1991/92 onwards you can reclaim the tax deducted on bank and
building society interest if you are entitled to gross interest or if the
tax was overpaid. Previously, this interest was subject to composite rate
tax which was non-refundable.
If you are a non-taxpayer and have not already registered as such, ask your
bank or building society for form R85 which will allow interest to be paid
at gross rates.
Tessas do not have to be declared unless they have been closed, in which
case the interest is taxable and should be recorded.
List the dividends from shares or unit trusts received during the tax year -
if you have kept the vouchers, this will be simple. It can sometimes be
difficult to understand whether the figures quoted on some unit trust
vouchers are gross or net of tax. Wyman suggests calling the broker or going
back to the registrar of the unit trusts to check. Pensions. Pension income
is taxable and should be declared. Details will be on the P60. Certain state
benefits, such as unemployment benefit and the old age pension, are also
subject to tax and must be declared.
If you have a personal pension plan you will be entitled to tax relief, at
your highest rate, on contributions. Ask the company for the personal
pension contribution certificate and send this to the Revenue, or enclose
the contribution receipt issued to you by the company.
Similarly, higher rate taxpayers making free-standing additional voluntary
contributions to their company pension can get tax relief on these by
filling in the details on the form and enclosing either the contribution
receipt or the voluntary contributions certificate.
Property income. This can be complicated. If you are letting a house and
have expenses relating to its upkeep, you and the Revenue might disagree
about what is an expense and what is an improvement. For example, you might
repair the window frames and put in double glazing at the same time - the
Revenue might challenge you on the double glazing.
Expenses in employment. These are defined by the Revenue as 'expenses you
had to pay which arose wholly, exclusively and necessarily in carrying out
your work.' In practice, 'it is hard to think of expenses for your work that
are not paid by your employer,' says Wyman.
However, if there is a work-related expense which you think you are forced
to incur and for which your employer will not reimburse you, you might as
well claim it and see what the Revenue says.
Loans. Basic rate tax relief is obtainable on mortgage interest on loans,
subject to a ceiling of Pounds 30,000. The Revenue will obtain details of
the loan from building societies but if the mortgage is from a bank, you
should ask it to give you the details (Form MIRAS 5) and send this to the
tax office.
Ainsworth reminds those who have made a loan, for example, to a business,
that they may be entitled to higher rate relief on it. To claim the relief,
obtain a certificate from the company you made the loan to and send it to
the Revenue, stating what the loan was for.
Capital Gains. You have to list details of disposals of assets liable to
CGT, such as property (other than your main home) and shares. Wyman says
many people forget that they can list expenses related to the sale, such as
stamp duty and commission.
However, if your total chargeable gains for the last tax year do not exceed
the CGT ceiling of Pounds 5,500 (and the total proceeds are not more than
Pounds 11,000), you can simply write, 'Gains not exceeding Pounds 5,500 and
disposals not exceeding Pounds 11,000'. If you have sold a second home you
are entitled to deduct improvement expenses from your gains, as long as you
have not already had income tax relief on these. You are also entitled to
indexation - you can get the Revenue to work out your indexation allowance
simply by writing 'indexation?' as a claim.
Married couples. Make sure you make full use of both personal allowances.
Minimise paying higher rate tax by using both lower-rate tax bands.
Norman Lamont's Budget measure regarding the transferability of the married
couple's allowance will not come into force until 1993. However, if a
married man's income is less than the married couple's allowance, the unused
part can be transferred to his wife.
Finally, remember to photocopy the return before sending it off.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: More colourful tax forms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYPAYERS CAN expect simpler and more colourful forms from next year to ease
the burden of calculating how much they owe the Revenue.
The language will be simpler and clearer, the instructions more helpful, and
the lay-out designed to help people fill in the blanks with figures as
painlessly as possible.
The basic personal tax return forms - P11, 11 (for the self-employed) and P1
(the simplified return) - are likely to be ready by the next tax year, in
April 1993. Four others, including one for mortgage relief, are already
coming into use.
The Revenue launched a programme in spring last year with help from Wolff
Olins, the design consultancy firm, to review more than 700 different forms
it produces, including tax forms, instructions and advice slips.
Bernie Hepplewhite, head of customer services in the Revenue's corporate
communications office, says the main reason for the change is to help
taxpayers by making the completion of their returns 'as undaunting as
possible'. In addition, it will help save costs and make life easier for
Revenue staff.
'There used to be a belief in the old bureaucratic tradition of the Civil
Service that if people filled out the forms incorrectly, they were daft,' he
says. 'Now we realise it's more likely that it's the forms that are daft.'
He stresses that the Revenue has re-designed its documents on a less
ambitious scale several times and has won Plain English awards for leaflets
and forms.
The new forms is more use more colour (orange and blue on white in the
latest prototypes) to make them look brighter and more up-to-date. They are
laid out in vertical columns, to provide a logical flow of information.
The language has been simplified, the volume of notes on the form increased,
and the questions follow a consistent sequence across the different forms.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: The lessons of a German sideshow - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLAMES over Los Angeles vividly demonstrate that these days, happily,
continental Europeans are somewhere in the Isthmian league of social unrest,
down with the equivalents of Wivenhoe, Carshalton, or Bognor Regis. Still,
though the strikes and political upsets in Germany by now look a side-show,
they have direct implications for UK financial markets.
The short run effects are already visible - a firming of the pound, a
closing of the gap between UK and German interest rates, a relatively more
favourable view of the UK as a political risk.
By the end of the week, the pound was trading at DM 2.93, up only  1/2 a
pfennig on the week. But the margin by which UK short-term interest rates
exceed those in German had narrowed to half a percentage point, compared
with 0.8 points at the start of the week; and the equivalent spread for
long-term rates had closed to 1.2 percentage points, compared with nearly 2
points at the beginning of April when electoral uncertainty was at its
height. A Pounds 2.5bn auction of gilts, on Wednesday, received a warm
response, with investors - including some from overseas - eager to bid high
for the stock.
Equities failed to demonstrate a corresponding degree of enthusiasm. The
FT-SE index closed the week at 2659.8, up 16.8; after the first
post-election surge, on Friday April 10, it has risen only 3.3 per cent.
This week's lack of enthusiasm may reflect the view that, in the longer
term, the implications of the German developments are not quite so
favourable. The Bundesbank - now, in effect, Britain's central bank too - is
trapped between two forces. One is the need to raise interest rates still
further, in the face of stubborn inflation. The second is need not to rock
the boat at a time of political strains within the governing coalition in
Bonn.
If, as a result, the Bundesbank does nothing, the outlook for the German
economy is stagflation: slow growth, persistent inflation, high interest
rates. Tied to those interest rates through the ERM, the UK risks suffering
similar growth consequences, though in the immediate future the return of
consumers' confidence will help ensure a healthy first phase of the
recovery.
Equities will benefit, however, if another of the week's developments points
the way to a healthier gilt market towards the end of the year. On Monday,
Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, warned of a 'tight public
expenditure round' in the negotiations between the treasury and the spending
ministries that start start in the summer. Chancellors always say something
like that at this time of year; the next phase of the softening-up process,
due shortly, produces equally traditional headlines like TOUGHEST SPENDING
ROUND IN YEARS, SAY MINISTERS.
There are grounds for thinking, though, that this time the wolf has come. On
Monday, Lamont spoke of the need to keep 'a very wary eye on the fiscal
position over the medium term,' which is treasury language for spiralling
deficits as far as the eye can see. If John Major is serious about aiming
for low inflation and low taxes, his government has every incentive to bite
the spending bullet in the first year of a new term.
We will know how far Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury,
has succeeded in doing this when the public spending white paper is
published in late autumn. A serious attempt to rein back the future growth
of the deficit would make the UK gilt market much more attractive; and lower
gilt yields would produce a corresponding upwards revaluation of equities.
All that lies ahead. In the short-term, the market has the takeover battle
for Midland Bank to chew on. Or rather, it hasn't: though both Lloyds and
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation are keen to buy Midland, neither
of them has made a formal bid.
The Hongkong Bank has issued a 59-page press release as a sort of harbinger
of the offer document due by May 12, on which Schroders, its adviser, is now
working hard. The price to be offered for every Midland share, says the
press release, is one share in HSBC, the Hongkong Bank's London-based
holding company, plus a bond valued at Pounds 1. At Friday's closing prices,
that valued Midland's shares at 402p.
On Tuesday, Lloyds issued a heavily qualified indication of its desire to
bid. It, too, has come up with a price, one Lloyds share plus 30p for every
Midland share. That values its target's shares at 437p.
Meanwhile, Midland closed yesterday at 381p, up 51 per cent since the first
public indications that a bid was on the way, in March, but still 19p below
the lower of the two bids. There is clearly a great deal of doubt about
whether the Lloyds bid will get past the competition authorities; but there
is a lingering scepticism about the prospects for the Hongkong Bank bid,
too. Perhaps Sir Peter Walters might remain chairman of an independent
Midland after all?
If so, he will have time to turn his attention to another of the week's
minor trends: the growing difficulties company chairmen seem to have in
controlling annual general meetings. Sir John Quinton, Barclays' chairman,
was splashed with white paint immediately before the bank's agm on Thursday
by an unidentified protestor. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI and one
of Barclays' non-executive directors is said to have joked: 'I hope it was
Dulux'. If he did, he got his come-uppance the next day: on Friday, at his
own company's agm, he was electronically barracked by tape recorders hidden
in environmental protestors' briefcase. Company chairman will soon be forced
to adopt the motto of the Sardinian camorra: an injury to one is an injury
to all.

Stockbrokers Wise Speke has stepped up its share dealing links with the
Skipton and Leeds building societies. Leeds is offering postal and telephone
share selling service for the privatised companies, starting at Pounds 9.95
per sale. Deals over Pounds 2,500 bear a commission of 0.75 per cent. For
non-privatised shares, the minimum is Pounds 19.95 and the rate for deals
over Pounds 2,500 is 1.25 per cent. The service is only available to Leeds
savers.
Skipton has a full dealing service for shares, gilts and other fixed
interest stock. A Pounds 5 fee obtains life membership for the service;
after that the minimum commission is Pounds 15, with 1 per cent for deals
between Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 5,000 and 0.1 per cent for additional sums
over Pounds 5,000. The dealing helplines are 0532-347555 for the Leeds and
0532-444095 for the Skipton.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: Why the Midland battle matters - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD Midland depositors care whether Lloyds or Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai takes
over their bank?
There are two fundamental issues. If Lloyds takes over, will the elimination
of one of the big High Street banks mean a reduction in competition and a
poorer deal for the consumer? Or will a takeover by either bank strengthen
Midland sufficiently to improve the service to its customers?
The case from Lloyds is that the cost savings which would result from a
merger (Pounds 700m over four years) will be reflected in more competitive
pricing of products and a higher quality of service.
Lloyds also argues that its own customers will benefit from a larger and
geographically more diverse range of branches - Midland is stronger in the
north and Lloyds in the south. In addition, the merger would result, says
Lloyds, in significant advances in information technology and, as a
consequence, in products and services.
Finally, Lloyds says that a merged bank will be able to offer all its
customers the best products and services from the ranges currently offered
separately.
The other side of the coin is that Midland depositors will inevitably see a
large number of their branches disappear, as part of the Lloyds cost cutting
drive (even though they will now have access to existing Lloyds branches).
And the Midland name will disappear, which means new cheque books, cards etc
for depositors - which could be a considerable inconvenience.
The cynical might also wonder whether the cost savings will really be as
large as Lloyds suggests. All too often, the 'economies of scale' that are
supposed to result from big company mergers turn out to be illusory. Mergers
can be motivated by mere 'empire-building' on the part of company managers.
Indeed, there is a more fundamental point. Even a 'more efficient' Midland -
whether under the aegis of Lloyds or Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai - might still not
be able to offer the kind of service that Weekend FT readers need.
Long gone are the days when consumers popped down to the branch every week
to have a word with their friendly bank manager. Many are happy simply to
use the cashpoint machine to withdraw money and therefore rarely enter their
branches at all.
Many building societies and smaller banks have lower costs and greater
flexibility than the big High Street banks. It is hard to think of a service
offered by a big bank that is not available elsewhere.
And it would probably be profitable for many depositors to move their
accounts. Remember all the fanfare about interest-bearing current accounts?
Well, at Lloyds, depositors get just 2.53 per cent gross on balances of up
to Pounds 5,000, at Barclays and NatWest the rate is a measly 2.02 per cent.
Midland has a rather better record in this area. Its Orchard account pays
3.04 per cent on positive balances. And First Direct, its innovative
telephone banking system, pays a healthy 4.34 per cent on balances of over
Pounds 1,000. (Lloyds has indicated that it will be happy to keep First
Direct.)
But the Save &amp; Prosper/Robert Fleming Classic account pays 7.25 per cent
gross on balances of over Pounds 1,000 (and 2.53 per cent of balances below
that figure). Cheque books, standing orders, direct debits etc are all
available on the account.
Add in the many high interest cheque accounts, or the money market unit
trusts where double-digit returns are available on deposits of Pounds 1,000
plus, and it is clear that it is only inertia which has kept many customers
at the high street banks.
The public image of banks is certainly low at the moment. The general
suspicion is that banks have tried to recoup their losses on Third World and
property loans by racking up charges on individual and small business
customers.
It is certainly true that banks have come to realise that their personal
customers are a highly valuable resource. Which other industry has such
intimate knowledge of the financial strength of its customers?
Although none of the banks has made much of a fist at selling shares to
their depositors, they have made great strides in the field of life
insurance. Lloyds has perhaps been most successful at this - via Lloyds
Abbey Life. With NatWest linking up with Clerical Medical, bank customers in
general can look forward to being on the receiving end of an insurance
marketing blitz in the 1990s. There is unlikely to be any escape from such
'cross-selling' - many of the other institutions offering banking services
have the same ambitions.
Customers should not be surprised that people are trying to make a profit
from them - that is the nature of the capitalist system, after all. The
answer is to be hard-nosed and businesslike in selecting your financial
institution.
So, to return to the question of whether customers should care who wins the
Midland takeover battle - they should take the opportunity to look round the
marketplace and see if they can get a better deal elsewhere. By all means
give a combined Lloyds/Midland or Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai/Midland a chance to
prove they can improve service. But if a merged bank fails to deliver, vote
with your wallet and switch your account.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: Optimism as motors look on the mend - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 18 months of bleeding red ink, and years of being pilloried as
industrial dinosaurs, the car makers of Detroit won a little respect on Wall
Street this week. General Motors and Ford Motor reported first quarter
results better than analysts' forecast and a return to profits.
The earnings - Dollars 179m in the case of GM and Dollars 337.9m for Ford -
were admittedly small relative to the companies' sizeand relied heavy on
profits from their non-automotive operations. But they did show a sharp
reduction in the losses of their North American operations.
Motor stocks have been moving upward for some time in anticipation of
recovery, although GM suffered a relapse a week ago when it announced a
Dollars 2.3bn stock offering. This week's figures gave them another shove
and set off a modest rally in the broader market.
The mood cooled on Thursday when Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big
Three, reported a Dollars 231m loss before accounting changes. But that was
due largely to the cost of introducing new models this year which could
transform its performance for the better.
Overall, motor industry figures reinforced the impression given to the
market by a season of broadly better-than-expected corporate results: the
economy is slowly but surely on the mend, and profits might spring back
later this year more strongly than expected.
It is this sentiment which took the Dow Jones industrial average to an
all-time high of 3366.50 on April 16 and has sustained it since.
It has also underpinned a movement by investors from growth stocks -
companies which tend to grow faster than the economy - into cyclicals, which
tend to track the economy.
Yet some caution is in order. First, the latest batch of economic statistics
shows an economy which is growing only slowly - 2 per cent in the first
quarter. Consumer confidence is on the rise, but figures yesterday, from the
National Association of Purchasing Managers, which tracks economic
expansion, were weaker than the market was expecting.
The car companies warned about the fragility of the recovery through
earnings reports and the same tone was struck by the large steel companies,
such as USX and Bethlehem Steel, when they reported continued losses in
their steel divisions.
In short, while most analysts expect a slow, sustained economic recovery for
the rest of the year, it is just conceivable that the upturn could peter
out, as last year's spring burst did.
The stock market also has features which are making some analysts edgy. The
DJIA, which is comprised of blue chip stocks, has been outperforming the
broader market for some time, which is often a sign of a correction ahead.
Technical analysts point to weakness since February in the ratio of stocks
with rising share prices to those with falling ones.
The stock market rally which began last December was powered initially by
falling interest rates, encouraging investors to take funds out of fixed
income accounts and seek higher returns in shares. Over the past month or
two the bull has been sustained more by expectations of rising earnings, and
share prices are now discounting fancy leaps in profit.
Three factors could limit the market's scope for substantial advances, or
prompt a significant, downward correction. One is if the economy fails to
provide the backdrop for the expected good earnings news.
The second is interest rates. Concern about the Federal Government's
borrowing needs, as well as the threat of inflation implicit in economic
recovery, has kept the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond above 8 per cent
for the past few weeks.
The Wall Street consensus is that bond yields will fall. But if bond yields
remain high, they will encourage fund managers to switch out of equities.
The third is politics. Ross Perot, the Texan who may run as a presidential
candidate, is gaining on President Bush in the opinion polls. There is a
long way to go to November's election, but growing uncertainty about the
outcome is starting to make the market a trifle nervous.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: Oil stocks are only for the strong-hearted - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TONY Craven-Walker, chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas, spends much of
his time pondering ways in which small oil companies can offer value for
shareholders. Monument is one of the UK's band of independent exploration
and production companies. These put so much money into searching for oil
that there is seldom any left to pay dividends. At the same time, the rise
and fall of their share prices is tied closely to the fluctuations in world
oil prices.
This year oil prices are low: for UK companies forced to cope with the
dollar-sterling exchange rate, they have sunk to their lowest level in real
terms for 20 years. Low oil prices have pushed UK oil company stock prices
into the doldrums. What is more, the stock market has started to lose faith
in a long-term increase in oil prices which undermines the argument for
buying into the sector in the first place.
Craven-Walker would like to find a novel way of offering a pay-out to
shareholders. In any case, Monument can offer more long-term value than some
of its counterparts because of its stake in the Morecambe Bay field in the
North Sea. This field produces gas for which there is strong UK demand at
prices which are often uncoupled from the oil market.
The last week has seen a small pick-up in the price of oil, giving a boost
to oil sector shares. But the price rise was probably more for technical
reasons than because of any strong upturn in demand and is unlikely to be
sustained.
Chris Fay, exploration director at Shell, has commented that the industry is
working on the margin of economic viability. Most UK oil companies can make
money with oil prices at around Dollars 18 a barrel but those with high
costs such as Lasmo and Clyde Petroleum will struggle. At the same time,
almost all exploration companies are trimming their drilling budgets this
year which lowers their chances of an oil find.
With the oil sector underperforming the FT-All Share index by at least 10
per cent this year, some pundits argue that oil stocks are a cheap buy. Not
everyone agrees: 'The sector is bombed out, but there has been a significant
change in perceptions about future oil prices. I don't think this has been
fully reflected in share prices yet and they could still fall relative to
the market,' said Simon Flowers, industry analyst at County NatWest in
Edinburgh.
County NatWest has joined many other industry observers in revising its
forecast for oil prices downwards to Dollars 23 a barrel in 1997 compared
with its previous estimate of Dollars 26 a barrel. It bases this on
commitments by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to boost production capacity along with expectations of a slow increase in
world oil demand.
Money invested in oil stocks is a hedge on the future direction of oil
prices in general. More specifically, investors could be expressing
confidence in a small company's ability to find oil. But this is a big bet.
Oil stocks, particularly the small independent exploration companies, should
carry a health warning. Investors who piled into Kelt Energy when its share
price hit Pounds 3 three years ago as the company looked as if it was having
a successful run on exploration, have seen their holding plunge to virtually
nothing today. A group of banks is running the company in a bid to recoup
some of the money lent.
Tullow Oil is currently generating a lot of excitement: it is focused purely
on oil exploration and has enjoyed some success. Investors could easily see
the value of their holdings double if the company makes a big discovery, but
they could equally lose their entire stake.
Shell and British Petroleum are much a safer bets on the oil price. Of these
two, Shell is financially stronger and its shares are likely to continue
their steady rise while dividends keep pace with inflation over the long
haul.
BP is more risky since if oil prices continue in their current vein, it is
unlikely to be able to sustain dividend payments at current rates.
In spite of the gloom over future oil prices, the sector could still prove
lucrative for the strong-hearted investor. Oil prices have a tendency to
confound expectations. Any political upset in the Middle East could send
prices soaring while exploration stocks take off.

FT  02 MAY 92 / The Long View: Cheques and balances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS is no time to be a banker. Humble clerks are kept awake at night
with fears of redundancy, and there is no security at the top either: after
this week's stepping aside by Sir John Quinton at Barclays only one of the
Big Four's chief executives has been in place for much more than a year, and
none appears to have gone exactly to schedule. The survivor is, of course,
Lloyd's Brian Pitman, the main driving force behind his bank's controversial
bid for Midland.
One statistic is relevant here: in March, bank and building society lending
actually fell (by some Pounds 500m), the first time this has happened for
many years. Bank customers in aggregate actually repaid part of the
principal, as well as stumping up the interest.
It is difficult to exaggerate how shattering this experience of contraction
is to the banking industry. Rapid growth rates have been the experience for
many years. Manufacturing industry may have suffered recessions, but this
never seemed to apply to the banking sector. In difficult times inflation
came to the rescue. Look at M4, not a motorway to Wales but the broad
definition of the quantity of money, which includes bank and building
society deposits. Money is the banks' raw material and it has grown in
quantity from Pounds 97bn at the start of 1980 to Pounds 510bn.
Until about 1985 the government was attempting half-heartedly to control
monetary growth but then it more or less gave up the struggle. The banking
industry boomed, and the annual growth rate of M4 rose from 14 per cent in
1984 to 19 per cent at the beginning of 1990. On the other side of the
balance sheet, lending was bounding ahead. At the start of 1980 the
outstanding volume of house purchase loans was Pounds 45bn, but now it is
over Pounds 320bn: an annual growth rate of 18 per cent.
By 1990 interest rates had reached 15 per cent and the government was forced
to trigger a recession in order to prevent inflation running riot. The
year-on-year M4 growth rate has plummeted to 5.6 per cent and may still be
falling (building societies suffered an outflow of funds of Pounds 172m in
March); in real terms monetary growth is therefore just about nil, which is
why monetarists are so pessimistic about the prospects for economic
recovery, and bankers are getting into such a mess.
The demand for money was high in the 1980s because the real cost of
borrowing appeared to be so low. This real cost was best measured not in
terms of retail prices but of asset prices: the prices of shares (until
1987) and houses (until 1989) went up far faster than the interest
accumulated on borrowings. The final surge of borrowing was in 1989 and 1990
by acquisitive companies, which thought that the value of properties and
businesses would continue to climb indefinitely. Huge bad debts have
subsequently been incurred by the banks on this final phase of the lending
boom. Bad debt provisions in aggregate by the Big Four clearers were Pounds
5.6bn for 1991, and this week a County NatWest study suggested there could
be up to another Pounds 4bn of clearing bank provisions still to come
against property debts alone.
Now the real cost of borrowing has become very high. Asset prices are
unexciting: true, share prices hit an all-time peak this week, but the
growth in the All-Share Index over the past year has only been about 6 per
cent, not enough to make borrowing to buy shares worthwhile, and property
prices are still falling.
Will the banks and building societies manage their contraction any better
than they managed their expansion? There are grave risks of a further
decline in the quality as well as the quantity of their loans. We are seeing
creditworthy companies paying off bank borrowings through equity and bond
issues. But the troubled corporate customers will remain in debt, and
interest is rolling up at 12 to 15 per cent a year. Home owners are paying
off their mortgages where they can, but those in difficulties are caught in
a trap from which there is no escape. People have been scared, and for many
years home buyers are likely to take out the smallest mortgage they can get
away with rather than the biggest loan they can afford.
The instinct of the squeezed lenders is to raise their margins to cover the
bad debts. The good borrowers will pay for the bad. We heard a lot of
squeals from the small business sector last year as this increase in rates
and charges was put into effect. Not only is such a shift perceived to be
unfair, but there is a further encouragement for sound customers to seek
other forms of financing. Foreign banks may find lucrative opportunities to
cream off the good quality business - although fortunately for the British
banks a lot of the once-powerful overseas competitors have their own
problems. Not so Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, however.
The Hongkong Bank's intervention represents a serious threat to the other
clearers. They had hoped that Midland, as financially the weakest of the Big
Four, would be forced to bear the greatest burden of the industry's
retrenchment. But Midland could be shored up by Far East money. Any recovery
in the pathetic returns on shareholders' capital in the British banking
industry could be postponed, and the other clearers could be forced to
shrink more drastically instead. No wonder Lloyds felt obliged to adopt
desperate tactics by launching (well, almost launching) the first contested
takeover bid for an English High Street bank.
Doubtless the public - especially those noisy small businessmen - will
celebrate the prospect of Lloyds being beaten off by the Monopolies
Commission. But shareholders and staff of the other banks should worry.
There is no M4 escape route any more.

In these days of diminishing inflationary expectations, one would hardly
expect index-linked gilts to be worth a second glance. Perversely, neglect
since the election has increased their charm. Only if inflation averages
well under 2 per cent during the next 10 years do conventional gilts offer a
higher return to investors paying 40 per cent tax. Small wonder the Bank of
England included Pounds 200m of index-linked in yesterday's offering.

FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lasmo fell 8 per cent on yesterday's announcement that the group
is taking the first steps towards a US and Canadian flotation of Ultramar's
downstream assets. In one sense, that seems a curious response. The UK
investment community would be right to be wary of a disguised rights issue
in the form of a demerger, as proposed in the past by such as Beazer and
Maxwell Communication. But that is not what is proposed. Instead, Lasmo is
to be applauded for seeking to bring in genuinely new cash.
The market's reaction may have been appropriate on other grounds. The chief
implication is that Lasmo is hedging against failure to find a trade buyer
for the assets. Presumably at this stage, any trade offers have been made on
the basis that Lasmo is a forced seller, so the flotation option could be a
gambit to get the price up. Lasmo must be hoping it works. Should the
flotation have to go ahead, it is not entirely clear why investors should
agree to pay up for assets the industry has deemed too expensive. If they
did, the implications would be thought-provoking. If the US trade is right
in its valuation of oil assets, it would seem to follow that the US oil
sector, which has underperformed the US equity market by a fifth since the
start of last year, has further to fall.

FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A week is a long time in Scandinavian insurance politics. Even three or four
days ago it still seemed that Denmark's Hafnia was destined to be swallowed
up by Sweden's Skandia in what had the makings of a new and powerful Nordic
alliance. Yesterday, however, institutional rumblings turned into
shareholder revolt, with the result that Hafnia's board has now backed a
rival DK1.5bn (Pounds 130m) reconstruction plan which seemingly
re-establishes its independence.
Notwithstanding Hafnia's parlous financial condition, Skandia's offer was
certainly niggardly enough to justify unrest. The more intriguing question,
though, is whether the hand of the French insurance giant UAP is at work.
There has long been speculation UAP might like to get hold of Hafnia's 33
per cent stake in its Danish rival Baltica, which it would then deliver to
France's Groupe Victoire in return for control of Colonia of Germany. UAP
has remained out of sight so far, but it would be no surprise if it popped
up with a larger stake in Hafnia once the capital raising is complete.
Whatever the answer, Hafnia's volte face creates fresh problems elsewhere.
Its erstwhile Norwegian ally Uni Storebrand - with whom it built a combined
48 per cent Skandia stake - can ill afford to hang on to these shares, which
would have been cancelled as part of the Swedish offer for Hafnia. Skandia,
whose shares have tumbled from SK140 just after the bid to SK118 yesterday,
now looks to be stuck with two unhappy investors.

FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk of lower UK base rates has a certain aptness for the equity market. On
Wednesday, the FT-All Share index closed at an all-time high. The previous
record, set last September, was reached just two days after base rates were
cut to their present level of 10.5 per cent. But in real terms, the market
is still sadly adrift. To match last year's peak adjusted for inflation, the
All Share would have to be 6 per cent higher than it is now. To match its
previous peak in 1987, it would have to be 30 per cent higher. In terms of
the FT-SE, that would require a rise of some 800 points. Not even the most
bullish broking houses expect a rise of much more than 300 points by the
year end.
Then again, that in itself suggests that the market is not wildly
overpriced. This week, it repeated its performance of the week before by
struggling a fraction higher in heavy trading. Plainly, the market is
adjusting to the realities of weak and non-inflationary recovery. Even a
half point cut in base rates would scarcely be grounds for a change of view.

FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: High hopes of low rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as if a base rate cut might finally be on the way after all. Not
only was the Bank of England discreetly but systematically intervening in
the money markets this week. Yesterday's Pounds 800m issue of five-year
gilts also seems designed to raise expectations of a cut. Since paper of
such short maturity is more geared to short interest rates, it might prove
difficult to sell if hopes were disappointed.
Of course, there is still a risk that a rate cut could backfire given the
narrow differential with Germany, especially since markets there are worried
about a seemingly runaway money supply. The risk was greater before the UK
election, however. Sterling is now close to its DM2.95 central rate in the
European system and the government could raise rates again with relative
impunity if sterling came under pressure. The Bank can also study the
reaction to its signal in continental markets on Monday before finally
making up its mind.
Given sterling's strength, the Bank might be tempted to go for a half point
cut. The received wisdom is that after the election, the UK is a beacon of
stability. Germany is facing strikes, France has an election next year and
Japan runs the risk of incipient financial crisis. The US has riots and
Italy lacks a president.
Yet, despite the Bank's astonishing success in selling gilts since the
election, it still needs the support of international investors to fund the
PSBR. The UK might have less appeal if investors believed the rise in the
exchange rate and the fall in interest rates had run their course. This is
an argument for a quarter-point cut. A half point would imply the government
is privately less convinced about the prospects for recovery than its public
utterances suggest.

FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Politically rudderless, Milan remains
afloat - Haig Simonian casts an eye over a lethargic bourse marking time
until the Italian presidential election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a country without a head of state, prime minister or government, probably
the biggest surprise is that the Milan bourse has not gone into freefall.
This achievement, however, must be seen against a background of painfully
thin trading, which has made equity business for all but the biggest of the
new-style Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim) highly unprofitable.
Substantial fixed costs have only been covered thanks to record trading
volumes on the fixed-income side for those Sims which are also active in
government bonds. But for brokers focused on equities, it has been another
story.
The April 5 general election, which showed a sharp drop in support for
Italy's established parties, has created a period of political uncertainty
as party leaders scramble to consider possible new alliances.
But last week's surprise resignation of President Francesco Cossiga has led
the country into uncharted territory, even by Italian political standards. A
new president is to be elected on May 13. Once in office, the new head of
state will have to nominate a prime minister, who will try to form a
government in a parliament in which 16 parties are represented.
The stock market is therefore marking time. Daily volume has sometimes
fallen below L50bn (Dollars 40.4m), and the only interest has tended to come
from the few foreigners still willing to take a punt on Italian stocks.
The Sims have been suffering. With over half their budgets allocated to
staff costs, even brokers with a sizeable market share are unable to make
money. Some blame the market's lethargy on more than just short-term
political factors.
Mr Giovanni Borghi, managing director of Intercassa, the Sim owned by
Cariplo, the big Milan savings bank, and 25 smaller savings institutions,
points to last year's introduction of capital gains tax. This triggered a
drop in trading volumes, despite the arrival this year of new rules limiting
the possibilities for off-floor trading, which should have led to a
substantial increase in recorded turnover.
'The tax dampened speculation between operators on the floor, who traded
partly on rumours,' says Mr Borghi. 'Its introduction has had a much bigger
role than many expected.'
Poor corporate profits have also depressed the market. Higher dividends this
week from Italgas, the fast-expanding gas and water group, and Eridania,
Ferruzzi's agro-industrial subsidiary, were welcome exceptions. But within
hours of their figures, Marzotto, Italy's biggest textiles and clothing
company which last year bought control of Hugo Boss in Germany, announced a
cut in its dividend because of current difficulties in the sector.
Not surprisingly, brokers have been looking for scapegoats. The most popular
has been Consob, the stock market watchdog. As part of Italy's stock market
reforms, it set rules last year for off-floor trading large blocks of
shares. The block market has seen some huge transactions in recent weeks,
just as business on the floor has languished. Moreover, some deals have been
executed at prices much higher those prevailing on the bourse.
The most striking example involved Alenia, the state-controlled aerospace
group. About 1.1m of its shares changed hands at L3,169 - some 50 per cent
above the market price. Other controversial block transactions have involved
Euromobiliare, the merchant bank whose majority shareholder is Midland Bank
of the UK, and the newly-quoted San Paolo di Torino. Though in line with
market prices, the San Paolo deal amounted to around L109bn - more than
total turnover on the floor that day.
Dealers ascribe the higher prices to inter-company transactions, probably
for tax purposes or to avoid a write-down on the balance sheet.
Such use of the block market has angered brokers, and has led to calls for
the minimum size of transactions which can be done off the floor to be
raised.
Consob has promised to look into the matter. But in response to the
criticism, it points out that the instances of large blocks of shares
changing hands at above market prices have been limited.
In some cases, it adds, the price difference had been within 10 per cent of
that quoted on the bourse. And in other examples, the deals had taken place
'for motives not linked to normal trading' on the securities market, and had
only been made public because they had taken place via a Sim.
Activity on the floor has been limited to Italy's biggest companies. Shares
associated with Mr Carlo De Benedetti went on a two-day roller-coaster ride
after he was sentenced to over six years in jail for his alleged role in the
Banco Ambrosiano collapse, but have since recovered. And Pirelli's stock has
been bought by investors who believe that, having fallen so heavily, it now
has only one way to go.

FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Foreigners seek Royal Dutch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST continental bourses were closed yesterday for the May Day holiday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM saw strong foreign interest in Royal Dutch while other blue chips
were weaker. The CBS Tendency Index closed up 0.2 at 128.8 for a 0.15 per
cent rise on the week.
Royal Dutch advanced Fl 1.60 to Fl 154.50 but off the day's high of Fl
155.80 following a strong rise in US oil stocks overnight. Although the
group released disappointing first quarter results from its US division
during the day, some analysts said that sentiment remained positive on an
upturn in demand during the second quarter.
Heavy UK institutional buying was also noted in KLM and Daf, although both
closed lower: KLM shed 30 cents to Fl 37.80 and Daf lost 10 cents to Fl 24.
Akzo, ex dividend, remained in demand following Wednesday's good first
quarter figures. It closed a net Fl 2.90 higher at Fl 158.90.
COPENHAGEN was dominated by Hafnia which rose strongly after its board of
directors said it would now support the rescue package proposed by a group
of Danish shareholders dissatisfied with an offer from the Swedish insurer,
Skandia. The all-share index rose 0.37 to 330.03, down 1.2 per cent on the
week.
Hafnia's B shares rose DKr30 to DKr250 on turnover of 35,000 shares while
the thinly traded A shares jumped SKr42 to SKr325. Its rival, Baltica, in
which Hafnia has a stake of more than 33 per cent, rose DKr15 to DKr635.
Sophus Berendsen, whose UK Rentokil has been gaining ground, rose DKr40 to
DKr1,900.
ISTANBUL advanced on rumours of a fall in the monthly inflation rate, due to
be announced on Monday. The index closed up 71.6 at 3,757.97, but was down
1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at TL209.5bn.
Among active shares, the cement group Adana A-type rose TL1,000 to TL11,500
on good first quarter results, Eczacibasi Yatirim, an investment company,
gained TL500 to TL8,400 while its its pharmaceuticals division, Ilac,
advanced TL750 to TL13,000.
Eregli was up TL50 at TL3,000 while Petkim, the petrochemical group, was
unchanged at TL650.
South Africa was closed yesterday for a holiday.

<TEXT>
AUTHORITIES at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) fear a renewed slide in share
prices as investors liquidate holdings ahead of Mangalore Refinery's
offering of Rs11.5bn worth of convertible bonds, the largest ever. Several
rights issues are also expected during the next five weeks.
The BSE recovered 213.31 to 3,887.72 on Thursday after plunging 17.7 per
cent in two days to an eight-week low of 3,674.60 on Wednesday. The market
was closed yesterday.
The market has been unsettled by a strike by brokers to protest against new
registration requirements and by a scandal in the gilt-edged market. Brokers
have since returned to work, in the hope that the government will resolve
the issue by May 21, the deadline laid down by the Securities and Exchange
Board of India, requiring BSE brokers to register with it.

FT  02 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported a calm session in stock index futures which nevertheless
breached the 2,700 level for the second time this week, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE started the session at 2,685, a 24-point
premium to the underlying cash market but quickly declined due to lack of
interest to 2,675 by 9.20am. Then, a sharp turnaround was recorded and June
advanced, boosted by a slight squeeze and talk of a cut in UK base rates,
sending the contract to 2707 by midday. Real business remained slow with a
mere 2,000 contracts traded by 11am.
June ran into sellers in the afternoon and drifted lower to closie at 2,697,
around 19 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18.
Turnover was a poor 4,922 by the close.
The traded options market also had a quiet session with turnover reaching
only 26,093 lots. The FT-SE option traded just 3,623 lots while the
Euro-FTSE recorded a mere 476 contracts in total. Asda was the top traded
stock option recording a total of 4,130 lots, with the January 35 calls the
busiest series. It was followed by BP at 3,424 and then by Allied Lyons in
which 1,550 trades were dealt.

FT  02 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes of rate cut boosts equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SESSION expected to be nothing more than a winding down period for the
Bank Holiday weekend provided plenty of thrills and spills and saw the
Footsie index stage another strong, but ultimately unsuccessful, dash at the
market's all-time peak.
A buoyant performance by equities rounded off a week that included Lloyds
Bank's considered Pounds 3.7bn counter offer to the agreed merger between
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, plus a series of big placings and a successful
outcome to the UK's biggest ever auction of gilts.
The trigger for the latest in a series of impressive showings by equities
was a growing belief in the market that the Treasury had rubber-stamped a
cut in UK domestic interest rates and that such a move would probably take
place on Tuesday morning. A reduction of a quarter of a point was
confidently predicted while many observers said a cut of a half point was
quite feasible.
Gilt-edged stocks bounded ahead, with the authorities sufficently encouraged
to issue a further Pounds 1.1bn-worth of stock, comprising Pounds 900m of
tap stocks and Pounds 200m in index-linked stock. Longer dated issues closed
around a half point higher. The equity market began the session some 6
points up at 2,660.1, on the interest rate cut story and also in sympathy
with the firm performance by Wall Street on Thursday evening.
With no immediate indications that a rate cut was imminent, the equity
market fell back to show a near four-point decline within an hour of the
opening, before embarking on a determined upward move. This was accompanied
by keen demand for the footsie future, which pushed confidently through the
2,700 mark. At its best level of the day, 2,672.7, the underlying index was
some seven points off its all-time closing high, reached last September.
Thereafter, footsie buying interest, and the general level of business began
to tail off as marketmakers awaited what was expected to be a twitchy
opening by Wall Street in the wake of the devastation caused by the riots on
the west coast.
London's caution was well founded with the Dow Jones Average down more than
25 points as the footsie ended the session 5.7 off at 2,659.8, although 16.8
higher over the week. Turnover reached 663.8m shares, heavily boosted by the
placing of a block of 24m shares in Kalon, carried out jointly by Smith New
Court and James Capel.
Retail, or customer business, in London continued at high levels this week
amid hopes that the economy is emerging from recession.

FT  02 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Zantac fears hit Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESS reports from the US casting doubts over Glaxo's number one drug,
Zantac, hit the shares in late trading and they fell sharply against the
market.
When trading began, the shares were up on positive news about Glaxo's
anti-migraine drug announced on Thursday. However, a report of tests by
researchers in Houston Texas suggested that antibiotics might be more
effective in treating ulcers than the class of drugs which includes Glaxo's
Zantac and SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Glaxo, for which Zantac represents
about 75 per cent of profits dropped 24 to 720p. Turnover of 4.6m was higher
than usual. Tagamet represents but a third of SmithKline's profits and the
shares fell only 4 to 855p.
UK analysts said the effectiveness of anti-biotics on ulcers had been
debated for some time in Europe but was not widely considered in the US.
Consequently, when Wall Street opened Glaxo's US-held stock was sold and the
UK shares followed suit.
Lasmo disappoints
An announcement by oil exploration group Lasmo that it is to float off its
downstream assets in California upset a market expecting a quick sale. The
shares fell 21 to 217, the biggest percentage drop of all the FT-SE 100
stocks, with a hefty 7.9m traded.
Oil analysts had calculated at Pounds 900m the book value of the assets
acquired after Lasmo's takeover of Ultramar last year. Bears like County
NatWest believed Lasmo would get at least Pounds 700m whereas more
optimistic securities houses were looking for a figure closer to the book
value. In the event, Lasmo expects to raise around Pounds 100m less than the
lower forecast.
Also, there was disappointment that, rather than hear something concrete
yesterday, the market will have to wait until a flotation scheduled for
June.
Ratners bid talk
Jeweller Ratners was steady at 20 1/2 p, but climbed 5 1/4 p during the
course of the week on rumours of a possible bid. Turnover yesterday remained
strong at 11m shares.
Kingfisher, holding company of the Woolworth to B &amp; Q Group, is known to
have further acquisitions in mind and was suggested as possibly stalking
Ratners, but Kingfisher's shares rose 2 to 544p and analysts had doubts
about the bid talk. It was pointed out that there is a big debt problem to
overcome and any company looking at Ratners at present is likely to be put
off after looking at the balance sheet.
Composite insurers performed well as securities house Smith New Court
advised clients that the time was ripe to pick them up. Mr Stephen Bird,
Smith's insurance analyst said the recent rise in the stockmarket was a
boost for the insurers which held about 28 per cent of their investment in
equities and mainly in the UK. He added that there was 'growing momentum for
higher commercial insurance rates' following the increase in personal rates
last year.
Mr Bird added that he did not expect the sector to be hit by the riots in
the US.
Commercial Union, which has underperformed since the general election,
gained 11 to 481p. Mr Bird strengthened his buy stance on Commercial and on
Sun Alliance, which he said was the group most exposed to UK equities and to
the UK. Sun rose 5 to 298p. He also lifted his stance on Royal Insurance
from sell to hold while Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken was recommending it as a
speculative buy. The shares lifted 9 to 224p.
The two-way pull continued in BP which saw heavy turnover of 19m shares and
ended the day only 2 stronger at 270p after being 8 better at one stage. US
investors were said to be back on the bid the previous night and now hold
13.8 per cent of BP in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). US
buying had taken the ADRs up to the sterling equivalent of 275p and, the
shares reached that level in the UK but then ran into heavy selling and
ticked back again.
Troubled conglomerate Lonrho dived 16 early in the session after a press
report said the US Government was investigating the company's links with
Libya including a deal involving Lonrho's north American hotels. Last month,
the company sold a third of its holding in London's Metropole hotel for
Pounds 177.5m to Libya.
The shares had been one of the week's leading recovery stocks but retreated
on the news. However, buyers emerged at the lower levels, sending the shares
forward to recover some of the lost ground and eventually ended 11 lighter
at 95p on reasonable turnover of 5.2m shares.
Utilities were firm as the reporting season approaches. Analysts have noted
an unravelling of the Electricity Package of late, down 5 at Pounds 3,193
yesterday, as investors anticipate what may be the best stocks when the
package splits in September.
Among water stocks, North West, one of the earliest due to report, continued
to attract support, rising 8 to 435p.
Allied-Lyons weakened against the trend in the brewing and drinks sector,
losing 6 to 639p as Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock from a buy to
attractive, on worries about spirit sales.
Media stocks continued to attract US investors. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi rose 3 1/2
to 23 1/4 p with 52m traded, making a turnover of 92m in two days.
MEPC finished 14 higher at 358p following rumours that the company has let
its Alban Gate office development in London.
Food group Albert Fisher rose 5 to 77p, still boosted by recent
presentations in the US.
Turnover was a hefty 10m shares, but down on Thursday's 17.1m. Analysts said
it was not yet clear what impact the US riots would have on Albert Fisher's
operations in Los Angeles.
reported to have been the beneficiary of a profits upgrading from UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew remained a good market adding another 6 to 294p. Turnover at
2.8m shares was down on Thursday's high figure.
Turnover in Kalon Group, the paints and chemicals group, unchanged at 106p,
rose to 48m after Smith New Court and James Capel together placed 24m shares
on the behalf of the past chairman, Leslie Silver, and his family.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices slide to 22-year
lows - Week in the markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A generally quiet week for commodity markets coffee stood out like a sore
thumb. With producer selling revealing a sad lack of buying interest robusta
coffee prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange continued their
inexorable slide to the lowest level in 22 years.
As the July futures price fell to Dollars 738 a tonne on Thursday some
dealers suggested that the market was due for an upturn, pointing out that
many speculative traders would have short positions to square up when the
market bottomed out. And that point in the present price cycle might be
reached soon, they said, as declining returns made producers more reluctant
to sell. Others argued, however, that, reluctant or not, many producers had
no choice but to keep selling because of the need to finance debt
repayments.
In early trading yesterday the former group seemed to have got it right;
producer selling appeared to have dried up and profit-taking and
bargain-hunting purchases prompted rises by midday ranging from Dollars 6 to
Dollars 16 a tonne. But the bears regained the ascendancy in the afternoon,
following a lower opening at the New York market. The July position, which
had rallied to Dollars 748 a tonne at one point, dipped to Dollars 726
before closing at Dollars 728 a tonne, down Dollars 59 on the week and
Dollars 269 from the beginning of this year.
Ivory Coast selling, which has been a notable factor in the recent coffee
price decline, weighed heavily on the cocoa market this week, and seems set
to do so for some time. Traders are aware that, having delayed the start of
this year's cocoa marketing campaign because of depressed price levels, the
Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, will have to maintain its sales
at a much higher level than usual for the remainder of the season. 'If,
according to World Bank guidelines, the Caisse de Stabilisation in the Ivory
Coast has to sell three quarters of the new crop by end-September, they need
to sell at least 20,000 tonnes a week,' one London trader told the Reuters
news agency yesterday. Normally by this stage Ivorian sales would have
slowed to about 9,000 tonnes a week.
London cocoa futures prices set fresh 16 1/2 -year lows this week before
steadying somewhat yesterday. The July delivery price closed at Pounds 589 a
tonne, up Pounds 5 on the day but Pounds 19 down on the week.
The two-weeks of talks on the International Cocoa Agreement that ended
yesterday in Geneva had no discernible market impact. As had been predicted
the meeting of producer and consumer members under the auspices of the UN
Committee on Trade and Development made little progress towards reving the
market stabilisation functions of the moribund pact. Delegates agreed to
meet again in July.
In an otherwise uneventful week at the London Metal Exchange the zinc market
continued to be distorted by a squeeze on supplies available for nearby
delivery. As the exchange's warehouse stocks grew by another 8,500 tonnes to
a record 244,775 tonnes the three months position fell Dollars 12 on the
week to Dollars 1,292.50 a tonne. But the squeeze fears pushed the cash
price up Dollars 32 to a 16-month high of Dollars 1,371.50 a tonne, widening
the cash premium to Dollars 79 a tonne, from Dollars 35 at the end of last
week.
Aluminium prices dipped to five-week lows on news of labour contract deals
had been reached at Alcoa and Reynolds of the US. The cash quotation
recovered Dollars 8.25 of the fall yesterday but still ended Dollars 18.50
down on the week at Dollars 1,289.50 a tonne.
All was fairly quiet in the precious metals market until the last two days
of the week. Then platinum put on a spurt that left the London price Dollars
8 up on balance at Dollars 350.15 a troy ounce at the afternoon fixing.
Later it moved farther ahead to Dollars 354 an ounce. Traders said the rise
reflected chart-inspired investment fund buying in the New York market that
reversed a 12-week downtrend.
At London's International Petroleum Exchange the crude oil market had a more
active week, with the July position putting on 68 cents at Dollars 19.49 a
barrel before easing a little yesterday. The rise reflected the more
optimistic view being taken by traders of oil demand prospects.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London said
there had been some strong buying from oil refiners in the US. 'The second
quarter is providing shopping opportunities for those who like to line up
barrels for later in the year,' he said. 'When the market started to run
they thought they'd better buy or miss the boat.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: US insurer paid on overdue
mortgage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK yesterday gained another reprieve by agreeing to make an
overdue interest payment on a mortgage held by Prudential Insurance of
America.
The agreement with Prudential could, however, spell trouble for O&amp;Y from
other debt-holders who have not been paid since the developer's liquidity
problems surfaced in late March. The New Jersey-based insurance group said
the two parties had reached a verbal agreement resolving an interest payment
due in April on a USDollars 155m mortgage secured by the Aetna Centre in
Toronto.
It declined to give details of the agreement, but noted that 'if a property
is performing, we would expect mortgage payments to be current'.
O&amp;Y failed to make the April payment on time, despite the fact that rental
income from the 45-storey building was sufficient to meet the property's
debt-servicing obligations. Prudential responded on Thursday afternoon by
notifying Aetna Centre's tenants that it was seizing all rents from the
property.
The move to assign rents appears to have caught O&amp;Y by surprise. The company
has spent the past few weeks asking banks and other holders of its Dollars
12bn debt for a debt standstill and an infusion of funds, while it
negotiates a more comprehensive debt restructuring. A group of Japanese
institutions last month agreed to defer interest due on a Dollars 800m
Eurobond secured by a building at the World Financial Centre in New York.
On the other hand, O&amp;Y paid Dollars 6m in interest to public holders of
floating-rate notes secured by three other Manhattan buildings. Like Aetna
Centre, the World Financial Centre is generating enough rental income to
meet interest payments.
However O&amp;Y has been forced to channel cashflow from these buildings to less
liquid parts of its far-flung property empire.
The company earlier this week won another breathing space with the agreement
by a group of banks to advance Pounds 5m (Dollars 8.85m) for the Canary
Wharf development in London's Docklands. Negotiations are continuing for a
bigger credit facility for Canary Wharf.

AIR CANADA will achieve break-even on an operating basis this year, and
forge alliances with North American, European and Asian airlines, according
to Mr Hollis Harris, the president.
Mr Harris, a former head of Delta Airlines, said that Air Canada can count
on its quality and strong revenue base. But costs are too high and must be
cut by 10 per cent more by the end of 1993. This will mean further staff
cuts in the hundreds.
The sale and leaseback of three Boeing 747-400s and the sale of its credit
card operation will bring CDollars 700m cash into Air Canada by year end.

FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: Asset write-down may hurt CSR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, is likely to report a
substantial net loss for the year to March 31, following a ruling by the
Australian Securities Commission (ASC) on the treatment of an ADollars 558m
(USDollars 422.70m) asset write-down.
The expected loss, due to be announced in June, follows a revaluation in
February of CSR's plant and equipment, goodwill and trademarks, which CSR
had intended to treat as an extraordinary loss.
This would have allowed it to account for the write-down without reducing
net profit for the year, which it had forecast would fall to less than
ADollars 200m, compared with ADollars 355m.
However, in a ruling published yesterday, the ASC said the write-down should
be treated as an abnormal loss, which means it will have to be deducted from
trading profits. The write-down was prompted by CSR's strict interpretation
of a revised accounting standard, AASB 1010, which obliges directors to
ensure that non-current assets are recorded in accounts at recoverable
values.
The revaluation surprised the Australian markets, and raised the possibility
that other companies might be forced to take similar action to comply with
the standard. However, the ASC's ruling follows widespread debate among
accountants and regulators about CSR's interpretation of another accounting
standard, AASB 1018, which deals with the treatment of extraordinary and
abnormal losses.
CSR said it had been advised that the write-down could be treated as an
extraordinary loss, but acknowledged that the standard 'is capable of other
interpretations, which may lead to a different accounting treatment'.
The group said the ASC's ruling did not affect 'the fundamental nature of
the revaluation,' which was unlikely to be repeated. Nor would it affect its
ability to pay a dividend.
CSR was given court approval recently to transfer ADollars 558m from its
share premium reserve to the profit and loss account, to offset the impact
of the write-down on retained profits.

FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pan-Nordic insurance group still
just a dream / A look at at how a tangled Scandinavian saga might be
unravelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES and XUELING LIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for the creation of a pan-Nordic insurance group are back to square
one after Denmark's Hafnia Holding decided on Thursday to reject a bid from
Skandia of Sweden to take over the group.
The Nordic insurance saga started last year when Norway's Uni Storebrand and
Hafnia tried to gain control of Sweden's leading insurer, Skandia, and
announced plans for an alliance, which, somewhat prematurely, they named
Nordic Co-operation.
The plan fell through and, in April, Skandia turned the tables on Hafnia,
making a bid to take it over. At the time Hafnia was in deep financial
trouble as a result of its over-adventurous bid for Skandia.
Hafnia's rejection of the Skandia bid places Uni Storebrand and Mr Jan Erik
Langangen, its chief executive, in a difficult situation, with speculation
rife in Oslo that he will be forced to resign.
The next moves in the complex Nordic insurance saga could take many
directions.
Among the possible developments are that Baltica, Hafnia's main domestic
rival, which was discussing an agreement with Skandia when the Uni
Storebrand-Hafnia raid was launched, could resume talks with Skandia.
'If they ring, we can always discuss things, but we have no plans to make an
approach ourselves,' said Mr Esben Hostager, Baltica's public relations
manager.
As France's Compagnie Financiere de Suez has a 23 per cent holding in
Baltica, and Baltica has holdings in Colonia-Victoire, the Franco-German
insurance arm of Suez, any deal between Baltica and Skandia would lead to a
Scandinavian-French alliance.
Another possibility is that Hafnia and Baltica could reopen merger talks.
This would be one way of solving the problems caused by Hafnia's 33.5 per
cent stake in Baltica. 'Any agreement would have to benefit our
shareholders, and nothing has emerged so far which seems advantageous to our
shareholders,' said Mr Hostager.
Alternatively, an outsider, such as France's UAP, which has a small holding
in Hafnia, may have its eye on Hafnia's Baltica stake with a view to
establishing French ascendancy over Baltica. However, Hafnia's institutional
shareholder group has said it will seek a friendly placement of the Baltica
shares, so this move looks unlikely.
Meanwhile, Uni Storebrand has a serious problem. On April 9, Skandia made an
offer to take over Hafnia on the condition that Skandia sold its
international reinsurance business to Uni Storebrand, with payment being
made with the Skandia shares held by Storebrand and Hafnia. The refusal of
Hafnia's shareholders to accept the Skandia bid means the Storebrand part of
the deal is also in danger.
However, the view in Oslo yesterday was that Storebrand would try to carry
out the deal with Skandia, although it would require renegotiation of the
April 9 agreement and the acceptance of any new arrangements by Hafnia.
Storebrand said yesterday there was a shareholder's agreement between Hafnia
and Storebrand that neither can sell its holdings in Skandia without the
agreement of the other. This agreement stands, Storebrand said.
The collapse of the deal with Hafnia leaves Skandia back where it was before
the Danish firm and Storebrand began their play to gain control. The
Danish-Norwegian approach was foiled because it did not have the consent of
Skandia's board. As no shareholder in Skandia can exercise more than 30
votes, the Danes and Swedes where unable to force through their plan. This
30-vote rule, in effect, places Skandia in the control of its employees.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, said on Thursday he regretted
the decision by Hafnia's shareholders. He said Skandia, for its part, would
concentrate on its insurance business.
The rejection of the Skandia bid came only after pressure on Hafnia's board
of directors, who originally favoured the offer, by dissatisfied Danish
shareholders. Institutional investors, led by the LD Fund, considered that
Skandia was getting Hafnia too cheaply.
The rebels have promised to raise at least DKr1.5bn (Dollars 234m) in new
capital for Hafnia, which would give Hafnia breathing space to dispose of
its 13.5 per cent holding in Skandia and its Baltica holding at an
acceptable price.

severance and stays on the payroll

MR Nicholas Nicholas, the former co-chief executive of Time Warner whose
forced resignation was engineered in February by Mr Steve Ross, the
company's chairman, received a Dollars 15.8m severance payment in addition
to Dollars 2.9m of salary, deferred income and bonuses in 1991.
According to a new filing by Time Warner with the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission (SEC), the company agreed not to cancel a 1989 employment
contract with Mr Nicholas. This will allow him to remain on the company's
payroll - at an annual salary of Dollars 250,000 - until 1999.
Mr Nicholas holds options to buy 500,000 shares in Time Warner at an average
of Dollars 90 per share. Yesterday's share price was Dollars 106 7/8 8, up
by  7/8 .
The size of executive compensation packages at Time Warner has been a
controversial issue for the company, mainly because Mr Ross is the recipient
of a Dollars 196m package related to payments for his stock interests in
Warner.
Last year Mr Ross received Dollars 4.06m in base pay, deferred income and a
bonus. In 1990 the total of Mr Ross's compensation - including a part of the
payment of Dollars 196m over eight years - was Dollars 78.2m.
Mr Jerry Levin, the former Time man who was elevated by Mr Ross to take the
place of Mr Nicholas as co-chief executive, was paid Dollars 2.8m in 1991.

FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: LTV registers further losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LTV, the large US steel group which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since
1986, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 43.3m, due
mainly to the weakness of the US steel market.
The loss compared with one of Dollars 46.3m a year ago. Group sales dipped
from Dollars 1.43bn to Dollars 1.39bn, due to the exclusion this quarter of
a vehicle manufacturing subsidiary, AM General, which has been sold. Sales
were up Dollars 88.6m on the previous year, stripping out the effect of the
sale.
The two other leading US steel manufacturers, USX and Bethlehem, also
reported continued losses this week, though both these companies managed to
reduce the red ink in their steel operations.
LTV reported a small rise in steel operating losses, from Dollars 48.8m to
Dollars 52.6m, on sales which rose 9 per cent to Dollars 869.6m and
shipments up 14 per cent to 1.75m tons.
The group said the steel losses reflected lower selling prices, a less
favourable product mix and higher employment costs, mainly from increased
hourly wages and incentives under its current labour pact.
The group's aerospace and defence business, in the process of being sold for
Dollars 450m to Thomson-CSF of France and Washington's Carlyle Group, made
Dollars 9.4m on sales of Dollars 455.8m, compared to Dollars 7.3m on sales
of Dollars 549.5m a year ago. The 1992 figures excluded results for AM
General.
The sale of the defence business still has to be approved by the US
Government's Committee on Foreign Investment, an inter-agency review panel.
Many Congressmen have expressed opposition to the sale, on the grounds that
it could mean the leaking of delicate defence secrets. Two military
contractors which lost the bidding race for the LTV unit - Martin Marietta
and Lockheed - are also lobbying for the sale to be blocked.

BANCO Santander, the Spanish commercial bank, is negotiating the sale of its
last remaining domestic subsidiary, the Banco de Murcia, to Bancaja, a
Valencia-based savings bank, for Pta17bn (Dollars 163.46m).
The deal fuels speculation that the Santander group, which owns 10 per cent
of the Royal Bank of Scotland and 13.5 per cent of First Fidelity Bancorp in
the US, is preparing for further international investments.
Foreign assets accounted for 27 per cent of the group's Pta75bn net profits
last year. Mr Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, said earlier this year he
wanted to lift the non-Spanish contribution to the group's income.
The sale of the 66-branch Banco de Murcia network is expected to be
completed within three months.
Banco Bilboa Vizcaya (BBV), the big Spanish retail bank, became the first
large domestic financial group to report a first-quarter slide. It announced
net profits of Pta18.5bn, 4.5 per cent down on the Pta19.4 in the first
three months of last year.

FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y may overhaul Dollars 12bn
debt plan - Developer in new efforts to stave off financial collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the international property group, is considering a complete
overhaul of its plan to reorganise Dollars 12bn in debt in an effort to ward
off the threat of bankruptcy filings.
Sources close to O&amp;Y's bank talks said it had called a meeting of its 12
biggest lenders for Monday to discuss whether all 100 of its banks should
contribute to a Dollars 700m 'global' loan.  The banks are led by Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citicorp of the US and Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation.
Until now, it has tried to raise new money from banks with an exposure to
its Canadian operations and to its Canary Wharf property development in east
London. Negotiations on a global loan would replace these attempts.
O&amp;Y had originally hoped to put a 'ring fence' behind those properties in
North America whose rents are sufficient to meet borrowing costs. Lenders to
these more profitable properties would have been asked to make only limited
sacrifices in the debt restructuring.
However, lenders to Canary Wharf and the Canadian operations have only been
prepared to provide small sums to keep O&amp;Y afloat for a few days at a time.
O&amp;Y has decided it may be better to involve all its banks in the
refinancing.
The 11 lenders to the Canary Wharf project are due to meet again on Monday
to discuss whether to provide Pounds 33m (Dollars 58.4m) of new loans to
meet the construction project's needs for a month, or whether to press for
the project to be put into administration under UK insolvency procedures.
The possibility that other banks would participate in the refinancing is
likely to encourage the 11 to provide a more modest amount of new money.

FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Shortage of skins hitting profit at Strong
&amp; Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT ENOUGH lambs to the slaughter is a rare reason for a profits warning,
but Mr Mike Buswell, chairman of Strong &amp; Fisher, used that when telling
shareholders at the annual meeting that first half profits would be
'significantly down'.
The news cut the share price from 35p to 31 1/2 p.
He stressed, though, that the group was trading profitably. In the first
half to June last year it reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.23m.
Strong &amp; Fisher is 70.3 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings, the
international food group, which rescued it in December 1990. Following a
restructuring the group was able to announce a dividend.
Mr Buswell said the serious shortage of lambs - or rather 'hoggets', which
are last season's lambs - being killed in the first quarter of the year
meant the group could not buy sufficient skins except at prices too high to
make a profit.
The group buys one-quarter of all lambskins available in the UK. Supplies
halved in January, because of a change in the system of support payments to
farmers which encouraged them to send the lambs to slaughter in December. In
the first quarter supplies were down by 25 to 30 per cent.
Mr Buswell said it was a 'one-off' problem and that this year's lambs were
now coming to be killed in 'ever-increasing numbers'.

Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, gave Mr Mick
Newmarch, its chief executive, a 7.9 per cent pay rise to Pounds 586,570 in
1991, an increase said by the company to include a cut in the bonus element
of his remuneration, writes Norma Cohen.
Mr Newmarch's salary sparked a storm of protest from shareholders last year
when his 1990 remuneration rose by 43 per cent while company profits slumped
by more than a third.
At the time, Prudential defended the rise, saying it included
performance-related pay based on the performance in 1989 when profits had
risen sharply.
In 1991, Prudential's pre-tax profits rose by 9 per cent, while its dividend
rose 6.8 per cent.

FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo sheds 21p on Ultramar sale news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the UK exploration and production company, disappointed the market
yesterday with its announcement that it could sell Ultramar's North American
refineries and other assets for between Dollars 1.17bn and Dollars 1.27bn
(Pounds 720m) by floating them off in North America.
Lasmo acquired Ultramar's downstream assets last year after a Pounds 1.4bn
takeover. The company listed them at book value of Pounds 915m in its annual
report, and analysts had suggested they could be sold for between Pounds
700m and Pounds 1bn.
Lasmo's shares dropped 21p to 217p on the news. The shares had been buoyed
in recent weeks by speculation that Lasmo was about to announce the sale of
the Wilmington refinery to Tosco Oil in the US. Market rumours of a takeover
bid for Lasmo from British Gas or Total, the French oil company, had also
boosted the company's share price.
Mr Michael Pavia, Lasmo's finance director, said the company was still
pursuing the possibility of a trade sale. This would probably produce a
higher selling price, but the North American market for refining plant is
currently depressed.
Mr Pavia said the US Securities and Exchange Commission should give the
go-ahead for an initial public offering (IPO) within a month. At that time,
Lasmo will have to decide whether to float the refineries or continue to
hold talks with prospective cash buyers.
But the refineries should be sold by mid-year, Mr Pavia said, whichever
route the company decided to pursue. He said interest in the refineries from
other companies had been encouraging.
But Mr Simon Flowers, industry analyst at County NatWest was sceptical, he
said: 'They wouldn't be talking about doing an IPO if they could get
immediate value from a cash sale.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, based in Shannon in the
Republic of Ireland, appears to be close to achieving a one-year 'lock-in'
agreement with its larger shareholders. The agreement would follow the
company's planned flotation in June.
Mr Maurice Foley, chief executive, said yesterday that 'the major
shareholders are fully agreed' on a deal which would allow them to dispose
of no more than 15-20 per cent of their present stake in the first year
after the flotation. Such an agreement is vital for GPA to ensure stability
in its share price, although in the negotiations GPA had apparently been
hoping to 'lock in' a minimum of 85 per cent.
The shareholders are Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, Air Canada,
Aer Lingus, the Prudential Assurance Company of America and The Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, which together hold 48 per cent.
In a statement yesterday Aer Lingus would not confirm finalisation of the
deal, saying only: 'Aer Lingus has reached an agreement in principal with
GPA regarding (the flotation). We have made substantial progress in our
discussions on the detail of the agreement, and we hope to finalise these
discussions shortly.' However the company said that the figures given by Mr
Foley 'are the figures we are talking about'.
It said it was negotiating on a bilateral basis with GPA, and not in concert
with the other shareholders.
Aer Lingus has been hoping to use the flotation as a means of releasing some
of its holding in order to finance the renewal of its ageing Boeing fleet.
The company also wants to purchase two or three 767s, to open a new route to
the west coast of the US.
The company will be floated simultaneously in London, Dublin, New York and
Tokyo. Mr Foley said that the final flotation price would be pitched at a
level 'to obtain the minimum we want from each market'.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: Promoting women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From T CORDREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is encouraging to read about British industry's moves to promote
women in the workforce ('An opportunity not to be missed', April 27). But I
wonder how much of this is hot air.
Unfortunately, Opportunity 2000 gives huge companies, with well-oiled public
relations machinery, the chance to churn out positive statements. But while
talk of company 'reviews', 'examinations of policy' and 'increased
awareness' may sound impressive, is anything really being done?
Obviously some companies are taking the issue seriously - but others are not
and have a very arrogant attitude to promoting women. I feel this was
demonstrated by your quote from BT which, pointing to a cultural change
within the company, said its female staff 'are slowly stopping behaving like
surrogate men'.
I suggest this reveals the true BT. It is dismissing women who have already
struggled on BT's promotion ladder, and is blaming those women's lack of
success on their attitudes rather than those within the BT hierarchy.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: The harder facts of life in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ALISON BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A 20 per cent increase in the price of an ice cream cone is bad enough
(Observer, April 27). But even worse are the average 10 per cent increases
on everyday items such as bread, newspapers and magazines, fruit (up to 100
per cent dearer this year]) plus ever-increasing rents, charges for water
and refuse collection, etc, etc, etc.
These are the facts of life in Germany which are leading to increased
'militancy' among ordinary workers. There have been several demands for a
'zero round' - ie no wage increases - this year. But most people already
suffered a 'zero round' last year: the so-called 'solidarity surcharge' of
7.5 per cent of normal income tax deductions (as if it was voluntary]) meant
that many people had no net wage increase last year.
People here are angry. The Bonn government lied when it said reunification
would not result in higher taxes; and admitted the real, huge additional
financial burden only after the federal elections were over. Meanwhile, it
is insisting on going ahead with insane projects such as the Jaeger 90
fighter aircraft; the political parties are 'helping themselves' to enormous
sums from public funds; there have been various attempts to increase
politicians' pension rights to astronomical levels; German industry is
making huge profits, but failing to invest in the eastern states; and the
ordinary people are being accused of greed and asked to pay for the mess]
Inflation rate 4.8 per cent? Tell it to your Tante.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Gilts stage a glittering performance: Why UK government
securities have returned to favour with investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The issue of a further Pounds 1bn of gilt edged tap stocks yesterday, only a
few trading hours after a successful auction of Pounds 2 1/2 bn of 25-years
stocks, completes a spectacular fortnight in this often unexciting market.
Less than three weeks ago commentators were moaning that British economic
policy might be hobbled by the near-impossible task of funding some Pounds
28bn of government borrowing in the next year. But in the weeks since the
April 9 the funding job is a quarter done, 20 year yields have fallen by
nearly a full point and the Bank of England has become confident enough to
hint last night that short-term rates could fall, too.
The immediate cause of this surge is obvious: dealers were not expecting an
outright Conservative election victory, and the whole market is celebrating.
But there is much more to it than that.
Though it is the equity market which has reached new peaks, while gilts have
merely returned to a strong trend which was momentarily shaken by election
panic, it is the fixed interest market which has attracted the big net flows
of new investment funds.
Any analyst who had even a month ago forecast a gilts boom at a time when
government borrowing was seen as slipping out of control would have been
told to take a holiday. The international flight into sterling since the
election also stands traditional wisdom on its head, and these are only
partly responses to the election result.
Foreign bond investors had run down their sterling holdings to historically
low levels ahead of polling day, which largely explains the strength of the
benchmark ten-year bond - this is the maturity which foreign funds prefer.
City traders report stronger overseas buying than they can ever remember,
and from all quarters, with especially strong Japanese and German demand.
This does not explain, though, why British institutions snapped up the new
Pounds 2 1/2 bn 25-year stock - too long-dated for Continental tastes, thus
demonstrating a commitment which shows long-term confidence in bonds.
There are two principal and seemingly durable changes in market psychology
at work. Foreign ratings of Britain in the international stability league
have risen not by a step but by a floor or two. This is partly because Mr
Major's standing has risen abroad as well as at home; but he should not let
this undermine his usual modesty. It is much more a measure of deepening
political and economic worry in all the other major markets: mainly
political in France and the US, both political and economic in Germany, and
both, in Japan (and Italy).
At the same time, fashion has been changing among British fund managers,
reflected in the steady fall in ten-year yields which set in long before the
elections here, or the troubles abroad.
The view that bonds are attractive because inflation is largely conquered,
but that strong recovery is still some way off, has become known as the
Norwich Union view. It is still controversial, and vocally opposed by some
equity houses; but more and more funds are beginning to restore some of the
gilt weighting they used to carry before the inflationary disasters of the
1970s. Some institutions have bought gilts rather as half-believers go to
church. They do not believe the full Norwich gospel but they feel it is as
well to take out some insurance. And remember the running yield.
There are two obstinate survivors of the recent conventional wisdom which
prevent a full return to that of thirty years ago. The first, which could
limit the rise in gilts, is the belief that real men don't buy bonds. They
may rise, certainly; but anything which is good for bonds is so good for
equities that gilts are for milksops. However, British institutional
weightings in fixed interest securities are so low by world standards that
there is plenty of room even for macho fund managers to move back a bit.
The more threatening survivor is the belief that however bad things may look
in Germany, the Bundesbank will get it right in the long run; while however
good they look in Britain, the government of the day will mess it up. (It
sometimes looks as if those who operate British monetary policy share this
pessimistic creed - though happily not this weekend.) As long as this view
lingers, it will be impossible for British short rates to fall below German
rates without undermining the pound; and since Germany's problems look real
and formidable, this is sad news for the depressed UK economy.
The Bank of England now seems at least willing to test the market for
ever-narrower sterling-D-Mark interest differentials. But the professional
view in the money markets is that it will still take months, and possibly
years, for foreign holders to accept the idea that if they want to hold a
sound, stable currency like sterling rather than the risk-prone mark, they
must be ready to lose some income.

Names a better deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss ALPA RAJA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an undergraduate at City of London Polytechnic, I took on the task
as part of my third-year thesis of doing an analysis of the problems Lloyd's
of London insurance market is facing. I concluded that the following
recommendations might be feasible: 100 per cent is too high for stop loss;
the limit should be two-thirds of overall premium limit;
A diversification rule should be made compulsory of a limit of 10 per cent
on each syndicate to limit large losses;
Profit-related pay for underwriters should be introduced in an attempt to
cut costs;
Efficiency of markets can be achieved through consolidation of syndicate
agencies;
Corporate Names should be encouraged. These would give the existing Names
the option to participate with limited liability in companies that have
analysts who can advise on the best syndicates. This would undoubtedly
improve profitability for Names;
Lloyd's should be regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry and NOT
be self-regulated. This would sustain public assurance and attract more
potential names;
Computer technology must be introduced in the market-place, with brokers and
underwriters transmitting business via screens. Specialist business could
continue on a face-to-face basis. Labour costs would be reduced drastically;
Two-year, rather than three-year accounting should be introduced to make the
system more efficient;
The position of Names should be improved; ie they should have more access to
syndicate information through regular circulars;
Lloyd's must ensure there is a reasonable spread of internal and external
names on all syndicates whereby ALL syndicates must have a maximum 30 per
cent of internal names;
The Council of Lloyd's should consist of an 80 per cent majority of external
representatives, acting totally independently since the present situation
proves to be too cosy.
I am sure such recommendations will be warmly received by those Names who
have suffered heavy losses.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your headline read 'PM rejects European super state' (April 29).
Doesn't any one think it in the least odd that while Mr Major, the prime
minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, continue to reject a
United States of Europe in the federal mould, Tory members of the European
parliament are, apparently, individually joining the Christian Democrats,
the European peoples party?
The objects of this people's party (EPP) include pursuing 'the process of
federal unification and integration in Europe and . . . the realisation of
United States of Europe'.
Odder still that the EPP expects them to stand as Christian Democrats at the
next European elections in 1994.
The EPP claims to be 'The Heart of Europe'. That is where Mr Major says he
wants to be. Coincidence? Or is the Tory party about to change its name?

FT  02 MAY 92 / Man in the news: Jurgen Mollemann - Hand that rocked the
coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The banner headline in Bild Zeitung said it all. 'You scheming swine]' it
screamed on Thursday morning.
The words were supposed to have been those of Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the
luckless woman who for one brief day was set to become Germany's foreign
minister, before her nomination was overturned in a palace coup inside her
own Free Democratic Party (FDP).
The target of her purported rage was Mr Jurgen Mollemann, her close
colleague as economics minister, her rival as future leader of the party,
and the man she considered most to have betrayed her.
Mrs Schwaetzer has since insisted that she never used the words but few in
Bonn would be surprised that she may have been sorely tempted. In this
political hothouse, where conspiracy theorists abound, many believe that the
hand of an arch-conspirator like Mr Mollemann was behind the apparent chaos
which overtook Germany's ruling coalition during the past week. The other
'old fox' who few believe was blameless was Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher
himself, the man who started the whole crisis by announcing his sudden
resignation as foreign minister on Monday.
Most members of the government and the ruling establishment have done badly
from the confusion. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is seen again as a weak leader,
unable to impose his will on unstable coalition partners; Mr Otto
Lambsdorff, leader of the FDP, is under pressure to resign for failing to
control his party; Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the
Christian Social Union, the third partner in the coalition, was simply
irrelevant to the whole affair, stuck in Washington at the International
Monetary Fund.
Mr Mollemann, however, has come out of it with the extra title of
vice-chancellor, and nicely placed, it would appear, to take over the party
leadership from Mr Lambsdorff whenever he goes. His only serious rival will
be Mr Klaus Kinkel, the new foreign minister.
It was typical of Mr Mollemann that his latest political initiative, a new
move for drastic budget cuts to curb the swelling public sector deficit,
should have leaked out at precisely the same moment. In it he hinted
strongly at the weak leadership of the chancellor, implied that Mr Waigel
had got his figures wrong, and moved swiftly himself to occupy the moral
high ground, calling not least for cuts in (western) social spending.
Mr Mollemann is a strange mixture: a notorious self-publicist, dapper and
glib, who models himself on Mr Genscher, his mentor, and yet has failed to
achieve the same popularity. When he was appointed economics minister in
January, 1991, the business sector audibly groaned. Since then he has
demonstrated a knack for choosing the right issues, showing no fear of
confrontation with his colleagues, and thus remaining well in front of the
political game.
He is still not taken entirely seriously in the Bonn establishment as a
copper-bottomed politician, and yet he has risen inexorably through the
ranks. Aged 47 (born two months after the end of the war), he trained as a
teacher, served his call-up as a parachutist (a bit of machismo repeated in
every curriculum vitae), and swiftly became a member of the Bundestag in
1972 at the age of 27.
It was 1982 before he was brought into government by Mr Genscher, as his
deputy at the Foreign Office. In 1987 he got his own ministry, Culture and
Science, and in 1991 - against the opposition, not least, of Mr Lambsdorff -
seized the Economics Ministry, the FDP's second most important portfolio.
In the short time he has been there, he has succeeded in revitalising a
moribund department, grabbing the headlines, and forcing its views on the
rest of the government. His civil servants, who regarded his arrival with
trepidation, now credit him with a laudable capacity to read his briefs,
master the issues and, if he must, exploit them for personal publicity.
Thus he plunged in first with Aufschwung Ost - Upswing East - the DM12bn
(Pounds 4bn) programme to pump desperately needed extra cash into east
Germany. Then he turned round and demanded drastic budget cuts in the west -
DM10bn off government subsidies or he would resign - to keep the budget
deficit under control.
He has also long been the most outspoken member of the government in
insisting that a stern line must be held against excessive wage awards - a
'four before the comma', or less than 5 per cent, was his slogan long before
Mr Kohl and the rest took it up.
Yet the PR is often more impressive than the outcome. The DM10bn in subsidy
cuts was watered down drastically in the German Bundestag, and Mr Mollemann
never resigned. A much vaunted breakthrough on the Gatt negotiations - when
he thought he had turned round the German cabinet, and outmanoeuvred the
agriculture minister, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, to throw full German support behind
a deal in the Gatt negotiations - has failed to push Mr Kohl far enough to
deliver a deal.
He is still not that popular with the business community. 'He is too much of
a schoolmaster,' according to one Bonn-based lobbyist. 'He is too
theoretical and inflexible.' Thus he is seen as responsible for Germany's
draconian export controls, including the proposal for customs officers to
tap telephones, outraging businessmen and libertarians.
He is a risk-taker to the end. The question is whether this week he achieved
his breakthrough to the big time, or whether he overstepped himself. Mrs
Schwaetzer was bitter because he urged her to go for the Genscher job, and
leave the way open for his claim to the party leadership. Yet when the party
revolted, he switched sides, and voted for Mr Kinkel.
It is Mr Kinkel who may yet prove his undoing. For the new foreign minister
is tough and practical, and his job will give him lots of publicity. He does
not feel bound to abstain from the contest for party leadership next year,
as Mrs Schwaetzer did. So Mr Mollemann may yet be pipped at the post. It
would not be for want of trying.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Upheaval on the high street: The contest over Midland is
just one element of the sweeping changes taking place in British banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, Lloyds Bank, in publishing its terms for the acquisition of
Midland Bank, proposed to disturb the structure of the high street banking
industry after almost a quarter of a century of stability.
Time has brought about a curious reversal of the roles. In January 1968 it
was the then chairman of Midland, Sir Archibald Forbes, who called around at
Lloyds to propose a closer association. He was frostily received. Instead,
Lloyds made a bid for Martins Bank, which failed. Midland may now draw some
comfort from Lloyds' historical lack of success as a predator: in 1986 its
offer for Standard Chartered was also abortive.
The turmoil of 1968 created the industry's present shape. Westminster merged
with National Provincial to create NatWest, and Barclays absorbed the then
number six bank, Martins, after a grand scheme to wrap Barclays, Lloyds and
Martins together fell foul of a Monopolies Commission investigation.
Midland, then number two, was the wallflower in all this.
The decline of Midland over many years to its current position as struggling
number four is only one of the factors which is triggering the latest
shake-up. With profitability under severe pressure from external competition
and the wave of bad debts, all the Big Four are cutting staff and
rationalising their branch networks. Lloyds is by far the strongest
financially, and sees an opportunity to reduce capacity more efficiently by
taking over Midland. At the same time, this would block the attempt by an
overseas bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to buy its way
into the inner circle of English clearing banking.
Headlong expansion during the 1980s, when bank deposits and lending soared
and the staff numbers employed by the Big Four climbed from 229,000 in 1980
to a peak of 282,000 in 1989, obscured crucial questions about how the
introverted management culture of the clearing banks could cope with
deregulation. An industry familiar with cartels and official controls was
faced with vastly greater competition and risks. In the past two years, as
profits have crashed, its leaders have begun to face the consequences.
Lloyds has been the sharpest in its response, focusing on its return on
capital, and cutting its staff numbers by 8,500 in 1991 alone. It claims
that the 20,000 jobs threatened by the Lloyds-Midland merger would only
represent the inevitable continuation of this trend. All the banks are now
planning to shed many thousands of jobs and hundreds of branches.
Until the 1980s, the banks had been accustomed to operating in a highly
restricted environment. Before the Conservatives arrived in 1979, for
instance, bank balance sheets were constrained by the so-called 'corset' on
deposits. Bank profit margins were fattened by the so-called endowment
effect of high interest rates related to the double-digit level of
inflation.
With deregulation, however, tough competitors appeared and feasted eagerly
on the soft underbelly of clearing bank business. The building societies
creamed off savings accounts by offering competitive rates, while in
corporate banking American and Japanese banks were ready to offer money at
very fine rates.
New technology has threatened to change the nature of banking. A
proliferation of magnetic cards, hole-in-the-wall machines and telephone
banking services has opened new opportunities but has also destroyed tried
and tested banking conventions. This process will continue at an
accelerating rate and is another reason for the rapid rundown of the branch
networks which were once seen as fundamental to the success of retail banks.
The management challenges have been immense. There has been a severe test
for the classic clearing banker, who will have joined straight from school
at 16, done his banking exams, and progressed up the ladder through the
branches. Once, the best of the bunch would have emerged in their fifties
into a secure, hierarchical world at head office for a comfortable few years
at the top. Instead, in recent years top clearing bankers have been plunged
into a world for which they were unprepared by their experience in branch
banking - a world of aggressive marketing, leading-edge technology and
global acquisitions. In choosing a new chief executive a few weeks ago,
NatWest missed a stratum of more traditional contenders for the succession
and opted instead for a 44-year-old Cambridge graduate.
Perhaps the biggest single problem for bankers is assessing lending risk in
a competitive market place. Bad debts have been climbing for years, and in
1991 the Big Four wrote off an amazing Pounds 5.6bn. Banks responded to the
new freedoms of the 1980s by scrambling competitively for market share
without recognising that the game had changed. They need to develop some new
prudential rules.
If the Big Four shrink to the Big Three, does it matter to the public? In
most respects not at all, although there may be some minor inconvenience if
your favourite local branch puts the shutters up. Retail banking is already
highly competitive and most people these days can get all the banking
services they need from a building society as well as a bank.
There is one highly sensitive area, however. Small businesses rely on local
bank branches and have nowhere else to go. This is the one sector of the
market where 'relationship banking' is still important. The small
businessman needs to build up the confidence of his local bank manager and
it is difficult for him to shop around. It is also difficult for new banks
to break into the market - as TSB, for instance, would like to do - because
they would tend to pick up the most untried, dissatisfied or troublesome
customers.
The disappearance of Midland would reduce choice. The risks are probably not
serious, but small businessmen are vociferous in protest. The small business
lobby is particularly angry at Lloyds, which is seen as having been
especially insensitive to push up charges and lending margins last year in
the middle of the recession. These business customers argue that they are
being made to pay for the mistakes made by the banks elsewhere, especially
in their big corporate bad debts. The bankers say, however, that charges
have had to go up to make this area of their activity profitable. No doubt
the Monopolies Commission, if it is called in, will probe some of these
claims. But the row forms part of a general problem in that the clearing
banks are being forced to raise and rebalance their charges in order to
adjust to competitive pressures and restore profitability. For instance,
some banks are now charging Pounds 2 to cash cheques for non-customers. The
public, which has often had an unrealistic idea of what it should pay for
banking services, is offended.
In the past, it was easy for clearing banks to pocket most of their income
in the form of largely hidden spreads between lending and borrowing rates.
Cross-subsidy then became the name of the game: services ranging from cheque
cashing to visits to the bank manager were thrown in for nothing.
Competition with non-banks and foreign banks has upset this cosy
arrangement, however. Squeezed on their lending margins, clearing banks have
been forced to examine costs in detail.
This explains the frequent claim by bankers that Britain is 'overbanked',
although branch networks were shrinking even during the buoyant 1980s;
accountants now study each branch's costs whereas in the past the bankers
only really looked at the volume of business which it would generate. Small
business accounts are victims of this process. On the other hand, customers
with savings accounts are getting a much better deal from the clearing banks
than they used to.
Big specialist competitors like Abbey National (now rivalling Lloyds for the
title of Britain's most profitable bank) and Halifax Building Society cover
the country with only a quarter of the number of branches of the big
clearers.
At least competition for corporate business has eased somewhat, now that the
Japanese banks have adopted a much lower profile. Corporate lending margins
have widened significantly. But the ability of the clearing banks to service
the top end of the corporate market has been permanently damaged by the
impact of deregulation on the risk profile of the big banks. They have all
lost the AAA credit rating they once enjoyed - Barclays was downgraded only
last week - and it is now cheaper for top-rank companies to borrow direct
from the money markets.
What is banking, anyway? It is a collection of businesses that have been
bundled together in the past but today, in different circumstances, are
often being profitably segmented. Why should retail banks expect to serve
business customers out of the same premises, for instance? And what have the
processing skills needed to handle millions of bits of paper got to do with
the ability to sell investment plans? Often the glue holding all this
together has been the branch network, but the economics of it are now being
rethought.
In their drive to cut costs, the clearing banks are looking at radical
measures, albeit short of full mergers: for instance, whether they should
pool their cheque-clearing facilities.
In a way, it is surprising that the era of the Big Four has survived for as
long as 24 years - and if the Hongkong Bank has its way, may last for a
while longer still. After all, there is today no equivalent of the Treasury
Minute of 1920 which halted the wave of banking mergers up to that point.
The Monopolies Commission was far from unanimous in coming down against the
Barclays-Lloyds-Martins leviathan in 1968. The Bank of England is officially
neutral on mergers, but as the banking industry's statutory regulator it can
be expected to be in favour of changes which strengthen banking
profitability and remove weak links.
There is much more competition in banking today than there was in 1968. But
the clearing banks have too high a profile and have made too many public
relations blunders for Lloyds to have an easy ride.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Blood, sweat and Euro-tears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLICKER of a smirk may well have passed across the the face of even the
most ardent Germanophile and committed European during the past week. Seeing
the political establishment of much admired and increasingly imitated
Germany face large-scale public sector strikes reminds one of Britain in the
1970s or France in the late 1960s. But any morbid satisfaction at this
apparent humbling of an economic giant is misplaced. A weakened and
strife-ridden Germany spells danger for the stability and prosperity of the
entire continent.
It would be hard to imagine a more difficult and risky time for the European
Community to integrate the entire European continent. But that is what it is
attempting to do, by widening the scope of its activities and possibly
membership to include eastern Europe and the rest of western Europe and
simultaneously by strengthening ties between its current members.
Western Europe could not, of course, choose the timing of the disintegration
of the communist bloc. To complain about it, or simply to have ignored it,
would have been both churlish and foolhardy. The opportunity to tie eastern
Europe into the west had to be taken when it arose, a fact that Germany was
quickest to grasp.
The failure of the German political elite was not to move too fast to
reunify Germany, but to conceal from the west German public the scale of the
necessary sacrifices. When speeches stressing blood, sweat and tears were
needed, Mr Helmut Kohl offered only blithe optimism. The subsequent east
German economic collapse has been cushioned by massive west German transfers
financed by higher taxes and downward pressure on real wages in the west:
hence the strikes.
Harsh apprenticeship
Ironically, it is precisely when the weaknesses of Germany's inflexible
system are being exposed that the rest of Europe has decided to embrace
certain aspects of it on a pan-European scale. The momentum behind
transforming a quasi-Germanic monetary system, the European exchange rate
mechanism, into Germany writ large, European monetary union, remains too
strong to resist. But no one, certainly neither France nor Italy, could have
appreciated at the outset quite how harsh their apprenticeship would turn
out to be, largely because a period of tight German monetary policy has
exported slow growth and high unemployment across Europe.
Yet having come this far, Europe has little option but to persevere.
Accelerating the move to monetary union is politically impossible, however
much France would like to get its hands on the monetary levers. Germany in
its current state is not going to cede control over the D-Mark. The lurking
suspicion that Germany will never be happy to do so, whether or not it
ratifies the Maastricht treaty, must haunt the dreams of French finance
ministers, past and present.
Nor is any government able to advocate a retreat from the Maastricht
timetable; and an ERM realignment, however desirable two years ago, would
not deliver lower European interest rates. The more likely route to lower
rates would be for the ERM to crumble following further rises in German
interest rates.
Gritted teeth
More likely, Europe will grit its teeth and bear the pain. Germany will
suffer angry complaints from its partners until it puts its fiscal house in
order. But the prospect for sharply lower German interest rates this year or
even next is still poor.
The 'blood, sweat and tears' option is not without grave risks. Slow growth
and rising unemployment are nurturing far right parties in both France and
Germany; and Italy looks more precariously placed than at any time in its
recent history. The task it faces in bringing its fiscal deficit under
control to meet the Emu convergence criteria would be daunting enough for
the most stable of governments. But with no president, no government and no
growth, Italy could be heading for a financial disaster.
The UK appears to offer an oasis of political stability; and, unlike France,
it has room for a modest interest rate cut. But the recovery has yet to
materialise; and the combination of high real interest rates and heavy
household debts means it may well be sluggish when it does.
Sadly, an economically depressed and strife-torn Europe is unlikely to be
able to rise to the political challenges it faces in the east. The miserly
and protectionist association agreements with Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia do not bode well for eastern Europe's future.
The EC, instead, risks retreating further from the liberal and progressive
goals it claims to hold dear. The result of last week's machinations over
support for Europe's troubled car industry suggests that the EC may be
shuffling towards an 'industrial policy' of shoring up lame ducks. Continued
slow growth will mean a plethora of limping candidates. Many political
obituaries of Mrs Edith Cresson labelled her a product of a past age.
Keeping her ghost in check may yet turn out to be a substantial task.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Nuclear Electric to shed 800 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned generator for England and Wales, is to
shed a further 800 jobs this year, Mr John Collier, its chairman, said
yesterday.
The company now employs 12,600 people after shedding 1,600 jobs in the past
two years. Nuclear Electric plans a programme of cost savings by 1998, when
it will cease to receive the nuclear levy - a Pounds 1bn charge on
electricity consumers to compensate for the higher cost of generating power
from non-fossil fuels. The EC has ordered the end of the levy on the grounds
that it is an unfair subsidy in a free market.
Mr Collier said the number of power stations operated by Nuclear Electric
was likely to fall from 12 to between six and eight - all pressurised water
reactors - by 2015 or 2020. Sizewell B in Suffolk, Britain's first
pressurised water reactor station, is due to be commissioned in 1994. From
the mid 1990s Nuclear Electric will begin closing its ageing Magnox
reactors.
Mr Collier said he hoped after the government review of nuclear economics in
1994 to be given the go-ahead to build two further stations using the
Sizewell B design. He is to meet Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, next week.
One of the stations would be Sizewell C and the other Hinkley Point C in
Somerset. Planning permission has already been obtained for Hinkley pending
the outcome of the government review.
Mr Collier expected an agreement by the year 2000 between the UK, France and
Germany on the design of an advanced pressurised water reactor.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Mellor to oversee lottery bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Mellor's national heritage department has taken over the main
legislative responsibility for the National Lotteries Bill.
The Home Office is expected to have residual responsibilities under gaming
legislation, but Mr Mellor and his department - whose work the lottery is
intended to help fund - will steer the bill through the Commons.
Mr Mellor, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, believes that a
national lottery could produce as much as Pounds 1bn a year to support
cultural and sporting life in the UK and improve crumbling and outdated
buildings such as sports stadiums.
It was also announced earlier this week that Mr Mellor would take over the
government's continuing interest in press standards and regulation. The
government is due this summer to review the performance of the Press
Complaints Commission, set up after the Calcutt Committee investigation into
privacy to replace the Press Council.
The Home Office is expected to retain its responsibility for issues such as
data protection.
Changes in departmental responsibilities involving the biggest shake-up
Whitehall has experienced for many years were announced yesterday, writes
Ivor Owen.
They give effect to the proposals in the Conservative party's election
manifesto, but no date has yet been set for the transfer of responsibility
for oversight and regulation of the financial-services sector and investor
protection to the Treasury.
The timing of the change will be announced in a Transfer of Functions Order
which is likely to be debated in the Commons.
Responsibility for company investigations will remain with the Serious Fraud
Office and the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Watchdog rejects change on council swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Audit Commission, the government's public expenditure watchdog, has
rejected calls for a change in the powers of councils that would allow them
to enter into interest-rate swap contracts.
A Bank of England committee had urged the change in response to widespread
concern in the City after the law Lords ruled last year in a case involving
Hammersmith and Fulham in London that councils did not have the authority to
enter into such transactions. The ruling left 80 banks facing losses
totalling Pounds 560m on interest-rate swap transactions with 130 councils
in England and Wales. The commission says, in its response to a consultation
paper issued by the Bank's legal risk review committee in February, that it
would prefer the government to spell out on a case-by-case basis the types
of transaction open to councils.
The committee under Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank,
argued that the ultra vires doctrine - the rule that transactions outside
the capacity of one of the parties involved are void - was unfair and led to
uncertainty.
The committee argued that poll-tax payers were adequately protected by
provisions about authorisation and ostensible authority. Abolishing the
doctrine would place those dealing with councils in the same position as
those dealing with limited-liability companies.
The commission says, however, that there are important differences between
councils and companies, and that poll-tax payers need the protection offered
by the doctrine.
It says the Alexander committee's proposal would 'largely remove the risk
from parties dealing with local authorities and transfer it to local
taxpayers who are unable to to take any steps to protect themselves from the
sort of situation which arose at Hammersmith and Fulham and elsewhere in
relation to swaps'.
Elimination of the ultra vires option would put pressure on auditors to use
powers of judicial review or to issue a prohibition on suspect transactions,
the commission adds. The result might be a fresh spate of
creative-accounting schemes of doubtful legality and prudence.
'Some London councils are still paying a heavy price for having entered into
such schemes in the 1980s,' it says.
The commission proposes clarification of the law where areas of uncertainty
arise.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Coal sell-off 'may hurt BR freight'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISING British Coal could damage prospects for selling British Rail's
bulk freight operation, according to Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter,
John Willman writes.
The Queen's Speech next week is expected to include legislation on
privatising British coal and BR.
BR privatisation will be achieved in stages, with profitable divisions such
as Railfreight and Trainload Freight sold first.
But Coal UK warns that the marketability of Trainload Freight could be
threatened if further pits were closed to make British Coal attractive
enough for privatisation.
Almost two thirds of Trainload Freight income comes from moving coal to
power stations and other user plant. Coal UK predicts that movements could
fall by more than half to 35m tonnes by 1995 and a further 10m to 20m tonnes
by the end of the decade.
The tonnage shipped by Trainload Freight has already fallen by 20 per cent
over the last 10 years as a result of pit closures.
Further closures of around half the remaining pits - just under 50 in number
 -are likely by the end of the decade if British Coal is to be profitable.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Terms of gas auction criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS yesterday released details of the gas it will sell to
competitors as part of its agreement with the Office of Fair Trading to
halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995.
But rival suppliers expressed their dissatisfaction over the handling of the
proposed gas auction and said it could put the creation of a long-term
competitive market for gas at risk.
'It will interfere in the market and attract lots of short-term players
which could let down their customers once they run out of gas,' said Mr
Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, an independent gas supplier.
British Gas said it would sell 500m therms of gas in October and was
inviting rivals to bid for the quantity of gas they required.
The sale price will be based on the average cost of gas to British Gas as
well as a wholesaling margin of 0.25p a therm and an allowance for costs.
Critics of the deal say British Gas should not be allowed to make money from
its undertaking to reduce its market share.
Mr Ellis said the gas should be offered to existing participants in the
market to help them through an immediate gas shortage in the next couple of
years.
The problem for competitors to British Gas is that there is not much gas
available in the market until 1995. Most rivals have signed contracts for
delivery of gas after that.
British Gas said it would release 400m therms for the year 1993-94, 300m
therms the following year and 200m therms in 1995-96. Each applicant for gas
will receive a minimum of 10m therms.

<TEXT>
SIR DENYS Henderson, ICI chairman, yesterday defended his company's
environmental record at an annual general meeting disrupted by supporters of
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group.
Sir Denys said ICI, the UK's largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
which are blamed for depleting the earth's ozone layer, was committed to
phasing out production as quickly as possible.
He told shareholders that the group was encouraging customers to switch to
alternatives such as Klea 134a. It had increased CFC recycling facilities,
although they were not being used as extensively as had been hoped. And it
supported a government initiative to identify the minimum quantity of CFCs
required to meet essential UK needs.
Greenpeace opposes the use of Klea 134a, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, which it
argues is also an ozone-depleting gas.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Underwriters oppose Lloyd's arbitration plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL by Lloyd's of London to resolve future disputes between agencies
and Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the insurance
market - outside the courts is meeting opposition from within the market.
The Lloyd's council - the market's governing body - passed an enabling
by-law earlier this week paving the way for the introduction of a mandatory
arbitration process.
Lloyd's agreed last year to establish an arbitration scheme for big
disputes. But urgency was given to the proposals, which could form part of a
scheme to help the market's worst-hit Names, when Mr Alan Lord, chief
executive, confirmed on Thursday that the council is investigating a
possible plan which would help Names who suffered most from losses in 1989
and 1990.
Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, has said that moves to help the
market's 'walking wounded' would need to be accompanied by measures to stem
litigation between Names and their agents. More than 2,000 of the market's
22,400 Names are involved in legal actions.
However, a number of leading underwriters - who insure businesses against
legal awards for negligence - are opposed to the plan.
Mr Alec Sharp, a leading errors-and-omissions underwriter with syndicate
839, managed by Castle Underwriting, says that if the scheme goes ahead
agents would be unable to obtain errors-and-omissions insurance and could be
exposed to financial problems.
Lloyd's was 'isolating managing agents from the normal insurance protections
available to financial institutions. If you have a syndicate that makes a
mess of something the entire agency is going to be on the line,' said Mr
Sharp. 'The costs of arbitration had in the past exceeded those spent in the
courts.' Lloyd's was responding to problems too late, he added. 'It is
shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.'
Mr Sharp also ruled out any possibility of errors-and-omissions underwriters
contributing to a fund which would compensate those Names who forgo their
right to seek compensation through the law.
'For anybody to get think that E&amp;O underwriters will get their chequebook
out for the benefit of the market is very very naive,' Mr Sharp added. 'Our
reinsurers would not pay up and our Names would sue. It's a vicious circle.'
Underwriters and agents are also unhappy about other elements of the efforts
to help Names. Some members' agents believe that most Names will refuse to
agree to pay an extra levy to finance the losses of other Names. Other
agents believe that the council should be doing more to alleviate cashflow
problems.
'Lloyd's is burying its head in the sand. We need some mechanism to put up
working capital,' said the chief executive of one agency, who believes
liquidity problems will be aggravated when the scale of 1989 losses -
currently estimated at Pounds 1.35bn - are revealed.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Violence in the US: Final blot on record of insensitive
police chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of
the most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack for
fuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black
neighbourhoods.
Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed by
the scale of the violence. Police could only look on, outnumbered, as crowds
looted shops, and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack.
The controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday, the
first night of rioting, against sending in National Guard troops, and only
to have bowed later to evidence that his police force was incapable of
handling the violence.
That the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by the
riots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on Mr Gates's
reputation.
In his 14 years of office, his critics say he has built a heavily
politicised force in his own image: aggressive, insensitive and widely
tinged with racism.
Shortly after his appointment in 1978, Mr Gates told a Hispanic audience
that Hispanic officers were not promoted because they were lazy, and he
later suggested that the carotid choke hold - a police technique severely
curbed in 1983 after police had killed 16 suspects with it - might be more
dangerous for blacks because their arteries did not open up as fast as on
'normal people'.
In March, Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led an
investigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angeles
police officer, although a judge had just released the two men wrongfully
convicted, calling police conduct 'reprehensible' and urging an immediate
investigation of the 'sordid record'.
The detective involved now heads the unit which investigates shootings
involving police officers.
But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removal
under a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and Mr
Gates has developed political clout on top of this job security.
President George Bush last year called Mr Gates 'an exemplary police chief,'
although at the time he called the conduct of the four Los Angeles officers
 -whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggered
this week's protests and violence - 'sickening' and 'outrageous'.
A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under the
chairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretary
of state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, in
terms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates the
officer from the community'.
Besides recommending that Mr Gates should go, the Christopher commission
urged a policy of community policing with more foot patrols, as well as
measures to discipline racist police officers and to improve the
investigation of complaints about police brutality.
The commission found that a significant minority of the Los Angeles police
force 'repetitively misuse force' without being properly disciplined.
Six months after its initial report, however, the commission noted that of
the 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutality
complaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from field
duty.
Mr Gates has finally agreed to step down in June. His replacement, Mr Willie
Williams, will be the first black head of the Los Angeles force.
Mr Williams faces an uphill struggle, but he has drawn widespread praise as
Philadelphia's police commissioner since 1988 for mending fences between the
police and the community - notably through the use of the foot patrol
methods recommended by the Christopher commission.

FT  02 MAY 92 / East Germans find their homes are no longer their castles:
Many live in fear of being forced out by their western neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KLEINMACHNOW, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRED HAUPT hanged himself from a tree outside his small wooden house in east
Berlin this week. He was found by the bailiff who had come to evict him.
His is the second east German suicide within a month related to properties
lived in by east Germans but claimed by west Germans. Mr Detlef Dalk, a
local politician, from the east Berlin suburb of Zepernick where Mr Haupt
lived, killed himself after his house was claimed by a west German. Mr Dalk
left an open letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl protesting at the government's
principle of returning eastern property to western owners instead of
indemnifying them.
East Germans occupying more than 1m houses and apartments claimed by
westerners have been plagued by similar worries. Confrontation over the
contested properties has done more to alienate 'Wessies' and 'Ossies' than
any other development since unification in October 1990.
Demands by west Germans for access to 'our homes' have been met by east
German signs proclaiming the properties 'out of bounds for Wessies'.
Mr Wilfried Wahner and his wife Ingeborg say they live in perpetual fear of
the west German owners of the house they have rented from the state for 32
years. They claim the owners are using every means to evict them, and blame
their predicament on German unity.
'At first we were happy about unification but now we feel victims of an
attack,' Mr Wahner said. During the owner's long absence, Mr Wahner repaired
the roof, built a garage, and meticulously tended the garden, at a time when
building materials were obtainable only on the black market.
The Wahners live in Kleinmachnow, a leafy east German suburb of west Berlin
with 11,000 residents. Until 1989 the town, whose streets ended at the
Berlin Wall, was known locally as the 'end of the world'. Now 66 per cent of
the houses have claims on them by former western owners.
When a representative of the owners first visited the Wahners in early 1990,
he assured them they would be allowed to remain in the house permanently.
The following spring, the first eviction notice arrived ordering the Wahners
to vacate the house within 10 days. 'It is ruining my nerves,' said Mr
Wahner, a 65-year-old former electrical engineer.
Despite assurances by the local tenants' association that the couple could
not be evicted under the terms of the unification treaty, the heirs
threatened them with legal action, claiming they had not paid the rent, a
charge they deny. 'We expected capitalism to be more social but it is awful
for many of us,' Mr Wahner concluded.
East German houses are frequently sold by the west German owners to other
westerners who, in Kleinmachnow, will typically pay up to DM700,000 (Pounds
238,095) for a small house and are then faced with sitting tenants paying a
rent-controlled DM300 a month.
While the rent has doubled since last year, it is only one-seventh of that
for a similar house in west Berlin. The westerners hope they can either
eventually evict the tenants or raise the rent. 'The conflicts of interest
are awful,' Mr Klaus Nitzsche, mayor of Kleinmachnow, said. 'New owners
harass the tenants who regard their homes as social housing.'
Mr Horst Abraham of the tenants' association in Kleinmachnow said the
prospects for the Wahners and others will depend on whether the protection
against eviction guaranteed by the unification treaty expires this year as
planned. He warned that, if it is not extended, owners will issue wholesale
notices of eviction saying they need the houses. East Germans forced to
leave their homes will have little chance of finding affordable flats as
virtually no new lower rental housing is being built.
Houses which belonged to Jews forced to leave Nazi Germany after 1935 often
have several conflicting claims on them. They were expropriated and usually
sold to Nazis, then expropriated again in 1945 and resold, often several
times, to people who later left east Germany. The heirs of the original
Jewish owners have been told by the government they will eventually get the
houses if they submit claims. But this can take years.
People such as the Wahners were assigned their house by the state after the
owner had left for the west. Although the owner retained title to the
property, the house was taken over by a state trusteeship agency into whose
special accounts, protected against withdrawals by the owner, the tenant
paid his extremely low rent.
East Germans had the right to buy the houses from the state. Those who did
before October 18, 1989, the day Mr Erich Honecker, the east German leader,
resigned, were deemed by the German government to have 'honestly' bought
their homes and cannot be dispossessed by former owners in the west.
The cut-off date was designed to stop former Communist officials and company
directors, who had an inside track on obtaining state properties, from
keeping the real estate they purchased after this date. But many an official
villa was sold cheaply to influential east Germans after October 1989.
Even those easterners who bought their houses before the cut-off have not
been spared headaches. Their house purchases did not include title to the
property on which the home stood, which under east German law remained
state-owned.
Many former western owners have submitted claims to get back these
properties, if not the houses on them. Bonn is considering a solution
whereby easterners will be able to keep their houses as hereditary tenants.
But this is of little help to tenants of contested houses such as the
Wahners who see themselves as the losers of history.

GERMANY last night led a strong push inside the European Community to
withhold recognition of the new joint Serb-Montenegrin state as the
successor to the old Yugoslavia, in an attempt to get the Serb army out of
Bosnia.
EC foreign ministers are to devote most of their meeting here today to
Yugoslavia. But even at the outset of yesterday's discussions, a German
spokesman said Bonn would also be seeking United Nations action on trade and
oil sanctions against Serbia.
Britain echoed the general sentiment that, by declaring a new state,
President Slobadan Milosevic of Serbia has given the Community a certain
diplomatic leverage over him. 'It would seem that Mr Milosevic is more
concerned about recognition and status than he is about his economy'.
Greece's prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitzotakis came in for criticism for
arriving at this weekend's meeting via Belgrade where he appeared to confer
de facto recognition on the new Yugoslav state.
On Macedonia, the EC ministers seemed agreed to respect, Greece's strong
views.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Bush seeks go-ahead for Chile free trade pact: Treaty would
be important step to goal of trading bloc covering the Americas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush is expected to ask Congress for permission to negotiate a
free trade agreement with Chile during a visit to Washington by Chilean
President Patricio Aylwin which starts on May 13.
The pact would be the first between the US and a South American country and
an important stepping stone towards President Bush's goal of a free trade
bloc covering the Americas.
Politically, it would send a message to the stalled Gatt negotiations that,
as with the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the US will not sit
and wait for liberalised trade.
Congressman Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican and a prime Congressional mover
behind the Nafta, said the president was likely to move quickly on Chile
while he still had Congressional authorisation for 'fast track' negotiating
authority.
This allows him to submit a trade agreement to Congress for a yes or no vote
with no amendments allowed. His power to use 'fast track' expires on March 1
next year.
Because of the rapid pace of its economic liberalisation, Chile falls into a
special category of trading partners in Latin America. Other countries in
the region, queued up for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) under the Enterprise
for Americas Initiative, cannot expect such early consideration until their
reforms are further advanced.
Hints that the Chilean negotiations would start soon have recently been
dropped by US Administration officials. Mr David Mulford, the US treasury
under-secretary, last week said the talks should begin within the next two
months. Chile has since April last year declared an FTA with the US to be
top priority. A free trade agreement with Chile is considered relatively
uncontroversial in the US. Unlike Mexico, its total population of 13m is not
seen as threatening to US jobs. The economies are highly complementary. Two
way trade in 1990 reached Dollars 2.84bn, (Pounds 1.6bn), 18 per cent of
Chile's foreign trade.
The greatest beneficiaries are expected to be American mining equipment
companies which would gain an advantage in the competition for the almost
100 major mining projects being developed in the country. Chile already has
a FTA with Mexico, the first bilateral pact in Latin America signed in
September last year.
Congressman Kolbe said President Bush must give Congress 60 days in which to
challenge his intention to negotiate with Chile. Such a pact would be
comparatively easy to negotiate and could be submitted for Congressional
approval early next year. The Administration has until March 1, 1993, to
notify Congress of its intention to use 'fast track'.

Mr Demirel was expected to sign agreements on road transport, civil

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil) yesterday said holders of 60 per
cent of its shares would reject an ADollars 127m (Dollars 96m) takeover
offer from Rossington Holdings, a bid vehicle jointly owned by two companies
associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur.
The board did not identify the shareholders who have undertaken to reject
the offer. However, about 60 per cent of the company is effectively
controlled by Australian banks.
About 40 per cent of Acil is owned by companies formerly controlled by Mr
Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur. A further 19.9 per cent is
owned by the Adelaide Steamship group, which is being restructured by its
banks.
Acil said shareholders who accepted the offer would be giving a 'substantial
amount of money away to Rossington.' Shareholders who accept the offer will
also lose their rights to participate in the forthcoming float of Weeks
Royalties.
Acil said the Rossington offer was highly conditional and could not succeed
in its present form. The offer is conditional on AustCon not selling its 50
per cent of National Brewing Holdings, formerly Bond Brewing.
The board says Acil is contractually bound to complete the sale of the
breweries to Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewing group.
The directors say it has taken more than two years to achieve the 'complex
and difficult goal' of re-establishing the company after the collapse of the
Bond group.
Rossington is jointly owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand, of which
Sir Ron is a director, and GPG, the UK company which he controls.

<TEXT>
Snecma, the French state-owned aircraft engine company, is expanding its US
interests by taking a majority stake in Speco, one of the world's oldest
aircraft-parts makers.
The companies are still finalising the terms of the deal, under which
Snecma, which already has extensive US interests, would emerge as the
controlling shareholder in Speco. The French company is expected to bring in
at least one other investor as a partner.
Speco, based in Springfield, Ohio, specialises in the production of
helicopter power transmissions, flight control actuator systems and
accessory drive systems. It made a substantial loss last year on sales of
Dollars 36m. It has a workforce of about 300.
When the deal is completed Speco will become part of Valaroche, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Snecma. It will liaise with Hispano-Suiza,
another Snecma susbsidiary, on technical and commercial issues.
Recently Snecma has suffered from the problems of the international
aerospace sector. It recently reported a net loss of FFr68m (Dollars 12.1m)
in 1991, against profits of FFr208m the previous year, on turnover of
FFr23.9bn.
The group also warned that the level of new orders had fallen 30 per cent.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Accounts rule change dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A proposed requirement for companies to list their spending on items such as
advertising and training has been dropped from the forthcoming accounting
standard on the profit and loss account, it emerged yesterday.
The Accounting Standards Board said it would not include so-called revenue
investment activities in its second financial reporting standard, which is
due out in the autumn.
Revenue investment is designed to show expenditure charged to the profit and
loss account incurred to enhance profits. It includes spending on research
and development, and big maintenance and refurbishment projects.
The withdrawal comes after widespread condemnation of the proposal from
companies, which claimed that spending on these items was difficult to
identify, and that disclosure would threaten their competitive position.
But there was also a noticeable absence of support for the idea from users
of accounts during the consultation period on the standard, which closed in
March.
'We flew a kite but no one seemed to want revenue investment,' said Mr David
Tweedie, chairman of the board. 'It got a big raspberry. We don't feel this
is a big enough issue to make it worth retaining.'
In the exposure draft of the standard issued in December, revenue investment
was to be disclosed as a separate item in the profit and loss account.
The board has instead placed the onus on voluntary disclosure of revenue
investment by companies in its operational and financial review, details of
which were released in a discussion draft this week.
Most items which would have been required under the revenue investment
category are not currently disclosed. But companies already have to give
some details of research and development spending under the 1985 Companies
Act and Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 13.
The Institutional Investors' Committee, a body representing institutional
shareholders, earlier this week criticised the level of R&amp;D disclosure.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Sao Paulo - city on a boom-bust roller-coaster ride: Once
the magnet for all types of talent, it represents the fading dream of a
Great Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUTTING through the heart of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, the
Avenida Paulista is home to the headquarters of most of Brazil's banks,
important companies and multinationals, and controls around 39 per cent of
the country's GDP.
Recently commemorating a century of existence, the 'Paulista's' jumble of
concrete skyscrapers, architectural masterpieces, and opulent mansions built
by the coffee barons who constructed the road bears witness to the
development of the Brazilian economy; its mood acts as a barometer on the
prevailing economic situation.
Some call it Brazil's 'island of the First World', a magnet for wealth and
talent and a symbol of what Brazil could be: for others, like President
Fernando Collor, it is a focus of all that is wrong with the country.
He sees it as a notorious den of cartels and monopolies blocking his every
attempt towards introducing a competitive economy, and peopled with
businessmen who, he claims, 'feed their cows with beer and imported
lettuce'.
The main target of Mr Collor's wrath lies at No. 1313. The powerful Sao
Paulo Federation of Industries (FIESP) prospered from the import
substitution policy begun in the 1950s and was, in the boom years of the
1970s, the main engine of growth for Latin America.
Today, frequently at loggerheads with the Collor government, it houses many
'dinosaurs' eager not to allow intruders into what remains one of the
world's most protected economies.
The most common FIESP weapon against the government is to warn of widescale
dismissals and impending social crisis. With Brazil in its worst recession
for a decade, officials are currently threatening mass lay-offs provoked by
the government's tight monetary policy (in effect since September) on top of
last year's 8 per cent drop in employment.
FIESP's lobbying force is, like Brazil's industrialisation, relatively
recent. Today's Paulista, along which 130,000 cars hurtle per hour and
digital pollution monitors read 'BAD' two-thirds of the year, is very
different to the magnolia-lined avenue hewn out of the jungle for the coffee
baron society to perambulate in their carriages.
Yet until only 40 years ago, coffee barons were the country's most powerful
people, coffee comprising 70 per cent of Brazil's exports. And Brazil was a
society which imported almost everything.
Coffee brought commerce, and names on the road's buildings such as Crespi
and Matarozzo register the business success of immigrants who came to Brazil
between 1885 and 1914 in a great global migration from Europe and Asia to
the New World.
More than half the city's population are descended from immigrants, but the
deterioration in the economy means nowadays that there are long queues at
the Italian and Japanese embassies of second- or third-generation
descendants wanting to return to their home countries.
The most recent wave of entrants to the Paulista were banks - more than 120
of them. Housed in some of the most impressive buildings, banks above
anything have prospered in the last decade of chronic inflation and now
represent around 15 per cent of GDP - double that of an average
industrialised economy.
Recently, they have been unusually calm. 'Some weeks we're Ethiopia, others
we're Switzerland. For the last three months we've been Switzerland but now
we're heading back to Ethiopia,' says one banker working on the Paulista. He
was referring to the fact that the 'agio', the difference between the black
market dollar rate and the official rate, and which is usually taken as a
monitor of confidence in the economy, is back up to 10 per cent after four
months at zero.
The disappearance of the 'agio' in December for the first time in 11 years
was less a sign that the Brazilian economy is truly on the road to stability
and more a result of the government's credit crunch. Maintaining the world's
highest interest rates is forcing Brazilians to sell their dollars from
under the mattress or bring in some of the estimated Dollars 50bn (Pounds
28.2bn) they hold abroad in order to pay suppliers and workers.
These days even the banks are unsmiling as the high interest rates push many
of their clients into insolvency - more in 1991 than in the previous two
(also recessive) years combined. Gloomier still are the Paulista's shops
where shelves remain stocked high and shoppers are few, frightened off by
credit costing 5,000 per cent a year.
Pressure is mounting on Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, Brazil's economy
minister, to relax the monetary policy. 'We are killing off our industry,'
warns Mr Emerson Kapaz, a Sao Paulo business leader and toy manufacturer. On
the Paulista's pavement, the informal economy seems to be doing little
better.
The preponderance of street traders selling everything from sink plungers to
electronic games show the increase this decade in the informal economy.
Thought to be equivalent to 50 per cent of Gross Domestic Product, it is
currently exercising the brains of those in government over how to tax it.
The last decade left other marks on the Paulista: these days, shoppers
clutch handbags and watch out for well-armed pickpockets who shoot for
brandname sneakers while motorists drive bullet-proof cars, wary of
kidnappers out for more lucrative targets.
Ragged children roam the street offering to guard cars for a handful of
almost worthless notes, a glaring example of how inflation has increased the
gap between rich and poor - the world's widest.
As dusk falls on the most expensive real estate in Latin America, gangs of
street children cluster round the bin outside Macdonald's hoping for scraps.
These were the people that Mr Collor referred to as the "shirtless and
shoeless' in his campaign two years ago and pledged to lift out of poverty,
while promising those inside the bullet-proof cars to take Brazil into the
First World.
Now, after a second year of recession and expecting 1992 to be little better
in growth, even the Paulista is starting to show the strain. The days of new
construction are forgotten and the lack of investment evident in the poor
upkeep of the greying buildings.
Once a magnet for talent from all over the world, the cracked pavements of
the Avenida Paulista now attract down-and-outs from the country's
poverty-stricken north-east. And symbolise the fading dreams of a Great
Brazil.

FT  01 MAY 92 / US holding fresh talks on beer imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US said yesterday it was consulting state governments on how to comply
with a Gatt disputes panel ruling that federal and state laws and practices
discriminate against imported beer, Frances Williams reports from Geneva.
The ruling, with far-reaching implications for many Gatt members with
federal constitutions, was discussed for the first time by Gatt's governing
council. The panel was set up last year to examine a complaint by Canada
alleging 78 discriminatory practices against imported beer by the US federal
government and 44 US states.
The panel found preferential federal excise taxes for small US brewers and
tax and distribution practices in 41 US states and Puerto Rico were
inconsistent with international fair trade rules. The US had not shown it
had taken 'reasonable measures' to bring states in line with Gatt rules, the
panel said. Another Gatt panel has ruled in favour of a US complaint that
certain Canadian liquor board practices for beer violated Gatt obligations.
After US threats of retaliation, the two sides reached an agreement last
Monday, giving US brewers easier access to Canada.
This is set to make it easier for the US to end discriminatory practices at
home. The US accounts for 90 per cent of Canadian beer imports, worth
Dollars 200m a year, though these are equivalent to 1 per cent of total US
beer output. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said he hoped to say
soon that the US could accept adoption of the panel report.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Spectre of jobless army haunts Russia: The painful business
of adjusting to new times must soon start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fear stalking the corridors of power of the Russian government is
palpable: it is of the rise of an army - an army of unemployed.
Mr Feodor Prokopov, the young deputy Minister of Labour, refers to it often.
'We will see a very sharp rise in the autumn - perhaps up to 3.5m or 4m.
Perhaps to 5m-6m by the end of this year. Now, it's nothing: a little over
100,000. But it will come'.
The lack of unemployment in a system where production has fallen steadily,
where many goods, especially military and capital goods, have no market and
real incomes of the population have been sharply reduced, is only a mystery
if one thinks of the former Soviet economy as capable of acting in a market
fashion. It is not.
Enterprises have retained staff at all costs - most of these costs being
obvious in the Rbs800-900bn debt which they now owe to each other. Says Mr
Prokopov:"You must understand the mentality. First, no manager has any
experience of firing any number of workers. Second, managers are not so much
managers in the western sense as members of the collective. This is a
Russian as well as a Soviet tradition.'
However, it is clear that time is running out, and that the painful business
of psychological adjustment to new times must soon start.
A study now being finalised for the United Nations International Labour
Organisation shows that the real level of unemployment has been much higher
than the public figures - in large part because workers, who receive full
pay for three months after redundancy and a tapering scale of pay
thereafter, often do not bother to register for an unemployment benefit
which few receive.
Soon, there will be no disguising it. Most managers covered in the ILO
survey reported an intention to cut staff by at least 10 per cent this year.
Thus the Government is trying to get in place a legal and institutional
framework which will cope with the most obvious and poignant signs of
economic crisis: men and women on the streets, without work. The legal basis
 -an employment law - is now in draft stage, and is out for consultation
with regional authorities and with the parliament.
It is fairly uncompromising: for instance, it explicitly states that 'in a
free economy neither the State nor private employers can guarantee
employment for the citizens and the citizens must feel that they themselves
have the responsibility to find themselves an occupation'
In a later passage, it says that 'hiring and firing according to the
business needs of the enterprise is the responsibility of the employers' -
though it later includes a provision which makes it necessary for employers
to inform the state, and the unions, in advance of mass redundancies (over
50).
Mr Prokopov and his colleagues and advisers are wrestling with four main,
and perhaps ultimately insoluble problems. First, they are seeking to
guarantee a (very) minimum wage to all those who will lose their jobs.
At present, their thinking is that this will be two-tier: 125 per cent of
the minimum income (to rise to Rbs900 by May 1) for those who lose their
jobs: 75 per cent of the minimum income for the long-term unemployed, for
those looking for work for the first time and those whose employers has not
contributed the statutory 1 per cent of the wage bill to the Employment
Fund.
This is low. An income 25 per cent less than a level defined as minimum is
desperately tight. But there is no money for more: if unemployment rises too
far, there may not even be money for that.
Second, they are trying to put in place a network of unemployment benefit
offices and training centres in a country which has not had the first and
has the wrong kind of the second. Ms Molly Meacher, a British employment
consultant working with Mr Prokopov, said that there is a lot of effort
being put into this, but it is not yet clear who should be trained for what.
Most training in the former Soviet Union is done in specialised institutes,
where workers are given skills for life: retraining is barely known. The
World Bank, with such countries as Germany, Britain and Sweden are beginning
to mobilise help on this front, and met in the past fortnight to co-ordinate
their responses. But it will be shambolic at first. Third, they want to
encourage the unions and the management to act like independent bodies: for
now, however, both look upward, to the state.
The former official unions, still dominant, are - says Mr Prokopov - passive
and confused: the managers have no experience in collective bargaining. The
aim is to get bipartite bargaining going at local levels: and there is much
interest in a a tripartite 'co-determination' system at national level.
But more depends on the shopfloor than on the government. They face the
immediate hurdle of getting the employment legislation past a parliament
where large numbers of deputies are sure to object to inscribing in law that
the right to work no longer exists: the law, like many others, may have to
rely on presidential decree.

Problem. Minutes before the chairman of Britain's biggest bank addresses his
last annual general meeting, somebody pours white paint all over him. What
do you do?
How the officials of Barclays Bank answered the said challenge yesterday
would certainly win a distinction in any Institute of Bankers exam.
Loyal company servant John Moulding swiftly offered the chairman his own
suit, then shivered in his underpants while replacement pinstripes were
rushed in from Marks and Spencer. Meanwhile an apparently perfectly tailored
Sir John Quinton stepped on stage for his final bow.
What his thoughts were on the incident, nobody knows. But Barclays
non-executive director and ICI chairman Sir Denys Henderson reportedly
joked: 'I hope it was Dulux.'

FT  01 MAY 92 / Observer: Pilk's outsider
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When a company has to look outside for a new chief executive, it is usually
an admission of failure. When the company in question is a world leader like
Pilkington, it is doubly so.
After more than 150 years in business, there is now only one Pilkington
among the famous glass-maker's leading lights. And while Sir Antony
Pilkington, the fifth generation of the family, is still chairman, he will
almost certainly be the last of the line. Like many dynasties Pilkington has
had trouble moving with the times and, despite boasting one of the
best-connected boards of non-executive directors, its management team has
long looked too inbred.
Roger Leverton, the new chief executive, is an international manager rather
than a glass man. Running RTZ's loss-making Indal business in North America,
he knows all about cyclical industries. He seems to made a success of
reshaping Indal's 28 subsidiaries and 8,000 staff in the depths of a
recession far worse than in the UK. He also has the benefit of a marketing
as distinct from a technical background.
That said, he still has to work under an executive chairman who has
dominated the company for more than a decade. Even though Leverton's title
is group chief executive, the City will need a lot of convincing that his
arrival at Pilkington means that there has been a significant change in the
power structure.

Ken Schofield's arrival in the chief executive's seat at MTM, the troubled
chemicals company, has to be good news. He did an excellent job in reviving
Hickson International and stands as good a chance as anyone of salvaging
MTM.
Even so, the manner of his arrival must raise eyebrows. When a company gets
into the sort of trouble that MTM seems to be in, shareholders might expect
the non-executive directors and the financial advisers to hang around and
help sort out the mess.
Notwithstanding Schofield's excellent record, shareholders can be forgiven
for wondering who is keeping an eye on their interests now the non-execs and
their advisers have quit. Perhaps there was a danger that Postern, the
recently hired firm of company doctors, was becoming too powerful in the
company's affairs. But it was up to the non-executive directors to keep them
under control. Who is going to tell Ken Schofield what to do?

'It'll take some getting used to,' said Jenny Colborne, goggling at her
husband. Although just pronounced Britain's scruffiest man, he had been
transformed for the occasion by the British Clothing Industry Assoc-
iation's gift of a Pounds 1,200 wardrobe including Centaur double-breasted
suit, Savile Row shirt and Frank Theak and Roskilly tie.
A management consultant and spare-time lute-maker from Worcester, John
Colborne normally rigs out his 6ft 2in frame with short-sleeved shirts above
cords in all weathers, even meeting clients while shod in trainers cast off
by his 70-year-old father.
The scarecrow effect won him pride of place in a 300-strong entry for the
association's Super Scruff title, its latest effort to promote British-made
male attire. Previous stunts have included presenting former trade and
industry secretary Peter Lilley with basketfuls of old socks.
But whereas most of the other contenders were nom-
inated by despairing wives, some considering divorce, the winner was shopped
by a next-
door neighbour. 'One of those neat little people,' Jenny Colborne said,
doing another double-take at the sartorial elegance topped by newly mown
hair and beard. On reflection, she added, the worst shock after 20 years of
mar- riage was the 'lack of chin'.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building for Asia's Future (11): Another Asian
dragon rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN economic power house is being created in the southern provinces of China,
Hong Kong and Macao.
In Guangdong, Hainan, Fujien and to a lesser extent Shanghai, the dead hand
of central government control has been lifted and enterprise is being given
its head.
Development in Hong Kong and Macao  - airports, ports, electric power and
telecommunications  - is occurring as a result of the southern Chinese
economic miracle.
The scale of the task in developing the region's infrastructure is
illustrated by the fact that Guangdong, with a population of 63m, is larger
than the UK but its total electricity generating capacity equals only 5 per
cent of Britain's.
This decade may see the electrification of southern China, construction of
big airports, creation of a telecommunications network, and the paving of
thousands of miles of highways.
Guangdong and Hong Kong are planning large rises in electricity capacity.
Generating capacity in Guangdong amounted to 8,280MW in 1990, but is planned
to increase to 14,300MW by 1995 and to produce 20,000MW by the year 2000.
GEC-Alsthom has just won a Pounds 550m contract to build two coal-fired
650MW units at Shajiao, on the Pearl River.
In Hong Kong  - where electricity generating capacity of 8,387MW is greater
than Guangdong's  - there are plans to increase nearly double capacity over
the next 15 years.
Anyone who has travelled on Guangdong's road system will appreciate the need
for improvement.
Most roads in Guangdong are single-lane dual carriage ways, with traffic
moving at a snail's pace.
Mr Gordon Wu, managing director of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, is
building a six-lane 304km super-highway, the first phase of which will
connect Shenzhen, on the Hong Kong border, with the provincial capital of
Guangzhou.
By the end of the century, within a radius of less than 50 nautical miles
from the centre of Hong Kong, there will be three airports capable of
dealing with international passenger and cargo traffic, and internal China
trade.
The largest of the three will be situated at Chek Lap Kok, a small island to
the north of Lantau.
Due for opening some time in 1997  - the year China resumes sovereignty over
the British colony  - the airport will have a cargo capacity of 1m tonnes a
year and ability to handle 20m passengers a year.
A planned international airport for Macao  - which reverts from Portugal to
China in 1999  - will open up the Zhuhai special economic zone.
By the year 2000 it is forecast to handle over 6m passengers and 123,000
tonnes of cargo a year. The smallest is an airport just completed at
Shenzhen, the special economic zone which borders Hong Kong. It has a
planned capacity, by 2000, of 5.5m passengers and nearly 200,000 tonnes of
cargo a year.
In Hong Kong there are an average of 54 telephones for every 100 people; in
Shenzhen, there are 17; in Guangdong the figure falls to three; and for the
whole of China it is less than one. China has embarked on a Dollars 6bn
telecoms programme, but that is just the beginning.
Hong Kong's biggest infrastructural advantage has been its natural harbour.
But its franchise is coming under threat from a more outward-looking China.
Work on an ambitious container terminal at Yantian, just across Hong Kong's
eastern border, is already advanced. To the west, Shekou has succeeded in
attracting one Middle Eastern shipping company to its shallower container
facilities in the Pearl River and a European shipping line is negotiating to
set up a direct route.
A third big deep-water port is planned in Gaolan, next to the Special
Economic Zone of Zhuhai.
Further afield, free ports are being set up in Yangpu in Northern Hainan
island and in the city of Xiamen, opposite Taiwan. These two special zones
have the avowed intent of mirroring the success of Hong Kong and are well
located to do so.
Local business remains confident that Hong Kong's infrastructure will give
it the edge. 'The cake is getting sufficiently bigger, so there is enough
for all of us', said one terminal operator. This view is reflected in the
growing number of consortia preparing to bid for the territory's ninth
container terminal.
'Transport infrastructure is fundamental to Hong Kong's future success,'
said Mr Alisdair Morrison, managing director of the Jardine Matheson group's
property arm Hongkong Land, one of a number of companies to express an
interest in bidding for the new terminal, due to open in 1995.
'As Hong Kong integrates with southern China, it is the manufacturing sector
and the physical movement of its goods which is at the forefront of Hong
Kong's growth. The port is the mechanism for taking advantage of that', said
Mr Morrison.
The emerging ports over the border seem likely to act as feeder ports for
Hong Kong, as will also be the case with the new deep-water port in Macao.
All the Pearl River ports suffer from silting and offer difficult access. In
the short term, they should enhance Hong Kong's position as a regional hub.
Total container output for the whole of China was only 1.5m Twenty-foot
Equivalent Units (TEUs) in 1990, compared with in excess of 5m TEUs out of
Hong Kong. The turnaround for a container in Hong Kong is measured in hours,
while operators claim that in China it has to be measured in days or even
weeks.
The Hong Kong government estimates that the number of fully-containerised
vessels utilising the port will increase from 8,390 in 1990 to 21,000 by

'I would even question whether Hong Kong can offer enough capacity in the
next five years. It's going to be very tough. Some of the business is going
to go to other places, but there's more than enough business for everybody',
said Mr David Allen, managing director of Asia Terminals.

FT  01 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lower after profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HALF-HEARTED attempt by London's equity market to gather itself for an
assault on the all-time high ran out of steam within minutes of the opening,
and share prices remained on the retreat for the rest of a rather
disappointing trading session. The FT-SE 100-share Index ended the day 10.8
down at 2,654.1.
Behind the slide in share prices were earnings downgrades on some of the
blue chip companies, and worries that the emergence of the UK from the
recession may take longer than expected. A sizeable sell programme by one of
the leading marketmakers also put equities under pressure. In the
background, institutions were believed to be holding off from the market
ahead of an expected rush of rights issues or cash-raising exercises.
Trading got off to a bright start, with dealers marking prices higher in
response to a 25-point gain on Wall Street overnight and the successful
outcome to Tuesday's record-breaking gilts auction.
Early minor gains were quickly wiped out, however, as the Footsie future
began to lose ground. The expiry of the Footsie futures option saw prices
drift off, stabilise briefly in mid-morning, and then resume their downward
path for much of the rest of the day.
A strong opening by Wall Street provided only marginal relief for London. At
its worst, the Footsie index was almost 24 points off at 2,641, but it
rallied to recoup half of that amount by the close.
Equities were given no lead by a rather tired gilts market, where the longer
dated issues closed with losses of around  1/4 . Index linked stocks, on the
other hand, posted good gains.
ICI's first-quarter figures were around the middle of the range of
forecasts, but the shares lost ground in the wake of sustained
profit-taking.
The oil sector, among the market's worst performing areas over the past
couple of years, showed signs of attracting domestic funds after strong US
demand over the past few weeks. BP, especially, was very heavily traded.
Turnover in equities was strongly boosted by another big individual placing.
Smith New Court, the securities house widely acknowledged to be the UK
market's bought-deal specialists, acquired 19.6 per cent in Transport
Development from Swedish group Proventus and placed the stock with a number
of institutions, taking a 4 1/2 p turn on the shares, according to dealers.
Overall turnover in equities amounted to 720.7m shares.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew remains bullish of UK equities. The broker maintained
its forecast that the Footsie will achieve 3,000 this year. 'Healthy levels
of cash flow and liquidity should allow domestic institutions to maintain a
reasonable commitment to UK equities,' said UBS. JP Morgan, the US
investment bank, lifted its year-end Footsie forecast by 100 points to 2,900
to 2,950. 'Downside is limited while the potential for gains on our
forecasts appears substantial,' said strategists at the US investment bank.
BZW is more cautious and sticks with its year-end forecast of 2,750: 'The
degree of sustainable upside is looking more limited after the swift
post-election rerating.'

(America): Dow stronger on signs of economic recovery

Wall Street
FURTHER evidence of economic recovery helped US equities to post solid gains
yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 25.94 higher at 3,359.12, making a
two-day advance of 51 points. Trading was moderately active, with more than
223m shares changing hands on the big board.
Advances outscored declines by 1,184 to 557. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved
ahead 2.93 to 414.95 and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks
climbed 8.74 to 578.68.
Investors were encouraged by unchanged initial jobless claims for the week
ended April 18. The market had expected a slight increase in the number. In
addition, the Chicago area purchasing managers report provided further
evidence of expansion in the manufacturing sector in April.
General Re, the biggest US reinsurance group, was one of the weakest stocks
of the day. It tumbled Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 81, below its previous
52-week low of Dollars 85, on reporting a fall in operating profits from
Dollars 135.1m to Dollars 116.5m for the first quarter and warning that
underwriting results were likely to be unsatisfactory for the balance of the
year.
The figures from General Re cast a pall over the whole insurance sector,
with Travelers dipping Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 3/4 , Cigna Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 51 3/4 , Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 and
American International Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 83.
Disappointing first-quarter results from Chrysler depressed the shares. The
stock edged Dollars  1/4 lower to Dollars 19 3/8 in active trading after
Chrysler turned in a loss of 7 cents a share for the quarter, including a
special gain of 75 cents. A year earlier, Chrysler had a loss of Dollars
2.66 that included special charges of Dollars 1.14.
Trading was also active in Ford and General Motors, which respectively
slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 and Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 1/2 .
In the airline sector, UAL, parent of United Airlines, put on Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 124 1/2 in spite of a first-quarter loss of Dollars 3.86 a share by
the parent company. A year earlier, UAL had a loss of Dollars 7.05 a share.
Third-quarter earnings from Duracell, the battery manufacturer, helped the
stock climb Dollars 2 to Dollars 26 7/8 . The company had profits of 4 cents
a share, against a loss of 33 cents in the year-ago period.
Strength in the technology sector helped the over-the-counter market outpace
the big board. Apple Computer jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/8 , but
Microsoft lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 110 1/4 after rising in morning
trading. Seagate Technology rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 15 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO ended little changed after moderate trading. The composite index was
off just 1.5 at 3,355.6. Rises led falls by 309 to 221, however, after
volume of 23.7m shares.
Traders said it was too soon to tell if the Ontario budget, announced late
yesterday, will have any effect on the market today, but anticipation of the
budget has undoubtedly slowed the market this week.
The golds group index was up 1.38 per cent and financial services down 0.69
per cent, with other leading groups showing little change.
Air Canada set a total of 350 job cuts this year and did not rule out
further job losses. It said its advanced bookings for May are ahead of last
year. The stock was off CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 5 1/2 .

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Foreign Exchanges: US
economic worries dominate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about the strength of the US recovery were once again the dominant
feature of what was otherwise a quiet day of trading on the foreign exchange
markets, writes James Blitz.
Although some of the economic indicators coming out of Washington were in
line with expectations, they suggested that economic growth in March and
April was not as strong as in the first couple of months of this year. The
US government's weekly figures for unemployment applications were unchanged
at 404,000 for the week ending April 18. And the leading indicators, which
rose 0.2 per cent in March, were not as strong as figures for January and
February.
Consequently, the dollar closed slightly weaker in London against both the
D-Mark and yen, down from DM1.6565 to DM1.6525 and Y133.45 to Y133.35. 'The
markets may feel that the pace of growth in the US has not been sustained,'
said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, 'and
we could see a further weakening in forthcoming months.'
Nevertheless, markets still have to weigh the uncertainty of a US economic
recovery against political weaknesses in Germany and economic weakness in
Japan. As a result, the D-Mark was unable to make much headway against other
currencies, including sterling, which suffered from a heavy bout of
overnight selling in the Far East.
Having dipped overnight below DM2.93, sterling managed to climb back to its
previous close in London of DM2.9325. The D-Mark also declined a little
against the yen, slipping in Frankfurt to DM1.2427 per 100 yen from DM1.2393
earlier in the day.
Uncertainty about the D-Mark was offset by suggestions that the Bundesbank's
policy-making central bank council might raise rates further at its regular
meeting next Thursday.
Analysts noted that the rate for 3-month money in Germany's markets has
climbed during the week from 9.60 per cent to 9.80 per cent, putting it
above the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent. Analysts believe this may force the
Bundesbank to raise the Lombard rate to come into line with the market.
'High interest rates would be supportive for the mark, if not for a very
good reason,' said one trader.
The yen's modest gains yesterday against the dollar and D-Mark were
interpreted as a sign that support given to the currency by the Group of
Seven finance ministers at the weekend is working after all. On Wednesday
the yen had eased against the dollar in New York trading, in spite of a
declaration by the G7 that the decline of the yen was not contributing to
the world's economic adjustment.
The dollar finished lower in New York last night at DM1.6477 and Y133.20.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Money Markets: Interest rates
ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME traders speculated yesterday on the possibility of a cut in British
interest rates after the Bank of England again bought bills at the longer
end at slightly reduced rates.
In yesterday's early trading in the discount market, the Bank bought Pounds
36m of Band-3 bills at 10 1/8 - 3/32 per cent and Pounds 13m of Band-4 at 10
1/32 -10 per cent. These were lower rates than those used on Wednesday
morning, when the Bank bought Band-3 bills at 10 5/32 - 1/8 per cent and
Band-4 bills at 10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent. Last week, the Bank was buying
Band-3 bills at 10 5/32 per cent and Band-4 at 10 1/16 per cent.
Rates for the shorter term
bills in Bands-1 and 2 remained unchanged, however, with the Bank once again
selling Pounds 147m of Band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Traders were divided over how to read the Bank's intentions from yesterday's
rates in Bands-3 and 4. One trader believed this was the start of a slow
climb down in rates, as the Bank of England tests whether the foreign
exchanges will sell sterling at slightly reduced rates. 'The news is mildly
encouraging on rates,' commented one trader.
However, the majority believed that the Bank was more concerned to relieve
the large shortages in the discount market without reducing the shorter term
rates in Bands-1 and 2. Once again, the Bank posted a large end-of-month
shortage at the start of trading yesterday of Pounds 1.2bn. In the
afternoon, the shortage was revised to around Pounds 1.15bn before taking
account of the morning operations. The Bank then purchased bills totalling
Pounds 164m, of which Pounds 147m were Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent
and Pounds 17m were for resale to the market on May 8 at 10 13/32 per cent.
The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 375m.
In the interbank market, the 3-month rate, a key indicator of possible base
rate moves, finished a shade lower at 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent compared to 10
1/2 - 1/2 yesterday. There was also a slight easing in the futures markets.
The June Short sterling contract edged up during the day, tracking
sterling's rise against the D-Mark. June short sterling opened on a low of
89.64 but finished at around 89.72. This suggests that the market believes
that interest rates three months from now will be 10.28 per cent.
In the German markets, the overnight rate fell from 9.60/65 per cent to
around 7.50 to 8.50 per cent.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Waste problem delays smelter
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASMINCO, the Australian metals group, is delaying sale of its half share in
the Budel smelter in the Netherlands, which produces about 5 per cent of the
western world's zinc requirements.
The Budel stake was put up for sale in March when Pasminco decided to
dispose of all its European assets. These also include the Avonmouth
lead-zinc smelter in the UK.
However, the future of the Budel plant, which has Billiton, the metals arm
of the Royal Dutch/Shell group as its other joint owner, has been under a
cloud for some time because it is running out of space to store
cadmium-containing hazardous waste called jarosite. The management says a
decision must be made within months about a Fl 400m (Pounds 130m) scheme to
process the jarosite or the smelter may have to close.
Pasminco said yesterday that the Budel sale had been delayed pending the
outcome of current discussions with the Dutch authorities in relation to the
disposal of the waste material jarosite from the Budelco operation. The
company said: 'As has been previously announced, these discussions have been
under way for some years and, while the outcome is uncertain, the
discussions are now reaching an advanced stage with a view to developing a
solution which is acceptable to all parties.'
Pasminco's production report yesterday showed Budelco produce 54,344 tonnes
of zinc in the first quarter this year, up from 52,646 in the same months of
1991. Avonmouth produced 25,249 tonnes of zinc and 10,409 tonnes of lead up
from 23,173 tonnes and 10,182 tonnes.

DROUGHT in Africa will force the continent's imports of maize to more than
11m tonnes in 1992-93 from a projected 6.3m tonnes in 1991-2 and 4.3m tonnes
in the previous season, according to the International Wheat Council's
latest market report, writes Our Commodities Staff.
South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia, which normally export to neighbouring
countries, have been forced to import.
The IWC expects the former Soviet Union's wheat crop to rise by 14.5m tonnes
to 93m in 1992, still well below 1990's 108m tonne crop.

mark time ahead of holiday in Europe

US Treasury prices were narrowly mixed yesterday ahead of today's holiday in
many European centres and with the market continuing to react to the
previous day's confusing refunding news.
In late trading, the bell wether 30-year bond was  1/4 higher at 99 15/32 ,
yielding 8.04 per cent while the two-year note was unchanged to yield 5.43
per cent.
The Federal Reserve arranged Dollars 2.5bn in customer repurchase agreements
when Fed funds were trading at 3 7/8 per cent. The adding operation was
expected, with Fed funds trading above the perceived target of 3 3/4 per
cent.
The long end of the yield curve was bolstered by Wednesday's announcement
that Argentina would be allowed to buy non-marketable 30-year zero coupons
in the private market. The Treasury said it might also sell zero coupons
directly to Argentina.
Shorter-dated maturities, however, weakened ahead of next week's quarterly
refunding auctions.
There was little market reaction to yesterday morning's release of initial
jobless claims for the week ended April 18, which were unchanged from the
previous week. The market had expected a small increase in jobless claims
for the week.
The market reacted with equanimity to the release of the Chicago-area
purchasing managers' index for April which weighed in at 54.3 per cent on a
seasonally adjusted basis against 51.1 per cent in March.
A reading of over 50 per cent indicates that the manufacturing sector is
growing.
THE German government bond market weakened during the morning session in
generally lacklustre trade yesterday, setting the tone for markets
through-out Europe ahead of a public holiday in many countries today.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, opened at
87.19, from 87.21 on Wednesday and below the important support level at
87.20. The contract quickly fell to 87.08, the low for the day.
Official data confirmed consumer prices in western Germany rose by 0.3 per
cent in the month to mid-April, for a year on year inflation rate of 4.5 per
cent. The annual inflation rate was 4.8 per cent in March.
The figures were in line with market expectations following the release of
data from German lander earlier this week.
Bund prices recovered later in the day as dealers squared positions ahead of
today. By the close, the June contract on Liffe stood at 87.21.
Volume was strong at 66,000 contracts.
Next week, interest is likely to centre on the first issue of paper by the
European Recovery Programme Fund, a body set up to fund economic
re-generation in eastern Germany.
The bonds will probably have to priced to yield slightly more than either
bunds or bonds issued by the Unity fund, another government-backed body.
Yesterday Liffe said that bonds issued by the ERP would not be deliverable
into its government bond futures contract, matching a decision by the DTB,
the Frankfurt exchange, earlier this week.
THE UK government bond market paused for breath yesterday as dealers
adjusted positions taken ahead of Wednesday's Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction.
The gilt futures contract on Liffe opened at 98.18, slipped to 98.13 in the
morning in line with the fall in the German market, but later recovered to
stand at 98.17 by late afternoon. Volume was a sluggish 20,000 contracts.
In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 was also
slightly weaker. From an opening level of 99 23/32 , the issue traded down
to 99.16 by late afternoon, for a yield of 9.05 per cent.
During April, the gilts market out-performed every other major government
bond market according to a database of 21 markets compiled by Kemper
Investment Management.
A balanced portfolio of gilts returned 4.8 per cent on the month, rising
sharply following the Conservative election victory. In contrast, a
portfolio of German government bonds returned 0.8 per cent in local currency
terms.
The Italian Treasury completed this week's funding programme with an auction
of five-year fixed-rate bonds. The authorities issued L6,000bn paper, which
was sold to the market at an average yield of 11.03 per cent, unchanged from
the previous auction in early April.
The market continued to be buoyant despite the weekend resignation of Mr
Francesco Cossiga, which has left the country without president or prime
minister. The benchmark 10-year fixed-rate bond maturing January 2002,
closed at 98.34, from 98.35 on Wednesday.
JAPANESE government bond prices continued the gentle slide which prevailed
earlier in the week, the benchmark 10-year bond moving to its lowest point
this year before recovering slightly in late trading.
The benchmark 10-year issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield of 5.71
per cent, from 5.685 on Tuesday. The markets were closed on Wednesday for a
public holiday. During the day the issue had hit a low of 5.725 per cent.
Trading volume was sluggish, with volume in the benchmark issue reaching
just Y256bn. Analysts said investors were wary of committing funds because
of the prospect of a large volume of corporate bond issues to refinance
maturing equity-linked debt. Yesterday, NEC, the electronics company, said
it would issue Y50bn of three-year bonds in the domestic market.
The next government bond auction, postponed until after the Golden Week
public holidays next week, will probably take place on May 7. Dealers are
expecting the new bonds to carry a 5.5 per cent coupon, unchanged from the
last auction. However, most said a higher 5.7 per cent coupon could be
required to attract long-term investors into the auction.
Portugal's central bank has extended a 10-month-old ban on foreigners buying
high-yielding variable interest rate government bonds until the end of 1992,
Reuters reports.
A Bank of Portugal spokesman said the ban, imposed last July, had been
extended until the end of this year. Portugal banned foreigners buying its
attractive Public Investment (FIP) variable interest rate bonds to curb
buying pressure on the escudo and dampen high local interest rates.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Clones catch up on Compaq - How
two industry legends are being put to rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq Computer buried two computer industry legends this week by announcing
dismal first-quarter financial results and publicly withdrawing from
membership of the much-vaunted Ace Initiative consortium.
A long-standing Wall Street favourite that beat American records for
corporate growth in the 1980s, Compaq is struggling to come to terms with a
cut-throat 'commodity' market for personal computers in which its brand name
and reputation no longer command premium prices.
Compaq's first-quarter earnings were down 60 per cent, at Dollars 45m, while
sales revenues fell 19 per cent to Dollars 783m. Once seen as IBM's toughest
rival in the personal computer market, Compaq is losing ground to a tribe of
'clone' manufacturers. Compaq's shares were trading at Dollars 23 3/8 at
midday in New York yesterday.
Similarly, Ace, an audacious plan to map the future of large segments of the
computer industry by establishing a new hardware and software standard for
the next generation of personal computers and workstations, is rapidly
losing momentum.
A year ago, Compaq was riding high when it joined with Microsoft, Digital
Equipment, Silicon Graphics, Mips Computer, Santa Cruz Operation and other
computer and software companies to announce the Ace Initiative.
Having achieved remarkable success as a bold imitator of International
Business Machines' personal computer standards, Compaq seemed ready to plot
its own course.
The support of Microsoft, the leading personal computer software publisher,
and Digital Equipment, the world's second largest computer manufacturer,
bolstered Ace's credibility.
Mips Computer's powerful reduced instruction set computing (Risc)
microprocessor, provided the group with a strong technology base. Compaq
provided Ace with an essential ingredient of success - the prospect of high
volume production of computers built to Ace specifications.
However, since the announcement of Ace, Compaq's fortunes have been reversed
by mounting price competition. Last October, Compaq's board ousted Mr Rod
Canion, president, chief executive and a co-founder of the company. Mr
Eckhard Pfeiffer, who replaced Mr Canion as president and chief executive,
is spearheading an urgent effort to transform Compaq into a more cost and
price competitive company.
He has slashed the prices of most of Compaq's products and in June the
company will launch a lower price range. Mr Pfeiffer acknowledges, however,
it will be some time before these efforts show results and second and third
quarter earnings are expected to continue on a downward slide.
Following its earnings decline, Compaq announced it was aborting plans to
launch computers based upon Mips Computer Risc microprocessors and was
pulling out of the Ace consortium.
For Compaq, the decision was strongly influenced by a reassessment of the
ability of Intel, the leading supplier of microprocessor chips, to maintain
its technology lead. 'Two years ago we told Intel it did not have the
technology we needed to remain competitive in the high performance segment
of the personal computer market,' says Mr Gary Stimac, Compaq senior
vice-president.
Intel responded by stepping up its research and development efforts. Instead
of designing new generations of microprocessors one at a time, the chip
maker now has three generations of chips under development in parallel.
Compaq also found a 'surprising lack of interest' among its customers when
the company previewed its plans for a computer based upon Mips' Risc
microprocessor.
'Customers told us the performance benefits of Risc did not outweigh the
disadvantages of switching to a new architecture,' said Mr Stimac.
Rather than spend the Dollars 100m it would cost Compaq to put its prototype
Ace computer into production, the company decided to scrap the project.
Similarly, Santa Cruz Operation, a leader in the development of desktop
versions of the Unix system, has lost faith in the future of the Mips Risc
microprocessor and halted work on a version of its Open Desktop program for
Mips.
Digital Equipment's commitment to Ace has been brought into question by its
recent announcement of its own, higher performance Risc microprocessor
called Alpha.
Mips itself remains committed to Ace and maintains that Compaq's withdrawal,
though regrettable, will not seriously damage the consortium. Companies such
as Olivetti, in Europe, and Acer in the Far East, will bring Ace compliant
products to market later this year, Mips says.
Yet to most observers, Ace is a shadow of its former glory; an anachronism
overtaken by technology and market trends.
For Compaq, Ace was a digression that may have cost the company more than it
spent on the aborted development of a personal computer based upon Risc
technology.
Engrossed by the prospect of establishing partnerships that would fend off
potential competition from workstation manufacturers, such as Sun
Microsystems, and always keen to leapfrog IBM, Compaq was blinded to the
real challenge.
Today, Compaq is forced to compare the features and prices of its products
with those of second and third-tier 'clone' manufacturers that only a year
ago it was too proud to call competitors.

The board did not identify shareholders who have undertaken to reject the

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: IBM seeks multi-media deal

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines says it is 'pursuing and being pursued' by
potential partners as it seeks to form an independent joint venture company
to provide interactive multi-media services to US businesses and consumers.
Time Warner, the media and entertainment giant seeking to raise cash and
reschedule Dollars 7.2bn of debt, is believed to be among the companies in
talks with IBM about the venture.
IBM declined to identify its potential partners, but said it was in talks
with several long distance and local telephone companies, television cable
service operators, entertainment companies and others.
'We are forming business and technology relationships with companies that
have the core skills that will be needed to implement an inter-active
multi-media network, says Ms Lucie Fjeldstad, IBM vice-president and general
manager of multi-media.
IBM had been exploring the business potential of multi-media - the
confluence of computer, consumer electronics and telecommunications
technologies - for the past two years, Ms Fjeldstad said.
'Movies on demand', where subscribers can watch a film of their choice at
any time, will be one of the first applications. Time Warner's vast library
of movies and television shows, as well as its cable television systems,
could become a key element of the service.
Time Warner's wants to attract cash from IBM in exchange for making
entertainment 'software' available to the project.
The amount of cash it might attract if the venture is agreed would be far
less than the Dollars 1bn investment by two Japanese companies - Toshiba and
C. Itoh - who recently bought 12.5 per cent of Time Warner Entertainment
(TWE), a new subsidiary of Time Warner that contains the movie and cable
assets of the group.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: UAL blames Dollars 92.3m loss on
weak domestic market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, yesterday revealed it lost
Dollars 92.3m after tax in the first three months of 1992. Mr Stephen Wolf,
chairman, described the result 'woefully unsatisfactory'.
The net loss compared with an after-tax deficit of Dollars 157m in the same
period a year ago. However, this was when the Gulf war lead to a sharp
decline in traffic levels.
United is one of three US 'mega-carriers', and its first-quarter deficit
follows a modest Dollars 20m profit from American Airlines and a Dollars
151.6m deficit at Delta Air Lines, its two big rivals.
At the operating level, UAL saw even larger losses, totalling Dollars 146.3m
in the first three months of 1992, compared with a Dollars 268.1m deficit a
year ago. Operating revenues were up from Dollars 2.56bn to Dollars 2.97bn,
but costs rose from Dollars 2.83bn to Dollars 3.12bn, despite a reduction in
fuel expenses to Dollars 363.4m from Dollars 448.1m.
United, which recently acquired the former Pan Am routes in Latin America,
blamed the results on the domestic market.
'The anaemic economic recovery in the US, where United has about two-thirds
of its capacity, coupled with the pricing actions of certain carriers, had a
very significant impact on first-quarter revenue,' said Mr Wolf.
Some analysts have been sceptical about the speed and ease with which the
Pan Am business could be integrated.
However, Mr Wolf stressed the airline's primary focus was 'on further
development' of the international route system. Here, he said, first-quarter
capacity was up by 39 per cent, and traffic by 55 per cent.
United's yield - passenger revenue per mile flown - rose by 2.8 per cent, to
13.60 cents, while its load factor was 61 per cent, up 2.1 percentage points
from the 58.9 per cent seen a year ago. Its shares were up by Dollars  3/4 ,
at Dollars 124 3/4 . Amid a series of management appointments, United
Airlines yesterday named Mr John Pope, formerly vice-chairman and chief
financial officer, to be the carrier's chief operating officer. Mr Pope
becomes responsible for day-to-day matters such as operations, marketing,
planning and customer service.
Mr Stephen Wolf, who remains chairman and chief executive, will concentrate
on strategy, and government and market relationships. The company is also
establishing an international division, which will be headed by Mr James
Goodwin, previously senior vice-president for maintainance operations.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: US broker defends bond trades
with insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERRILL LYNCH yesterday told a Senate subcommittee its junk bond trades with
Guarantee Security Life Insurance, the insolvent Florida insurer, were
proper, and did not constitute illegal 'parking' of securities, Agencies
report. The broker, the biggest in the US, is defending itself before the
permanent investigations subcommittee, chaired by the powerful Democrat, Nr
Sam Nunn.
Merrill executives said its dealings with the insurer were reported to the
state insurance regulators in Florida. Parking refers to a short-term sale
and repurchase of securities, with the aim of dressing-up an investment
portfolio temporarily.
However, Mr Nunn reportedly peppered Merrill Lynch witnesses with pointed
questions suggesting the trades were not real transactions. The Florida
insurance commissioner, Mr Tom Gallagher, has already told the subcommittee
the trades were merely paper transactions used by the insurer to inflate its
assets.
Guarantee Security was seized by the regulators in August and declared
insolvent. Since then, the deputy receiver for the insurer has alleged that
Merrill helped to hide Guarantee's holdings of high-yield securities from
regulators, by temporarily exchanging them for government securities at the
end of each financial year.
Merrill has denied any impropriety, but the insurance regulators have filed
a civil suit against the brokerage house, along with certain former advisers
to the company.
The Senate hearings come at a time when insurance in the US has acquired
heavy political overtones, adds Nikki Tait in New York. Some members of the
Democrat-controlled Congress are attempting to introduce some form of
federal supervision of the sector.

<TEXT>
LOSSES at PWA, the holding company of Canadian Airlines International,
climbed 17 per cent in the first quarter, despite a 3 per cent rise in
revenues and improved load factors.
The Calgary-based company, which is trying to ensure its survival by
negotiating a partnership with the US carrier, American Airlines,
acknowledged that a return to profitability was unlikely this year.
Canadian's main rival, Air Canada, which is also in the red, said it was
cutting another 350 jobs as part of an effort to return to an operating
profit within the next 12 months. The job losses include 10 per cent of the
airline's management positions.
PWA suffered a first-quarter loss of CDollars 74.9m (USDollars 62m), or
CDollars 1.56 a share, up from CDollars 63.8m, or CDollars 1.70, a year
earlier. The lower per-share loss is due to a larger number of outstanding
shares.
The airline ascribed the higher loss to fierce fare-discounting, despite a
rise in its passenger load factor to 64.8 per cent from 59.5 per cent. Air
Canada suffered a CDollars 218m loss last year, but said it aimed for a
CDollars 300m turnround by the end of 1993.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Alcatel in control systems deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group, is
selling part of its control systems business to Yokogawa, the Japanese
electrical concern. It has also entered into a co-operative agreement with
Yokogawa for the rest of its control systems interests.
Yokogawa has taken control of Controle Bailey, a company within Alcatel
Alsthom's Cegelec division, which specialises in batch control processes for
the chemical and petro-chemical sectors.
Controle Bailey, which employs 220 people at its Paris base, made a
substantial loss last year on sales of around FFr200m (Dollars 35.8m). The
company has been in decline for several years after a buoyant period in the
mid-1980s when its sales reached FFr400m.
Cegelec, which had overall sales of around FFr17bn in 1991, said that
Controle Bailey was too small to absorb the very high research costs
involved in developing new systems. As a result it has been considering its
disposal for some time in order to focus on its three core areas of activity
 -energy controls, drive systems for processing industries such as steel and
paper, and access control systems such as subway ticket machines and
motorway tolls.
After the acquisition, Yokogawa, one of the leaders in batch control
processes, will no longer have any competitive interests with Cegelec,
allowing the two to form their co-operative agreement.

<TEXT>
THOMSON, the French state-owned electronics group which is negotiating to
merge some of its interests with CEA-Industrie, the nuclear energy group,
cut its net losses in 1991 to FFr702m (Dollars 125.8m) from FFr2.47bn in
1990.
The group, which is the linchpin of France's public sector with extensive
interests across the electronics industry, produced a profit in its defence
electronics subsidiary, but lost money in its consumer electronics
interests, which were hit by a restructuring charge of FFr1.5bn. It
succeeded in turning its consolidated loss of FFr1.6bn in 1990 into profits
(before payments to minorities) of FFr227m.
Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics division, saw its net profits rise from
FFr2.17bn to FFr2.35bn on sales which slipped by 5 per cent to FFr35.18bn.
The fall in sales was largely due to a reduced contribution from its Al
Thakeb contract in the Middle East.
The consumer electronics division, Thomson-CE, remained in the red with a
net loss of FFr2.48bn on sales which fell by 6 per cent to FFr31.16bn.
Thomson Electromenager saw its sales rise by 2 per cent to FFr5.08bn,
contributing to group consolidated sales of FFr71.28bn, which fell by 5 per
cent during the year.

<TEXT>
THE month-long struggle by Skandia, the Swedish insurance group, to take
over Denmark's second largest insurer, Hafnia, ended yesterday after
Hafnia's board of directors said it would now support the rescue package
proposed by the group of Danish shareholders dissatisfied with the Swedish
offer. Previously the board had given its full support to the Skandia bid.
The reversal of Hafnia's original agreement with Skandia took place after
the deadline for a final statement from Skandia's board was postponed. The
Skandia statement was expected following a 'due diligence report' carried
out on Hafnia.
Mr Ebbe Christensen, chairman of Hafnia's board, said that he could
'understand if Skandia were disappointed because they no longer had an
agreement where they thought they had one'.
But Mr Christensen said that he hoped it would still be possible to
establish a future co-operation with the Skandia.
The agreement between Hafnia's board and the group of Danish shareholders
involves a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 234.3m) increase in Hafnia's share capital
through a rights issue.
The two institutional shareholders, the LD Fund and the Local Authorities
Pension Insurance Fund, which have led the disaffected Danish shareholders,
have welcomed the move.

IN THE most difficult year in its history, McLaughlin &amp; Harvey, the
construction group, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.4m and passed its
dividend.
This followed losses of Pounds 4.9m at the half-way stage, when provisions
of Pounds 4.05m were made for bad debts and write-down for construction work
in progress.
The company said that conditions in the industry had worsened in the second
half, but although further provisions had been made they were on a much
reduced scale.
Mr Charles Denny, chairman, said that the Northern Ireland division had
secured a substantial workload this year. However, turnover in south-east
England was expected to be diminished as the company was not prepared to
accept work at negative margins.
Sales fell to Pounds 98.4m, against Pounds 110m in 1990 when there was a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 727,000. Losses per share jumped from 11.6p to 80.3p.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Schofield will steer MTM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the specialist chemicals company which saw its share price plunge in
March, yesterday appointed Mr Ken Schofield as chief executive in a board
shake-up involving the resignation of all non-executive directors.
The shares gained 7p to 64p yesterday.
It followed a boardroom battle between two camps. On one side, the executive
directors and institutional shareholders led by Gartmore, and on the other,
Postern, the corporate management specialists, Robert Fleming, MTM's
adviser, and the non-executive directors.
Mr Schofield was chief executive at Hickson International, the chemical
company, but announced in March that he would be leaving in May, having
turned the business around.
MTM's non-executive directors failed on Wednesday to persuade the board on
the merits of a Postern-backed plan to revive the group's fortunes which
involved selling key assets to reduce debt. The non-executives, Mr Stuart
Wamsley, Lord Tordoff and Mr Don Mackay, resigned yesterday, along with
Fleming as adviser.
The executive directors, backed by Gartmore which controls 5 per cent of
MTM, supported the appointment of Mr Schofield and his plan to trade the
company out of difficulty rather than break it up.
'I am a great one for trying to retain what is good in a company and
reluctant to sell what are the crown jewels in a depressed market,' Mr
Schofield said.
MTM's share price slumped from 286p to 26p in March after it failed to
convince Binder Hamlyn, its auditors, to sign off its 1991 accounts and
warned of profits well below expectations.
The announcements triggered concern about last year's accounts, which the
auditors are now reviewing.
Mr Richard Lines later resigned as chairman and Mr Tom Baxter left the
finance director post. Mr Lines retains a 7 per cent stake in the company,
which he founded in 1979 after a career with ICI,
MTM declined to comment yesterday on whether the company would have to
adjust earlier years' profits and balance sheets as a result of the review
by Binder Hamlyn.
The board meeting held last Wednesday is understood to have discussed a
draft report on the company's accounting and underlying transactions. Some
details are likely to be included when MTM reports its 1991 profits next
week, more than seven weeks after they were due.
During his 18 months as chief executive at Hickson, Mr Schofield is widely
credited with sorting out eight years of less than successful acquisitions.
Mr Schofield is now seeking new non-executive directors and a new chairman.
Postern, which was brought in as consultant after the resignation of Mr
Lines and Mr Baxter, is to continue helping with the financial management at
MTM which still lacks a finance director.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels to raise Pounds 20.6m via
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESORT HOTELS, which concentrates on mid-market, three-star venues, is
making its fourth rights issue in less than four years to fund acquisitions.
The Pounds 20.6m proceeds of the 1-for-2 issue will virtually wipe out net
debt ahead of the purchase of 11 hotels already run by the group. These
hotels in the County Resort and Country Resort chains will bring the number
of hotels owned by the group to 25, while another 19 are managed.
The issue price is 63p. Yesterday the shares shed 7p to close at 76p.
The group estimated that pre-tax profit had increased by at least 30 per
cent to Pounds 6m in the year to yesterday. Mr Robert Feld, managing
director, said turnover would be roughly 35 per cent ahead of the previous
Pounds 12.2m. However, additional shares in issue meant that earnings would
fall by about 1p to 7.95p. The total dividend is forecast to rise slightly
to 3.45p (3.4p).
The hotels being acquired are part of the Business Expansion Scheme. Mr Feld
said the purchases, which would be completed in 1993 and 1994, would bring
in Pounds 24.5m of debt.
Resort's latest net debt figure was Pounds 21m, about Pounds 1.4m more than
the last year-end, and the acquisitions could have pushed up gearing to 55
per cent. The pro forma debt-equity ratio after the rights, taking account
of the acquisitions' debt, was 21.5 per cent.
The hotels will be acquired for just over 13m shares, which after the rights
issue will further expand the number in issue by 13 per cent.

market by 1995 could cut the company's profits by Pounds 100m a year, Mr
Robert Evans, chairman, said. That would mean a reduction of 10 per cent in
its income.
He said the company had developed strategies - agreed with the Office of
Fair Trading - to compensate for the drop in its UK business. Mr Evans added
that British Gas was on target to earn 40 per cent of its profit from
international exploration and production.
He stressed that the price formula imposed by the OFT was a tough one. It
will last five years and limit price increases to 5 percentage points below
inflation.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Battle For Midland: Smaller companies look to foreign
bodies for improved choice and service

THE PROSPECT of Britain's 'big-four' clearing banks becoming only three if
Lloyds goes ahead with a successful bid for Midland has prompted small
business owners and their organisations to consider the attractions of
banking with a foreign owned bank.
Few UK small businesses know much about how Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation treats its customers. But organisations such as the Forum of
Private Business, with 19,000 members, believe a successful bid from the
Honkong Bank would inject a new vitality into a jaded UK banking market.
A takeover by Lloyds, in contrast, would merely strengthen attitudes to
dealing with small business clients which were implicitly criticised last
year when the government insisted on the banks introducing codes of conduct
for dealing with their customers.
'Small businesses need more choice not less,' said Mr Stan Mendham, chief
executive of the forum. 'As they emerge from recession they need financial
stability which should come from a more diverse banking system.'
The ideal outcome for the forum would be if Hongkong Bank acquired Midland
leaving Lloyds free to form links with a Continental bank. 'Either
combination would bring new attitudes, principles and capital,' said Mr
Mendham.
There is a possibility of overseas banks moving into the UK corporate
market, according to Mr David Burton, a partner in The Centre for
Consultancy (Surrey) which advises businesses on their banking
relationships.
Continental banks are seen as having closer and more long-term relationships
with their business customers.
British banks have traditionally emphasised the importance of deposit
protection, whereas banks on the Continent and in Japan see themselves more
as intermediaries between sources of finance and business, according to Mr
Martin Binks, a Nottingham University researcher who has studied the banks'
relations with small businesses.
This has led to British banks basing lending on the amount of capital
already in the business. Overseas banks are more willing to relate lending
to present and future income.
But are the continental banks really that much closer to their smaller
customers?
Many of the direct shareholdings in industry held by the German banks were
acquired immediately after the Second World War to prevent large companies
failing. NatWest Bank has commissioned a study of the equity holdings of the
German banks to see whether they really are more supportive of small
business.
British small business organisations also point to the US banking system
where there are many very small local banks. As small businesses themselves
these banks are closer to their smaller customers and can understand their
needs better. Small banks are however more prone to failure, as the annual
US banking closure statistics show.
The weakness of the small businesses argument in favour of more foreign
competition in the UK market is that so far no continental European or US
bank has established a long term presence in the small and medium-sized
business market.
The Americans in particular are noted for expanding into attractive business
sectors and then withdrawing rapidly when head office policy changes or
business conditions deteriorate. Citibank, for example, began to establish a
regional network but closed them soon afterwards.
'A lot of the foreign banks have withdrawn from these markets,' said Mr
Simon Whitney-Long, a partner of the Bank Relationship Consultancy. 'Some
believe they will be expanding again in six months but that is not a lot of
help to small businesses now.'
Overseas banks will also have to overcome the problem of providing a
personal service to small and medium-sized business clients from a very
limited branch network or from a single office in London. A common complaint
about the big UK clearers, which do have extensive branch networks, is that
they are still too remote from their small business customers.
The success of Midland Bank's First Direct operation, where personal clients
do their banking on the phone, has prompted some banking consultants to
wonder whether small business clients might also be willing to do business
in this way. This might provide an opening for a non-UK bank without a large
network.
There are many obstacles to overcome before an overseas bank could establish
itself as a friend of small business in the UK. Presently though, the
continental banks and the smaller UK banks have the advantage of a good name
with their small business customers.
This is partly because they are able to provide a more personal service to
their smaller number of customers and partly because, since their market
share is small, they rarely show up in the surveys which have revealed
dissatisfaction with the larger banks.
But the symbolism of one large UK bank offering Pounds 3.6bn for another at
a time when businessmen and women are having difficulty negotiating a Pounds
10,000 overdraft with their bank manager is not lost on the small business
community.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Battle For Midland: Villagers call banks to account -
The blight on Chiddingfold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIDDINGFOLD is one of those pantiled Surrey villages you used to pass
through on the way to the south coast in the days before motorways and
foreign holidays.
The children on the back seat of the car, uncontrolled by safety belts,
would push their noses against the glass and shout: 'Oo, isn't this lovely.
Can we stop and feed the ducks dad?' And father would look down at his
watch, then up at the half-timbered pub overlooking the village green and
the pond and think: 'why not?'
He might have popped into the Lloyds bank next door and topped up his
holiday money. A few doors further along the green he would have found the
NatWest and the Midland. The sign of the black horse hung fittingly across
from the old forge where horses were being shod as late as 1950.
The forge survives, along with the butcher, the baker, the grocery store,
the newsagent and the chemist.
Chiddingfold is a healthy village of about 3,000 people but trade has
suffered in the 13 months since the sign of the black horse was replaced by
an estate agent's board.
NatWest was the first to leave about 18 months ago. Then the Midland went
and Lloyds closed its doors about a year ago. In 1609 a pestilence hit the
village, claiming 50 souls in quick succession. It was as if nearly 400
years later the banks had fallen to another disease.
Mr David Wright, the blacksmith, believes the affliction had a foreign
origin. 'All those bankers went down to Mexico, drank a lot of tequila, and
lent them too much money. Now we're paying for it,' he said.
'Lloyds sent us a letter saying 'We are closing this branch so that we can
improve your quality of service.' I have it somewhere. It was worth
keeping.'
Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, this week cited Chiddingfold as an
example of how a bank merger could prevent what he called disorderly
attrition. When he said it was 'an absolute nonsense' that 'poor
Chiddingfold' had no bank branches, the locals found his statement somewhat
ironic given that Lloyds had been the last bank to go.
'They told us they would not leave the village, so many people transferred
their business to Lloyds. It was doing so well, and we still cannot
understand why it has closed,' said Mrs Susan Rose, who runs the newsagent's
shop with her husband Brian.
The banks were run as sub-branches of larger branches in Godalming, eight
miles away. They opened up on three days a week, 10am to 2pm Monday,
Wednesday and Friday. 'Of course all three branches opened the same days and
hours. They didn't stagger the hours,' said Mrs Rose.
The Roses organised a petition which failed to move Lloyds, nor could they
interest the bank in the idea of running a cash machine in their shop. They
suggested a mobile bank, or the banks getting together and sharing the same
premises, but the villagers ultimately had to settle for the only option
left to them - to drive into Godalming or Haselmere.
'This place really used to buzz on a Friday. All the farmers used to come
here to the bank and buy their Farmers' Weekly at our shop. They don't come
now,' said Mr Rose.
All the traders said their businesses had suffered because people would
often combine their trip to the bank in Godalming with doing their shopping.
Mr Reg Young, the butcher, said he had seen his trade drop by 40 per cent
since the banks went.
One of the biggest complaints is the outlay necessary for villagers to get
at their money. The return bus fare to Godalming is Pounds 2.20 and a new
parking scheme charges 40p for all on-street parking. 'It takes an hour of
my time and costs me 40p plus petrol, every time I go the Midland Bank in
Godalming,' said Mr Young.
Sir Jeremy appears to have re-ignited a militant streak among the villagers
that has lain dormant since 1929 when they threw the village police sergeant
into the pond, accusing him of burning down their annual bonfire before the
celebrations on November 5. Some 200 policemen were summoned and lined up on
the green. It was the last time they read the riot act on English soil.
Beneath the Jaeger sweaters and the Harris tweed jackets the sinews are
stiffening once more. 'It's killing village life,' said Ray Bastable, the
travelling fishmonger who has to increase the size of his float when he
comes into the village. 'Nobody has any change,' he said.
Villagers are helped by a friendly service from some of the shops. 'You can
cash a cheque for Pounds 50 at the Co-op when you buy goods there,' said Mrs
Thelma Lane.
Another saviour is the Post Office, which offers free banking with Girobank
but it costs Pounds 2.50 to cash a cheque from one of the clearers there.
No-one in Chiddingfold, it seems, quite understands why every clearer had to
leave. Lloyds said yesterday that no decision to close branches was taken
without 'an awful lot of thought and regret.'
It said the Chiddingfold branch had about 200 customers when it closed and
had been unviable.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Private functions, public concerns - How
Lonrho came to strike a deal with Libya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ADNAN Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian financier, never does things by
halves. The venue he chose for the first meeting between Mr Tiny Rowland,
Lonrho's chief executive, and representatives of Libya's Colonel Muammer
Gadaffi was Paris' fashionable Restaurant Laurent.
On Thursday November 21 1991, Mr Rowland, accompanied by Mr Robin Whitten, a
Lonrho director, joined Mr Khashoggi and a group of other businessmen at a
table booked for 20 people at the restaurant. The others included: Mr Reda
Alaywan, a Lebanese businessmen; a Libyan based in Paris who asked not to be
identified; and Mr Mousdafa Zouhde, head of the African operations of the
Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico), Libya's state-owned
overseas investment arm.
The Libyans were seeking ways of investing in western companies; Mr
Khashoggi thought Lonrho, with its long history of close relations with
governments in sub-Saharan Africa, might be the perfect partner.
At the lunch, the conversation centred on one thing: how Lafico and Lonrho
could 'mutually work for their best interests', according to one
participant. Less than five months later, the discussions over that Paris
lunch table had led to a Pounds 170m deal to make the Libyans partners in
one of Lonrho's hotel chains.
There was to be one other consequence: yesterday, the US administration
revealed it was investigating the relationship between Libya and Lonrho  -
an investigation which might lead to Mr Rowland's company being blacklisted
in the US.
All that was still in the future when the idea of the lunch was first
hatched by Mr Khashoggi and Mr Alaywan in September. That month, the two men
signed a joint venture agreement and established a joint company named
Kadir, based in the British Virgin Islands, with its registered office at PO
Box 3136, Road Town, Tortola, to exploit what they perceived as Lafico's
desire to expand in the West.
Mr Alaywan and Mr Khashoggi were natural partners. The former had extensive
contacts with Lafico - he was already acting as an intermediary between
Lafico and the president of a chain of French hotels, for example. Mr
Khashoggi had excellent western contacts with potential partners and a
formidable reputation as a broker of deals between westerners and Arab
governments during the oil boom of the 1970s and early 1980s.
In October Mr Khashoggi approached Mr Rowland about possibly doing business
with the Libyans.
Lonrho had just completed one of its most disappointing financial years.
Pre-tax profits had fallen by 24 per cent to Pounds 207m, the final dividend
was about be slashed and the balance sheet was looking weak as net debt rose
to over Pounds 1bn.
On October 18 Mr Rowland wrote to Mr Mohamed Ali El Huwej, Lafico's
chairman, saying how pleased he was to learn from Mr Khashoggi of Lafico's
interests in expanding its involvement in hotels. He welcomed the
opportunity of discussing how the two could collaborate.
Ten days later Mr Ali El Huwej wrote back to Mr Rowland expressing Lafico's
'willingness (for the) highest collaborations in the involvement in your
group's activities, namely the hotels chain, agriculture and any other field
we find with interest'.
Mr Ali El Huwej's letter underlined the importance Lafico attached to
signing joint ventures with western companies. He revealed that Lafico had
more than 80 joint ventures across five continents.
The lunch followed. During the discussions, Lonrho's UK-based Metropole
Hotels chain was identified as the first of many Lonrho businesses ripe for
Libyan involvement, said one of those present. A further meeting to talk
about the details of the deal was fixed for February in Geneva. Last night
Lonrho issued a statement through its solicitors saying that there had been
no further deals with Libyan institutions.
As 1991 drew to a close, Lonrho's internal accountants and lawyers were
ordered to produce a report on Lafico's western interests, according to one
of the people who worked on the project. He added that Mr Rowland found the
report's conclusions satisfactory.
The second meeting between Lonrho and Lafico was held in Geneva on February
4 and 5 to hammer out the price for a one third stake in Metropole Hotels.
This time Mr Rowland was accompanied by Mr Robert Dunlop, his joint deputy
chairman, while Lafico was represented by Mr Ali El Huwej.
One of the participants at the Geneva meeting said that the Pounds 177m
price for the stake in Metropole was agreed fairly quickly. The money was
then transferred to Lonrho the day before the deal was announced on March
26. Although Lonrho had got its cash, the relationship with Libya left
investors unhappy. The share price later fell to 65 1/2 p, its lowest level
since January 1984 and well below the 250p it reached as recently as last
November. It closed yesterday at 106p.
Investors were not the only people left unhappy. Mr Alaywan had understood
that a commission of 10 per cent, or Pounds 17.6m would be paid to the
intermediaries. In the event, he says, Mr Khashoggi said Mr Rowland would
only pay 1 per cent. Mr Alaywan wrote to Mr Rowland asking for the
commission, but says he has not heard from Lonrho.
Relations between Lafico and Lonrho, however, remained smooth. Much time in
Geneva was devoted to exploring what other joint deals the two might do in
the future.
But yesterday's news that Lonrho's Libyan dealings have triggered an
investigation of the company by the US Treasury Department's Office of
Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) shows the price that Mr Rowland might have to
pay for dealing with Lafico. There is now a real possibility that Lonrho
could be placed on the US government's list of banned companies.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Battle For Midland: Cost savings dictate bank mergers in
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED merger of Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank could become a nightmare
for thousands of workers who might face redundancies, but in cost terms it
could prove an extremely efficient method of rationalising bloated branch
networks.
That, at least, appears to be the initial lesson to be drawn from the
experience of two of the three large-scale bank mergers that have been
agreed over the past year in the United States.
The two mergers that bear comparison are the joining of the Bank of America
and Security Pacific in California and of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers
Hanover Trust in New York.
These two mergers, which resulted in the creation of the second and third
biggest banks in the US in asset terms, were both known as 'in-market'
transactions, combining competitors in the same markets - as opposed to an
'across-market' deal, such as the merger last year of the North
Carolina-based NCNB and the Georgia-based C&amp;S/Sovran.
In UK terms, a Lloyds-Midland link would be the in-market deal, with Hong
Kong and Shanghai's bid for Midland clearly representing the across-market
transaction.
Although initially greeted with scepticism, in-market deals are fast gaining
favour in the US.
The cost savings that can be achieved are, in fact, beginning to outstrip
earlier expectat-ions.
Chemical Banking, as the newly combined Manny Hanny/Chemical institution is
called, has said it expected to save Dollars 750m of annual costs over the
next three years.
This is to be accomplished by cuts across the board, but with a special
focus on administrative and other 'back office' expenses.
By the end of this year, Chemical should have managed more than Dollars 225m
of its cuts, and some analysts reckon its eventual savings will exceed its
Dollars 750m target by Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m a year.
In staff terms, Chemical aims to shed 6,200 jobs out of its combined
starting workforce of more than 43,000. By March 31 of this year - only
three months after the merger was completed - Chemical had already cut 2,500
jobs.
As the third largest US bank, with Dollars 136bn of assets, Chemical is well
positioned to take advantage of future interstate branching possibilities,
assuming the laws are eventually relaxed.
Most of its branch closures are within the New York state area, with a
target of 80 branches out of 430 to be consolidated.
In San Francisco, the Bank of America, which is effectively launching a
rescue of the much weakened Security Pacific of Los Angeles, is also likely
to achieve significant cost cuts because of the merger.
The present forecast is for Dollars 1.2bn of annual savings by 1995, with
some 10,000 to 12,000 of the combined bank's 91,000 jobs being eliminated.
Bank of America needs to sell off 183 branches just to conform to federal
anti-trust guidelines. However, it is likely to close hundreds more as it
integrates its branch network with that of SecPac in California and other
Western states.
The in-market nature of the Bank of America/SecPac union is more broadly
regional than the Chemical Banking case, where the two banks involved in the
merger were literally housed in buildings that faced each other across Park
Avenue.
But with Dollars 180bn of total assets and a position as the second biggest
US bank after Citicorp, the new Bank of America should also emerge in a
strong position for future national growth.
Mr Lew Coleman, vice-chairman of Bank of America, recently described mergers
as 'the only viable option' to eliminate overcapacity in the US banking
industry at a time when legislative reform has been stuck in Congress and
regulatory relief has been largely unavailable.
It is less clear that the creation of Nations Bank out of NCNB and
C&amp;S/Sovran was the only solution for these Southeastern banks.
The Dollars 4.6bn NationsBank deal, which created a regional bank with
Dollars 110bn in assets and a position as the fifth biggest in the US, was
an across-market deal that seemed less urgent.
The merger was, however, a personal triumph for Mr Hugh McColl, the
expansive chairman whose ambitions go beyond his native region.
Even if the creation of NationsBank had a touch more empire building than
the other deals, it is positioned to save on costs.
Some 9,000 jobs - out of 60,000 - are to be eliminated by 1994 and annual
cost savings are now being estimated at Dollars 450m.
A look at these three US bank mergers suggests that the larger cost savings
are being achieved where the institutions are geographically closer
together.
That makes sense, but bankers note there is an important caveat concerning
in-market transactions. While the elimination of duplication in branch,
staffing and administrative costs may be attractive, the putting together of
two banks in the same area may also result in a larger pile of bad debts
from similar clients.
The bad debt issue is especially relevant in New York, where commercial real
estate loan losses have been severe. However, Lloyds and Midland will almost
certainly have some overlapping company lending in the bad debt category.
Bank mergers are nonetheless now considered a practical tool in the US
market, and predictions from bankers and top regulators suggest that by the
year 2000 America's 12,000 banks may be whittled down to as few as 5,000 to
6,000 institutions.
More than anything else, cost saving is driving the trend.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Battle For Midland: TUC chief calls for referral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, added his
voice to calls by trade unions that the proposed Pounds 3.7m bid for Midland
Bank by Lloyds should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, Mr
Willis said the proposed merger had important implications for competition
and service provision in private and business banking.
He said it was reported that a merged bank would control 30 per cent of all
lending to medium-sized and small businesses, an area where banks were
already under criticism for their lending practices.
An emergency motion condemning the bid, with the feared loss of 20,000 jobs
and the closure of 1,000 branches, was passed unanimously by delegates at
the Wales TUC annual conference yesterday.
Mr Leif Mills, general secretary of Bifu, the banking union, said industrial
action would be considered if the merger went ahead.
He accused Lloyds of a 'deafening silence' over what benefits would follow
such a move. He said the reason behind the plan was to create advantages for
those manipulating the money market.

FT  01 MAY 92 / ICI profits rise 7% to Pounds 212m after cost cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK group, yesterday reported increased
pre-tax profits for the first quarter, up 7 per cent to Pounds 212m from
Pounds 198m in the same period a year ago.
The results, achieved on turnover of Pounds 3.055bn against Pounds 3.052bn,
were in line with City forecasts.
However, some analysts were surprised by the poor performance of the
life-science operations and resilience of the specialty chemicals and
materials divisions.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said: 'It is still uncertain when the
difficult trading conditions of the past 18 months will finally be behind
us. There are, however, some signs of recovery in the US and the UK,
particularly in the housing, consumer products, and textile markets.'
The profits were helped by cost-cutting which added about Pounds 55m to the
bottom line. There was also a net gain of about Pounds 20m from the disposal
of the salt business.
Profits at the pharmaceuticals division increased from Pounds 88m to Pounds
122m. New products such as Zestril, Zoladex and Diprivan grew sharply as the
division's turnover increased to Pounds 386m from Pounds 324m. Sales of
Tenormin were disappointing as generic competition in the US made inroads.
The agrochemicals and seeds division reported trading profits of Pounds 48m
down from Pounds 68m on turnover of Pounds 356m against Pounds 375m. Mr
Colin Short, finance director, said this was because of pre-season selling
in France and the US during December, and poor weather. Sales in March had
been good.
Profits at the industrial chemicals division fell from Pounds 35m last year
to Pounds 31m on turnover down from Pounds 966m to Pounds 829m.
Specialities reported profits at Pounds 15m from Pounds 7m on turnover of
Pounds 320m against Pounds 309m; the paints division's profits were Pounds
20m (Pounds 19m) on sales of Pounds 397 (Pounds 362m); the materials
division's profits were Pounds 5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 9m on a
turnover of Pounds 495m (Pounds 507m); and explosives reported profits at
Pounds 9m (Pounds 8m) on a turnover of Pounds 136m (Pounds 121m).
Regional businesses fell from a Pounds 12m trading profit during the first
quarter last year to a Pounds 1m loss. Earnings per share rose 17 per cent
from 17.3p to 20.3p. ICI's shares fell 19p to 1362p.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Scroggs moves quickly to centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CEDRIC SCROGGS was a little-known player at Fisons before he moved to
centre stage last month as chief executive of the pharmaceuticals,
horticultural and scientific instruments group.
Since then, the former chairman of the scientific instruments division has
demonstrated considerable energy. Now he must convince doubters he can help
the company recover.
Fisons' troubles date from 1990 when US Food and Drug Administration
officials became concerned about manufacturing procedures for two products.
The next year they asked Fisons to withdraw both drugs. Neither are back on
the market. Fisons admits the affair has already cost the group Pounds 65m,
equivalent to a quarter of last year's profits.
Over the past 28 days Mr Scroggs has arranged meetings with FDA officials
and adopted and implemented a strategic review to deal with earlier
criticisms. 'We've been dogged by these compliance issues. But they are the
entry fee required to remain in the business,' he said. 'We've taken steps
to get back into the market fast.'
Mr Scroggs hopes the FDA will quickly allow one of the withdrawn drugs, the
hay-fever treatment Opticrom, back into the US where it had sales of about
Dollars 40m. Fisons' management has yet to decide whether the investment
required to resubmit Imferon, a blood product, is worthwhile.
Meanwhile, Mr Scroggs believes the key to success is concentration. He has
already said he wants to sell the generic, non-patented products operations.
Yesterday he announced plans to concentrate further on core operations by
divesting the horticultural and consumer health businesses. 'We were simply
too diversified for a group of our size,' he said.
Fisons' consumer health business was a minnow, Mr Scroggs said. Although it
had good brands, turnover last year was only Pounds 83m. Acquisitions
costing hundreds of millions of pounds would be required for the operations
to gain critical mass.
Similarly, the horticultural division had good businesses that were well
managed. But it did not have the scale required to survive even within the
context of the EC, he said.
Mr Scroggs defended the decision to make the announcement without having
buyers lined up. He said: 'With multiple negotiations going on it would have
been impossible to keep them under wraps. That would have damaged morale
inside the organisation and led to rumours in the City.'
Meanwhile, the policy of concentration will also be implemented within the
pharmaceuticals division. Mr Scroggs said Fisons' expertise would be centred
on anti-inflammatory medicines and drugs for the central nervous system.
Fisons' rigorously independent line to develop and market drugs created by
its research department has also been abandoned. 'We mustn't splinter our
resources,' he said.
Fisons would enter more co-marketing agreements to make up for its lack of
marketing muscle outside the UK, he said. Last month it announced that
Temmler, a subsidiary of Asta Medica, would market its Tilade asthma drug in
Germany.
Mr Scroggs' strategy looks sound. He must now implement it. But some
analysts doubt Mr Scroggs, with no background in pharmaceuticals, is the
right man to spend the money. The pace of change at Fisons has been
impressive. The question is whether the company will accelerate in the right
direction.

FT  01 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y bankssplit over rescue for Canary Wharf

BANK LENDERS to Olympia and York's Canary Wharf office development in east
London are evenly split on whether the UK subsidiary should be placed into
administration under UK insolvency procedures, senior bankers said
yesterday.
Sources close to O&amp;Y's negotiations with the 11 lenders said around a third
of the lenders, including Barclays of the UK, believed administration was
preferable for Canary Wharf.
Three or four other banks, including Lloyds of the UK, were arguing it would
be better to keep Canary Wharf as a going concern under O&amp;Y's ownership. The
remaining banks are undecided. 'The banks' positions can change,' said a
senior banker. However, he pointed out that banks would probably have to
decide next week whether an administrator should be appointed or whether
they would provide a Pounds 30m facility to meet Canary Wharf's financial
needs for the next month.
The 11 lenders have so far provided around Pounds 1bn for the project. The
banks involved include Citicorp of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova
Scotia, also from Canada, Credit Lyonnais of France, and Barclays and Lloyds
of the UK.
On Wednesday, they provided an emergency loan of Pounds 5m to Canary Wharf,
but these funds will be used up in the next few days. O&amp;Y had difficulty
securing even this small sum, bankers disclosed. Credit Lyonnais originally
refused to provide its share of the money, because it felt O&amp;Y was not
providing enough financial information nor making strenuous-enough efforts
to raise the money by selling assets in Canada.
In a separate development relating to O&amp;Y's US operations, Standard &amp;
Poor's, the rating agency, said yesterday negotiations with potential
tenants in a 53-storey building at 55 Water Street in Lower Manhattan had
apparently collapsed.
In downgrading the rating of the single-purpose company which owns the
property, S&amp;P raised doubts whether funds were available to finance
improvements necessary to induce lease renewals or attract new tenants.

FT  01 MAY 92 / OFT opens inquiry into underwriting fees for share issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has begun an inquiry into whether City
institutions are operating a cartel by setting standardised fees for
underwriting share issues. Companies have told the OFT that they are unhappy
about being unable to negotiate costs.
'We are conducting a general inquiry into the fixed costs associated with
underwriting,' the OFT said, adding that no formal investigation was under
way. 'Our concern is whether there is any price-fixing or other
anti-competitive activity going on.'
The fact that all companies are charged the same regardless of the risks
their securities pose or their choice of underwriter had also prompted the
OFT to act.
The spokesman said that while the OFT had not received any formal
complaints, it had been made aware of 'general comment' from companies about
their inability to negotiate fees. It will decide whether to launch a formal
investigation after receiving more information.
The OFT has previously inquired into possible anti-competitive practices in
the sale of securities. Last spring, it opened an informal inquiry into the
sale of Eurobonds after a change in that market's underwriting practices
designed to restore profitability. However, the OFT decided after a few
months that there were no grounds for a formal investigation and dropped the
matter.
In the case of shares, underwriting fees for initial public offerings or
rights issues fall below prescribed levels only in circumstances such as
government privatisation issues.
Brokers receive 0.25 per cent of the total amount sold, while underwriters
earn 0.5 per cent of their portion. Sub-underwriters, typically pension
funds, life insurance companies and institutional fund managers, earn 1.25
per cent.
The OFT wrote in March to several City trade associations seeking
information on how profitable underwriting and sub-underwriting has been for
institutions over the past 10 years and the frequency with which issues
'fail', causing losses for underwriters.
The Institutional Fund Managers Association, the National Association of
Pension Funds and the British Merchant Bankers' Association have received
letters asking them to provide information.
City institutions defend the process of fixed fees, saying that variations
of risk are reflected in the price charged for the shares rather than in the
commissions.

FT  01 MAY 92 / US threatens EC with punitive tariffs over oilseed subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 565m) worth of annual imports from the European Community for its
refusal to comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) panel
ruling against the EC's new oilseed subsidy regime.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US trade representative, said in Geneva that the US
had been patient but given 'the EC's failure to offer an acceptable
resolution today, we have no choice but to initiate this action.'
The European Commission described the US action as 'totally without
justification' and 'counter-productive and inappropriate', because Brussels
had promised to table a compromise solution to Gatt by June.
A formal Commission statement complained the US action lacked 'any legal
basis', because the Gatt council had yet to accept the findings of its
oilseeds panel.
The dispute risks souring already difficult negotiations on farm subsidies
in the stalled Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks.
The US action would raise tariffs on Dollars 1bn of EC exports to the US.
The Community exported Dollars 4.7bn of farm exports to the US, and imported
Dollars 7.15bn of US agricultural produce, in 1990.
Details of the US sanctions will be published shortly. Any measures would
seek to price targeted European products out of the US market.
Brussels' proposed change is to tie aid to EC oil seeds growers to a
requirement that they must take 15 per cent of their arable land out of
production. This 'set aside' provision should mollify US objections by
giving more scope for imports, EC officials said.
The EC told Gatt's governing council, which discussed the second Gatt ruling
against the EC subsidies for the first time yesterday, that it could not
accept the report immediately but would submit a 'concrete proposal' for
settling the long-standing dispute before the next council meeting. This is
tentatively scheduled for mid-June.
Under Gatt procedures, retaliation must be sanctioned by all 103 members and
it is unheard of for reprisals to be threatened on a 'first reading' of a
panel report.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Letter: Defending Britain's vocational education and
training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From VIVIEN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your otherwise excellent article, 'Lessons to be learnt in vocational
training' (April 27), perpetuates the fashionable myth that 'Britain's
training regime is poor, with nothing comparable to Germany's 'dual system'
of work-plus-training'. In fact, the quality of Britain's vocational
education and training at the comparable craft/technician level is much
better than that of Germany, or indeed France, despite the poorer foundation
laid at school. Our problem is that not enough young Britons benefit from
it.
A higher staying-on rate is the proffered solution. But we are in danger of
losing our lead on quality if more do remain, in schools especially, on
poorly resourced vocational programmes which are not complemented with
industrial experience.
The funding regime is the key. The Germans and French do not expect
employers to fund education and training which is not cost-effective. To the
extent that the state does not pay, individuals do in the shape of income
forgone, in return for national qualifications.
Competence-based national vocational qualifications and Training and
Enterprise Councils should help us with quality and numbers, if only the
government would let both operate more flexibly within a national framework.

Sir, In your editorial 'The challenge for the Labour party' (April 30) you

You say that this is what Labour must be. But what you describe is what the

FT  01 MAY 92 / Letter: Lesson in innovation learnt in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GULU LALVANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At the Institute of Directors' convention in London on Wednesday, Mr
Peter Morgan, the director-general, exhorted Britain to become 'the Hong
Kong of Europe'.
For my consumer electronics group, this is more than an enterprise wish; it
is an economic reality.
Britain is, and will remain, the bedrock of Binatone's operation. Why,
though, in a recession, have we forged ahead to become this country's number
one in telephones, displacing BT as market leader?
The answer is that we took a leaf from Hong Kong's book. For 25 years we
have been learning from the Far East. Before the recession got a grip, I
moved my base to Hong Kong, to be sure the group would continue to benefit
from the stream of innovations endemic in Hong Kong culture. These
enlightened attitudes have been promulgated throughout Binatone.
It worked for us. I am convinced that anyone else - car manufacturers,
service businesses - could do the same. With a new, strong governor for the
colony, maybe more companies will reach out to it - and win.

FT  01 MAY 92 / LA law reignites a smouldering resentment: The eruption of
violence in one of America's biggest cities shows deep - rooted and long
ignored racial tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody could have anticipated this verdict.' Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los
Angeles and a black man, was probably expressing the visceral reaction of
the great majority of Americans of all races when four white Los Angeles
police officers were acquitted on Wednesday of savagely beating Rodney King,
also black, after a high-speed car chase. It was an horrific incident
captured on amateur video and replayed endlessly on the nation's television
screens over the 13 months since it took place.
But a lot of people had anticipated or feared what followed in mostly black
south central Los Angeles. Again live, and this time in full colour, the
nation watched aghast as blocks erupted in flames and as innocent motorists
were dragged from cars and trucks and beaten with a savagery equivalent to
that visited on Rodney King. 'I steal a Twinkie (a snack cake) and get six
months, they nearly kill a black man and get off,' said a young black.
'What's going on here?'
What is going on is an issue that this country has been ducking for years.
It embraces race, ethnicity, inner-city decay and the administration of
justice. Some of the circumstances may be peculiar to Los Angeles - in
particular the behaviour of its police department - but most are universal.
Another Bradley, Bill, the Democratic Senator from New Jersey, took to the
Senate floor a month ago in a powerful speech. Having made his name first as
a professional basketball player, a white man in a black sport who learned,
as he put it, to see the city 'through the eyes of my black teammates', his
words carried some authority.
'In politics for the last 25 years, silence or distortion has shaped the
issue of race and urban America. Both political parties have contributed to
the problem. Republicans have played the race card in a divisive way to get
votes - remember Willie Horton - and Democrats have suffocated discussion of
self-destructive behaviour among the minority population in a cloak of
silence and denial. The result is that yet another generation has been lost.
'The divide among races in our cities deepens, with white Americans more and
more unwilling to spend the money necessary to ameliorate the physical
conditions or to see why the absence of meaning in the lives of many urban
children threatens the future of their own children.'
It is a precise and brave analysis. The general flight to the suburbs,
including by middle-class blacks, has rendered the country politically more
indifferent to the plight of inner cities. The relative economic success of
the new wave of immigrants from Asia and Cuba has increased tensions between
minorities, as seen in the disturbances in Miami two years ago, Washington
last year and in Japan Town in Los Angeles on Wednesday night.
The Asian success, in particular, has certainly been taken by Republicans as
a vindication of free market philosophy. The Reagan and Bush
administrations, and the courts they have appointed, have sought to reverse
the classic affirmative action approach of the 1960s, which was designed to
practice, if necessary, reverse discrimination in order to increase the
educational, social and job prospects of blacks.
Thus President Bush nearly vetoed last year's civil rights legislation
because he saw it as being 'a quota bill'. This year, Mr Bill Clinton, who
has run well among those blacks who do vote, has a programme for inner-city
regeneration, centering on public works, incentives to private sector
investment and job training. But he, too, has sensed that it might not be
politically advantageous to go beyond that. If black Americans did feel 25
years ago that past injustices were being redressed, they cannot today.
But Senator Bradley is also right to point to the 'self-destructive'
behaviour of some minorities, and there are plenty of statistics to back
this up. Consider a recent study on Washington, DC, which is about
three-quarters black. The non-profit National Center on Institutions and
Alternatives found that, on any given day last year, no less than 42 per
cent of all black males aged between 18 and 35 were somehow involved with
the criminal justice system. As many as 70 per cent had been arrested by the
time they reached 35.
There are other figures, too. Infant mortality among blacks is double the
national average, more than 40 per cent of all black children live below the
official poverty line, blacks account for nearly 30 per cent of all Aids
cases, while nearly half all US murder victims are black. The depradations
wrought by disease, drugs, other crime and the lack of economic opportunity
are all reflected in these numbers.
If political indifference and manipulation among whites is an exacerbating
factor, it also exists on the other side of the racial divide. For the
national black political leadership is now a shadow of what it was before,
and even for some time after, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.
Only the Rev Jesse Jackson stands as a man of substance, and his political
power is in decline, though not irreversibly.
It was especially ironic that Los Angeles should erupt the night before the
final TV showing of the Bill Cosby programme. For the comedian's black
middle-class situation comedy family, literate, prosperous and caring,
represented in many respects an ideal of an integrated America. Black role
models now are very different; Mike Tyson, the boxer seen by many blacks as
a victim of injustice, Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington,
released last week after serving time for cocaine possession and also seen
as a victim; Los Angeles gang leaders, fighting crime, according to popular
culture, but not exactly playing by the rules of the book. Equally, Clarence
Thomas, the new Supreme Court justice, is seen more as a white pawn, which
would never have been said of his black predecessor on the court, Thurgood
Marshall.
But the failings, and the alienation of blacks, are also institutional. The
Los Angeles police department may be an extreme case. Last summer, after the
Rodney King beating, a special commission, put together by Mayor Bradley and
headed by Warren Christopher, the former undersecretary of state, reported,
devastatingly, on the degree of racism and brutality in the department. It
urged that Daryl F Gates, 13 years the LA police chief and a fierce defender
of his troops, be replaced.
Last month this happened; his job was handed to Willie Williams, a black
with a progressive record running the police in Philadelphia. But Mr
Williams has not moved west yet and it was Mr Gates who has been on the
airwaves constantly in the past 24 hours, defending the acquittals and
condemning the violence afflicting the city.
That the trial took place in neighbouring, affluent Ventura County, and in
front of a jury of 10 whites, an Asian American and an Hispanic, may be
explained by the difficulty of getting a fair hearing in front of an
inner-city jury in Los Angeles itself. But to many blacks that is white
legal sophistry and a further indication of double standards in the practice
of justice.
No wonder the country is tense today; no wonder there are so many appeals
for calm, from the president on down. For what is happening in Los Angeles
could spread, and no one wants a re-run of 1968.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Keating control
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA's new prime minister has made an impressive start. Economic
recovery is under way, inflation has collapsed; interest rates are low; and
Mr Keating's colourful adoption of the republican cause looks a potential
vote-winner. Little wonder that the popularity of the Liberal opposition -
labelled by him a bunch of 'colonial lick-spittelers' - looks increasingly
shaky. But Mr Keating must not get carried away in his desire to fuel the
recovery. Keeping political power may best be achieved by refraining from
exercising it.
The new government's desire to kick-start the recovery is understandable. Mr
Keating's past errors as Treasurer left Labor trailing 20 per cent in the
polls. After six quarters of flat or falling output, with an election
looming and with the memory of 18 per cent interest rates fresh in voters'
minds, Labor has needed to re-establish its economic credibility.
The government was wise to cut interest rates hard last year. Australia
shared with the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world in the mid-1980s asset price
boom following financial deregulation. It faced a similar legacy of high
real interest rates and heavy personal debts and has also paid the price in
terms of lost output.
But Labor has already gone far enough to stimulate activity. Interest rates
have fallen by more than 10 percentage points over the last two years, over
twice as far as in the UK; and with the budget deficit relatively small by
OECD standards, the government has also been able to introduce a
growth-friendly package of higher public spending and tax cuts.
Inflation risk
Indeed, the danger now is not too little but too rapid growth. The fall in
consumer price inflation to just 1.7 per cent is evidence that the past
policy of high interest rates has worked; but not a sign that they should be
cut further. Further stimulus now could quickly lead to rising inflation and
a widening trade deficit.
The government would be wise to sit back and let the already substantial
easing of both monetary and fiscal policy feed through. The policy lags are
long: but output rose in the last quarter of last year and signs from
retailers and the housing market suggest that recovery is underway.
Mr Keating should instead be deciding how best to change the policy
framework to avoid a repeat performance of the latest boom-bust cycle. It is
this imperative which makes studying the OECD's latest report worthwhile.
Its economic forecast is, as always, ludicrously out of date and should be
ignored. The OECD report expects only modest growth; but was finished before
the fiscal package was announced at the end of February.
Independent bank
However, Mr Keating would be wise to follow the OECD's tentative suggestion
and cede control over interest rates to a newly independent Reserve Bank
charged with maintaining low and stable inflation. Mr Keating did, in fact,
do a relatively good job in reducing inflation; but only after it had first
been allowed to run out of control.
Only with a secure macroeconomic framework will the Labour government be
able to pursue its reform agenda confidently. Australia has come a long way
in the last decade from its protectionist and over-regulated past. But there
is further to go: in cutting tariffs, improving transport networks,
deregulating the public sector and raising educational standards.
But Australia should be wary of undermining the system of consensus
wage-bargaining that has guided wage and price expectations over the past
decade. True, the series of national wage accords has prevented changes in
relative wages from effectively signalling shifts in supply and demand to
workers. Australia's labour productivity growth record in the 1980s has not
been impressive; but nor was that of decentralised America. The rapid fall
in wage inflation during the recent recession has not been achieved in
partially decentralised and unco-ordinated Britain.
The Labor government has set itself ambitious goals. But Mr Keating would be
better placed to pursue his constitutional and liberalising agenda if he
were to relinquish control over monetary policy. It might not suit his
character to give up power to his central bank; but the risks of holding on
to the policy reins outweigh the apparent gains of being able to manipulate
interest rates before elections. Mr Keating has already done enough
manipulating.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Risky roads out of recession: UK insurers are reeling from
storms and economic slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA has joined the weather, recession and crime as the bugbears of
British insurers. After last month's bombings in London, UK insurers are
bracing for another round of claims likely to approach Pounds 1bn.
'Partitions and suspended ceilings had collapsed, lights were blown,' said
Mr Nicholas Balcombe, a loss assessor, after surveying the damage caused to
buildings in the City by shock waves from the bomb which exploded outside
the Baltic Exchange on April 10.
'I've never seen damage like that before in England,' added Mr Balcombe,
whose company spent much of last year examining the aftermath of war in
Kuwait.
His comments could apply equally to the state of the UK insurance industry.
The IRA bombs have underlined the harsh fact that UK insurers  - criticised
for their mistakes overseas - are now being humbled in the market they know
best: the UK.
Although they are putting a brave face on recent losses, their balance
sheets have been badly hit by their worst trading results. Financial
weakness is also inhibiting the insurers' capacity to take advantage of the
European single market and exposing them to potential foreign predators.
Last year the pre-tax losses of the UK's five leading composites - companies
which insure a mixture of general and life business - totalled more than
Pounds 1.2bn, double the loss reported for 1990.
UK underwriting losses for the 10 leading general insurers - which include
the composites - were Pounds 3.4bn, up from Pounds 2.2bn in 1990. Sun
Alliance, the biggest of the composites, was the worst-hit. Last year, its
UK underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 713m, contributing to pre-tax
losses of Pounds 466m.
What has gone wrong? First, insurers are suffering the effects of a round of
fierce price competition which is still continuing in some sectors of the
market.
Competition from continental Europe has provided an important stimulus.
Companies from Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and elsewhere
have stepped up their UK activities to take advantage of the single European
market next year. French companies in particular have competed fiercely by
cutting rates to win a share of the lucrative, high-margin insurance bought
by business rather than by individuals.
In response, UK companies in the late 1980s pushed for growth, making market
share the main priority. As a result, some risks were rated at
unrealistically low premiums, and underwriting losses increased. 'Companies
allowed their underwriting standards to slip,' says Mr Robin Mitre of Credit
Suisse First Boston, the securities house.
Second, the industry has been hit by a sharp increase in weather and
recession-related claims. Mr Mitre says: 'Go back two years and no one would
have dreamed it would have been so bad.' Mr Paul Hodges, of James Capel,
another securities house, says the scale of the insurers' difficulties was
'wholly unpredictable. The companies have been utterly luckless. Everything
that could go wrong has.'
The weather: Storms and subsidence caused damage of more than Pounds 3bn
between 1990 and 1991. International reinsurers now judge the UK to be as
risky as the hurricane-prone Caribbean. Sun Alliance, which insures one in
four householders, paid out some Pounds 117m in subsidence claims in 1991,
compared 1980s. Mr Scott Nelson, Sun Alliance's general manager, expects
claims to stay at the higher level through the 1990s.
The recession: A combination of rising interest rates, higher unemployment
and falling house prices has proved a lethal cocktail for insurers
specialising in domestic mortgage indemnity business, in which insurers
cover mortgage lenders against losses they might make on the sale of
repossessed properties. Repossessions have climbed from 15,810 in 1989 to
more than 75,000 in 1991.
Domestic mortgage indemnity claims, and provisions against future claims,
are expected to total nearly Pounds 2bn for 1991 and 1992. Sun Alliance,
Royal Insurance, Eagle Star and Legal and General, which underwrite about 70
per cent of all mortgage indemnity contracts, are expected to be most
affected.
The recession is also linked to an increase in claims related to arson and
theft. During 1991, claims for thefts payments came to Pounds 907.3m, a 52
per cent increase on 1990, according to the Association of British Insurers,
a trade group. 'Theft losses have now reached epidemic proportions,'
commented the securities house S G Warburg in a recent note for clients.
Arson accounted for nearly half the Pounds 1.02bn in fire claims reported
last year.
Legal awards: Liability claims have increased. Insurers of surveyors, for
example, face record claims from homeowners who have lost money as a result
of faulty valuations. The UK's two legal expenses insurers - which pay legal
costs - made big losses in 1991. More generally, the British are picking up
the American habit of turning to the law for redress following, for example,
injuries at work, the failure of companies because of bad advice and the
purchase of defective products by consumers.
Insurers are tackling this array of problems in several ways. Rate increases
have been imposed on most personal insurance - some motorists are paying up
to 50 per cent more for policies than two years ago. In home insurance, the
industry has responded to subsidence by introducing a system of zoning, in
which householders living in subsidence-prone areas, such as the south-east,
pay rates twice as high as counterparts elsewhere.
Insurers are also adopting cost-cutting measures. Staff numbers, which grew
rapidly in the 1980s, have been slashed by about 10 per cent as composites
trim the numbers of clerical staff and middle managers. Branches have also
been closed to cut costs, which for the top 10 groups rose from 29.9 per
cent of premiums in 1986 to 33.9 per cent in 1990.
These measures alone may be enough to restore profitability in the short
term but some critics question whether they are sufficient to bring
long-term strength. Mr John Ginarlis, of PA Consulting, the management
consultancy group, says: 'It is not just a question of putting the rates up
all the time. Ways of doing business have to change.'
Mr Ginarlis and others suggest insurers must win more control over their
distribution channels to reduce costs and establish closer relationships
with customers.
This could involve moves to bypass high street brokers, the industry's
traditional retail outlet for motor business. It may also mean that insurers
will renegotiate deals with building societies which sell most homeowners'
policies in return for commission payments of more than 30 per cent.
Insurers should examine methods of selling direct to the public either by
exclusive agents, as is common in mainland Europe, by direct mail or by
telephone, says Mr Ginarlis. Analysts believe direct sales could account for
as much as 50 per cent of the market within five years, a share already
reached in the US and Australia.
For instance, Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, is a
pioneer of direct telephone sales of motor insurance in the UK. In 1990 it
made profits of more than Pounds 10m, reflecting its good underwriting
results.
Motor and household insurers also need to take action to control the cost of
repair work, which frequently inflates claims. Domestic &amp; General, a small
family-owned company which insures domestic appliances such as fridges and
central heating systems against breakdown, administers the cost of repairs
directly. It has consistently recorded profits in a sector in which the
composites lost money in the early 1980s.
Companies such as D &amp; G are in tune with consumers' growing concern to
obtain quality of service, even if this is more expensive, Mr Ginarlis
believes. He argues that insurers must establish long-term relationships
with customers and move from individual products to the provision of what he
calls 'an all-embracing customer protection service'.
While UK insurers are thus responding positively to criticism, their room
for manoeuvre is limited. Recent losses have eaten into their capital base,
making them vulnerable to foreign predators and undermining their ability to
expand abroad.
Since 1990, asset values have plummeted. The decline in overall stock market
values in 1990 knocked between 30 and 40 per cent of the value of the
composite companies' shareholders' funds, eroding balance sheet strength.
For two years, companies have met losses and financed dividend payments from
reserves, further eroding their capital base.
Sun Alliance, for example, saw its solvency ratio (the yardstick which
measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) fall from
119 per cent at the end of 1989 to 63 per cent at the end of 1991. Other
companies have been hit harder; Royal Insurance's solvency ratio falling to
34 per cent at the end of last year, well over twice the legal minimum but
just four points above a level considered to be adequate by the industry's
regulators.
This decline has been accompanied by a sharp fall in insurers' share prices.
The market capitalisation of Royal, the worst-hit company, has sunk by
two-thirds in two years to less than Pounds 1bn. The strongest, Sun
Alliance, has seen its capitalisation dwindle to about Pounds 2.2bn, less
than a quarter of the capitalisation of Allianz, Germany's and Europe's
biggest insurer.
Mr Claude Bebear, the chairman of AXA, the second-largest French insurance
company, last week reiterated his interest in acquiring a UK composite,
whose prices he believes are now attractive. Other companies, such as Zurich
of Switzerland, and UAP and AGF of France, will also be watching UK
developments though they are not yet prepared to launch hostile bids. There
are signs, however, that UK composites may be viewing the intentions of
foreign rivals more sympathetically.
Last year, Royal agreed to set up a joint venture with two other European
insurers - Fondiaria of Italy and AMB of Germany. Although limited in scope
at present, the move appears designed to protect each company's
independence. In the long term, other UK insurers may be tempted to explore
similar options with European partners. Despite recent improvements, their
current trading conditions may leave them with few alternatives. If they
fail to ally themselves with stronger partners, names such as Guardian Royal
Exchange may become extinct.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: Claude Brumachon - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French 'modern dance' is one of the curiosities of the theatrical decade.
For years, France welcomed the experiments of visiting American creators
with a characteristic eagerness for the new. The consistently vital
programming at the Theatre de la Ville in Paris, the wonderful Biennale de
la Danse in Lyon, the choreographic competition at Bagnolet, are symptomatic
of this willingness to enjoy innovation. The decision to start propagating
more of the home-grown product, to bring into being a nationally
indentifiable modern dance, a manifestation of the 1980s in France, and
extensive coverage in the magazine Les Saisons de la Danse offers valuable
testimony to this.
If ministerial and departmental patronage, and a committed public, are
enough, then France has a lively Free Dance identity. The problem is, as I
have discovered to my cost, that much of this dance is rootless, provincial,
intellectually costive. Though we starve much of our own new dance, the work
of Robin Howard and Robert Cohan for the London Contemporary Dance Trust
gave modernism strong roots, physical credibility through excellence of
schooling and essential points of reference for development and even
rejection. In France, this foundation is missing.
The Place has been generous in offering a showcase to dance troupes, from
Britain and Europe. Alastair Macaulay and I have charted on this page the
torrent of ineptitude - it could not be otherwise - and recorded with
hosannas the arrival of some few vital talents. The evenings of French dance
have been, in the main, very taxing on a critic's willingness to enjoy, and
never more so than on Tuesday night when Claude Brumachon returned with his
troupe. Brumachon's ensemble forms the Centre Choregraphique at Nantes. His
programme provides two works (each lasting 50 minutes) of staggering tedium.
The first (Eclats d'Absinthe) shows four men and five women having hell in a
Hamam, repeating feeble little gestures ad nauseam, and slamming their
bodies about with a fine disregard for breakage. It is a terrible indictment
of mixed bathing.
The second piece, Fauves, is worse: more repetitious, more pretentious, and
even less probable as choreography. For part of the time the cast behave as
if in the last stages of delirium tremens. One chap strikes oriental poses
and makes ungainly little runs, as if it were his turn this week to
impersonate Ruth St. Denis. There is a good deal of heavy breathing.
Costuming is uniformly hideous, and the sound tracks are detestable.
Lighting is excellent.
Advance publicity spoke of dance 'passionate, sensuous, erotic' - the writer
is probably driven mad with lust by blotting paper - and one woman in the
cast obligingly went topless all evening. In the closing moments, Brumachon
pulled off a most beautiful image as a man and woman in trailing garments
lay on some parallel bars while a second man became a boatman ferrying them
to eternity. But this was no compensation for the aeons of aversion therapy
that had preceded it.
'The Turning World' season continues with varying troupes at The Place,
Duke's Rd, WC1, until May 23

FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: The Humana Festival, Louisville - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Why do we have the Humana Festival? Because I live in Louisville, Kentucky,
and I want to live in an interesting place.' Thus John Jory, producing
director of the Actors Theatre of Louisville, explains the hidden agenda
behind the Humana Festival of new American plays, which he founded 16 years
ago and has now become America's premiere trade show.
During Special Visitors Weekend, - 'big weekend' to locals, the penultimate
weekend of the six-week festival - a dizzying array of agents, theatre
professionals and critics from New York, Hollywood, the regions and abroad
convene to sift through the festival's offerings looking for next season's
hit. Most who came to Louisville to 'shop' this year were disappointed - a
representative of one large dramatic publisher said it was the weakest for
ten years.
In purely theatre-business terms, few of the plays at Humana were viable
products which could, in their present states, make it on to Broadway, but
since Broadway is more interested in money than art, that says little about
their artistic merit. Jory thinks that much of the exciting work in the
American theatre is happening outside the mainstream and many
non-traditional plays were featured in this year's festival. He will
continue to present adventurous work in future festivals, whether commercial
producers like it or not.
The most exciting play in the festival was Jose Rivera's Marisol. Rivera's
play is similar in scope and theme to Tony Kushner's Angels in America, now
enjoying a successful run at the National Theatre in London. Both plays
portray a pre-millennial America in such dire straits that angels come down
to save it. While Kushner takes Aids as his central theme, Rivera addresses
the alienation of minority cultures in urban America.
Marisol (played by Karina Arroyave) is a young professional Puerto Rican
American who denies her background every time she goes to work: 'I amputated
neat sections of my cultural heritage . . . keeping so much pain so far deep
inside my Manhattan bosses and Manhattan friends and my broken Bronx
conscientiousness never even suspected.'
Marisol lives in a New York where apples are extinct, the moon is hiding
behind Saturn's rings, and her guardian angel deserts her to lead a
celestial rebellion against God. No longer protected from the horrors of
urban life, she wanders into a nightmare world of lunatics, neo-Nazis and
credit card debt collectors.
Rivera interweaves possible and impossible situations - some clearly
imaginary, some familiar from the news, some, says the programme note, from
Rivera's own life - constantly displacing the viewers' sense of what is
real. Rivera succeeds in reminding the audience that Mirasol's world is
becoming our own. But his message is one of hope.
In the final moments of the play the angels are joined in their battle by
'the disenfranchised of the earth . . . the poor, the homeless, the
frightened.' Mirasol's guardian angel - a butch black woman in leather and
high-top sneakers - crowns herself lord of the new millennium and, in
director Marcus Stern's final stroke of genius, stepped out of the world of
the play into the theatre's elevator for her final exit. London's Royal
Court has Mirasol, and American productions at La Jolla Playhouse in
California and the New York Shakespeare Festival are in the works.
Another highlight of the festival was Jane Anderson's Lynette at 3 O'Clock,
co-winner of the National 10-Minute Play Contest. The play featured witty
and well-wrought dialogue, and the Humana production had one flash of
directorial inspiration: by slipping a bed on its side and standing the
actors against it the viewers had the ceiling's eyeview of the sleepless
Lynette and her boyfriend Bobby, which Anne O'Sullivan as the loopy Lynette
exploited hilariously.
The other Contest winner, Lanford Wilson's Eukiah, was a moody tale of
deceit, well played by Mark Shannon and Shaun Powell; the third 10-Minute
offering, Joyce Carol Oates' Procedure, a spare exploration of people's need
to dull their responses to death. Both productions aspired and achieved
modestly.
Local audiences loved Marsha Norman's D. Boone, which celebrates Kentucky's
hero Daniel Boone and refers heavily to Kentucky lore. Actors Theatre
commissioned the play, which was funded by the Honourable Order of Kentucky
Colonels, a charitable organisation. Norman's dialogue is witty and crisply
written, but the play is troublingly schematic.
The central character is a contemporary woman, Flo, who dislikes her world
so much that she wills herself into the past to be with a perfect 'real man'
 -Boone. The play becomes an uncomfortable mix of Back-to-the-Future caper
and contemporary domestic drama, with various of Flo's suitors joining her
in 18th century Boonesborough and finding therapy for their personal
problems by helping Boone battle the Indians. Flo, though, never stops
defining herself by the men around her, and some of Norman's other
characterisations are equally troubling  - implacable Indians, and a gay
museum curator who gains real man status in Boone's world.
The two other festival plays addressing American history and culture were
not nearly as slick as Norman's, but more admirable in intent and
imagination. John Conklin's The Carving of Mount Rushmore is an
investigation of the creative process, mixing historical monologues about
the creation of the mountain monument with poetry, music, and visual images.
Conklin, an accomplished designer, designed and directed the Humana
production, which was certainly beautiful to look at, but came across more
as a work-in-progress than a finished product.
Evelyn and the Polka King, by book writer John Olive, lyricist Bob Lucas and
composer Carl Finch, is also not finished yet, but could, when complete,
trigger a renaissance of that most mid-Western of musical forms. Even Big
Weekend's icy Saturday night audience was thawed by Hank Czerniak's (Tom
Ligon) second-act sing-along, 'I lover to hear the vendor shout, kielbasa
beer and sauerkraut.'
The festival's more conventional productions were well-wrought and executed
 -The Old Lady's Guide to Survival, by Mayo Simon, a funny and touching
exploration of ageing and Alzheimer's, and Ross Maclean's Hyaena, a strongly
gripping evocation of a world of twisted values that successfully forces
viewers to re-evaluate their own.
Under Mladen Kiselov's tight direction, William McNulty gave a harrowing
performance as the Hyaena, a carer of the sick and dying who preys on their
agony, and Michael Hartman excelled as his victim.
Two one-acts, David Henry Hwang's Bondage and Suzan-Lori Parks' Devotees in
the Garden of Love, presented under the heading 'Rites of Mating', were
interesting but eventually unsatisfying experiments. Hwang and director
Oskar Eustis investigated preconceptions about race by wrapping the
performers, Asian-American actor BD Wong (Tony Award winner for his
performance in Hwang's M. Butterfly) and Caucasian actor Kathryn Layng in
full-length leather as they played out sexual fantasies based on the racial
stereotypes in an S &amp; M parlour.
Parks' rich language was the highlight of her play about disappointment in
the courtship wars, whose meaning, however, remained opaque to most viewers.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: Stephen Oliver - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Oliver, who has died at the age of 42, was an English theatre
composer of extraordinarily profuse gifts. By the time he was 20 he had
written a Duchess of Malfi opera, a number of other operas, and an even
larger number of pieces in various smaller musico-dramatic forms. The
remainder of his tragically short life he devoted to pouring out an
abundance of music of every sort - not just to serve dramatic purposes,
though this tended to bulk large in his work-list, but also for orchestras,
chamber ensembles and singers of all sorts.
He was a choirboy at St Paul's Cathedral before going on to Oxford, where
his Duchess of Malfi first attracted wide attention. Thereafter, his ability
to produce works of both effortless practicality and immediately attractive
character in every style and form drew him to the notice of television, film
and theatre companies. The scores for the celebrated RSC adaptation of
Nicholas Nickleby and for the musical Blondel (written by Tim Rice) stand
out among a vast number of others.
In the purely operatic field, apart from the early Duchess of Malfi and the
1976 Tom Jones staged by the now defunct English Music Theatre, he will
probably be best remembered for the various adaptations that he made for the
Musica nel chiostro Festival at Batignano in Italy, and for the beautifully
elegant, well-made Beauty and the Beast opera (1984) commissioned by the
same source.
Last year's ENO commission, Timon of Athens, proved to be an attempt at a
large-scale work that failed, perhaps because of its insistence - so
uncharacteristic of Oliver - on aiming at a 'big statement' opera rather
than a practical, purposeful vehicle for singers. (No doubt this was because
Oliver wrote it when he was already an advanced Aids sufferer.)
The works of his that one guesses will last are those in which his
imaginative light touch, witty approach to word-setting and profoundly (but
never self-consciously) civilised musicianship found a just balance. As well
as being a musical performer of many parts, he was a gifted writer and a
splendidly ebullient conversationalist who regularly took part in radio
discussion programmes.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Citibanker for EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Hexter is moving after 20 years at Citibank to head up and build the
financial institutions group of the merchant banking side of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
An experienced commercial banker, he already knows eastern Europe from Citi.
Since 1988 he has been divisional executive for the US bank's central and
Eastern European operations, where his role included overseeing the
establishment of two wholly owned subsidiaries, in Czechoslovakia and in
Poland, last year. Citi, one of the foreign banking pioneers in the region,
has also had a joint venture with the National Bank of Hungary in Budapest
since 1985.
Hexter, 43, is attracted to the EBRD job 'because the brief is a much
broader and more difficult one'. He describes the mandate as catalysing the
growth of private sector financial institutions in the former eastern bloc.
This will entail a combination of direct equity investment from the EBRD,
sometimes in tandem with foreign shareholders, as well as a raft of
technical assistance to existing, mostly state-owned local entities, along
the path towards privatisation.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Bringing wizardry to book: The arrival of a new
generation of consumer electronics products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you get when you blend the latest in communications, computer and
consumer electronics technologies into a single pocket-sized device? The
answer, US electronics industry executives are predicting, is a potentially
huge market for a broad new class of electronic gadgetry.
Examples may include an electronic calendar and phone book with a built-in
telephone or an electronic reference book or service manual that displays
text and graphics, an electronic notebook you can write on, or a pocket
facsimile machine.
The key elements of these futuristic products are miniature computers with
built-in communications capabilities. Speech recognition, handwriting
recognition and interactive video will play an important role in making this
new generation of electronics products far easier to use than today's
personal computers or even conventional consumer electronics products such
as video tape recorders.
Silicon Valley is abuzz with excitement about the potential for a new market
that might consume vast quantities of semiconductor chips and provide new
opportunities for computer manufacturers and software developers.
'We think there are going to be billions of these devices out there, and at
some point sales of these new devices will surpass those of personal
computers. We are guessing what is going to happen before the end of the
century,' says John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer.
Firing the imagination of Apple and many other companies is the prospect of
a 'fusion' of the computer, communications, information services, publishing
and office equipment industries, driven by the emergence of common digital
technologies, to form a Dollars 3 trillion (million million) 'information
industry' by 2000.
Apple plans to launch its first 'personal digital assistant' to address this
nascent market next year. 'Newton', according to industry insiders, will be
a notepad-sized tablet with a pen, instead of a keyboard. It is expected to
incorporate a diary, phone book and other 'personal organiser programs'.
Although Apple is the most visible contender for a share of the emerging
personal electronics market, it is not alone. IBM, AT&amp;T and Hewlett-Packard
also have their eyes on the prize, and Japan's consumer electronics
companies are not ignoring developments.
Sharp Electronics, of Japan, has partnered with Apple to manufacture its
first personal electronics product. Sony is also expected to be involved in
Apple's future consumer electronics efforts.
Hewlett-Packard is planning to build a family of 'information appliances'
following the success of its first hand-held computer, the 95LX, with sales
of more than 100,000 units over the past year.
'I think you can imagine whole classes of products that allow computer users
to go everywhere with sophisticated networks,' says John Young, HP chief
executive. HP will not reveal details of its product plans but the company
says that it aims to address needs that have not been met by its first
hand-held computer such as a larger screen and keyboard, for word processing
applications, and a pen interface with handwriting recognition.
And then there are the start-up companies, each aiming to become 'the next
Apple Computer', by conquering the market for carry-along computers. General
Magic, an Apple spin-off, is said to be developing a 'personal
communicator', but is keeping details of its product plans quiet.
Eo Computer, a potential competitor, is using a pen interface for a similar
product. Poqet Computer, a pioneer in the hand-held computer market, has
also launched a pen-computer that it is aiming at 'walking workers' such as
delivery services and policemen, who must fill in forms or record customer's
signatures.
Poqet is sceptical about the more ambitious plans of other pen computer
manufacturers and maintains that the broader market will not develop until
handwriting recognition technology is improved.
Other technical factors that could retard market growth of personal
electronics devices include the difficulties associated with incorporating
cellular or radio communications in a battery-powered computer.
'Power consumption remains an issue for wireless communications,' says John
Vermes, vice-president of market development at Vadem, a company that has
designed notebook and laptop computers for several leading manufacturers.
Current colour flat panel displays are also power hungry, making it
difficult to incorporate them in battery-powered computers.
Price will also be an important factor in the development of a mass market.
It is generally agreed that the first generation of information appliances
must be offered at no more than Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 565). To reach a
broader market, however, they will have to sell for less than half of that
price.
Another problem is that nobody has yet been able to come up with a suitable
name for these products. 'Pocket computers' is as good as any, but computer
makers are shying away from it because they believe that computers are
intimidating and ultimately many of these products will be aimed at
consumers.
Industry consultants sometimes refer to the new class of products as
'sub-notebook' computers because they are smaller than the standard notebook
computer and in some cases may be larger than a pocket computer. 'Companion
computer' is another suggestion.
Apple Computer calls them 'personal digital assistants', while
Hewlett-Packard favours 'information appliances'. Whatever they are called,
they are surely to become ubiquitous if the amount of money and energy that
is being applied to bringing them to market is any indication.
Nevertheless, several important marketing questions remain. The big issue is
whether information appliances should be dedicated to a range of related
tasks, or whether that should be general-purpose computers which, like
desktop personal computers, can be reprogrammed to perform new tasks.
Apple sees digital personal assistants as dedicated devices. 'Unlike PCs
which are general-purpose products, personal digital assistants will focus
on specific functional capabilities,' says Sculley.
But according to Microsoft, the leading personal computer software
developer, that is a mistake. 'Focusing on a dedicated device is an example
of applying old thinking to a new problem,' says Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft
product planning executive.
'Anything that you can do in a dedicated device today you will end up being
able to do better in a more general-purpose device very soon,' he maintains.
Microsoft regards hand-held computers as another platform for its system and
applications software and recently announced an extension of its popular
'Windows' program for pen computers.
Yet compatibility with desktop computers is not necessarily important in the
emerging market for carry-along computerised tools. If sales meet
expectations, many users of personal electronics devices will not be
personal computer users.
The promise of a huge new market is buoying the spirits of recession-weary
American electronics companies. Despite their enthusiasm some fear that the
'personal digital assistant' may turn out to be another short-term wonder
like the digital watch.
There is also an underlying fear among US companies that, like the video
game and the video tape recorder, the market for this new generation of
consumer electronics products may ultimately be dominated by foreign
manufacturers.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Management: Knives are out in the boardroom - Christopher
Lorenz welcomes evidence that non-executive directors are at last flexing
their muscles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seldom can company chairmen and chief executives have been more nervous than
they are this spring. Not only are bosses on both sides of the Atlantic
facing the renewed threat of corporate takeover, but they are also suffering
a much more personal fear - of being knifed by their own board colleagues.
General Motors set the trend last month when its outside directors took
action after years of intense frustration at the leviathan's poor
performance. They demoted the company's chairman by ousting him from his
post as head of GM's top strategic forum. This sent tremors throughout
corporate America: if it could happen at GM, it could happen anywhere.
Now the chairman of Britain's Barclays Bank, Sir John Quinton, seems to have
suffered an even worse fate by being asked to give up his executive duties
earlier than he had intended. His sin was not only to preside over Barclays'
sliding performance through the recession. He also made several odd
decisions, such as somehow finding the time to become chairman of England's
controversial new Premier soccer division.
To many people, moves like those at GM and Barclays represent a new and
welcome era in better corporate governance: the overdue flexing of muscles
by non-executive directors, often in concert with institutional
shareholders, when a company fails to deal promptly with its problems.
But how new is the trend? And how much does it really promise for better
governance?
The Quinton affair will send as many shock waves through British boardrooms
as has GM's in the US. But it is not a new development: back in late 1990
and 1991, as the recession tightened its grip, the non-executive directors
and institutional shareholders of a number of over-extended, medium-sized
companies dispatched the offending bosses summarily. These events could just
spell a new era in governance, but there is a host of reasons why they do
not necessarily do so.
For one thing, such cases are still the minority, and still generally occur
too late to avoid the company being damaged in the meantime. The last
chairman of British Aerospace was allowed to hang on far too long before
being deposed.
In many cases, as the labyrinthine Maxwell scandal demonstrated only too
graphically, non-execs remain supine or powerless in the face of a
chairman's neglect of the business, or even his suspected misuse of it.
This may be because he has used his old boy network to appoint a bunch of
cronies - as is the case far too often - but this is not necessarily the
reason.
Just as debilitating to the potential power of quite respectable non-execs
may be any of the following:
The paucity of their number relative to that of the executive directors.
There is still no minimum requirement for the number of non-executive
directors (some boards have none at all), and very few British companies
have a majority of non-executives on their board, unlike their US
counterparts.
Their inadequate representation on audit, nomination and remuneration
committees, not all of which exist in many companies in any case.
Insufficient mechanisms to ensure that they have access to the same
information, formal and otherwise, as the executive directors.
Even when they do possess such information, they may not have time to digest
it and organise the necessary political consensus in support of their point
of view.
Even if they are capable of acting independently, non-execs who are
full-time managers of one company may pull their punches when acting in a
non-executive capacity elsewhere, out of an innate fear of encouraging
non-execs on their own boards to rock the boat too often.
The list could be lengthened still further. Most fundamental of all, in the
words of John Scott-Oldfield, a management consultant who has helped
construct a number of very effective UK boards, 'the capability of
non-executives is only as good as the chairman allows the board process to
be. He must be both enlightened and open'.
In principle (though once again, not necessarily), this is more likely to be
the case if the chairman's role is split from that of the chief executive.
Theoretically, non-execs should be able to exert most influence when the
chairman is also non-executive, and therefore identifies his interest
closely with theirs. But plenty non-executive chairmen are merely
figureheads who are given the run-around by a powerful chief executive or
managing director. One well-known MD used to snigger whenever his non-exec
chairman's name was mentioned.
It may be pure coincidence that at two of the UK companies where non-execs
have most clout, B0C and Grand Metropolitan, the jobs of chairman and chief
executive have not been separated. What this does suggest is that the degree
of enlightenment of the person in the top post can be more important than
the formal structure of his or her job.
That said, such best practice is rare, and enlightenment is a less common
and reliable commodity than are formal safeguards.
So the new UK Director of Public Prosecutions, Barbara Mills, was right in
principle at this week's Institute of Directors' annual convention to
advocate separation of the top two roles. This can also be done by adopting
the American habit of splitting the post of 'chief operating officer' from
that of the executive chairman.
As well as advocating 'active and effective' non-executive directors, Mills
called for the creation of audit, nomination and remuneration committees.
There is certainly a need for either regulation or legislation to guarantee
non-executives exclusive membership of audit and remuneration committees.
Instead of relying on 'recommendations', like so many half-hearted past
efforts at corporate governance in Britain, the Cadbury Committee on the
subject should advocate that these moves, and others, be enforced.
Only then will all Britain's public companies, rather than just a few, start
to be governed properly.
In the meantime, directors of most large enterprises will continue to harm
employee motivation, and their companies' reputations, by paying themselves
too much, and by clutching at corporate power long after they should have
quit.
