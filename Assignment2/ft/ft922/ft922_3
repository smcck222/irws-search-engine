AFGHANISTAN appears set for a new power struggle with signs of renewed
tension between the country's interim President, Mr Sibghatollah Mojaddedi,
and his rival mujahideen leaders, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
Mr Mojaddedi is due to step down on Sunday under a two-month-old agreement
between mujahideen factions, and hand over power to another interim
government which would hold elections. However, he has made clear he wants
to stay on. 'I am not interested (in staying in power). But I cannot ignore
the people's will and expectations,' he said this week addressing supporters
in Kabul who asked him to stay in office.
Said one supporter: 'We will wage jihad (holy war) against anyone who
opposes him. We have enough power.'
The president's statement came only a day after an official spokesman
announced in Kabul that he would not step down on Sunday.

<TEXT>
THE volume of laundered drug money, estimated at Dollars 85bn (Pounds 46bn)
in the US and Europe four years ago, has remained high in spite of the
efforts of a task force set up to combat it by the leading industrialised
nations at their 1989 economic summit.
'I cannot imagine that the figure has dropped since we started,' Mr Alexis
Lautenberg, a Swiss foreign ministry official, said yesterday. Mr
Lautenberg, who has chaired the task force in the past year, said that even
though many countries, including Switzerland, had introduced measures to
prevent drug money laundering, the activity had merely shifted
'geographically and institutionally'.
Money launderers were moving to eastern European and far eastern countries
and using unregulated institutions and more circuitous paths.
The report also revealed that many of the 27 governments participating in
the task force had not yet implemented many of its recommendations,
especially those requiring legal action. Only 10 have ratified the 1988
Vienna Convention criminalising drug money laundering.
Progress will be accelerated next year when member countries of the European
Community and European Economic Area will have to comply with the EC money
laundering directive. It will oblige all financial institutions to know the
identity of their customers, to keep full records and to report any
suspicious transactions to the authorities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, yesterday made clear that
Brussels would be giving up none of its current powers over competition to
satisfy calls for lighter Commission involvement in member states' affairs.
In a speech in Bonn, Sir Leon held up Commission competition policy as a
prime example of subsidiarity in action.
His speech follows hard on the heels of comments by Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, on Wednesday which suggested that the principle could
be applied more widely to 'competition and state aids rules'.
Sir Leon underlined that existing Commission practice when dealing with
state aid, mergers, cartels and alleged abuses of a dominant position
already provided for national action where appropriate.
He reminded his audience that the Commission had recently devolved to member
states the responsibility for investigating many subsidies to small and
medium-sized companies. He said he was planning to clarify the role of
national courts in applying EC competition law.
But he was adamant about which authority should examine state aid which
might distort competition across the Community. 'No country can police
itself, and yet policing is clearly essential if a true common market is to
exist,' he said. 'The way to apply the principle of subsidiarity in this
area is not for the Commission to absolve itself from its responsibility.'
'It is true that the thresholds (above which mergers are automatically
examined in Brussels) are too high at present to include in the Community's
jurisdiction all concentrations having Community-wide effects,' he said.
Competition officials are examining whether the threshold level should be
lowered when it comes up for review next year.
Sir Leon also repeated his view that anti-competitive mergers with an effect
on the world market should be covered by new rules under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
'Just as a single member state may not always be able to deal effectively
with competition-distorting practices, the Community itself is sometimes too
small to do so,' he said.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Working time directive will affect UK the
most
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's working time directive, now limping towards the EC
statute book, will have only a marginal effect on working time in most EC
countries. But, eventually, it could come to be seen as a watershed in UK
industrial relations.
Britain, and to a lesser extent Ireland and Denmark, will for the first time
have to introduce statutory minimum employment rights covering the working
week, annual holidays, night shifts and minimum daily rest periods.
The UK government has succeeded in stripping out what it found most
objectionable, and UK and European employers' bodies have generally welcomed
the outcome for a directive that most of them opposed in principle. Equally,
the trade union vision of a net of basic Europe-wide minimum standards at
work has edged forward enough for Mr Norman Willis, president of the
European Trades Union Congress, to hail the agreement as a 'major step'.
The most critical response came from the UK Institute of Directors which
said: 'We have conceded to the EC the right to lay down Britain's labour
laws. This deal opens the door for the many other social and employment
measures which the EC has lined up.'
In fact, the EC has already laid down labour laws relating to mobility,
health and safety, and written contracts of employment, among other things,
and after the exhausting dispute over the working time directive there is
unlikely to be a rush into further legislation.
Indeed, the working time directive itself has still not been passed. There
is an 'understanding' between the 12 employment ministers covering most
important aspects of the directive but a dispute between the French and
German governments has held up a final deal, probably until December. A
further three years then elapse before the directive becomes law. Several
categories of worker, such as the self-employed, and some industries, such
as transport, are indefinitely exempted.
In the UK, most attention has been focused on the proposed 48-hour limit on
the working week - averaged over at least three months - and the suggestion
that Sunday should 'in principle' be the day of rest.
The Sunday proposal has been diluted and the UK has won a special exemption
allowing overtime over 48 hours provided it is voluntary. Britain will,
however, have to provide legal protection for workers who do not want to
work more than 48 hours a week, and employers may have to keep additional
working time records.
The other 11 countries - where employees will not be allowed to work over 48
hours - will only have to make small changes to present arrangements. As the
table shows, most of the 11 already have weekly or daily limits. When
overtime, itself restricted, is added, some employees in those countries do
currently breach the 48 hour limit by a few hours.
The other important proposals in the directive are: minimum three weeks'
paid holiday rising to four weeks in 1999; an eight-hour limit on night
shifts; an 11-hour minimum daily rest period and 35 hours' consecutive rest
once a week.
All the above - except for the holiday proposal - are subject to revision if
employers and employees agree at local or national level.
The holiday legislation will affect Germany which has a minimum of 18 days;
Greece, where there is no paid holiday for the first year; Ireland which has
three weeks and Italy which has no minimum. But UK employers will be most
affected. The Low Pay Unit estimates that 1.3m employees have no paid leave
at all and 3m have less than four weeks.

<TEXT>
THE lower house of the Dutch parliament yesterday voted to ratify the
Schengen treaty on eliminating border controls in the heart of the European
Community.
The treaty removes border controls between eight of the 12 EC states.
To take effect, all five original signatories - France, Germany, Belgium,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands - must ratify it. Belgium and Germany still
have to put the treaty to the vote. Spain, Portugal and Italy also belong to
the Schengen group.
The Dutch vote of 123 in favour and 23 against the treaty in the 150-seat
lower chamber brings to an end a prolonged and sometimes hotly-engaged
debate on its future.
Ten backbench MPs of the Labour-Christian Democrat coalition rebelled
against the government and cast votes against the Schengen treaty. It is
expected to be ratified by the upper chamber in the autumn.
Some Dutch parliamentarians objected because of its stricter procedures for
refugees seeking asylum in Europe and for the way it was negotiated without
prior parliamentary control. Last year, the Council of State, the highest
government advisory body, also criticised some of its provisions.
The agreement is named after a village in Luxembourg where the original
treaty was signed in 1985. Since then Italy, Spain and Portugal have joined
the group.
Greece has observer status, leaving Britain and Ireland as the only EC
members completely outside the Schengen group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Maastricht Treaty may be in doubt. But for precisely that
reason, a Maastricht syndrome is already shaping the way the European
Community does business.
There is a general and over-arching debate about 'subsidiarity' - trying to
separate what the EC should be responsible for and what member states should
keep. The working time directive is the prime example of how uncertainty
over the EC's future is already bending legislation plans, and introducing
the sort of 'opt-outs' pioneered at December's Maastricht summit.
Late Wednesday night this controversial draft law came within a whisker of
being the first practical example of how the EC moves forward while its
members go at different speeds, via routes different enough to obscure the
actual direction. What was agreed exemplified the increasingly touted
'Europe a la carte,' or 'variable geometry,' through which countries pick
and choose the policies they feel comfortable with.
Alone among its partners, the UK had steadfastly opposed this EC proposal to
put a uniform 48-hour limit on the working week.
Nevertheless, after intensive negotiations between the UK, France and
Germany, designed to accommodate the different political needs of these
three largest member states, the 'British problem' was solved. Only an
ostensibly technical disagreement between the French and Germans postponed
full consensus.
The solution shows how the new system works. Britain will be able to
postpone the 48-hour week for initially ten years, after when there will be
an EC 'review' which legally, at least, does not prejudice the outcome.
This is as far away as one can get from a 'derogation', or time limited
exemption, towards an 'opt-out', without actually arriving. 'A masterpiece
of draftsmanship,' said one senior Irish diplomat with more than a hint of a
smile.
It is also an instance of the multi-speed Europe foreshadowed at Maastricht,
mainly through the UK's opt-out there from its partners' plans to develop EC
social policy.
The need for a show of EC unity, if not consensus, on the eve of today's
Lisbon summit of Community leaders and following the Danish rejection of
Maastricht, drove the 11th-hour negotiations on the directive. For the UK,
equally important was the preservation of the government's intention of
operating in "the heart of Europe' - and securing its strengthening alliance
with Germany.
When push came to shove, however, it was Germany which three times
interceded to ensure the UK would not be outvoted, and France which picked
up the ball to negotiate the final compromise with Britain.
Both France and Germany were anxious to protect Britain's Tory government
from its Euro-sceptic supporters, who see labour market deregulation as a
Thatcherite shibboleth.
Yet France, after pulling on board the UK, then decided to hold up final
agreement. Paris, facing a referendum on Maastricht, fears that a directive
which appears to dilute social provisions could invite attack from the
mainly Communist left, which is hostile to the treaty, according to a senior
EC official.
Denmark's rejection of Maastricht has led to more than usually acidulous
devotion to national concerns in EC decision-making. For the moment this
mostly favours the big countries on whom the treaty's future depends.
But, as the sort of legal arabesques, procedural fudges, and vigorously
prosecuted special pleading evidenced in the working-time directive become
more acceptable, Europe a la carte collects credentials.
This is just the sort of loosening wanted by the UK, which takes over the EC
presidency next week.

PROPOSALS to give women throughout the European Community a minimum standard
of paid maternity leave face an uncertain future following the Council of
Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Wednesday.
The European parliament had previously voted in favour of women having at
least 14 weeks' maternity leave on 80 per cent of their pay - a measure also
backed by the European Commission.
However, some countries within the Council of Ministers, including the UK,
argued the level was too high and a compromise was reached at the end of
last year giving a level of pay equivalent to each country's sick pay
provision.
Italy decided on Wednesday that this position was unacceptable and wants,
instead, to adopt the higher payments put forward by the European
parliament.

<TEXT>
LEADERS of Germany's 16 federal states yesterday claimed to have broken the
deadlock in their negotiations with the government over ratification of the
Maastricht treaty on European union.
A compromise agreed with constitutional experts from the main political
parties would provide the states with a significant increase in their power
to control any future transfer of sovereignty to Brussels.
However, Chancellor Helmut Kohl last night refused to give the deal his
final blessing, pending close analysis by the government's own legal
advisers. He is also conscious of deep anxiety amongst his own foreign
policy advisers, and in the German Foreign Ministry, that the agreement
could severely limit the government's room for manoeuvre in future EC
negotiations.
Key to the agreement is a new clause in the German constitution, to replace
the existing clause on German reunification, made redundant by the events of
the past two years.
The text worked out by the constitutional experts, and due to be presented
to the full constitutional committee of the two houses of parliament today,
includes a formal commitment to the goal of European union. That is defined
as based on democracy, the rule of law, and the social and federal
principles underlying the German constitution - as well as the principle of
subsidiarity.
The Bundesrat - the upper house of the German parliament in which the 16
states are directly represented - will in future have an effective veto on
any further transfer of sovereignty which is not seen in Germany as matching
those preconditions. That would almost certainly mean an insistence that any
future EC reforms must include very substantial strengthening in the powers
of the European parliament, in order to ensure democratic control.
The key point still at issue between the German government and the states is
the question of involvement in on-going EC decision-making. They agree that
the states can in future nominate an alternative representative in EC
negotiations for matters which are their exclusive responsibility. A new
form of words requires the government 'to take substantial account of the
opinion of the Bundesrat' if EC negotiations affect the interests of the
states. That suggests that not only exclusive interests of the states would
be involved, but also for example EC budget negotiations, which affect them
indirectly.
The interests of the central government are supposed to be protected by the
proviso that its responsibility as sole representative of the entire country
must still be preserved.
Mr Hans Eichel, the prime minister of Hesse, said last night that the
compromise represented the furthest the states were prepared to move in
restricting their involvement in EC negotiations.
Mr Max Streibl, the conservative prime minister of Bavaria, went further in
warning that if the government did not agree, the issue was one on which he
was prepared to vote against ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
However, Mr Friedrich Bohl, the minister of state in Mr Kohl's office, said
that the government could not agree until the entire text had been
exhaustively investigated by constitutional advisers.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (32): Why the wheat traders are agog - Life
in a sleepy market town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K. K. SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHOLESALE market in Sohna, a small town in the Gurgaon district of
Haryana, lies dormant for most of the year. But for two months in the autumn
when the kharif (summer) crop comes to the market and in May and June when
the rabi (winter) crop is sold, the ramshackle marketplace hums with
activity.
This year, the market's artis (middle-men) are agog at the change in its
sales pattern. In previous years, whenever wheat was brought to the market,
all but the superior 'desi' varieties were automatically bought by the Food
Corporation of India, the government's procurement agency. In May, when
tractors were busy bringing in trolley-loads of ordinary wheat which the
corporation would normally have bought for official stocks, its small office
in the market was deserted.
'They (the officials) have little to do. They know they cannot compete with
the traders this year,' said an arti.
The sale of wheat is a complex business, and it takes the whole day to sell
a trolley-load. As the wheat cascades down to the cemented floor, once the
sides of the trolley are opened, the arti's employees start to get busy.
Women with cane strainers sift the grain carefully to separate it from the
chaff. It is an elaborate exercise that is done manually by throwing the
wheat into the air on tray-like sifters, so that the grain separates from
the chaff and dirt.
Gradually, a big pile of the cleansed wheat builds up with the small mound
of chaff besides it. This operation takes three or four hours. Then, a small
group of traders begins to wander from one arti's stall to another,
carefully studying the quality of the grain by sniffing it, pouring
fistfulls from one hand to another and even tasting it.
'They see whether the grain is broken or diseased. Only the full grain heaps
fetch the highest price,' explains the arti. Then they start bidding and, in
an kind of impromptu auction that follows, the price slowly rises while its
farmer-owner stands by anxiously.
In previous years, Dharampal, a farmer who owns seven acres in the village
of Indri, sold his grain to the official agencies at the minimum support
price. 'Some farmers grow desi wheat and the traders came only for this
superior quality. This year, they are buying everything,' he says.
The bids started at well above the support price at Rs330 a quintal and in a
matter of minutes had reached Rs380. 'This is best price I have ever got,'
says Dharampal, beaming with satisfaction. He is happy to have brought his
wheat to the market rather than wait for it to rise.
'Many farmers are holding on to their wheat. I have to sell now because I
must repay my debts,' says Dharampal. The richer farmers, he says, can
afford to wait for the price to rise in two or three months, but he had to
sell as soon as his wheat was harvested.
The wheat crop in Sohna has been a good one, says Dharampal. The winter
rain, unlike the monsoon, did not play truant and, besides, he has a working
tube-well to provide water. He uses urea as a fertiliser in small quantities
since it is expensive (he does not know why fertiliser prices have gone up,
although he is aware of the 'subsidy' on it).
But he sees no reason for shortages because, he says, the harvest has been
as good as in the past two years. Dharampal does not know why he is getting
such a good price for his wheat. He speaks of 'God's grace' and looks to the
heavens in gratitude. He is not aware of any ganging up by the farmers and
traders, though he has heard of Mahendra Singh Tikait, the militant farmers'
leader in Uttar Pradesh, who is fighting for a better deal for his
community.
Militancy has not reached sleepy Sohna. The arti is also puzzled at the
change this year as, he says, the traders used to buy only the desi variety
or damaged grain that the official agencies would not touch. 'The farmers
have got a good price this year. The government is now picking up diseased
wheat only. and not too much of that.'

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (31): Farmers seek fairer deal - The
government's food policy is blamed for depleted food stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K. K. SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA IS again, after more than two decades, shopping abroad for foodgrains,
reviving memories of the 'ship-to-mouth' days 30 years ago when emergency
imports had to be made from the US.
The situation is clearly not so bad now, but that the country is once again
planning to import 1m tonnes of wheat after attaining surpluses for the past
20 years must raise questions about what has gone wrong with Indian
agriculture and the green revolution.
It also raises questions about India's food policy, a related issue, and
whether the farmers are getting a fair deal at a time when they are
organising themselves after centuries of passive docility. Do farmers get
the right incentives? The government has raised procurement prices (the
price at which official agencies buy grain from the markets) progressively
by more than Rs100m over the past four years.
Despite this, the depleted food stocks have not been replenished this year.
Wheat stocks stand at the level of around 11m tonnes after the procurement
season is virtually at an end. Official agencies will clearly not buy enough
to meet the target of 9.5m tonnes of wheat from the farmers, simply because
the latter are getting more than the minimum support price (or the
procurement price) from private traders.
Traders have offered stiff competition to the official agencies. They are
believed to be hoarding their purchases (as also are rich farmers, who have
not brought all their surplus wheat to the market) because they expect
shortages to occur in the near future and are waiting for prices to rise.
Such speculation is possible because the food policy has not been recast to
cope with the shortages. Belatedly, the government offered a 'bonus' of Rs25
a quintal above the minimum support price when farmers fought shy of selling
wheat to the official agencies. This still does not match the prices offered
by private traders and hence the poor procurement that will fail to make up
depleted stocks.
Much of the farmers' resistance to the government's policies have come from
the northwestern states of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. This
is where the green revolution took root and enabled the country to raise
total foodgrain production from a low 82m tonnes in 1960-61 to 176m tonnes
last year.
Even this impressive growth in production is now not enough. Food- grain
production has increased at an average of 1.7 per cent a year while the
population is rising at around 2.2 per cent. Far from providing surpluses
for export, as the government had hoped for, present produc- tion is not
enough for the population.
Last year, the monsoon arrived a month late and this upset sowing and
harvesting plans in the northwestern states. The fall in production that
followed underlines the fact that Indian agriculture, for all the progress
the green revolution has made, is still dependent on timely and ample rains,
particularly during the monsoon season.
Only a third of India's arable area is irrigated. This raises questions
about irrigation pol- icy and whether dependence on large projects was the
right answer. Far more has been achieved by successful exploit- ation of
ground water res- ources in Punjab and Haryana, where easy availability of
minor irrigation schemes has gone a long way towards better use of
fertilisers and high- yielding varieties of seeds, the basis of the green
revolution.
At the same time, it must be emphasised that the current crisis should not
detract from the undoubted progress that Indian agriculture has made. Even
in a bad monsoon year - and this year will probably record another poor
rainfall season and cause fresh problems of food management - a minimum
potential has been built up and this is growing every year.
Unfortunately, the population is growing faster - and the farmer is getting
wiser - and production in good monsoon years is not sufficient any longer to
make up the shortfall in bad years.
The situation is made more serious by the lack of an agriculture policy,
which three successive governments have promised but failed to produce.
Political pressures are behind this since the farmers, after all, are an
important vote-bank. The policy will have to secure a better deal for the
farmers and the government's economic reforms do not provide one, at least
in the short term.
Fertiliser prices have been raised and are to be raised further as the
subsidy on fertilisers is withdrawn. Electricity charges are to be economic
and seeds will cost more. All this cannot be spelt out in the policy for
political reasons, especially when the farmers are organising themselves and
seeking that the rural masses should be treated as 'equal citizens'.
At present, they believe they are not and clearly the terms of trade operate
in favour of urban dwellers.
As the farmers have discovered, if they hold out against the official
procurement agencies which, they believe, pay them a much lower price than
is their due, they can win better prices. The present shortages - and the
expected fall in production next year because a good monsoon is not expected
 -are working in their favour.
Farmers' leaders point out that in the last five years, only 21.8 per cent
of total development expenditure was spent on agriculture, rural
development, irrigation and special area programmes. Even if social services
are included, not more than 24 per cent of the total went to improve the lot
of the farmers, who constitute nearly 80 per cent of the population. They
also point out that between 1970-71 and 1988-89, production of wheat went up
by 71.4 per cent but the support price of wheat compared to wholesale prices
of all commodities went down by 44.7 per cent.
The result was that the real income per hectare of wheat growers went down
in spite of the substantial increase in production.
Farmers believe that the present crisis, which they are undoubtedly
exploiting, caused by inadequate availability of foodgrains, is not due to
any deficiency in agricultural practices or the laziness of the farmers but
because of flawed price and trade policies. Unless farmers are thought of as
human beings and not as machines, production will continue to fall behind
the growth of population. Unfortunately, the economic reforms have nothing
to say about their problems.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (30): A blue chip may emerge -
Petrochemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By R. C. MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND phase of privatising Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd
(IPCL), one of the state's few profit-making companies, is scheduled for
later this year. In the first phase the government sold 20 per cent of its
Rs1.86bn equity to mutual funds; now New Delhi will cut its stake to 51 per
cent.
IPCL, seen as an emerging blue chip with sales of nearly Rs20bn last year,
operates a hydrocarbon cracker at Baroda, its headquarters in the western
state of Gujarat. It has a second cracker and downstream petrochemical units
located near Bombay. The company is now building the third cracker at
Gandhar, also in Gujarat.
A Rs48.75bn (Pounds 938m) investment is planned over the next five years on
modernisation and expansion, with Rs34.75bn at Gandhar. The cash-strapped
government has given notice that IPCL should raise all the money on its own.
Mr Hashmukh Shah, chairman, says IPCL has not relied on budgetary support
for years and does not wish to do so now.
Last December, the government sold to mutual funds through bids 20 per cent
of the equity at IPCL and several other state enterprises to mop up Rs30bn
and narrow the budget deficit.
The Narasimha Rao administration is under pressure from the IMF and World
Bank to quicken the pace of economic reforms and cut the budget support to
state enterprises. New Delhi is to bring the budget deficit down to 5 per
cent of GDP this year from 6.5 per cent last year.
The funds required for the new facilities that IPCL is to build are far
greater than the company ever attempted to mobilise in the past. Innovative
financing methods are needed.
Mr Shah wants these plans to be in place before he retires at the end of the
year. Nearly Rs20bn will come from internal resources and the remainder is
to be raised through equity, supplier's credits and commercial loans
overseas.
But India's securities market scandal has soured immediate prospects for
companies wanting to tap the overseas capital market. Mr Shitin Desai of DSP
Financial Consultants says a local issue will have to precede the overseas
flotation.
The primary capital market is buoyant despite the securities scam. The
convertible stock of Mangalore Refinery, a joint sector company, was
oversubscribed nearly five times at the end of May.
Petrochemical shares are fancied by local investors. The Rs10 shares of
Nocil, a joint venture of Mafatlal Group and Shell, are quoted at Rs2,100 on
Bombay Stock Exchange. Analysts attribute this high price to the track
record of management, attractive earnings per share and expectations of
future performance.
Mr Shah says the market values the IPCL shares at 10-15 times their par
value. The shares were traded unofficially at Rs700 in March at the height
of the stock market boom. The government, which sold IPCL equity to mutual
funds at the low price of Rs70 per share in the first phase of divestment,
is determined to get a proper price in the second phase through a public
offer.
But the stumbling block is IPCL's poor performance last year. Earnings per
share plunged to Rs1.45 from Rs4.81 three years ago. The Bombay
petrochemical complex was shut for the best part of the year after an
explosion in an ancillary plant.
Mr Shah has to convince investors the future is rosy. He projects the
earnings per share to jump to Rs8.9 this year but will level off later as
the company intends to double its equity to Rs4bn in five years. Sales are
to double to Rs43bn in five years from Rs20bn.
He claims these are conservative projections, making allowance for a
moderate rise in profits as the government reduces import tariffs by half to
nearly 50 per cent over the next three years and exposes Indian
petrochemical companies to overseas competition. Meanwhile, IPCL is exposing
its staff to the international market by seeking to establish a joint
venture in Saudi Arabia. It is to build a Rs8bn engineering plastics plant
with General Electric of the US at Baroda and improve IPCL profitability.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (28): Industry feels worried - Though
corporate sales are up, the production index has fallen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GITA PIRAMAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DICHOTOMY is almost absurd. According to the Department of Economic
Affairs, the index of industrial production plunged from 8.5 per cent in
1990-1991 to -0.4 per cent in 1991-1992.
Indeed, in manufacturing (as opposed to mining or power generation), the
descent was even swifter. Here, the index fell from 9.6 per cent in 1991 to
 2.4 per cent in 1992.
Yet, at the same time, end-of-year company results unveil several islands of
prosperity. An analysis of 875 major companies whose audited results have so
far trickled in shows that aggregate sales rose by 21.1 per cent over last
year. And the Economic Times Research Bureau reports that corporate
operating and gross profit moved up by 27.1 per cent and 26.5 per cent
respectively.
The most outstanding company performance is that of ITC, a cigarette
manufacturer. Its sales rose from Rs22.9bn last year to Rs30.17bn this year,
and in the process it became India's premier company in the private sector.
Delving into the figures resolves the apparent conflict between lower
production and higher corporate sales.
'If one breaks down the results for the financial year ended March 1992, one
sees that the profits of the first half do not really carry through to the
second half. A large part of the apparent increase in sales actually
reflects inflation and not higher production,' says Mr Rahul Bajaj, chairman
of Bajaj Auto.
The prospect of a poor monsoon, turmoil in the banking sector, high interest
rates and tight credit head a list of negative factors that causes concern
in Indian boardrooms. The mood is definitely one of uncertainty and anxiety.
For large companies, and particularly consumer-oriented ones, possibly the
most worrying factor of all is a fundamental change taking place in
distribution patterns.
I n I n d i a, g o o ds h a v e traditionally been distributed across the
country by small, scattered and independent traders. By giving big companies
between three to six months' credit, these traders also play a vital role in
financing the companies from whom they buy goods.
Apart from their regular business activity, these traders are heavy
investors, if small in scale individually. The recent stock exchange crash
after the Harshad Mehta scandal has hit them hard. In a knee-jerk reaction,
many have been forced to reduce their regular trading volume, resulting in a
Catch-22 situation. Companies meanwhile have been double-whammed: not only
has a cheap source of finance dried up but sales have dropped to miserable
levels.
Will the traders recover? And if so, how quickly? Or should companies evolve
new distribution patterns to fill the vacuum? Most companies are adopting a
wait-and-see approach before taking more radical steps. If orders start
trickling in, if the monsoon is not as bad as predicted, and if sales pick
up, the old system may survive. The ifs are many and the cost of
restructuring high.
The next few years will be difficult for India's corporate captains for
other reasons also. I n d i a is g r a d u a l l y but inevitably switching
from a seller's market to a buyer's one. Facing real competition, both local
and international, for the first time is not a happy prospect for
industrialists pampered by decades of protection. What is the point of
reform if it hits my business, more or less sums up the attitude of the
majority.
Moreover, companies which are dependent on imported raw materials have been
badly hit by the government's policy on the partial convertibility of the
rupee. With 60 cents of every export dollar now being converted at free
market rates instead of the government's official rates, imports have become
15 to 20 per cent more expensive. A hidden subsidy has vanished overnight.
Meanwhile, the high cost of money, combined with the demise of monopoly
profits, is scaring off capital investment. More and more companies are
re-examining the viability of their expansion plans.
One key industry at a vulnerable turning point is the steel sector. Moves to
loosen government shackles so as to boost total capacity have been
over-cautious and largely ineffective.
For example, before last year's partial decontrol of steel prices, Mukand, a
leading Bombay-based mini-steel company, wanted to build a Rs40bn steel
plant to produce 1m tonnes a year. Today, Mr Rajesh Shah, Mukand's chief
executive, admits: 'We are having a close second look at the project.'
In such circumstances, the fortunes of India's big business houses may
resemble a wild game of snakes and ladders.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (29): Master of fine blanking branches out -
Profile: IFB Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Marxist-ruled West Bengal has the dubious distinction of having the
largest number of antiquated engineering units of all the Indian states. But
in West Bengal is also located IFB Industries, which exports around 80 per
cent of its production of fine blanked components used in automobiles,
mainly to hard currency areas.
Fine blanking calls for the application of highly sophisticated technology.
The surprising thing about IFB is that 12 years ago when Mr Bijon Nag, a
first generation entrepreneur, chose Calcutta, the biggest city in West
Bengal, for investment, a substantial flight of capital from the state to
other parts of the country was taking place.
Though he would not admit it, the fact that Mr Nag is a relation of Mr Jyoti
Basu, chief minister of West Bengal for the last 15 years, might well have
clinched the issue for him. In any case, IFB is one of the rare cases in
West Bengal which has not been visited by industrial unrest since it started
operations. Political connections have certainly helped.
Even so, as the company's business grew, IFB realised it would be too risky
to put all its eggs in a Calcutta basket. In the last few years, it has set
up bigger plants in Bangalore and Goa.
IFB's forthcoming venture for the production of electric motors in
collaboration with Siemens of Germany will also be in Bangalore. Only
recently, the IFB-backed Pounds 4m joint venture, European Fine Blanking,
has started production at Wrexham in North Wales.
According to Mr Nag, the fine blanked components to be produced at the
Wrexham plant will, besides reducing the UK's dependence on imports, be
exported to Europe and the US.
Having mastered the fine blanking technology, the company has decided to
create more than one production base in the west. While the capacity of the
Wrexham plant will be expanded in the next couple of years, a decision has
already been taken to have similar units in Czechoslovakia and the US.
The success of IFB is largely attributable to its technical and financial
collaboration with Heinrich Schmid AG of Switzerland. The Swiss company has
also partnered IFB in the Wrexham venture.
Mr Nag admits that the association with Heinrich Schmid has helped IFB in
roping in Electrolux Autoliv of Sweden and Rentrop Hubbert &amp; Wagner of West
Germany as collaborators for the manufacture of automotive safety belts and
car seat reclining systems, respectively. Like fine blanked components,
these are largely for export.
When the company diversified into the white goods business two years ago,
industry watchers thought IFB had made its first wrong move. The Indian
market for white goods is worth more than Rs20bn. But much bigger companies
than IFB with strong marketing networks were already in the field. IFB did
not have any experience in marketing consumer goods. It had to start from
scratch.
The technical tie-up with Bosch Siemens for the manufacture of washing
machines has gone a long way in ensuring the success of IFB's
diversification. The washing machine plant in Goa has a capacity to produce
125,000 units a year.
According to Mr Nag, IFB will be going all out to develop an export market
for washing machines. The company will be making some more white goods,
including electric ovens, dish washers and refrigerators.
The likely source of technology is Bosch and Moulinex of France. IFB, which
hopes to earn a profit of over Rs140m on a turnover of Rs720m in the year to
June 1992 is to grow at a rate of 35 to 40 per cent in the next five years,
according to Mr R. N. Sen, executive director. Turnover of IFB group of
companies is about Rs1.25bn.
Recognising the risks involved in the white goods business, IFB diversified
by taking over two moribund tea estates in West Bengal.
IFB has made these plantations reasonably profitable in the past three years
by replanting and by using scientific agricultural practices. In the next
five years, IFB's tea production will treble to over 2m kg, according to Mr
Nag.
A group company called IFB Agro Industries, engaged in the production of
extra neutral alcohol and liquor is drawing up plans to make a number of
alcohol-based chemicals. The IFB group being already in the financial
services business, it is well placed, according to Mr Nag, to take advantage
of the liberalisation policy and offer a host of new services.
Fairly well established in leasing and hire purchase, IFB has decided to
float a mutual fund - the private sector is now allowed to operate such
funds. It will also provide venture capital and engage in merchant banking.
Raising resources to finance new projects is not a problem for IFB, because
of its blue chip status on the Stock Exchange.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (27): Bollywood hears cash registers clink -
The country's film industry is among the world's biggest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GITA PIRAMAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANT TO forget the harsh world of reality? For less than Rs10 anyone can do
just that for three hours of pure entertainment at one of India's 13,000
movie halls.
With 900 films in 15 languages produced annually, the choice is wide. Some
14m tickets are sold daily. All of which makes the Indian film industry one
of the biggest in the world.
Although films are produced in all of India's major languages, the
Bombay-based Hindi industry dominates the scene, both economically and
culturally.
Dubbed 'Bollywood' by its detractors for its near-parasitic dependence on
Hollywood's creativity, the popular Hindi cinema has been the staple
entertainment of the masses for over seven decades.
Hindi films are released nationally, while regional language ones are
released only in individual states.
Currently, the movie industry is in a state of breathless expectation. In
the 1980s, producers lost money; in contrast, the 1990s appear both bright
and profitable.
At theatre halls, cash registers have started clinking once again as a new
generation of teenagers discovers the visual delights of the big screen.
Home videos are boosting the trend.
For theatre owners in some states, profits have also improved because of a
recent minor tax change providing a modest rebate. No longer are movie
theatres being converted into shopping complexes and office blocks.
Though few new cinema halls are opening up, some old cinemas, which had
fallen into seediness, are being restored. It is widely expected that the
current ratio of eight cinema seats per 1,000 population will improve in the
near future.
Moreover, the video onslaught, which had become the bane of the business
during the 1980s is no longer the menace it used to be. For almost a decade,
rampant piracy robbed film-makers of royalties from video cassette sales,
while keeping middle class audiences out of theatres. The Rs12bn film
industry faced a challenge from a pirate industry whose turnover was almost
equal.
By the late 1980s, however, things had changed. Sporadic police raids and
court cases, combined with the accumulation of vast personal fortunes,
encouraged the bigger video pirates to legitimise their operations.
Film producers and video pirates signed a reluctant truce. Not only did they
start financing films together, but libraries began to stock legally-made
cassettes. Licensed video sales looked up and today constitute about 10 per
cent of total returns.
One film producer who has been particularly successful in twirling the video
boom to his advantage is Mr Ramanand Sagar. According to industry experts,
Sagar Studios makes a clear profit of Rs800,000 on every video cassette it
brings out. It keeps a tight control on production costs. Each video is made
for roughly Rs250,000 - a low figure by industry standards.
Despite the poor quality of sets and computer graphics, videos from the
Sagar stable are immensely popular. The secret of Mr Sagar's success? He has
cashed on a resurgent Hindu wave. His version of the Ramayan, one of India's
two great epics, brought the country to a grinding halt every Sunday morning
when it was broadcast on the state-run national television network.
When Mr B. R. Chopra, a rival film-maker, was chosen to serialise the
Mahabharat, Mr Sagar shifted to the video medium. His 78-episode magnum opus
on the life of Krishna (of which 10 have been produced to date) has been
marketed with flair.
Popularity brings its own problems. 'We are losing at least Rs30m-40m a year
because of cable pirates,' grumbles Mr Prem Sagar, managing director. Cable
pirates, in fact, are taking over from the video pirates of yesteryear.
Unauthorised cable networks in urban areas have mushroomed. For between
Rs60-150 a month, they offer at least two cable channels during peak hours.
Most also offer Star TV, the new Hong Kong satellite broadcasting station
and CNN.
According to Admarg, an independent Bombay-based market research agency, in
December 91 there were 12,000 cable operators. There has been a brisk 20 per
cent rise in the cable operator fraternity.
Though Star TV is an advertisement-driven free service, cable operators
frequently tape popular programmes. Illegal cable screenings of Star TV
programmes (which include the BBC World Service, Asia MTV and Prime Sports)
as well as locally-produced entertainment software, are rapidly becoming a
far greater menace than the video pirates.
The government has promised steps to update legislation on copyright and
cable TV, but progress has been tardy.
Ironically, the advent of satellite channels at the same time offers the
promise of an additional revenue source for film producers to wash off red
inkstains on their profit-and-loss accounts. 'At some point, Star TV will
have to commission Indian software,' agrees Mr Shakti Samant, president of
the Indian Movie Pictures Association.
Most Indian film making is financed out of black money. 'Much of this comes
from the underworld. Indian mafia dons want to meet the starlets and gain
respectability at the same time,' says Mr Rauf Ahmed, editor of Filmfare, a
monthly magazine with 500,000 readers.
The problem is that few legitimate sources of funds are accessible for this
high-risk business. With no banking or institutional finance available, film
producers are forced to borrow capital at usurious annual interest rates of
36-48 per cent.
Among the hundreds of film companies, just one, the Madras-based G V Films,
is a public limited concern.
Film-making is possibly one of the most disorganised ways of making money.
'Unlike in other parts of the world, film stars in Bombay work in up to 20
films at a time,' says Mr Firoze Nadiadwala, a leading film producer and
distributor. Even top directors and technicians have multiple assignments.
This results in scattered shooting schedules of films.
Most films take up to two years to complete, with prohibitive cost overruns.
That is why out of 900 movies produced in a year, less than 14 per cent
succeed in making money. They either die still-born or distributors refuse
to take them up.
In India, films are usually distributed region-wise through one or
combination of three options. Producers receive either a minimum guarantee
basis (the distributor guarantees to pay the producer a minimum amount
irrespective of box-office collections), a flat commission or a refundable
advance.
Despite the near-certainty of losses for low-budget productions with
untested directors, the glamour and glitz of Bombay's stars continue to
attract nouveau-riche suckers. The industry is rarely short of funds.
In such a scenario, the mood is more upbeat than it has been for the past
three years. It's time for lights, camera, and action in Bollywood.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (26): Growth has faded - The electronics
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR marks the 10th anniversary of one of the most significant events
in Indian television and electronics manufacturing.
It was in 1982 that the administration of Mrs Indira Gandhi abandoned its
traditional hostility to televisions, until then thought an unnecessary
luxury, and encouraged their use for people to watch the Asian Games. TV
manufacturing was given further impetus in the run-up to the general
election two years later.
The change of policy led to television becoming one of the biggest growth
industries of the mid-1980s, with annual expansion of more than 30 per cent
the norm. This in turn fuelled strong growth throughout the electronics
sector.
Few manufacturers are in a mood to celebrate the anniversary. Of the more
than 100 companies that entered the market, many have since quit or are in
trouble. Three manufacturers - Videocon, Onida and BPL - now dominate the
field with a combined market share of more than two-thirds.
They and the other remaining manufacturers are competing in a market that
has shrunk from 1.3m colour sets and 4.4m black and white in 1988 to 800,000
colour sets and 3.2m monochrome sets in 1991.
The electronics components sector, whose fortunes are closely linked to
consumer electronics and especially the television industry, is feeling the
pressure. Although its production continues to rise, capacity utilisation is
low and the returns on its substantial investment are poor.
Indigenisation of inputs into the electronics sector has improved
significantly in the last 10 years. Whereas manufacture of colour
televisions started with 90 per cent of components imported, that is down to
10 per cent.
However, the components industry's long-term plans for further advancement
are suffering because current volumes are insufficient to justify
large-scale investment in facilities to produce components including
integrated circuits.
That, in turn, will keep up the cost of televisions - Indian prices are
among the highest in the world, although televisions are beginning to
compete in the export market - and prevent further growth in the market.
Tariffs on imported raw materials and components remain high.
Television manufacturers are united in what to blame for their woes. Sales
taxes, excise duties and other government imposts have risen to a level
where they are 50 per cent of the total price of a colour television set.
'Due to this, an industry which is supposed to be a sunrise industry has
become a sunset industry in the last four years,' says the Consumer
Electronics and TV Manufacturers' Association.
The industry believes that in spite of high poverty levels in India, the
market is - high taxes aside - capable of enormous growth. 'There is a view
that those who can afford to buy televisions have already done so,' says Mr
N. Vittal, secretary at the government's department of electronics. 'I do
not agree. If China with a comparable population can produce 7m colour sets
a year, why should we be satisfied with 800,000?' Industry sources say that
household penetration is less than 5 per cent.
With the market depressed, manufacturers are concentrating on increasing
exports and on diversifying into consumer electronics and related products
such as audio equipment, video recorders and household products including
washing machines and vacuum cleaners.
Internal forecasts by one consumer electronics group predict that Indian
sales of video-cassette recorders and players can almost double from Rs5.5bn
in 1990-1 to Rs10bn in 1994-5 and those of audio equipment will rise by a
similar proportion to Rs13.71bn.
Among groups poised to take advantage is Peico Electronics and Electricals,
in which Philips has a 40 per cent stake. Peico has had a chequered history
in its 60 years. Its fortunes reached a low ebb in the 1980s when labour
troubles, a loss of direction and a government-enforced late entry into
television manufacturing led to it missing out on the TV boom.
However it claims 30 per cent of Indian audio sales and is mounting a more
determined attack on the television market. It held No 1 position in the
black and white 14-inch market last year, against No 8 position previously
Further advances will be helped by the recent government liberalisation
which will enable Philips to take a 51 per cent stake in the company which
will also market goods under the Philips brand name.
The leading indigenous companies are also benefiting from the liberalisation
which allows them to market products under the brand name of the foreign,
mainly Japanese companies, with which they have collaborations. Onida has
tie-ups with JVC, Videocon with Toshiba and BPL with Sanyo.
Closer ties would inevitably boost quality and, with it, export potential.
According to Cetma, last year's exports of 200,000 colour TV sets is likely
to rise to 500,000 this year.
But exports alone will not solve the industry's problems.
Mr T. P. G. Nambiar, managing director of BPL, which exports more than 10
per cent of its output, says competition from international competitors
means that the price of 14-inch televisions in the UK market has fallen from
Pounds 81 to Pounds 73. 'We can always sell abroad but the price is never
very profitable.'
The incentive is that volumes are boosted and the foreign exchange earned
can now be spent on importing goods to improve production.
Like other manufacturers, Mr Nambiar would prefer to see the main growth in
domestic markets. For television manufacturing, if not for consumer
electronics as a whole, that could be some way off.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (25): More, but still not enough - Foreign
Investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR K. K. Modi, the chairman of Godfrey Philips, a leading cigarette
manufacturer, is a busy man right now. Last week he spent many hours with
the top brass of Stephanel. This British company is seriously considering
both marketing its range of women's wear and sourcing some of its production
in India.
Next week, Mr Modi will be closeted with Disney executives, looking at the
prospect of dubbing the latter's vast repertoire of children's movies into
various Indian languages.
'Since the liberalisation programme started, the number of inquiries from
foreign companies has been phenomenal,' says Mr Modi.  'It is a far cry from
the time we wore out shoe leather trying to attract companies to come to
India.'
The recent international interest in India is certainly not superficial.
Very soon, Indians could be crunching bowls of Kellogg's Cornflakes, washed
down by cans of Coke. These global brands are just two of the 950 foreign
collaborations approved by the Indian Government in the past 12 months.
In contrast, there were just 666 approvals in 1990. According to the Indian
Investment Centre, 289 projects involving foreign equity worth Rs5.34bn were
approved in 1991. Figures from the Department of Industrial Development
suggest that 78 per cent of this amount was approved between August and
December 1991, or shortly after the first budget of the present government.
In January 1992, foreign collaborations involving Rs1.76bn were approved -
which is more than the whole of 1990, when there were just 194 projects
involved a mere Rs1.28bn worth of foreign equity. February 1992 was even
more remarkable. In just that one month, the figure shot up to Rs14.91bn.
Foreign investment seems to be finally coming to India in a big way.
Currently, General Electric of the US is possibly the largest foreign
investor. It has tied up with half a dozen Indian companies for products as
diverse as refrigerators and washing machines (with Godrej), thermoplastics
(with Indian Petrochemical Corporation), and industrial lighting (with
Wipro). It has also evinced keen interest in India's ambitious energy
programme and is likely to set up a electric power station once the
government has finalised its power policy.
Du Pont also has major investment plans. These include a Dollars 100m
venture to manufacture polyester base film for photographic, X-ray and
graphic arts applications, to be located at Kurkumbh, near Pune in
Maharashtra.
Meanwhile, there is a whole host of smaller projects involving high-profile
multinationals such as Shell in petrochemicals, IBM in computers, and
Alcatel in telecommunications.
But just how much of this fresh investment is due to the welcome mat spread
out by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, and the much-touted 'new
economic policy' announced on July 24 last year? Reading between the lines,
the answer is: not very much.
Companies like GE, Du Pont and Coca-Cola, which head the list of major
investors, have long been interested in India. Most of their recently
announced projects have been in the pipeline for the past two to four years.
Even more significantly, almost all were tailor-made to suit India's
five-year plans.
The Du Pont polyester base film project is a classic example. 'The Indian
government was clear that foreign investment had to be high-tech,
world-class and export-oriented. We centred our project around those
objectives,' says Mr Bob Wray, business director of Du Pont electronics.
'Liberalisation only speeded up decisions.'
Even more significantly, despite the obvious and dramatic percentage
increase in foreign investment, the actual total remains piffling in
international terms. The question is: why has India failed to attract more?
India's multi-layered bureaucracy is frequently cited as a key factor. Aware
of international frustration, one of the first acts of the Narasimha Rao
administration was to appoint a high-powered four-member foreign investment
board headed by Mr A. N. Verma, a senior civil servant, to slice away at red
tape. But it was unable to achieve much.
Right through a sweltering Indian summer, Shell's managing director, for
example, cooled his heels in a Delhi hotel, waiting for final clearances for
a Rs30bn naphtha cracker which Shell wants to set up with the Mafatlal Group
outside Bombay. He waited in vain.
Swapping such horror stories is almost a favourite pastime for foreign
businessmen dealing with India. In trying to understand the logic for these
delays, what most India watchers forget, or neglect to take into account, is
the strong nexus between business and politics in India. If a new venture
encroaches on an existing concern, its management will anxiously look for
ways to protect its turf. Often politicians and bureaucrats are all too
ready to help out by stalling a rival's project.
It took Pepsi-Cola over three years to set up a food processing and soft
drink plant outside Delhi. The undertaking almost became unviable in the
process. Though its profit-and-loss account is nothing to write home about,
the Pepsi venture at least managed to get going despite the multi-pronged
and unabashed blitz unleashed by Parle, a local soft drinks manufacturer.
A Du Pont-Thapar Group nylon 66 project in Goa has not been as fortunate.
The polyester cartel succeeded in delaying the Rs1.96bn enterprise to the
point where cost escalations rendered it financially unviable.
Another source of misgiving among potential foreign investors is India's
draconian labour laws. It is almost impossible to fire workers or close down
loss-making units.
These are not the only trouble spots. According to Mr Alan Furness, British
Deputy High Commissioner in Bombay, 'there is a degree of scepticism about
how far government policies have really changed and what this means in
practice. There are also fears about power allocations and whether other
infrastructural needs will be fully met.'
Nonetheless, despite warped labour policies, a stubborn bureaucracy and
roadblocks all along the way, India holds several advantages over
neighbouring countries for foreign investors.
Du Pont, for example, preferred to locate its polyester base film plant in
India rather than China, Japan or the Pacific Rim countries. According to Mr
Wray, 'we want to globalise but there is too much competition in Japan and
markets such as Korea, Taiwan and Singapore are too small. India offered
more incentives than China. The clinching factor was the presence of a major
local consumer for our product.'
So India could be one way to beat the global recession; company results for
1991-1992 have been largely ebullient. Inflation and the prospect of a poor
monsoon may cut into next year's profits but with a 150m-strong middle
class, India's consumer boom, which started in the late 1980s, may only
marginally decelerate.
In this panorama, do the pluses outweigh the minuses in the minds of foreign
investors? Recent figures certainly suggest that they do. But will India
seize its rare opportunity or let it slip away?

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (24): Small fish in a big pond - How
business houses are achieving an international presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GITA PIRAMAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY are just minnows in a global pond. Yet they are not insignificant. They
do not possess the financial muscle of American and Japanese multinationals,
but they are chiselling out an international presence.
Forty-five years after independence, Indian business houses are dipping
their toes into unfamiliar waters. Leading the charge is RPG Enterprises,
India's sixth biggest business house. The Bombay-based group is building a
Rs120m car tyre plant in Sri Lanka. It is scheduled to go into commercial
production by the end of the year.
'Once full production is reached, we expect annual sales to be Rs300m,' says
Mr Harsh Goenka, the youthful chairman of RPG Enterprises.
Government-run companies are not far behind the private sector. The
Baroda-based Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) wants to set up a
Dollars 200m, 100,000 tonnes a year acrylonitrile plant in Yambu, on the
western coast of Saudi Arabia. According to Mr Hasmukh Shah, IPCL chairman,
the engineering phase 'will commence after August'.
Other important projects include a Rs35bn oil refinery at Jebel Ali in Dubai
by the Bombay-based Ambani group and a Rs7.4bn rayon grade pulp plant in
Indonesia by the Delhi-based Thapar group. Meanwhile, a handful of Indian
business houses already runs significant international operations.
Singapore-based Mr Rajan Pillai, head of a Rs12bn bread and biscuit empire,
controls New Zealand's biggest biscuit company. Mr P. K. Mittal, head of the
Rs13bn Calcutta-based Ispat group, runs the largest steel mill complex in
Indonesia's private sector. In Malaysia, Bombay-based Mr Aditya Birla
operates one of the world's largest palm oil refining plants. From Essex, Mr
Vijay Mallya supervises 17 manufacturing units, spanning 18 countries, which
generate revenue of Rs18.65bn.
This surge of international activity among Indian business houses coincides
with an awakening realisation among foreign companies of India's
attractiveness as a large consumer market and as a potential manufacturing
base.
There are several reasons why Indian businessmen have chosen to come out of
their shells at this point of time.
First of all, Indian technology appears to be coming of age. RPG's
Enterprises's Sri Lanka project is a case in point. Within India, all the
six major tyre companies have been established with help from global leaders
such as Dunlop, Pirelli and Intercontinental. The RPG project, however, is
based solely on technology provided by Ceat, a RPG Enterprises-run company
in which the Goenka family holds a 40 per cent equity interest and Italy's
Ceat owns 10 per cent.
For some businessmen, the motivation seems to be a need for international
recognition. In India they may be powerful players, but they want to be more
than just big fish in a small pond. As Mr Mallya puts it: 'We want to be a
large international group based in India, operating a broad spectrum of
businesses in association with the world leaders.'
Mr Shah of IPCL echoes this sentiment. 'While the new economic policies
place a premium on export-led growth, IPCL believes that the mission is much
larger in dimension. We should aim at international forays to emerge as a
force to reckon with in the petrochemical industry worldwide.'
Before that happens, the government will have to ease the cumbersome
controls on Indian investments abroad. Aware of the bottlenecks, the
government is now actively considering granting automatic clearances for
Indian companies planning to invest in overseas joint ventures or
wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Procedures for granting approvals to the appointments of Indians on the
boards of overseas companies in which investments may also be relaxed
shortly. Combined with the imminent free convertibility of the rupee, these
should further stimulate Indian groups to go global.
Despite the enthusiasm of Indian businessmen, so far the dip into
international waters has been rather timid. Most lean on local partners for
expertise and funds. IPCL's acrylonitrile plant is being set up in
collaboration with the Alujain Corporation, part of the Saudi Arabian Xenel
group. Mr Pillai's Britannia Brands is a joint venture with BSN, the French
food conglomerate. The Thapars are setting up their pulp plant with P. T.
Risjadson Holding and Investment of Indonesia.
Financially, also, most of the new ventures tend to start off small. RPG's
Sri Lankan foray, for example, is extremely modest. At Rs120m, it is a mere
drop in the ocean compared to the Rs30bn which the Goenkas propose to invest
on projects in India. Of this, Rs4.5bn is earmarked for expanding their
Indian tyre interests.
Mr Birla's international adventures started equally bashfully. 'By the late
1960s, I started feeling that south-east Asia would be a good place to be
in. I began with a very small textile unit. I think the initial outlay was
not even Rs10m,' he recalls. This 12,000-spindle textile plant in Thailand
became the take-off point for a multi-location, multi-product group of 11
companies whose combined sales are currently Dollars 730m. Within India, Mr
Birla's group sales are Rs54bn.
Despite their export growth, until recently Indian business houses were
unable to break out of their Asian boundaries. That is rapidly changing,
with India's diamond merchants setting the pace. Their manufacturing outlets
are in Surat and Bombay, but they buy diamonds from London and Antwerp and
export them to New York and Hong Kong.
Industry experts say that three Indian diamond firms (Rosy Blue, Jayem and
Vijaydiamond) tower over the rest. Not only are their sales higher (roughly
Dollars 200m each), but they differ from hundreds of run-of-the-mill diamond
merchants because they operate cutting and polishing plants in several
countries besides India.
Mr Dilip Mehta of Rosy Blue has factories in Belgium, Sri Lanka, Thailand
and Israel besides India. Mr Vijay Shah (Vijaydiamond) has plants in the
Philippines and Thailand besides offices in Bombay, Israel, Antwerp, Hong
Kong and New York. Though both maintain manufacturing ties with Surat, Mr
Madhu Mehta of Jayem now largely operates out of Antwerp and Thailand.
Does all this point to the birth of India Inc? It is too early to say.
Nonetheless, today's willingness of Indian business houses to look out of
India and into the world's windows reveals growing confidence and maturity.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (23): Coal scuttle thrown open - Kunal Bose
says that New Delhi has no alternative but to invite private sector
participation in new projects. At the same time, the industry has a
four-prong plan to achieve 'self-reliant growth'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY is as yet talking about the privatisation of the Indian coal
industry, which was nationalised two decades ago. But under the new economic
order the coal industry, like any other public sector undertaking, cannot
depend on the government for financing new projects. So New Delhi will have
no alternative but to invite private sector participation in a number of
coalmining areas.
According to Mr S. K. Chowdhury, chairman of Coal India Limited (CIL), those
which may be thrown open to the private sector include washeries (where the
ash content in coal is reduced), power plants to supply electricity to the
mines, workshops for maintenance of equipment and shaft sinking and other
mine development activities.
The coal sector's allocation for the eighth five-year plan launched in April
1992 is Rs115bn. But government budgetary support will be limited to Rs28bn.
Doubt persists on whether CIL will be able to find the funds for the
projects identified in the plan. Its production target for 1996-97, the
plan's final year, is 258m tonnes.
Because of the strain on its resources, the government has no alternative
but to invite private sector participation in as many areas as possible. A
more important move under consideration is for the government to permit bulk
consumers of coal such as power, steel and cement to have captive mines.
Industries for which coal is the principal raw material would heave sighs of
relief if they were allowed coalmining rights. There is a running battle
between CIL and the major coal consumers over the quality and quantity of
coal supplied. For example, there was a supply shortfall of over 6m tonnes
of coal to the power sector in 1991-92.
Mr Purno Sangma, minister for coal, admits that 'complaints regarding the
size and quality of coal continue to be an area of major concern'. The
complaints mostly relate to the high ash content of the fuel and the
presence of such materials as stone and mud.
The minister believes that joint inspection by the producer and the consumer
at the loading point will largely eliminate the complaints. But to improve
the quality of coal will call for the setting up of washeries close to the
mines as a private initiative since CIL does not have the money to do the
job.
A study by experts found that a 7 per cent reduction in ash content would
lead to an improvement of up to 28 per cent in the calorific value of coal
and a 7 per cent saving in transport costs.
CIL, which needs substantial foreign exchange to finance imports of
equipment and spares, has decided to give a major thrust to the export of
coal and coke. Its newly created export unit hopes that exports will reach
2m tonnes in a couple of years. In addition, Mr Chowdhury explains, it hopes
for an extra Rs350 a tonne.
The single largest corporate employer in the world which no longer expects
the government to take care of its losses, according to its chairman, CIL
achieved an improvement in the year to March 1992. The company earned a net
profit of Rs1bn against a loss of Rs2.53bn in 1990-91.
How badly the coal business was run in the post-nationalisation period is
evident from CIL's accumulated losses of Rs22bn.
The perennial bane of CIL has been low productivity in the underground mines
and equipment problems in the opencast mines. According to Mr Sangma, in the
five years to 1991-92, the wage cost per manshift rose by 58 per cent, while
the output per manshift in the underground mines, where nearly 85 per cent
of CIL's total manpower is deployed, remained stagnant at 0.53 tonnes.
With wage costs equal to 85 per cent of the selling price of coal produced
in the underground mines, the loss on production of 60.31m tonnes in 1991-92
is estimated at Rs10bn. However, the loss has been made good by the profits
earned from production of 147.51m tonnes in the opencast mines.
Output in the opencast mines, however, leaves considerable room for
improvement. If the equipment which now remains idle for nearly 55 per cent
of working hours is put to more efficient use, that would help. The poor
equipment utilisation is in spite of 'fairly high investment in workshops'.
The challenge for CIL today is to generate enough resources to ensure
'self-reliant growth'. According to Mr Chowdhury, the aim is to achieve this
in four ways.
First, the underground mining operation which has suffered because of
inadequate supervision, delays in project implementation and neglect of dip
development is to be thoroughly overhauled.
Second, in its obsession to step up coal production, CIL has in the past
sacrificed the quality aspect. In the past decade, the share of superior
grades in total coal production has declined from 35 to 14 per cent. The aim
is to raise this to 20 per cent within three years.
Third, CIL has planned to liquidate coal stocks by 20m tonnes to a more
manageable 27m tonnes during the current year. But CIL cannot achieve the
target if the railways do not press into service sufficient numbers of
wagons. There is also scope to reduce the inventory of stores by Rs1bn.
The fourth task is to step up the export of superior grades of coal to
realise extra value.
While the government has yet to show the political courage needed to close
any of the uneconomic mines, it is trying to cope with the estimated 50,000
surplus workers by redeploying them in new coal projects and offering them
an attractive voluntary retirement scheme.
However, in this CIL will need the support of state governments, some of
which are run by non-Congress parties.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (22): Easing the shackles - Profile: P. S.
Sangma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE WILL not make the final decisions. But as acting labour minister, Mr P.
S. Sangma will be highly influential in the government's formulation of
controversial policies to deal with sick units and their workers in the
public sector, and to ease the shackles imposed on industry to deal with
surplus employees, writes Michael Smith.
The deliberations are among the most difficult the government faces. In
India, jobs have traditionally been viewed as the preserve of the holder for
his or her working life.
The political sensitivities that surround the issues have already
contributed to the departure, several months ago, of Mr P. Ramamurthi, Mr
Sangma's predecessor at the labour ministry.
Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, prime minister, thought to be considering a
significant re-shuffle of his cabinet, took on the job himself for a short
period, but then decided to appoint an acting replacement. Mr Sangma was
familiar with the brief, having been labour minister in 1986-87.
Still only 44, he has wide experience in government, although below cabinet
level. A lawyer by profession, he was elected to parliament in 1977 at the
age of 29. When Congress I was next returned to power, in 1980, he became a
deputy minister and served in that post in industry and foreign affairs
before becoming minister of state (home).
Like many other government ministers, Mr Sangma returned to his home state
when Congress I lost power. In his case he was chief minister in Maghalaya
for three years before Congress I was returned to power last year. He was
then appointed coal minister, a non-cabinet job which he retains alongside
his labour brief.
Mr Sangma visibly enjoys the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate, and can
often be seen smiling when confronted with challenging questions. But his
approach to his ministerial jobs is by no means adversarial.
Although he jokes about the lack of unity among trade unions - 'there are
nine trade union centres, and that makes it easier for us: we can make them
fight each other' - he says he is trying to impress upon union leaders the
need to work together.
'It would give them more bargaining power,' he explains. 'For any honest
employer, it is better to have one union than several to deal with. If the
unions are united, it is better for the working classes.'
Mr Sangma says he is in favour of the unions, though on one condition: that
the leadership should come from the workers themselves, and not from
political parties. The government is proposing legislation which would limit
outsiders on union executives (including MPs) to 10 per cent of the
leadership.
Although this may meet union opposition, the bigger fights will be over the
public-sector sick units and any amendments to labour laws.
Mr Sangma, who chairs the tripartite committee to consider the impact of the
new industrial policy on labour issues, has tried to allay the fears of
unions, by telling them that the government intends to 'safeguard the
interest of workers'.
The government would like to rationalise labour through voluntary
retirement, retraining and redeployment, he says.
Mr Sangma points to agreements such as that recently negotiated by him in
the state-owned coal mines. Under this, workers have, for the first time,
agreed that any new mines shall take only 30 per cent of their employees
from new recruits to the industry. The rest will come from other mines where
they are viewed as surplus labour.
The problem with the 58 sick units earmarked for modernisation is that their
financial position is already tenuous, and some would be considered unviable
in other countries.
Mr Sangma says he hopes most of the units can be revived. 'In a few cases,
where there is no chance of revival, we are willing to hand them over to
workers' co-operatives, and we will write off all the past losses and
liabilities and give them finance.'
And if that does not work? 'We will see later on,' replies Mr Sangma. He
laughs his infectious laugh, but in a way that suggests he realises that
that will be the crucial test of government policy.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (21): No exit, so far - Overstaffing in the
public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY DAY, about 25 workers turn up at a factory in Delhi where, according
to management, they are paid to do nothing.
The factory's plant was long ago removed by its owner, the electronics
company Weston. But repeated requests to the workers that they transfer to
another factory or leave with compensation have been turned down.
Mr Sunder T. Vachani, managing director, says the 25 are each paid Rs3,000
(Pounds 56) a month, an average wage in Delhi for a production worker, but
he adds they spend much of their time asleep. He has not approached the
government for permission to make them redundant: he predicts that it would
be refused.
Weston and thousands of other Indian employers have a surplus of labour,
because they are bound by a plethora of rules and regulations which make the
redeployment and retrenchment of workers extremely difficult, if not
impossible.
The government has signalled a willingness to act, but is encountering
enormous problems in formulating a policy, both to make it easier for
private companies to exit and on 58 so-called sick industry units which it
wants to move out of public ownership.
With the help of a Dollars 500m loan from the World Bank, it plans to set up
a National Renewal Fund to provide resources for dealing with displaced
workers. But that is of limited use in a country that has no social security
net to catch anyone made redundant but has huge labour surpluses.
Overstaffing is most severe in the public sector. The World Bank has
identified it as one of the most serious obstacles to Indian industry's
competitiveness. It estimates that there is a surplus of 250,000 to 300,000
workers in the public sector; many believe that to be an understatement.
Partly as a result, the Indian public sector includes numerous sick units
whose liabilities exceed their assets. The 58 units being tackled by the
government now have accumulated losses of Rs100bn and a total workforce of
470,000.
Private sector employers want an exit policy for the public sector, so that
losses can be tackled, inflation rates cut and taxes reduced. But many want
a government policy to make it easier for themselves to tackle inefficient
workers and loss-making units.
In theory, provision already exists, through the Industrial Disputes Act,
for closing down unprofitable units. However, job security and compensation
arrangements are subject to more than 100 regulations, and the act confers
discretionary powers of decision on states and government.
However, the laws of many states forbid closure, and states which have a
more liberal regime are reluctant to assent to closures and redundancies.
Companies which close unilaterally, without permission, face losing plant
and equipment without compensation. State governments will often take over
the operations and run them at a loss, rather than see workers lose their
jobs.
Many industrialists believe the success of the economic liberalisation will
be jeopardised unless the government formulates an exit policy.
'Entrepreneurs and foreign companies will be reluctant to get into
manufacturing if they feel there is no way out if they get into
difficulties,' says one. He is having difficulties finalising a joint
venture with a Japanese company, because of the lack of an exit policy in
India.
Among organisations seeking a tougher approach is the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce. Mr V. C. Dutt, its chairman, has called on the
government for employers to be able to cut back at least 1 per cent of their
workforce without going through the 'proper labour and legal procedures.'
But the government, in treading warily on formulating a policy, can claim
that the clamour for reform from industry is by no means universal.
Mr Tarun Das, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, is
sceptical about the need for radical change in labour laws. 'Employers are
already shedding labour and their organisations are becoming leaner,' he
says. 'Much more needs to be done; there is overmanning across the board.
But companies can already do it, provided they have the consent of the
unions.'
Job-shedding can be achieved even without the consent of unions. Earlier
this year, union leaders at Premier Automobiles advised members to turn down
an early retirement package, but about 3,000 of the 9,500 workers rejected
their advice. In such circumstances, the state did not intervene; nor did it
want to.
Nonetheless, Mr Vinod L. Doshi, chairman, believes an exit policy is needed.
'We do not envisage it, but if for any reason demand does not pick up and we
are in dire trouble, we will have no means of further reducing the
workforce. Companies in other countries do not face the same constraints.'
With the views of industrialists appearing sometimes to conflict with each
other - and the political pressures surrounding the formulation of the
policy so great - it is hardly surprising that there have been some
confusing and often contradictory messages from senior ministers.
As long ago as last December, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minster, promised
an announcement within a month. Six months later industry is still waiting.
Other ministers and Congress-I spokesmen occasionally say that an exit
policy is not under consideration.
That, however, is more to do with their regret that the phrase 'exit policy'
was ever used, because of the emotions it arouses. Means to retrain and
redeploy labour are certainly under consideration, even if some ministers
insist that the plans do not include 'retrenchment'.
In recent statements Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, has attempted to
allay workers' fears that the government's industrial policy would not
affect their interests. Implementation of the new policies would not render
them jobless, he says. 'Whatever we are doing, we are doing for the welfare
of the workers.'
Such statements do not convince the trade union leaders, and it is difficult
to see how a radical improvement in India's industrial performance can be
achieved without significant change to labour laws. That, in turn, is hardly
likely to work to the advantage of workers.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (20): The key to the unions' strength -
Divided they may be, but they are not a soft target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIVISIONS among Indian trade unions suggest that they should be a soft
target for governments wanting to force through labour law changes. The
appearance is deceptive.
In a country where governments are loath to abandon the consensus tradition,
union opposition has delayed the formulation of policies that would make it
easier for employers to shed labour.
There are about 70,000 unions in India. And instead of one or two
co-ordinating forums for all unions, common in many countries, there are at
least nine - the number recognised by the Ministry of Labour - and all have
different political agendas.
Indeed, one reason for the profusion of trade union centres is that many see
themselves as the industrial arms of political parties. The ties are all the
stronger, because many members of parliament remain union leaders after
their election.
The key to the unions' strength is the areas where they are organised. Among
316m workers, only about 25m, or 8 per cent, belong to unions, according to
labour ministry figures.
But while their representation is almost non-existent in many areas of the
unorganised labour sector, their penetration in the organised sector is
high.
The organised sector is only 31.6m strong, against the unorganised sector's
285m, but it includes the public sector and the vast majority of India's
large employers.
Industrial action, or the threat of it, can have a powerful effect there.
Unions which staged a one-day strike against the economic reforms last
November claim that it was only afterwards that the government became eager
to talk to them about their views on the changes.
The strength of union opposition to the reforms varies. The communist-backed
All India Trade Union Congress is totally opposed. Mr T. N. Siddhanta,
secretary, says the previous, restricted economy 'has served us well. I do
not say everything was done correctly, but we have been able to stand on our
own two feet.
'Liberalisation is more and more expressing itself against the interests of
the workers.'
The Indian National Trade Union Congress (Intuc), which is allied to the
Congress-I party and claims to be the largest grouping, takes a softer line,
and did not participate in the strike last November.
However, it opposes foreign companies' taking a stake of up to 51 per cent
in Indian enterprises. 'They will press out Indian companies that are doing
all right,' says Mr S. N. Rao, its spokesman.
And Intuc is certainly against a policy of allowing the closure of sick
industrial units or labour rationalisation. Mr Rao does not deny
overstaffing, especially in the public sector, but he argues that that is
not the fault of the workers.
But perhaps the most effective argument at the unions' disposal is that
India has no social security or unemployment benefit, and employment
availability is not growing.
'The government has stopped recruitment for several years,' says Mr
Siddhanta. 'With employment generation nil, no-one will get a job
elsewhere.'

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (19): Tourism targets seem not too fanciful
 -One of the world's cheapest countries for western visitors is trying to do
more to attract them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP fall in the value of the rupee in recent years has helped to make
India one of the cheapest countries in the world for the western tourist.
The government has ambitious plans to take advantage; the tourism industry,
though encouraged by the level of ministerial enthusiasm, is sceptical about
the chances that these will be achieved.
India has set lofty targets for tourism in the past - and failed to reach
them. Its share of world tourism traffic has remained at 0.4 per cent over
the past five years and its foreign exchange earnings from tourism have
remained at Dollars 1.3-1.5bn.
Last month Mr Madhavrao Scindia, civil aviation and tourism minister,
announced that he wanted India's share of world tourism to rise to 1 per
cent within five years. By the end of the century he wants both foreign
exchange earnings and employment in the sector - currently 14m  - to double.
The country's lacklustre performance last year, previously designated as a
year for tourism, is explained in part at least by events outside the
industry's control.
The Gulf War upset the best-laid plans of all the countries in the region
and the violence surrounding the Indian general election campaign made the
sub-continent less attractive still. 'The tourism ministry does not have an
in-house astrologer,' says Mr Scindia. 'If we had one he would have
cancelled the year for tourism before it began.'
Mr Scindia, an effective railways minster between 1985 and 1990, is viewed
as a breath of fresh air by tour operators and hoteliers, even though his
reputation has been tarnished recently because of controversies over civil
aviation.
His plans for tourism include improving the quality of the infrastructure,
particularly transport, increasing foreign investment and easing the vast
array of government controls and bureaucracy which hold back the industry
and providing financial encouragement for hotel building.
Compared with the performance of its neighbours, India's targets do not seem
so fanciful. Even if it were to raise the annual number of its tourist
arrivals from 1.7m to 3m or 4m, it would still not equal the 4m-plus already
achieved by Singapore and Malaysia.
The main advantage that those two countries have over India is their
geographical position. According to Mr AK Gupta, joint secretary at the
ministry of tourism, at least 80 per cent of those who visit countries
belonging to the Association of South East Asian Nations come from within
Asean.
India's problem is that it is relatively isolated from the main sources of
tourism. 'The foreign tourist has to make up his mind,' says Mr Gopta.
'India is not a country for an impromptu visit.'
Nonetheless, India's infrastructural problems do not make it easy for
spur-of-the-moment visitors. Internal flights within India are often booked
some days in advance and, while anyone with corporate contacts can usually
arrange a late booking, that is of little use to the leisure tourist.
To help ease the congestion, the government has inaugurated an open skies
policy whereby independent operators can set up airlines between the main
cities. Three companies are already flying between them about 15 737s but
the foreign exchange expense of setting up in the business has led to
problems for other potential entrants.
Meanwhile, progress has been made in making Indian Airlines flights more
punctual and the tourism ministry says 86 per cent on trunk (metropolitan)
routes are on time. More customer-friendly policies, such as warning
passengers of impending delays, are being introduced.
To bring more people into the country, the government has eased rules on
charter flights. Whereas an airline would previously have to wait six months
for clearance to bring in a chartered flight, arrangements can now be made
within 24 hours, says the tourism ministry. It expects the number of
charters to increase to at least 400 in 1992-93, against a previous norm of
125.
To achieve its targets, India will also need to spend far more to increase
the number of its hotel rooms. There are now some 44,000 in the approved
sector, perhaps half of what is needed.
Upmarket hotel chains are already planning significant expansion. The
Welcomgroup has a Rs1.6bn development plan for the next three years which is
expected to increase by 50 per cent its capacity from the present 2,300
rooms.
Last month's government tourism plan increased from 3 to 5 per cent the
interest subsidy available to some two- and three-star hotels, while
discontinuing subsidies for four- and five-star rated hotels.
Investment in hotels and other facilities will also be encouraged in special
tourism areas where tax concessions will be made available.
This reflects a government desire to move away from the previous even-handed
approach to the various regions.
Fifteen specified circuits and destinations are being identified for
concentrated marketing and development. That should take some of the
pressure off the Golden Triangle of New Delhi, Agra and Jaipur which, in
peak tourism months at least, is close to full capacity.
The government's decision to sell 60 per cent of its equity in 24 hotels
managed by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation could also increase
the supply of quality accommodation. Foreign companies are being invited to
take stakes of up to 40 per cent in the hotels which will be marketed in
batches of four.
It remains to be seen how interested foreign companies will be in joining
ventures in which the government will still hold 40 per cent of the equity.
A further deterrent is that the hotels, which comprise one of the largest
chains in the country, have staff-resident ratios twice as high as private
sector hotels.
Foreign investment in private sector tourist enterprises has also been made
possible through recent liberalisation. The high price of land in cities
will remain a brake on development, particularly on two- to three-star
hotels which are needed more urgently than pricier units.
All of these developments have encouraged the tourism industry that real
change is in the offing, but grievances remain.
The Indian Association of Tour Operators says the government's introduction
of a 20 per cent tax on foreign currency payments at hotels where nightly
rates exceed Rs1,200 will weaken the enthusiasm of foreign tour operators to
organise trips to India.
The association also wants the government to allow more luxury cars to be
imported. which it says are needed for the industry.
Few in the industry are confident that the government can achieve all of its
targets, but growth in tourist arrivals and foreign exchange receipts of
between 10 and 15 per cent a year is considered eminently plausible.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (18): Neglect of schools could hold back
growth - Half the population cannot read, but the government is resisting
pressure to introduce compulsory primary education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS INDIA pursues east and south-east Asia down the trail of higher economic
growth, it could run into a major road block - it has one of the highest
rates of illiteracy of any country in the world and one of the worst records
for neglecting primary education.
While east and south-east Asia made universal schooling the focus of their
drive for higher economic growth, India has lagged badly behind in
developing primary schools.
Almost half the population aged seven and over cannot read or write. Less
than 50 per cent of children between the ages of 6-14 are in school -
leaving a staggering 82m who are put out to work by their parents in
so-called cottage industries, in the fields, or as bonded labour. Two-thirds
of those who attend primary school drop out before the final year.
The World Bank and donor nations are now putting pressure on India to face
up to the seriousness of the situation and to make universal primary
education a priority. Mr Oktay Yenel, head of the World Bank office in
Delhi, says: 'There is no country (other than the oil-rich countries of the
Gulf) which has achieved high levels of per capita incomes and reduced
poverty with a predominantly illiterate population.'
The Bank sees low levels of literacy - worst among the poor and among women
 -as putting a brake on other programmes to alleviate poverty, including
health education and family planning.
Both aid agencies and diplomats in Delhi were dismayed that the February
budget seemed to have dropped the emphasis on basic education that had
formed a key element of the budget presented by Dr Manmohan Singh, the
finance minister, last July.
The multilateral institutions are convinced that raising funds both
domestically and abroad for a mass primary education programme would be no
problem. 'If India had a major primary education expansion programme, I know
that the World Bank would come in in a big way and I guess that many other
countries would find it worthwhile,' says Mr Yenel.
The aid agencies believe that there are now well- established and polit-
ically neutral technologies for accelerating primary school expansion. They
do not believe the arguments of senior officials in Delhi who oppose
compulsory education on the grounds that the rural poor prefer to send their
children to work rather than to school.
'If there is good quality primary education, I am convinced that the great
majority of parents would want to send their children to school,' says Ms E.
Watanabe, head of the United Nations Children Fund (Unicef) in Delhi.
But in North India in particular, primary schools are bad. On average there
is one teacher for every 58 pupils. Appointed from outside through influence
of friends or family, he often has no contact with the village and turns up
irregularly at the school.
'I asked parents whether they knew the teacher,' Ms Watanabe says of
villages she visited in Bihar where Unicef has a project. 'None of them knew
him,' she says. Books, blackboards, and mats for pupils to sit on are all in
short supply.
India wrote the goal of achieving universal primary education into its
constitution after independence. But it has remained a dream as the number
of illiterates grew each year by 5m to 437m.
One of the paradoxes of the country is why its educated elite, committed to
the goals of development, socialism and democracy, should have allowed
primary education so low a priority. India spends less than 1 per cent of
GDP on primary education - or well below that of most countries in Asia and
in sharp contrast to the large resources it devotes to secondary and higher
education.
The blunt response of Professor Myron Weiner, an American academic who has
recently published a book on child labour in India, is that the fault lies
with the caste system.
Prof Weinder sees the neglect of primary education as based on the fear by
the higher castes that 'excessive' and 'inappropriate' education for the
poor 'would disrupt existing social arrangements'.
He explains: 'Rhetoric notwithstanding, India's policy makers have not
regarded mass education as essential to India's modernisation. They have
instead put resources into elite government schools, state-aided private
schools and higher education.'
Though universal primary education and the abolition of child labour have
been official policy since independence, the government under Rajiv Gandhi
shifted the focus about seven years ago.
The emphasis was put instead on improving the conditions of child labour
while providing non-formal education for those who had dropped out of the
school system and crash literacy courses for adults. This shift in policy
was justified as reflecting the 'socio-economic realities' of the country.
Mr Anil Bordia, the education secretary, who has presided over the change in
policies, says that the best results have been achieved in the south where
25-30 districts (including the state of Kerala) have been declared literate.
Two-thirds of the country will be literate by 1997-98, he claims.
He rejects Prof Weiner's analysis of India's educational problems. 'He does
not understand India. I think he does not know what he is talking about,'
says Mr Bordia.
The education secretary himself does not believe compulsory primary
education is the right approach to universal schooling in India. He recalls
how 'painful' it was for him as a young judge in Rajasthan - where education
in one district was compulsory - to fine parents who begged not to send
their children to school.
Mr Bordia is also suspicious of foreign interference in primary education
and is opposed to the World Bank sending specialist personnel to support a
large proposed primary education project in Uttar Pradesh, the northern
state with one of the highest rates of illiteracy.
He says that he has seen in Pakistan and Bangladesh 'the harm which big
investments in primary education can do to a country whose culture and
milieu are not particularly different from our own. Neither in planning
(primary education and literacy) nor implementation, do we need help from
abroad,' he adds.
The multilateral institutions believe that literacy campaigns and non-formal
education (where children attend classes after a day's work) are no
substitute for mass primary education. They fear as well that the these
programmes will divert resources from the more urgent task of primary
education. 'My concern', says Ms Watanabe, 'is that the focus on literacy is
diverting attention from primary education.'
The multilateral agencies need to maintain their campaign since primary
education lacks a lobby within India. 'Primary education is one of the
subjects that does not have a strong national lobby,' says Ms Watanabe. Mr
A. B. Vajpayee, the BJP leader and a veteran parliamentarian, says he has
never had a question from a constituent over primary schooling.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (17): A brighter trend on the roads - The
two- and three-wheeler market seems to be benefiting from an early upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF A demonstration was needed of the power of a well-chosen joint venture,
it was provided last year by the Indian two-wheeler sector and Honda, writes
Michael Smith.
As Indian motor-cycle sales fell 9 per cent to 430,000, Hero Honda, a joint
venture in which Honda has a 26 per cent stake, increased volumes by 13 per
cent to become market leader.
In scooter manufacturing, Kinetic Honda, another Honda joint venture, added
10,000 to its sales to reach 87,000, again in a shrinking market.
The Indian two- and three-wheeler market, which last year totalled 1.68m
units, is dominated by six players. Bajaj Auto, Hero, Kinetic, TVS (which
has a joint venture with Suzuki), LML and Escorts.
Together, they account for more than 90 per cent of sales.
Fortunately, the collective gloom which resulted from the severely depressed
market of last September-January, when the market slipped by more than a
quarter on the comparable period of the previous year, appears to be
lifting.
Monthly sales since January, are closer to last year's levels and in some
cases above them. That means that the two- and three-wheeler sector was
affected later than cars and has benefited from an earlier upturn.
In India, long-term growth is assured because two-wheelers are commonly used
to carry three and four people and are viewed as the poor person's car.
The problem for companies like Bajaj Auto, the market leader for all two-
and three-wheelers, and Escorts, the motor-cycle market leader before last
year, is the competitive threat posed by Honda and, to a lesser extent,
Suzuki.
Bajaj has done well to carve out a 47 per cent share of the market for two-
and three-wheelers. Although that is well down from the 80 per cent it had
prior to the liberalisation of the industry in the early 1980s, it is a
significant improvement on the 40 per cent of eight years ago.
Under the chairmanship of Mr Rahul Bajaj, the company is considered to be
one of the better-run indigenous Indian organisations with, for example, a
relatively enlightened approach to research and development.
R&amp;D is the only department in the company which does not have budget
constraints. But the task is tough. 'Honda of Japan spends more on R&amp;D than
our annual turnover,' says Mr Bajaj. 'Where does that leave us?'
The answer is striving hard both to increase market share further and boost
exports from their current 2 per cent of production to a targeted 15 per
cent.
Indian market share increases can come from initiatives such as the
introduction in 1990-91 of a 50cc moped which in its second year of
production took 10 per cent of the market.
Bajaj still claims to be cheaper than most of its rivals in most of its
products.
Achieving the exports target will be more difficult in the absence of dealer
networks available to companies with joint ventures and doubts among
potential foreign buyers about the quality of Indian manufacturing.
For similar reasons, Escorts will struggle to increase exports which last
year accounted for about 1,000 of its 120,000 motor-cycle production.
Although Escorts has collaborations with overseas companies including
Yamaha, it has no joint ventures with Japanese companies. Product
development has suffered as a result and it is still developing a
fuel-efficient, four-stroke model to match the one behind Hero Honda's
success.
Mr M. M. Mehta, Escorts vice-president, says that when it comes, in two to
three years' time, it will be better than those of its competitors. He also
draws comfort from a revival in demand for Rajdoot motor-cycles which were
behind the company's earlier success.
'We cannot meet the demand for Rajdoots. In the mid-1980s it suffered from
the Japanese competition. But we have been making constant improvements and
the price has become more favourable against the Japanese because of rises
in import duties.'
However, Mr Mehta does not disguise his regrets about the lack of a joint
venture. 'If an Indian company has a joint venture, the (foreign) partner is
concerned with the technology and the well-being. For example, if the
yen-rupee relationship slips, the collaborator will give some consideration
on the price of imports.'
Not surprisingly, Escorts is considering the possibilities of a joint
venture.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (16): Car industry has yet to prove
potential - In spite of a recent decline in sales, Michael Smith finds
grounds for optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Indian government eased controls on who could set up manufacturing
bases in industry last year, it left the cars sector out of the
liberalisation. Few were surprised.
Although the Indian car industry is more than 40 years old, the government
is still undecided whether it should be viewed as an important sector with
potential for providing large-scale employment and export growth, or merely
as a source for luxury products for the rich.
To date, the view of Indian governments has been the latter. Cars have been
seen as guzzlers of the foreign exchange needed to make and fuel them. As a
result, the sector has been even more heavily regulated than others and
taxes have been higher.
Production licences have been refused to countless potential manufacturers
and today there are only four companies making cars. Their combined domestic
sales have never risen above the 175,000 achieved in 1989-90 and only one
company exports cars to any considerable extent. The carmakers together
employ fewer than 30,000 people.
Those companies that have tried and failed to get in on the act can at least
console themselves that market conditions in the past two years would hardly
have provided the perfect launch pad for entry.
After a quadrupling of domestic sales between 1983 and 1990, the total fell
to about 142,000 last year and there are fears that it will be below 100,000
this year.
A variety of factors accounts for the decline. The devaluation of the rupee
has made component imports more expensive, and petrol price rises and the
increased cost of consumer credit has lessened the attractions, and
possibilities, of owning a car.
More damaging still was the government's decision last year to raise excise
duties on the price of cars to 60 per cent, compared to a previous 40 per
cent and 6 per cent in the mid-1980s. 'Cars have become truly unaffordable,'
says Premier Automobiles, the second largest car manufacturer.
In spite of the gloom, there are grounds for optimism in the long term. The
growing potential for foreign collaboration, and with it increased exports,
improvements in the quality of indigenous components and better productivity
will all aid the industry.
The catalyst for much of the change has been Maruti Udyog, a joint venture
between Suzuki of Japan and the Indian government. Prior to its emergence in
its present form in 1983, consumers had to choose between Premier and
Hindustan Motors, both producing 1950s models with outmoded equipment.
Amid claims from its rivals that it was given favourable treatment in tax
treatment and production quotas, Maruti has slowly built up its claimed
share of the market to more than 60 per cent.
Exports last year reached 22,900. Although that is not expected to increase
significantly this year, the target for 1995 is 50,000 to 60,000. One reason
for the expected rapid growth is that the Suzuki's new Alto 800cc model will
be made exclusively in India. The company has this year raised its stake in
the joint venture from 40 to 50 per cent.
Mr R. C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti, says he cannot claim that the quality
of the product is identical to that made in Japan, but he says it is not
significantly lower. Labour costs 1.7 per cent of the total input of a car,
whereas the equivalent figure for Japan is 12 per cent. 'Potentially we can
get the price cheaper, providing we can get our act together in the
components industry.'
Maruti's growth has already stimulated a rapid improvement in the quality of
components made in India. Partly as a result of collaboration with overseas,
mainly Japanese companies, component makers are increasingly turning out
products which can compete in international markets.
The Automotive Components Manufacturers Association of India says its
members increased exports last year from Dollars 100m to Dollars 140m and
expect exports growth of 30 per cent annually.
For India's components makers to become much larger players on the
international market, they will need more expensive equipment which
economies of scale would provide. That will only come with significantly
increased domestic market share.
Like Maruti and component manufacturers, Premier and Hindustan are looking
to joint ventures for growth. Both companies are in need of revival.
Premier is expected barely to make a profit in the current year. Mr Vinod
Doshi, chairman, is resentful about the accusation, common in Indian
business circles, that it has failed to satisfy the needs of the market.
Although the most recent of its two car models was first manufactured in the
mid-1980s, Mr Doshi points out that Premier has been trying unsuccessfully
ever since to persuade the government to allow it to manufacture another.
Previously, it collaborated with foreign companies but did not enter joint
ventures. Now that is changing. 'We are looking for a long-term marriage,
not just a technical licence.' Talks are under way with companies including
Fiat, Peugeot and Nissan and Mr Doshi expects to have formed a relationship
with one of them within three or four months.
Meanwhile he and his son have shown that they mean business in revitalising
the company by persuading 3,000 of the 9,500-strong workforce to take
voluntary retirement. The package and the way it was negotiated has sparked
considerable admiration in Bombay, where, as in the rest of Indian business,
it is notoriously difficult to shed labour.
The new entrant to car manufacturing is Tata, the large industrial and
engineering group. Frustrated by the government's refusal to allow it to
establish a carmaking collaboration with Honda in the late 1980s, the Tata
subsidiary, Telco, recently started manufacture of what it claims is the
first Indian car to be made without foreign collaboration.
In spite of government restrictions on entering car manufacturing, under
'broad banding' policies a company which already makes four-wheel vehicles
is able to diversify into cars. Tata developed a pick-up van; the Tata
estate car and three-door Sierra are modifications of that.
Tata plans to produce 10,000 of the cars this year and has orders for all of
them already. Mr V. M. Raval, director of Telco, says interest has been
shown from the UK, France and Egypt.
The present car is built on a chassis and so is higher than a standard
estate car. That could encounter resistance from potential export targets.
Before it begins exports, Tata intends to change that, as well as develop a
petrol version of what is now an exclusively diesel car and improve the
finish.
Mr Raval say exports are some way off. But he believes that it will be
competitive because it will be lower-priced than rival products made in
other countries.
As with much of Indian car manufacturing, the promise has yet to be
fulfilled.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (14): A turn in the tide for textiles -
Signs of a more buoyant export-driven industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER LAGGING behind the rest of Asia over the last few decades, India's
fabric and garments exporters are beginning to wake up to the opportunities
that a cheaper currency and the change in economic policies are opening up
to them.
'There is going to be a massive boom,' says Mr Hrishikesh Mafatlal, head of
the textiles division of the Bombay-based Mafatlal group. The group is the
country's largest producer of dyed and printed fabrics and is a supplier to
Marks and Spencer in the UK.
Mr Mafatlal expects exports, which accounted for 35 per cent of Dollars
1.2bn sales last year, to contribute 50 per cent of turnover in the near
future as the group doubles its rate of investment to an annual Dollars 16m
a year.
At Bombay Dyeing, another of the Bombay groups that survived the massive
contraction of sales by the large textile mills that characterised the 1970s
and the 1980s, Mr Dinkar Alva, the managing director, also sees a turn in
the tide. 'There are expansion opportunities,' he says, with the group
likewise basing its investment on upgrading quality and boosting exports.
Arvind Mills, an Ahmedebad group and probably the most aggressive of the
larger mills, has built a substantial expansion programme on the export of
high quality blue denim and on cotton shirting. After Rs500m of exports last
year, the group is aiming for Rs5.1bn by 1994-95, by which time it hopes to
be among the top ten denim producers in the world.
Other signs of a more buoyant export-driven industry are a surge of new
investments - particularly in the south which grows fine, long staple cotton
 -in spinning. As a result of this, the textile machinery industry is
quoting delivery dates of two to four years to provide new spinning
machines.
Yet this new confidence in the industry has not translated itself into the
trade statistics. Notwithstanding a 24 per cent devaluation of the rupee in
July last year and a continuing slide in the currency since then, India's
textile exports grew by only 4.4 per cent last year to Dollars 5.7bn.
Garment exports actually fell in dollar terms by 1.8 per cent.
This slow rate of growth was most obviously due to recession in the US
(accounting for 24 per cent of Indian textile exports) and in the EC (43 per
cent) and to the ceilings placed on Indian textile exports under the
multifibre quota arrangements. Another major reason was that exports to the
former Soviet Union slumped in the wake of the collapse of that market.
But it also reflected the failure of Indian manufacturers to benefit from
the devaluation themselves. 'Our exporters passed on the value of the
devaluation to the buyers rather than retaining it themselves,' says a
senior official in the Ministry of Textiles.
While exports of garments fell, there were nonetheless sharp increases in
exports of handloom products (up 21 per cent in dollar terms) and of cotton
yarn (up 38 per cent).
India remains, however, a marginal player in the world textile trade. Its
share of world fabric exports actually dropped between 1980 and 1990 from 2
to 1.1 per cent. In garments India achieved a modest increase over the
decade and now accounts for 2 per cent of world trade  - a proportion well
below China's 8.5 per cent.
But if India is a small player on the world stage, textiles are India's
single largest export and account for 30 per cent of export earnings. The
industry believes that further increases must come through exploiting
India's competitive advantages, and by improvements in quality and moving
more upmarket.
With China and Pakistan, India is one of the few countries in the world to
have a substantial surplus of raw cotton. Yields are high in the Punjab but
still well below international levels in the south and central India.
Compared with 10 years ago, there is greater emphasis on design and quality.
Mr Mafatlal says that in his own group 'there has been a sea change in
management culture'. He cites a major reason for the greater emphasis on
quality as being improved labour relations. 'The single biggest change is in
how we treat our staff and in the way we get them to participate,' he says.
The government is also more supportive to textile exporters than in the
1970s when its main preoccupation was to curb the growth of large mills and
boost employment in the handloom and powerloom sectors. Textile machinery is
easier to import. So are the buttons, zips and extras that the garments
industry needs.
Nonetheless, Indian garment manufacturers face bureaucratic hurdles and
other difficulties that put them at a disadvantage with their competitors in
neighbouring Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka. Ms Mani Mann, a garments
exporter, does not see much hope of improvement: 'I am cynical about
liberalisation because there is so much political interference. I don't know
if we will really go forward,' she says. But her own order book has doubled
this year which shows that some purchasers are turning to India more than
they were.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (15): Pioneer for the private sector -
Profile: IF&amp;LS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION has not made much headway in India. The government's only
major initiative has been to sell an average 8 per cent stake in 30 public
sector companies. The government has said as well that it is prepared to
sell up to 49 per cent of the shares of public sector enterprises - thus
giving the private sector a minority stake but not ceding management
control.
An institution that is, however, playing a pioneering role in familiarising
India with the concept of the private sector financing traditionally public
sector projects - roads, bridges, mass transit - is Infrastructure Leasing
and Financial Services Limited (IF&amp;LS).
A Bombay-based institution set up to attract private capital to projects
that central or state governments do not have the funds to finance
themselves, it has enough schemes under its belt to demonstrate that this is
a field with immense potential.
It has arranged the financing and construction of a link road in Indore in
Madhya Pradesh between two industrial areas that will pay for itself from
toll charges. It is bringing Nippon Kore, a Japanese engineering design
company, to do a detailed feasibility study for a bridge and traffic system
in Bombay that will equally be self-financing from toll charges. And it is
negotiating for the financing and construction of an urban rail link between
Hyderabad and its satellite town of Secunderabad in the south.
Mr Ravi Parthasarathy, managing director, believes that a sea change has
occurred over the last two years in India's acceptance of the concepts of
privatisation and of private financing for infrastructure projects. Equally
unthinkable two years ago would have been the contracting of a Japanese
company to do engineering design for Bombay. But Mr Parthasarathy says that
India does not have experience of designing the traffic system needed to
accompany the proposed bridge from Worli to Sea Rock. The bridge will much
shorten the journey from the airport to the city centre.
Established in 1988, IF&amp;LS is an independent institution whose main
shareholders are nationalised banks. But the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), an affiliate of the World Bank, holds 15 per cent of the
shares.
It gets most of its earnings from its investment banking, leasing and
securities trading business.
IF&amp;LS took what Mr Parthasarathy calls a 'buffetting' when its former
chairman, Mr M. J. Pherwani, resigned as chairman in the wake of the
financial scandal. He had also been chairman of the National Housing Bank
which is heavily involved with Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker, in
securities trading.
IF&amp;LS suffered no losses and was given a 'clean sheet' by the Reserve Bank
of India (the central bank). But with the upheaval among heads of financial
institutions, it has still to find a chairman. The board has, however, given
the go-ahead for a substantial expansion by approving a Rs1bn capital
increase intended to give IF&amp;LS the strength needed to raise funds from the
multilateral institutions.
Much of IF&amp;LS's pioneering work has been to get the central and state
governments to pass legislation making possible the private financing of
public sector projects. The proposed light transport link for Hyderabad
cannot be built without an amendment to the India Railways Act which gives
the state a monopoly over railway construction. IFLS hopes that the
Hyderabad project will be the forerunner of other privately financed mass
transit projects in major cities.
The most high-profile project in which it is involved is the construction of
a fourth bridge in Delhi across the Yamuna. The project envisages an
eight-lane bridge with an integrated system of flyovers and inter-changes to
link the industrial estate of Noida with Maharani Bagh in New Delhi.
International contractors will be asked to bid. The operators will be
allowed flexibility in setting the toll charges themselves.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (12): State gets thumbs-down - Businessmen
still say West Bengal is not a safe investment bet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH INDIA pursuing more liberal economic policies, the Marxist government
in West Bengal can no longer hold New Delhi responsible for the lack of
industrial investment in the state.
Nor can it look, as it did in the past, to federal investment to revive its
industrial economy. The central government does not have the funds.
According to Mr Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal, 'earlier, West
Bengal was discriminated against. Businessmen were denied licences if the
investment proposed was for West Bengal. But the condition has now changed
with the dispensing of the licensing system. We now have to compete with
other states to get private investment.'
Whatever Mr Basu's view, his colleagues in the government have yet to make a
break with the past. In the Economic Review for 1991-92, the state
government says: 'Unless the centre invests in new industrial units, the
state would be deprived of a major industrial growth impetus.'
The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has prepared a package of
measures for marketing West Bengal among prospective investors within and
outside the country, argues that new private investment began to taper off
in the mid-1960s as the state placed increasing faith in government
investment. The real value of productive capital in the state has been
declining by 0.5 per cent a year since 1968-69.
The major part of new investment has been claimed to rehabilitate old
factory units. The consensus among businessmen is that West Bengal is still
not a safe bet for investors.
Mr Basu would admit that the infrastructure needs to be improved. Per capita
availability of power in West Bengal is much less than the country's average
and industries are subject to unscheduled power cuts.
It is understandable that power-intensive industries feel no incentive to
relocate in West Bengal. Instead, the Calcutta-based Mittals went to
Maharashtra and Orissa, where power supply is assured, to put up three steel
plants.
Other facilities in West Bengal, such as urban infrastructure,
telecommunication and transportation, also compare unfavourably with the
more advanced states. Unless these drawbacks are removed quickly, the state
does not stand much chance of getting fresh investment.
Against this background Mr Basu has reason to fear that under the new
economic dispensation, the regional imbalance will grow and new investment
will tend to flow to the more developed areas.
However, it is more than efficient infrastructure that investors will
demand. This year, the state has seen two major strikes - a 72-day stoppage
in the jute mill industry and a strike of twice that length at the Bata shoe
factory. Such long stoppages and acts of trade union 'hooliganism' put the
state in bad light.
Mr Basu is now trying to solve the problem by treating trade union abuses as
any other law and order problem. He has also instructed the labour
department 'to intervene quickly when a strike takes place.' While the state
will have to do a lot of promotional work and convincing before new
investment starts flowing in, the industrialists will not be keen to take
over the ailing units, either.
According to Mr Gouri Goenka, chairman of the Duncans group, which will be
commissioning a Rs1.4bn acrylic fibre unit at Haldia in September, 'it
should not be difficult to run a modern plant in West Bengal, but I will not
be interested in taking over a unit for the purpose of turning it around.
There is no way one can rationalise labour here.'
For West Bengal which abounds in 'sick' industrial units - as many as 124
have been referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction
 -it is important that the government facilitates their takeover and if
there are no takers for them, then their closing down, according to the
Bengal Chamber. But West Bengal is still not ready for the shift of labour
from sick units to new undertakings and from mature sectors to the emerging
ones.
Left Front constituents still swear by the public sector, but Mr Basu, who
is more a pragmatist than a Marxist, knows that he needs the private sector
badly for the state's industrial revival.
In spite of the reservations of his party colleagues, he allowed Mr Rama
Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises, to take over Calcutta Electric Supply
Corporation, which will now be implementing two power projects of a total
capacity of 1,250MW at Budge Budge and Balagarh.
The state government, which is facing serious resource constraints, has also
decided to ask the private sector to implement the 900MW Sagardighi project.
The state must have an additional 210MW capacity a year to cope with the
rising demand for power.
The resource constraint is also forcing the government to invite the private
sector to manage some of its undertakings. For example, the C. K. Birla
group is to modernise the coke oven plant of Durgapur Projects and the
Gauripur power station, both state units. The Birlas will be using the coke
and power at their proposed steel plant in the state.
It is only now that the state is giving attention to industry, so
preoccupied has it been with the restructuring of the rural economy all
these years. Is the Rs32bn Haldia Petrochemicals project, the most ambitious
for the state, finally about to take off? According to Mr Tarun Dutt,
chairman, 'since foreign exchange is no longer a problem, we hope to be able
to complete the project in four years.'
The Ambanis, of the Reliance group, had assured the chief minister that they
would set up a polyester filament yarn unit at an investment of Rs4bn.
However, not many other such projects are in the pipeline. Whether or not
investors from outside will come to West Bengal will depend on Mr Basu's
ability to make his ministers and bureaucrats responsive to the needs of
industry.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (13): Monolith faces pressure - Unit Trust
of India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE AN investment institution which raised almost enough new cash last
year for it to have bought up all the new equity issued on the stock market.
Its vast appetite is fed by a national network of 75,000 agents. Many of its
customers believe its investment returns carry a government guarantee.
The Unit Trust of India's place at the heart of the country's investment
community is unchallenged - for now. But this gargantuan group is about to
come under pressure as India's potentially vast mutual fund market is opened
up to the private sector.
UTI has had a purple year, even by its own standards. At the end of June
1991, it had 10m account holders. Now, it has 20m. It collected a net Rs10bn
(Pounds 2bn), taking its funds under management (at book value) to Rs31bn.
UTI both benefited from the dizzy rise in Indian share prices last year, and
fed it. As prices rose, more investors gave their money to UTI to invest -
and as UTI received more cash, it bought more shares, driving prices higher.
More than half of the new money raised by UTI last year was aimed at growth
(or equity) funds - some Rs5.5bn, compared with the Rs6bn or so of new
equity raised on the stock market as a whole.
'We are hungry for equity,' says Mr S. A. Dave, UTI's genial chairman. Such
buying pressure has helped to keep Indian share prices at price/earnings
multiples which seem unsustainable by the standards of many markets, even
after the sharp decline in the past two months.
Even before this spurt, the institutions involved in India's investment
markets looked monolithic. Alongside the LIC and GIC, UTI (which accounts
for around 80 per cent of all mutual fund investments) has a firm grip on
the country's capital markets.
It controls around 10 per cent of India's quoted companies - a significant
proportion, given Mr Dave's estimate that only around a quarter of most
companies' shares are freely traded in the market, rather than being tied up
in family or other long-term hands. It is also one of the handful of
institutions that buys corporate debentures and underwrites equity issues.
Money flows into UTI through a vast network of tributaries that spreads
across India. Besides its 75,000 agents, the group also piggy-backs on other
national distribution networks, such as those of fertiliser companies. Units
in UTI schemes are available at many petrol pumps, or mobile collection
points in some urban areas.
The returns paid on its fixed income schemes account for much of UTI's
attraction. It paid a dividend of around 16 per cent last year, some 3
percentage points more than was available on bank deposits. Unlike banks,
UTI is not weighed down by the directed credit policies which have forced
banks to take on large volumes of low-yielding or non-performing loans.
It now plans to launch a money market fund, investing in corporate
certificates of deposit and other short-term debt instruments.
The question for supporters of deregulation is how to break UTI's
stranglehold on the mutual fund industry. Set up in 1964, UTI was
unchallenged until 1986, when some other state-owned financial groups were
allowed into the market. Now, private sector mutual funds are on the horizon
(the Securities and Investments Board of India has yet to publish
regulations governing how such funds are run).
UTI's powerful distribution network and track-record of paying steadily
rising dividends will make it tough to beat. Mr Dave says of his agents:
'They are freelancers, so they are not prohibited from doing business with
others.' However, whether in practice rival mutual funds can feed off the
UTI's network remains to be seen.
As India's capital markets develop, other aspects of UTI's dominance could
also give the reformers pause for thought. How,for instance, can the state
be sure of getting the top price when selling stakes in public sector
companies if UTI is the only bidder of any size?
In February, stakes of up to 20 per cent in 30 state-owned companies were
sold off, the first disposal of its kind. UTI bid successfully for
two-thirds of the shares on offer - only to run into a political storm later
over claims that the shares were sold off too cheaply. Shares in the Steel
Authority of India, the first of these companies to be listed on the stock
market, began trading at around Rs200 each in May. According to one merchant
banker involved in bidding for shares in February, they had been sold by the
government for less than Rs20.
'It's all hindsight,' says Mr Dave. 'Many of the packages of shares offered
by the government were not even taken up. The market grew very fast after
the sale.' Nevertheless, it seems likely that politicians will experiment
with other ways of selling shares in public companies next time.
UTI's power also gives rise to concern in some quarters because of the
implicit political control over its operations. The group is owned by a
variety of state-owned financial institutions, and its chairman is a
political appointee. Could that mean its power as a leading shareholder in
many of India's biggest private companies is susceptible to political
interference?
'We are an investors' organisation. Government has no control over us,' says
Mr Dave. He points to the row that erupted earlier this year between rival
factions in the senior management of Tisco, the steel company owned by the
powerful Tata family. Both factions canvassed support among politicians, but
neither won the backing of the politicians, he says.
However, a political establishment that has grown used to controlling and
directing the financial system through state-owned banks is likely to find
it difficult to allow UTI complete freedom. That is particularly true as the
capital markets develop as an increasingly important source of cash for
Indian companies.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (11): The belt feels the strain - A look at
Faridabad, a leading industrial township
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K. K. SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTO PINS India is a medium-sized company in the old part of the new
industrial township of Faridabad. It is doing well amid neighbouring giants,
such as Escorts and Batas, The company was launched in 1953 shortly after
the township, now in the main industrial belt in Haryana, was started to
rehabilitate refugees from the partition of Punjab in 1947. Land was cheap
and available then. However, it has since all been snapped up by industries
anxious to start operations near Delhi, 16km away.
Mr Ravindra Singh, finance director of Auto Pins India, says he does not
know how much the company's two-acre was bought for but admits: 'It was dirt
cheap. Land was available in abundance then.'
The township has grown enormously since the early 1950s. It now has a
population of more than 700,000, with 9,000 small and large factories spread
over its 4,050 acres. The factories employ over 120,000 people but many more
find jobs in related occupations as the township has grown in all
directions.
Like Auto Pins India, which makes leaf springs for truck manufacturers such
as Ashok Leyland and Telco, most are doing well despite problems they face
in common. Shortage of space to expand is just one of them - the main
highway from New Delhi is built up on both sides by large and small
factories, all anxious to find a slot near Delhi. Many more are in Faridabad
itself which is now a cluster of tall, billowing chimneys. That is why Auto
Pins India is unable to expand.
Although its two-acre site is sufficient for its present operations -
including making anti-roll bars in collaboration with Krupp Bruninghaus of
Germany - its management feels that it will have to go elsewhere if the
company expands.
The company employs 400 workers and with a turnover of Rs115m, it is doing
well. There are many others like Auto Pins India and all of them bemoan the
shortage of electricity. Faridabad's two thermal generating plants lie
almost across the road to Auto Pins India and they lack the capacity to
provide power to all of Faridabad's factories.
'We had to install a captive generating set than runs on diesel. It is
expensive to run but it has to be switched on whenever we have power cuts,'
says Mr Singh.
Power cuts are common and nearly all companies in Faridabad have captive
generators to allow uninterrupted operations. The local authorities have
plans to improve generation but the existing plants are now old and need
replacement themselves, so power shortages will remain indefinitely. All
complain that Faridabad is losing production, or production costs are high,
because of the lack of cheap electricity.
There will be no early easing of the shortage although Faridabad is slated
to have a gas-based station (at present in the planning stage). Labour
problems also sometimes affect work in Auto Pins India, often because
outside unions interfere; it has no problems with its own workers' union.
Wage demands are the main reason even though Auto Pins India pays an average
of Rs1,500 a month, which is good by Indian standards. But outside unions of
transport operators are a major headache.
The Faridabad-Ballabgarh industrial belt is one of the country's biggest,
with a combined turnover of Rs48bn. Large and medium companies producing
goods ranging from needles to giant earth movers and smaller companies
acting as ancillaries. It provides Haryana with its main industrial centre
(the other being the Ambala region).
The other major problem is housing. Faridabad was never meant to be its
present size. A satellite town for Delhi, to which a large part of its
population commutes by bus and train every day, its growth has been
haphazard and its present congestion has deprived it of its planned township
look. Inevitably, pollution is a problem. Residential sectors across the
main highway are now a coveted area while land prices have risen in the past
few years owing to lack of space.
Despite the Haryana government's industrial policy for Faridabad, the
township's residents feel neglected and say that the authorities have failed
adequately to cater for its need for amenities. In any case, Faridabad has
grown almost as much as it can and further industrialisation will have to be
in areas surrounding it.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (10): An all-round advantage - The prospects
of Haryana, the north's only Congress-ruled state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K. K. SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONLY Congress-ruled state in the northern Indian Hindi-speaking belt,
Haryana has ambitious plans for economic development. Mr Bhajan Lal, its
controversial chief minister, won the state a year ago when Mr Devi Lal, the
former deputy prime minister, and his party, the Janata Dal, were trounced.
Because of the Congress victory in Haryana, while the party was routed all
over northern India, the state's officials expect preferential treatment for
its economic development plans. These are no longer confined to agricultural
growth, although it is readily conceded that Haryana is primarily an
agrarian state where food grain production has made rapid strides.
Haryana contributes to the national food grain stocks far more than larger
states because it was one of the states where the green revolution
succeeded. But Haryana has ambitions to be an industrial state as well.
Earlier this year, Mr Bhajan Lal released a statement on its industrial
policy which laid great emphasis on industrialisation as employment in
agriculture had reached saturation point.
Haryana encircles the union territory of Delhi and Mr Lal thinks that this
is the state's biggest advantage in its drive towards industrialisation.
Indeed, one of the objectives of the statement on industrial policy is to
exploit the state's 'strategic advantage' of proximity to New Delhi, which
officials believe to be the gateway to foreign markets.
For this reason that the state aims to attract export-oriented, high-tech
and electronics industries. Indeed, Haryana's industrial belt is like a
noose round the capital. Most of the major industries are located in towns
on New Delhi's border, such as Faridabad and Gurgaon, or a short distance
away.
This has already created problems of overcrowding and pollution, which the
state's officials do not accept though, even in a small state like Haryana,
there are schemes for 'balanced regional development'. These give incentives
to companies to start industries in districts that have none. The
'so-called' backward areas of Haryana provide incentives such as a capital
investment subsidy worth 15 per cent of the total, subject to a maximum of
Rs1.5m, but so far there have been no takers.
Industries are still drawn to areas lying in Delhi's periphery even though
land prices are high and congestion is creating problems such as electricity
shortages and transport bottlenecks. What are known as 'pioneer' units will
get subsidies if they come, varying from Rs5m to Rs1.5m and depending on
size. To encourage them to go to 'backward' areas, these units will qualify
for additional subsidies. These are available for agro-based and food
processing industries at the attractive rate of 25 per cent of investment in
fixed assets (subject to a maximum of Rs3m). Similar subsidies are available
for electronics units.
Officials say they have received many inquiries but it is still too early
for investment decisions. Haryana has several industrial estates where small
and 'tiny' units do a thriving business, although the driving force is the
Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation, which plans to start five
new estates in addition to small village ones to provide self-employment
opportunities for the state's educated youth.
The corporation has already arranged foreign collaboration, including a
halogen auto-lamp project with South Korea, a disposal syringe project with
technology from Britain and an automobile radiator project with Canadian
help. The state's industrial policy, in fact, provides special incentives
for investment by non-resident Indians and foreign firms, citing as
successful examples Maruti Udyog, the country's largest car maker, and
Escorts, a big manufacturer of tractors and motor cycles.
Haryana's success in its plans for industrialisation do not depend entirely
on political stability. The state has a tradition of political defection (Mr
Bhajan Lal himself suffered through defections when Congress was in power
six years ago). New public sector units will be limited by India's economic
reforms and hoped-for handouts from the central government may not
materialise.
To industrialise, Haryana must attract private investment and proximity to
Delhi is at present the only attraction it offers for this. Much will depend
on how successfully it deals with providing an adequate infrastructure for
industrialisation.
Although the state boasts that every village has electricity, the claim is
belied by erratic supply. Power supply cuts sometimes last several days in
the peak harvest season. Many factories have learnt not to depend on the
state electricity board and have installed expensive generating sets. The
government recognises this and has provided subsidies for them.
The state's roads are in an appalling state. Corruption is rampant and funds
for road building are siphoned off by politicians, officials and
contractors. Unfortunately, corruption is a way of life in Haryana; anything
that is connected with officialdom moves only if it involves a bribe.
Prospects in Haryana are not improved by its proximity to Punjab. Violence
has already spilled across the state's borders and investors hesitate to
start businesses in areas close to Punjab which the government wants to
develop. Fortunately, Haryana does not have a serious communal problem.
It does, however, have a caste problem, with a bewildering array of castes
and sub-castes that have their interests, rather than the state's, uppermost
in their minds. Caste is all-pervasive and makes inroads into politics and
officialdom and is responsible for vendettas that are the bane of life in
Haryana.
It is intangibles like this, as are concrete factors like power shortages,
that Haryana must tackle to be on the road to successful economic
development.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (9): Foreign banks ready to seize
opportunities - 'Economic reform has gained such a momentum you cannot turn
it back'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LURE of wide lending margins and a fast liberalising economy make the
eyes of foreign bankers glint. To hear them talk, India is likely to offer
some of the best banking opportunities around in the coming decade, and
foreign banks have a good chance of profiting.
Compared with their domestic rivals, foreign banks have a number of
advantages. They are not weighed down by the requirement to place a fixed
proportion of their deposits in government debt - though they do have to set
aside a certain amount (currently 15 per cent of deposits) for lending to
priority sectors.
Their relative freedom means that they can devote more of their resources to
commercial lending, where margins are around 6 per cent. Nor do foreign
banks face some of the other burdens of domestic banks: the lack of
computerisation or militant unions, for instance. The need to get specific
approval from the authorities every time they want to open a branch is not
seen by most as a severe restriction on business.
Confidence in economic reform lies behind the current enthusiasm of most
foreign bankers. 'It has already gained such a momentum, you cannot turn it
back,' says Mr Hinrich Frese, chief executive of Deutsche Bank in India.
'There is only one way, which is forward, towards further liberalisation.'
Like many foreign financiers in the country, he talks enthusiastically about
the long-term prospects. 'Manufacturers make a mistake to disregard India.'
Several German companies have begun operations in India, including Hoescht,
Bayer and Siemens. So far, Deutsche is the only German bank to have set up
operations to follow them.
The failure of Indian banks to provide modern banking services for their
customers (most have only a handful of computerised branches in metropolitan
centres) has opened up another opportunity for foreign banks. Most bankers
say there is a strong demand for better services. 'What the customer gets in
Pakistan or the Gulf, he expects here,' says Mr Frese.
The potential market is vast. There are fewer than 1m credit cards in issue
in India. Consumer finance hardly exists. 'The only question is, who gets
into the business first,' says Mr Vikram Talwar, senior vice president in
charge of Bank of America's Indian operations.
BoA, along with Citibank and others, says it is making substantial efforts
to gain a foothold in the market. 'This is the only country outside the US
where we are making a major investment in retail business,' says Mr Talwar.
The bank plans to launch itself on the market with the full paraphernalia of
modern retail banking - automated teller machines, home banking, credit
cards and consumer loans. 'Technology is going to be the key,' says Mr
Talwar.
The general mood of optimism, however, has been badly dented by the
securities scandal that has shaken India in recent weeks. The fraud erupted
in the market in which banks trade securities between themselves - a market
which has been developed by the aggressive trading of a handful of foreign
banks in the past decade.
At least two of them - Standard Chartered and ANZ Grindlays - have been
badly stung. Both have had to move funds into the country to bolster the
liquidity of their operations as a result.
Standard Chartered has launched criminal actions to try to recover Rs9.04bn
(Pounds 162m) from brokers and others who it claims defrauded it through the
market. According to the Reserve Bank of India, Standard paid out Rs3bn
without receiving any securities. It is also holding securities with a face
value of Rs7.5bn issued by two small banks, neither of which has sufficient
assets to pay it.
ANZ Grindlays managed to avoid direct loss in the interbank securities
market, but has been tripped up by the fraud in a different way. It received
cheques totalling Rs4bn from the National Housing Bank and paid the money
into the account of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the
scandal.
NHB says it never received any securities for the payments, and that ANZ had
no right to put the money into Mr Mehta's account (the cheques had been made
out in ANZ's name). Mr Mehta and members of his family have since been
charged with fraud, while ANZ has been ordered to repay the Rs4bn to the
NHB.
The fall-out from the securities scandal has made a serious dent in the
reputations of both ANZ and Standard Chartered in India. It has also made
more clear to all foreign banks the risks of operating in the country.
'This is a malfunctioning of the industry - not just of certain participants
in the market,' says Mr Frese of Deutsche Bank. The German bank's own
financial services subsidiary has also been hit by losses in the interbank
market, he says. Until the market is put on a safer footing, it will remain
a precarious place to do business.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (8): Bank reform may be a slow process -
Bold moves, including recapitalisation, are necessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST, tentative steps have been taken in the long process of reviving
India's dilapidated commercial banks. But whether the country's politicians
and banking authorities have the nerve to take the bolder moves that will be
necessary to complete the job has yet to become clear.
The problems engulfing the commercial banks stem from the way the country's
credit system has been used as an instrument of government policy over the
past two decades. Around two-thirds of all lending by banks is in effect
directed by the state.
Three problems have resulted. The first is that banks have been forced to
accept large blocks of low-yielding assets. To finance India's fiscal
deficit, 30 per cent of bank deposits must be invested in government debt
(known as the statutory liquidity ratio). A further 15 per cent is held in
deposits with the central bank.
Some headway has been made in reducing this burden on banks. The statutory
reserve ratio fell from 38.5 per cent in April, and the interest rate paid
on government debt was eased by three-quarters of a percentage point to 12
per cent.
'The tax on credit has come down substantially,' says Mr S. Venkitaramanan,
governor of the Reserve Bank of India. But the Bank is still some way off
allowing the yield on government debt to find its own level in the market.
Banks have also made substantial subsidised loans to meet the social policy
objectives of extending credit into rural areas and to support smaller
companies. By government fiat, 40 per cent of their 'free' deposits (those
not earmarked for government debt or the cash reserve) must go this way.
These subsidies will not disappear. 'In all developing countries, there is
some element of subsidised lending,' says Mr Venkitaramanan. However, the
level of subsidy should come down, and it should be made more transparent,
he says.
The low return on many of their assets has forced banks to charge a huge
margin (currently at around 6 per cent) to the small proportion of their
customers who do not benefit from these subsidies. Not surprisingly, that
has begun to prompt better-quality borrowers to bypass the banking system
altogether: a commercial paper market, currently with around Rs5bn of paper
outstanding, has begun to develop.
With a ceiling on bank deposit rates of 13 per cent, depositors have also
begun to turn away from the banking system towards mutual funds which offer
higher returns. The extent of disintermediation remains minimal, but most
bankers expect it to pick up in the future.
The banks' second problem is the large volume of bad or doubtful debts they
have been forced to shoulder. Establishing quotas for lending to priority
customers has inevitably undermined the credit-assessment process inside
banks.
'The input of credit was necessary,' says Mr G S Dahotre, chairman of the
Bank of India. 'But whether it was done on sound principles is another
matter.'
The effect has been to erode the capital base of the banks - though since
they are not required to disclose their non-performing loans, or the level
of provisions they have made, it remains impossible to assess their true
financial condition. Two years ago, the World Bank suggested that Indian
banks should aim, 'as a first step', for a ratio of capital to assets of 2
per cent. However, the Reserve Bank claims that the position is not as bad
as this suggests - partly because revaluations of some of their assets would
bolster reserves.
'We may be at 4 to 4.5 per cent on a fully adjusted basis,' says Mr
Venkitaramanan.
Whatever the true picture, it is clear that a recapitalisation of the
banking system will be needed. In a report published at the end of last
year, Mr M. Narasimham, a former central bank governor, suggested the
creation of a new fund to take over part of the banks' bad debts, and the
provision of subordinated loans by the government. Stronger banks should
raise capital from the public, Mr Narasimham said.
The Reserve Bank has talked of setting up a new bank to take over lending to
the agricultural sector, and agrees with the need to clear banks of some of
their bad loans. 'We may need an asset reconstruction fund,' says Mr
Venkitaramanan, drawing a parallel with the Resolution Trust Corporation in
the US, the agency which has taken over the assets of savings and loans
institutions.
As yet, though, it has given no clue as to how existing commercial banks
could be recapitalised. The possibility of privatisation has provoked a
backlash from militant bank unions, prompting the government to rule it out
for now.
The third problem for banks is the administrative and political straitjacket
in which they have been held. Virtually every aspect of their operations is
centrally directed, and managers are given little freedom to manoeuvre. That
has created a bureaucratic culture, and a lack of attention to credit
quality or service.
It has also left banks saddled with large unprofitable branch networks and
hefty cost bases. When it was nationalised in 1956, the State Bank of India
(then called the Imperial Bank of India) had 414 branches. It now has 8,500,
a reflection of government policy of extending bank branches into rural
areas. Very few of these branches are computerised - a product in part of
union opposition which has prevented the automation of the banking system.
State Bank has at least been able to automate its central general ledger,
which is more than can be said for others, including Bank of India.
The problem for banks is how to bring down costs and improve service, while
at the same time continuing to work within this straitjacket. The power of
the unions, and the political need to maintain extensive branch networks,
suggest that any progress will be slow.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (7): Where the big numbers are - Market
research into consumer spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE past 10 years, newspapers and magazines in India have given
enormous publicity to what has been called the 'middle class boom'. But
Marg, India's largest market research organisation, believes that the real
boom in consumer spending will spring from the rural areas.
'Here are the really big numbers and the big bucks for companies,' says Mr
Titoo Ahluwalia, the chairman of Marg. He says that once the problems of
distribution and communication have been solved, rising household incomes
and product brand awareness will produce a 'cluster of booms' in different
parts of rural India.
India has a population of 850m and in the past consumer spending was
concentrated in the urban areas. But Marg is not alone in finding soaring
demand from rural and semi-rural areas. Detergent producers like Hindustan
Lever and biscuit manufacturers such as Britannia are experiencing far
stronger sales growth outside urban India.
Mr Ahluwalia believes the strong growth in sales will occur in products such
as agricultural inputs (implements, fertilisers, pesticides), soft products
(soaps, toothpaste and detergents), consumer durables (audios, kitchen
gadgets, refrigerators, two wheelers) and pharmaceuticals. Of
over-the-counter medicines, he says: 'Our studies repeatedly show big
numbers in this sector.'
Part of the growth stems from villagers abandoning traditional herbal
medicines. Rural incomes have grown substantially in the past few years
because of four good monsoons, debt relief measures for farmers and
increasing government procurement prices. This year - depending on how
widespread or bad the drought is - the growth will slow down or could fall.
But over the longer period, substantial increases in agricultural
productivity together with brand awareness should further boost both incomes
and consumer spending.
Marg sees the rapid penetration of television into the rural areas as being
the major factor behind greater product awareness. Mr Ahluwalia cites a
personal anecdote of a village in Goa of 87 households. Two years ago there
were only two TV sets. Now there are 17. 'Young kids are asking about brands
and products', he says. 'That is where the big boom is going to come from.'
Market research presents unusual problems in a country of India's size and
diversity. A typical project involves interviewing in four languages and a
nationwide survey would require 18 languages. Marg, which does public
opinion polling as well as market surveys, blew its own trumpet loudly when
it forecast correctly the number of seats that Congress would win in the
last general election.
For market research purposes Marg classifies 'middle class' in India on
different criteria from those used elsewhere. On a conventional western
definition of 'middle class' as a household with a car, buying a house on a
mortgage and taking a holiday by the sea, the Indian middle class is tiny.
But on the basis of the segment of the population that purchases branded
fast-moving consumer goods, it is very large.
Marg warns that the Indian market has pitfalls of which the foreign investor
is not immediately aware. General Foods discovered this in the mid-1980s
when it launched Tang as a breakfast drink. It failed in India where milk is
traditionally drunk in the early morning and people do not like mixing
citrus with it.
Indians equally have shown no interests in deodorants. They bathe once a
day, and, says Marg, do not believe that 'natural fluids should be
suppressed.' Mr Ahluwalia believes that British companies are failing to
exploit British brand names which are deeply embedded in the past of rural
India. 'British companies are sitting on some pretty powerful properties
which they are being sluggish to exploit.' He says that British companies
have shown a surprising lack of interest in exploring the Indian market.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (6): The scandal that just had to happen -
The financial system is ripe for abuse. In recent weeks, the stock market
bubble has burst after a share purchase scandal that centred on the Bombay
interbank market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCANDAL that has engulfed India's financial establishment this year
threatens to stop the reform of the country's financial markets in its
tracks.
Centring on the Bombay interbank market, but spilling over into the stock
market, the scandal is a typical product of careless financial deregulation:
markets were allowed to develop faster than either regulators or market
infrastructure were able to cope with.
Mr Harshad Mehta, a young broker who won a cult following for his aggressive
share buying over the past year, exploited this weakness to the full.
For months, the financial community had been asking where Mr Mehta raised
the money to make his daring share purchases. The answer is now clear: he
and other brokers succeeded in drawing Rs30bn illicitly out of the interbank
market, according to the Reserve Bank of India. The victims were banks which
traded through Mr Mehta and other brokers, among them State Bank of India,
National Housing Bank and Standard Chartered. Officials from the first two
banks are among those who have been charged with fraud, along with Mr Mehta
and others.
The scandal has emanated from the market for bankers' receipts - the product
of a uniquely Indian blend of excessive administrative control, inadequate
regulation and antiquated systems. Banks are forced to put 30 per cent
(until April, 38.5 per cent) of their deposits into low-yielding government
debt. This has prevented the creation of a normal interbank market, in which
banks deposit surplus cash with each other.
In its place has grown a market in repurchase agreements (or 'repos', known
in India as 'ready forwards') - arrangements under which a bank sells
securities to another bank and agrees to buy them back up to 90 days later
(or vice versa). That way, banks can raise short-term cash without incurring
the statutory reserve requirements.
The second peculiarity of the Indian financial system is that transfers of
government securities are still entered by hand in a ledger maintained by
the Public Debt Office. Powerful unions have held back computerisation,
though the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, says it hopes
to have automated the process by this summer.
The delays in delivery of stock that result - and the cartloads of paper
that banks have to pass between themselves when they buy or sell securities
 -have prompted banks to issue receipts to each other, promising to hand
over securities at a later date. When repurchase agreements are unwound, the
receipts can simply be torn up.
The system is ripe for abuse. Banks (or brokers acting in their name) have
often created receipts not backed by any securities holdings. Some banks
knowingly lent their names to such deals to allow brokers to raise cash.
At the same time, banks' controls over the issuing of receipts have in some
cases been appallingly lax: they have been issued (and accepted) in
photocopy form, with no serial number, and in some cases bearing only the
signature of a junior bank official.
The Reserve Bank knew of problems similar to these, though on a smaller
scale, a year ago, and tried to put the lid firmly on the market. It failed.
In early 1991, the State Bank of India, the country's largest commercial
bank, was dealing in the interbank market at a rate of around Rs10bn (Pounds
500m) a month. By this March, that had shot up to Rs87bn. With little
external regulation or internal control, bank officials and brokers colluded
to suck as much as Rs30.8bn out of this over-charged market, according to
the Reserve Bank.
Much of the extra bank credit that was created in the process is thought to
have been drawn into the stock market, helping to drive the Bombay Stock
Exchange's Sensitive Index (Sensex) up from just over 1,000 early last year
to a peak of 4,500 in April before the scandal broke.
Share prices lost touch with reality. The average price/earnings ratio of
the market peaked at 57 at the end of April.
Most observers of the market claim to be glad that the stock market bubble
has burst - but they do not want to see share prices fall further from what
is still a heady level. With the Sensex standing at around 3,000, the
price/earnings ratio of Indian companies averages just over 30.
By almost any standards, the p/e still looks high. And even then, there is
widespread disbelief in many of the numbers being reported by listed
companies. Share ramping (against the by-laws of only some of India's
exchanges) and insider dealing (still not an offence) are publicly
acknowledged to be rife.
The financial scandal that has come to light in recent weeks has given a new
impetus to the overhaul of financial regulation that was already being
undertaken by the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of
India. This is centred on three areas:
The interbank market. The Reserve Bank has agreed with banks active in the
market a series of restrictions aimed at preventing a recurrence of the
fraud. These include, for instance, restricting trading to government
securities (in the past, banks have actively traded bonds issued by public
sector companies and units in the Unit Trust of India as well). Also, banks
are being encouraged to separate trading, settlement and custody activities
to make it more difficult for frauds to occur.
The stock market. The SEBI is putting pressure on the country's stock
exchanges to regulate their markets better. According to Mr G. V.
Ramakrishna, SEBI president, investors often receive no contract note for
their deals and so often do not know on what day their brokers have dealt or
at precisely what price. There are sometimes long delays in delivery of
shares or cash.
SEBI is also looking over the exchanges' shoulders as they open up their
markets to corporate broking firms for the first time, due within the next
month. Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, has been hired by the Bombay
Stock Exchange to advise on capital adequacy rules for brokers, to replace
the unlimited liability currently imposed on partnerships and sole traders.
The supervision of markets and the regulation of brokers is being left
largely to the exchanges - with SEBI breathing down their necks. 'They know
that if they don't do it, we'll get it done,' says Mr Ramakrishna.
Banking supervision. Discussions are under way about the creation of a new
board of banking supervision independent of the Reserve Bank - a
recommendation contained in a official report on the financial system at the
end of last year by Mr M. Narasimham, a former central bank governor.
At the same time, the Reserve Bank's own relationship with the commercial
banking system has come under scrutiny. It directly owns two banks at the
centre of the scandal in the securities markets, the State Bank of India and
the National Housing Bank. Mr R. Janakiraman, its deputy governor - the man
charged with investigating the fraud - is himself a member of the State
Bank's board.
Mr Venkitaramanan denies that the Reserve Bank has any responsibility for
the way these banks have been run - but he admits the position makes him
uncomfortable. 'There should be separation of ownership and regulation,' he
says.
While attention is currently focused on an overhaul of financial regulation,
the progressive deregulation of India's capital markets has been continuing
apace. Two steps taken in recent weeks indicate the direction and pace in
which things are moving.
The first was the abolition last month of the post of Controller of Capital
Issues, an official whose job it had been to stipulate the price at which
shares could be offered to the public and the interest rates that companies
could pay on their debentures.
This had given rise to the lottery in which investors lucky enough to be
allotted shares at par in a new issue were assured of a hefty paper profit
once secondary trading started. Now, issues are expected to be priced at
closer to their likely market price.
The second step has been the move to free up the country's government debt
market, with the Reserve Bank for the first time inviting tenders for
short-term bills. Interest rates on long-term government debt could also
soon be set by the market, says Mr Venkitaramanan - if wholesale price
inflation falls from its current level of 12.5 per cent, and the country's
fiscal deficit falls towards 5 per cent. These are two very big 'ifs', but
at least interest rates have been moved steadily upwards in recent months to
something more like a true market level.
These and other liberalising moves are now too far advanced for India to
turn back to its old ways, reformers claim - adding that the securities
scandal should not be allowed to prevent further development. 'I don't think
we should restrict capital market activity,' says Mr Venkitaramanan. 'But
the regulatory structures have to catch up.'

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (5): Socialist roots of a master tactician -
Profile: Arjun Singh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE shelf of his study at his home in New Delhi, Mr Arjun Singh, minister
for human resources and a future contender for the premiership, has a bust
of Lenin. He defends the founder of the Soviet Union as a radical reformer.
'As a human being, he has a right to a home'.
But to the visitor, the portrait of Lenin is a signal of where Mr Arjun
Singh wants to position himself in the Congress party. In contrast to Mr
Narasimha Rao, who comes from the south and has become a protagonist for
economic liberalism, Mr Singh is from the Hindi-speaking north and voices
the party's socialist roots and the anguish of its traditional electoral
base among the rural poor.
Mr Rao sought to silence Mr Singh's criticism of the government's shift to
pro-market policies by naming him as chairman of the committee set up to
draft the economic policy document presented to the party's main
policy-making body - the All India Congress Committee - at its session at
Tirupati in April.
A master tactician, Mr Singh characteristically drafted a policy platform
that had the party facing two ways at once - endorsing the Nehruvian
socialism of its past while giving Mr Rao a free hand over liberalisation.
But the statement in the document that there will be no retrenchment in the
public sector - only retraining - bears his hand.
At the same time Mr Singh used the Tirupati session to distance himself from
Mr Rao and demonstrate his credentials as his successor. He urged elections
to the Congress Working Committee (CWS) which runs the day-to- day affairs
of the party - a departure from a past in which Mrs Gandhi and her son Rajiv
nominated loyalists to the party's top jobs.
In the election that followed, Mr Singh was the candidate who won most
support with 435 votes. Working hand in hand with Mr Sharad Pawar, the
minister of defence, he organised a list of names that won bloc support from
the northern states. Mr Rao was miffed at what he considered a challenge to
his authority and asked all those who were elected to resign. Both Mr Singh
and Mr Pawar refused.
After weeks of deadlock, the two ministers came up with the compromise that
they would resign if Mr Rao at the same time nominated them to the
committee. The prime minister agreed.
Having made his point, Mr Singh now pooh-poohs any idea that he is a
contender for the post of party leader or prime minister. 'Not by any
chance,' he says. 'Don't be under a false illusion.'
He adds: 'What I consider of primary importance is that we have to maintain
unity in the Congress party and remain solidly behind the prime minister.'
Urbane and unfailingly courteous, Mr Singh does not look the socialist
politician that he was before joining the Congress. A voracious reader and a
pragmatist, he would probably adapt his policies to circumstances as prime
minister.
Mr Singh has responsibility for education as minister for human resources.
But he shows no sign of bending to pressure from the World Bank and the
international donor community to make primary education compulsory. 'To
bring in compulsion does not go well,' he says.
A former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh - the large central Indian state
where the BJP is now in power - Mr Singh also leads the wing in the Congress
that favours confrontation with the Hindu radical party. He has been at odds
on this with the prime minister, who believes that the Congress needed BJP
support to pass its economic policies.
Mr Singh had to step down from the post of chief minister in 1989 after his
family was implicated in a lottery scandal in the state. Now he takes a
tough attitude towards foreign banks which have overstepped the law in the
Bombay stock market scandal. 'The laws of the country have to be observed,'
he says. 'If they have violated the laws - Indian or foreign banks - the law
will take its own course.'

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (4): Rao faces storm over market abuses -
Congress has regained self-confidence. But one issue now dominates politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN PARLIAMENT reconvenes next month for the monsoon session, there will be
one issue on the agenda - the government's handling of the Bombay stock
market scandal.
Opposition leaders have already claimed that ministers are involved. They
seem likely to press their demands for the resignation of Mr S.
Venkitaramanan, the central bank governor, and for Dr Manmohan Singh, the
finance minister, as the two men who should accept moral responsibility for
the abuses that occurred.
But as yet, the political fall-out of the stock market scandal has still to
make its full impact on political parties or public opinion. Interpreting
the results of a handful of by-elections held earlier this month, a Congress
party spokesman triumphantly claimed that their message was that 'that the
nation has no alternative to the Congress and the Congress has no
alternative to Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao'.
This is the hyperbole of party political machines. Nonetheless, the claim
reflects what had been a growing self-confidence within the Congress. A year
ago the party would have been ridiculed if it had dared to make it.
The Congress was returned to power in 1991 as the single largest party in
parliament, but it lacked an absolute majority. In the election it gathered
only a handful of seats in the Hindi-speaking north - once the stronghold of
its power - and the bulk of its new parliamentary membership came from the
south and west.
With the assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi during the election campaign - and
thus the end of the Nehru family's long domination of Indian politics -
Congress looked a rudderless ship. Mr Narasimha Rao, 71, was a compromise
choice to head the party. He seemed to have little chance of imposing his
will on it or on the government he formed.
By contrast, the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which surged in
strength in the 1989 and 1991 elections on a platform of anti-Moslem
sentiment and populist national rejuvenation, seemed rattling at the doors
of power. It won 123 seats in the 1991 election and also consolidated its
grip over state assemblies in the north. It is in power in Uttar Pradesh,
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh.
Many political observers thought that the combination of a weak Congress and
a resurgent BJP would result in a political instability that would force an
early general election. But this month's by-elections - though only a
partial indicator - confirm the shift in the landscape that has taken place
since last year.
The Congress regained the New Delhi constituency that Mr L. K. Advani, the
BJP leader, won in the 1991 election and gained a state assembly seat in the
north. It lost seats in the south - but nonetheless its performance was much
better than the BJP which found itself on the retreat in most areas where
elections were held.
There is thus no longer talk of an early general election. The government
faces a stormy passage over both the political fall-out from the financial
scandal and unrest over high prices and a bad monsoon. But this parliament
could still last another two years - or even run its full term.
The cold calculation behind this is that no political party has an interest
in an early election. The Congress wants to wait until it has refurbished
its image, brought down inflation and until the economic reforms have had
time to show what are hoped to be their beneficial effects. The BJP is
equally unwilling to risk a poll at a time when its own popularity is waning
and the BJP governments in the northern states have yet to make an impact.
The Janata Dal and the left are also too fragmented and too disorientated to
seek an early election.
This turnaround in Congress fortunes has mainly been due to Mr Rao. He
declined to bring any of the other parties into a coalition when he came to
power - preferring to seek a fresh majority in parliament on different
issues and counting on divisions within the opposition to work to his
advantage. This strategy has worked.
The Janata Dal of Mr V. P. Singh, the former prime minister, has
disintegrated over the year with some of its factions now supporting
Congress from the outside and some joining it. With Mr Advani, the BJP
leader, Mr Rao sought ad hoc alliances to pass key reforms such as the first
budget and the earlier measures of trade and industrial deregulation. But
this cosy working relationship has run into opposition from the rank and
file of both parties who want a more confrontational relationship that
allows them to establish their different identities and to mark the
differences.
Nonetheless, with the help of defections and windfalls such as the holding
of postponed elections in Punjab, which were boycotted by the Akali (Sikh)
parties, Mr Rao has a de facto majority in parliament. The Congress also
benefits electorally from being perceived as a party with a programme.
Liberalisation has its enemies - both within the party and without - but the
Congress is now building an image as a party of change. In the past,
disillusionment with Congress as a tired institution more preoccupied with
patronage than policy played a large element in the erosion of its support.
By contrast to the modest recovery Congress has been making - it still
remains weak in the north - the BJP has allowed its advantages to fritter
away. It did itself much damage in January by its march on Kashmir. An
occasion intended to mobilise Hindu opinion behind a nationalist campaign to
show that Kashmir was an integral part of the Indian union, it ended up by
revealing the vulnerability of the Indian state in the face of Kashmiri
nationalism. The march also broke the myth of the BJP as a successful
organiser of mass populist movements.
The failure of the Kashmir march also showed up the divisions within the BJP
leadership - a party that has prided itself on its discipline and unity. Its
image received a further blow when one of its female activists - and an MP
as well - attracted large publicity as a result of an alleged affair with a
another senior party leader. Adding to its woes, the younger generation in
the party has been frustrated that they have been given no real access to
power.
The paradox in all this is that before the financial scandal broke, Mr Rao
was not able to exploit more fully the growth in confidence of the Congress
party and his own authority within it. As prime minister, his hesitation
over taking decisions and his reluctance to face confrontations with
powerful lobbies such as the unions and the farmers have, if anything,
grown.
He called a meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) - the party's
main policymaking forum, which meets at only rare intervals - at Tirupati in
the south in April. The occasion was intended to endorse his own leadership
over the party and to give him a freer hand in pursuing his reform
programme.
But after the conference did just that, Mr Rao seemed to stumble and has not
recovered his footing since. He took elections to the party's working
committee - which handles day-to-day management of the party - as a
challenge to his authority. He called on the 10 elected members - including
Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister, and Mr Arjun Singh, the natural
resources minister, to resign. Both refused.
Mr Rao then took a long time to find a compromise to his party problems. He
also postponed a cabinet reshuffle - in part needed to replace Mr M. Solanki
as foreign minister. Mr Solanki was forced to resign after handing over a
letter to the Swiss authorities requesting them to go slow on investigations
into the payments of commission by Bofors, the Swedish arms manufacturer, to
win an Indian arms contract.
The opposition alleges that part of Mr Rao's indecisiveness and discomfort
since then is that he was more aware of the contents of the letter than he
has let on. It is the resurrection of the Bofors affair that makes the
government even more on the defensive when faced with charges that ministers
were involved in the Bombay financial scandal.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (2): Radical changes needed to achieve
export growth - The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for the Indian economy contains one unex- pectedly bright
feature and some disquieting ones.
The most positive feature is that a year after the country came close to
defaulting on its foreign debt repayments, the foreign exchange reserves had
climbed by end-April to an unexpectedly high Dollars 5.4bn  - equivalent to
just over three months' imports.
The leeway that this provides has principally come from once-and-for-all
emergency cuts in imports and exceptional external financing from the IMF,
the World Bank and the donor nations.
The disquieting features are that inflation has remained insistently high.
As against a target agreed with the IMF that inflation would fall to 9 per
cent at the end of fiscal 1991-92 year in March and to 6 per cent by March
1993, the inflation rate has hovered around the 12-13 per cent mark over the
last nine months.
If the drought in parts of the north is exacerbated by a bad monsoon over
the coming months - current forecasts suggest well below normal rainfall -
this could add seriously to the upward pressure on prices.
Real growth in GDP is for the second year running likely to be at a low for
the decade of 2-3 per cent. Growth in industrial output picked up in
February - rising by 3.4 per cent as compared with 12 months before  - but
was zero or negative for 1991-92 as a whole. This was due to both
government-imposed curbs on imports and to the squeeze on domestic demand
caused by the tight credit policy of the Reserve Bank of India (the central
bank) and thus higher interest rates.
The third disquieting feature is that there is little sign of export growth
picking up at a pace necessary to meet India's import and debt repayment
requirements. Exports in dollar terms actually declined a little in 1991-92
to Dollars 18bn - mainly as a result of the collapse of the Soviet market.
This year - with hard currency markets still sluggish as a result of the
recession - exports are unlike- ly to grow in dollar terms by more than 6-8
per cent as compared to the 15-17 per cent achieved in the late 1980s.
The overriding question for the economy is whether these elements reflect
the temporary difficulties of readjustment, or whether they carry the risk
of the economy running aground in the quagmire of stagnant growth,
unacceptably high inflation and persistent balance of payments difficulties.
The prospect of a bad monsoon adds to the difficulties.
Mr Deepak Nayaar, the former chief economic adviser who believes that India
runs the risk of South American- style stagflation, draws the conclusion
that policy should give first priority to reducing deficits and inflation.
He fears that if stabilisation is combined with an ambitious restructuring
programme - particularly if the economy is opened up to higher levels of
imports - India faces the risk of continuing depreciation of the currency,
higher inflation and low economic growth.
The World Bank and the IMF share some of these doubts about the economy's
short- term performance. But they are pushing for more radical change -
increased labour flexibility, privatisation and major reforms in the
financial sector to achieve more efficient credit allocation - as necessary
to improve international competitiveness and exports.
It is disputes about the pace of these reforms - with the government
agreeing over the direction but hesitant over the timing - that is holding
up World Bank sectoral loans to India and further IMF low interest funds.
That India came close to default a year ago was a result of the govern-
ment's failure in the 1980s to bring the budget and balance of payments
deficits under control. Real GDP in the late 1980s rose by an annual aver-
age of 6 per cent. But the budget deficit rose to 8-9 per cent of GDP and
the current account deficit in 1990-91 to 3.5 per cent of GDP.
The two budgets presented by Dr Manmohan Singh, the minister of finance,
have brought the budget deficit down in line with IMF targets - to 6.5 per
cent of GDP in 1991-92 and to a projected 5 per cent in the 1992-93 budget
put before parliament in February.
But in practice the stabilis- ation programme has been less tough than these
figures suggest. The 1991-1992 target was achieved with the help of
accounting devices such as the postponement of fertiliser subsidy payments.
More worrying for the future, the projected reduction in the deficit this
year is being achieved more by cutting cap- ital spending (infrastructure,
health, rural development) than current spending (sub- sidies, wages and
public sector employment). Thus as a prop- ortion of GDP, capital spending
will fall by 2.1 per cent over the two years to March 1993 while current
spending will fall by only 1.2 per cent.
The insufficiently tight rein on fiscal policy has helped fuel a faster rate
of monetary expansion than anticipated and hence higher inflation. The broad
measure of money supply (M3) rose last year by 19 per cent as against a
central bank target of 13 per cent. Most of this came from the build-up in
the foreign exchange reserves. But government borrowing from the banking
system rose by 25 per cent.
Since April, it has become harder and costlier for the government to finance
its deficit from the banking system. The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by
which the banks are required to lodge a proportion of their deposits with
the Reserve Bank was cut from 38.5 to 30 per cent and the government has
also begun to auction treasury bills - meaning it must pay a market price
for its own borrowings.
But until these shifts in monetary policy, the impact of high interest rates
had fallen on the private sector. Prime corporate borrowers now pay 19.7 per
cent. The high cost of money together with the import curbs were the two
most important factors behind the slump in industrial growth last year.
After rising by an annual average of 8-9 per cent over the last few years,
the growth in industrial output was flat or negative in 1991-92 as a whole.
The emergency curbs on imports - including a 200 per cent cash margin on
opening a credit line - were primarily responsible for the slashing of the
current account deficit in 1991-92 to Dollars 3bn from Dollars 8.5bn the
previous year. Imports, which accounted for 9 per cent of GDP in the late
1980s and which through foreign tie-ups and technology transfers were
responsible for much of the increased productivity in the economy, fell by
30 per cent to Dollars 20.7bn (balance of payments figures).
With the major improvement in the foreign exchange reserves, the import
restrictions were lifted earlier this year. The World Bank expects that even
if imports rise in dollar terms this year by 20 per cent, they will still be
below the 1990-91 level and thus lower in real terms and as a proportion of
GDP.
What is clear, however, is that the limiting factor on restructuring and
growth in the coming years will be India's capacity to finance the higher
imports needed to achieve faster technological change and higher rates of
productivity.
In the 1980s India was able to finance imports with the help of commercial
borrowings abroad. But since last year this avenue has been largely closed
because of the nervousness of foreign banks about India's creditworthiness.
India also faces a larger burden of debt repayments than it did in the
1980s. With outstanding foreign debt of Dollars 74bn - or 27 per cent higher
than five years ago - repayments of interest and principal will this year
account for 30 per cent of export earnings. Amortisation payments will
almost double over the next few years from Dollars 3.8bn this year to
Dollars 6bn in 1996-97.
Though foreign investment approvals have climbed sharply since the change in
policies, their contribution in balance of payments terms is relatively
small. By the mid-1990s direct foreign investment inflow could, on present
trends, reach at most Dollars 1bn a year.
Last year the World Bank, the IMF and the donor nations contributed Dollars
3.7bn in exceptional external financing. India is this year seeking
exceptional financing of about Dollars 3bn. But some donor nations including
Japan are increasingly reluctant to contribute.
All this underlies the necessity of more structural radical changes needed
to achieve much higher export growth. Without this, India could find itself
heading for another balance of payments crisis.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (1): Chances are slipping away - India is
not moving fast enough to implement much-needed economic reforms. The Bombay
stock market scandal and a poor monsoon this year will add to its problems
of inflation and the balance of payments
</HEADLINE>

THE RADICAL reforms announced last year by Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao's new
Congress administration made many friends of India feel that the country -
which has been a slow runner among Asian nations - could be poised for a
period of rapid change. But the government is now in danger of letting these
opportunities slip away.
Mr Rao, the prime minister, has a clear sense of the path that India must
take in the wake of the collapse of two historic cornerstones of Indian
economic and foreign policy - Jawaharlal Nehru's concept of economic
self-sufficiency, which ran aground last year when India came close to
defaulting on its international debt payments, and friendship with the
Soviet Union, which fell apart with the disintegration of the Communist
empire.
The prime minister is committed to making the Indian economy more
internationally competitive and to achieving growth through higher exports.
He sees the need for closer ties with the US, both to mobilise aid and
investment and as now the only superpower with the leverage to exert
pressure on India's adversary, Pakistan.
Mr Rao has his eyes on a comprehensive settlement with Pakistan that would
cover the disputed issues of borders, Kashmir and nuclear rivalry  - and
which could pave the way for arms reductions on both sides. He also
recognises that market economics require a far larger devolution of power to
the states than was palatable to most members of the Nehru family.
This programme of internal and external restructuring marks a substantial
change of direction for a country that ploughed the same furrow for too
long. But between knowing where he wants to go and getting there, the prime
minister has lost his nerve.
Over recent months, he has begun to flounder politically.
Uncharacteristically, he was knocked off balance by allegations that he had
a hand in the cover-up of commission payments to Bofors, the Swedish arms
manufacturer. Then, he made a serious tactical blunder in treating an
internal election to the Congress party's main policymaking organisation as
a challenge to his power.
His short-term difficulties are likely to be exacerbated by two problems
that now loom large on the horizon. The Bombay stock market scandal - in
which banks and financial institutions stand to lose Rs30bn through
fraudulent securities dealings - threatens to paralyse the administration as
allegations grow that senior ministers and civil servants were involved. It
has already resulted in a drying up of funds in the stock market, the
interbank market and even retail trade.
The other major problem is the growing danger that after four years of good
monsoons, the rains could fail this year - thus pushing up prices beyond the
already high 12-13 per cent inflation rate. If the drought, already
widespread in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, grows worse or
spreads, the government could find itself faced with widespread unrest and
violence.
An elderly, cautious patrician, Mr Rao sprung a surprise last year by the
radical response of his government to the threat of debt default - and more
surprises could be in store. He then carried through an unexpectedly large
25 per cent devaluation of the rupee and extensive trade and industrial
deregulation.
Mr Rao followed this up this year with a budget that made the rupee
partially convertible, brought down the budget deficit to a projected 5 per
cent of GDP for 1992-93 and initiated tax reforms.
Over the last year, the prime minister has transformed what had begun as a
minority government in the parliament into one that has a de facto majority.
By contrast, the Opposition - the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the
Janata Dal and the left - have been weakened through their own internal
divisions.
Yet, Mr Rao's failure as a reformer stems from his reluctance to confront
the powerful lobbies that have long resisted change in India.
He has postponed promised reductions in the fertiliser subsidy because of
opposition from farmers. He has put off reductions in the size of the civil
service and the public sector and a halt to inflation-adjusted wage
increases because of union opposition.
The unions have also held out so far against privatisation and the
introduction of more flexible labour practices in industry.
Industry itself has successfully resisted tariff cuts that would draw blood
through the competition of foreign imports. Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance
minister, announced in the budget that the maximum tariff would be reduced
to 110 per cent and that tariffs would come down over the next three years
to levels comparable with other developing countries. But the effect of
tariff cuts so far on industry has been offset by the impact of a sharply
depreciating currency.
Mr Rao's reason for avoiding confrontation is that a country that is
socially as fragile as India cannot afford further division and secondly
that change requires a consensus. But with the government dithering, the
momentum of reforms has been lost and opposition lobbies have been able to
entrench themselves more deeply.
The delays are trying the patience of the IMF and the World Bank, and of
bilateral donors to whom India is looking for a further Dollars 3bn in
exceptional balance of payments financing this year. They are one of the
reasons why the sharp increase in foreign investment approvals - indicating
a growing interest in gaining a foothold in India - have not been followed
up by substantial inward equity flows.
But most of all, the slow pace of adjustment will mean a slower growth for
the economy over the longer run. Already, India is piling up future
bottlenecks by postponing urgently needed decisions over telecommunications,
power and other infrastructure projects.
The budget, equally, reflected a shortsighted tactic of sacrificing future
growth to avoid present pain. The cuts in the deficit were achieved more
from reducing capital investment than current spending.
But the major constraint on future growth is the potential shortage of
foreign exchange needed to finance imports - hence technological change and
higher productivity. With an outstanding foreign debt of Dollars 74bn, India
no longer has the access to the international commercial markets it had in
the 1980s and foreign investment is still relatively small.
Its foreign exchange requirements will thus have to come from an expansion
of manufacturing exports, which reflects a major restructuring of industry
and a reduction in its cost levels. With exports still growing slowly, there
are not as yet the signs of a change of the magnitude required.
India is already experiencing its second year of low growth. Real GDP this
year, as last, is likely to increase by only 2-3 per cent - or by not much
more than the growth in population. The surest way to prepare the ground for
a return to the caste, communal and ethnic violence India witnessed 18
months ago would be a prolonged period of slow or average growth.
The same caution that Mr Rao has brought to economic reform he has applied
to his handling of India's foreign relations. The two overlap since he feels
that, until he is more comfortable at home, he cannot take risks abroad.
Mr Rao quickly recognised that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, India
needed US support to exert pressure on Pakistan and to obtain substantial
funding through the World Bank and the IMF. President Sadat looked to the US
in a similar way to enlist its support against Israel.
India has made some modest steps towards drawing closer to the US -
including the diplomatic recognition of Israel and joint Indo-US naval
exercises. Mr Rao's task has not been made any easier by the clumsiness of
US diplomacy in handling disputes with India over trade, missile technology
and nuclear proliferation.
Within the country, there is also a growing recognition that India - no more
than Pakistan - can indefinitely defy world concern over the risks of
nuclear rivalry. India is thus showing more readiness to pursue
confidence-building measures with Pakistan and to accept US observation of
missile tests.
There is also a recognition that any agreement with Pakistan over the
nuclear issue would have to be part of a broader settlement. India is now
signalling that it is ready for border adjustments, an open frontier and the
resumption of normal trade. A peace treaty allowing both sides to make
substantial reductions in defence spending and which would have been
unthinkable a few years ago is at least imaginable now.
The real issue is whether the governments in Delhi and Islamabad will have
the strength to overcome the lobbies in their own countries that are hostile
to such detente. With Mr Rao, the hesitations have the upper hand.
So far, the government has sidestepped the issue of devolution of power to
the states. But the states themselves are becoming increasingly exasperated
with a central government whose overriding powers they resent and which
cannot meet their demand for resources.
States are beginning to compete among themselves for private sector, foreign
investment and aid funds. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the
resurgence of ethnic and regional movements have opened their eyes and
ambitions.
In India there is a reluctance to face up to problems until action proves
unavoidable. Myopia over macro-economic management brought India close to
defaulting on its international debt last year. The external support now
being provided by the World Bank, the IMF and the donor nations provides
India with a breathing space in which to carry out much needed structural
change. The risk of not doing so is that India will drift into another
crisis.

VENEZUELA plans to stretch maturities on a portion of non-restructured
external debt from two to four years by issuing new bonds. It is to
restructure up to Dollars 1.5bn of obligations maturing in 1992-93, out of a
total of Dollars 5bn in non-restructured public sector external debt. This
includes commercial paper issued to cover Venezuelan military purchases and
non-guaranteed credits on exports to Venezuela.
Air India has raised a total of Dollars 651m in the syndicated loans market
to help pay for four Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft, writes Sara Webb.
The financing consists of a Dollars 74m secured commercial loan maturing in
1999, and a Dollars 577m commercial loan guaranteed by the Export-Import
Bank of the US, with a maturity of 2006. Air India is understood to be
paying a margin of Libor plus 1 percentage point on the Dollars 74m tranche
and a margin of Libor plus  7/8 of a percentage point on the Dollars 577m
tranche.

FT  26 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) World Trade News: US labour fears Mexican role
in the revolution - The trade pact has divided American labour and business
along traditional lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 2nd July 1992) appended to this article.
Lobbyists locked in debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta) concur on at least one point: jobs will be lost and jobs will be
gained if the pact becomes a reality.
While the Bush administration portrays the Nafta as a job-creating dynamo,
American unions fear it will throw thousands of workers out on the streets.
There are studies to support each contention.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman of Eastman-Kodak and head of the government's
private sector Nafta group, argues that the pact will create US jobs, citing
the example of his own company. Eastman-Kodak expanded in Mexico in the
1960s to penetrate the trade barriers of the day. Since then, for every
three jobs created in Mexico, the company says it has hired one additional
support person in its US facilities.
Mr Whitmore gives numerous examples of added jobs resulting from Mexican
trade and investment. Procter &amp; Gamble expects free trade to result in 2,000
new jobs, he said. Dana Corp, a car parts supplier, exports twice as much to
Mexico as it manufactures there: 'Every story of added exports is a story of
added jobs in this country,' he said. However, US unions cite a long list of
companies which have closed down or laid off workers from US plants to move
production to Mexico. These include the last Zenith television manufacturing
facility in the US, American Car, producer of freight cars, which once
employed 4,000 in St Louis, Missouri; Grand Met's Jolly Green Giant, which
slashed employment from 12,000 to 115 workers after the move; and three
jean-making plants owned by Farah Co. which employed 3,750 in the early
1980s but only 410 today.
'In contrast to the soothing bromides found in the economic textbooks, this
rapid increase in trade has produced few benefits to the economy of either
Mexico or the US,' says Mr Rudy Oswald, an economist with the AFL-CIO, the
US labour organisation.
Mr Charles Bremer, international trade director of the American Textile
Manufacturers' Institute, estimates that 200,000 of the 1m American clothing
workers will lose their jobs as a result of the Nafta. It will be less
traumatic for the textile industry, which now supports the pact because it
has managed to get protection built in at the negotiating table; its future
losses are reckoned in the tens of thousands.
The International Institute of Economics, in its report 'North American Free
Trade: Issues and Recommendations', by Messrs Garry Hufbauer and Jeffrey
Schott, examined all the job projection data and concluded that 112,000 US
workers will be dislocated by a Nafta, but 130,000 net new jobs will be
created. The outlook for unskilled workers is 'bleak', they say.
The Bush administration and the large US companies pushing for the Nafta
envisage a marriage between US technology and Mexican labour creating
products competitive with any produced in Asia or Europe. They suggest that
the US will get 'good' high-wage skilled jobs because its workforce is more
educated, while the manual or mass production jobs will go to the cheap
labour in Mexico. This sidesteps the fact that many of the 'good'
manufacturing jobs also will go south.
The pro-Nafta forces argue that companies in search of cheap labour might,
without a Nafta, move to Asia; Mexicans, at least, show a preference for US
imports. 'With or without a Nafta, low-wage workers in many sectors of the
US economy will continue to face strong competitive pressures from abroad,'
say Messrs Hufbauer and Schott.
For this reason, Democrats in Congress will withhold approval of the
agreement unless it is accompanied by a significant job training programme
for workers whose job losses can be traced to the pact, and a commitment on
funding. They are unimpressed by plans for a new training scheme from the
administration which has repeatedly cut back current programmes.
The administration last year also promised to agree a joint 'action plan'
with Mexico on labour rights, including improved working conditions, child
labour laws and health and safety measures. Much to the disgust of many
Democrats, all that is expected to emerge is a fact-finding plan, like a
study of Mexican labour.
This will provide ammunition for the AFL-CIO and its allies in Congress, who
say that they will support only 'the right kind of Nafta'. By that they mean
one that has Mexican agreement to allow unionisation free of the kind of
government control which has suppressed Mexican wages.
'If the collective bargaining system does not function, Mexico will maintain
its low wage advantage for a generation or more,' said one US union
official. He contended that unless wages are permitted to rise to create a
large middle class then Mexico will not develop into a consumer market
capable of supporting American jobs.
Mr Sheldon Friedman, an AFL-CIO economist, sees the Nafta as an attempt by
the administration to help the US oil companies 'get their foot in the door'
in Mexico and to help US banks recover their bad loans.
Correction (published 2nd July 1992)
Grand Met's Jolly Green Giant reduced employment by more than 1,200 to 115
workers in the period from 1983 to the present; not from 12,000 as reported
in the Financial Times of June 26.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Standard Chartered: Correction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Owing to a transmission error, the Financial Times yesterday incorrectly
reported that the Indian authorities had brought criminal charges against
Standard Chartered Bank in India in connection with a securities market
scandal. The report should have said that criminal charges had been brought
against two former employees of Standard Chartered Bank.

FT  25 JUN 92 / The Faltering Recovery: Chicken industry finds some
sustenance - Recession has hit the Midlands hard but it is not all gloom.
Two companies illustrate the contrasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS PENNY SMITH is not a pin-striped finance director. Around the plant of
Perry Poultry she wears the same as everybody else - white wellies, white
overall, blue hairnet, white helmet. She washes her hands and disinfects her
boots when she enters each part of the plant and does the same when she
leaves.
Hygiene is important in the chicken business. Perry Poultry buys plucked and
gutted chickens which it cuts, portions and packs. It marinates them -
tandoori flavour so far, garlic and herb soon.
Perry Poultry is a small player in a crowded industry, based in Bilston in
the heart of the Black Country, a part of the west Midlands better known for
metal processing than food processing.
The metal processors are deep in recession, but Perry Poultry has been
expanding since its first production in August 1989.
Yet the food processing industry has its own hazards. 'Orders are fairly
easy to get if you are a conforming plant (one which meets European
Community standards) with a good reputation,' said Mr Alistair Ross, Perry
Poultry's chairman and main shareholder. 'To make a profit out of it is
where the skill comes in. It is not to be recommended for people with a
nervous disposition.'
The problem is that the profit margin is narrow. Perry Poultry would like to
make 4 per cent. More usually it has to make do with 2 per cent or 3 per
cent. The line between success and failure is fine.
Directly or indirectly, Perry Poultry supplies the likes of Kentucky Fried
Chicken, Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Tesco. Mrs Smith explained:
'Our customers are looking for lower prices all the time but we don't see
any raw material costs coming down: there's the squeeze.'
So far, Perry Poultry has carved its way through the conflicting pressures.
It lost Pounds 35,000 pre-tax in its first year, but in 1990 had pre-tax
profits of Pounds 188,000 on a turnover of Pounds 5.27m. It staged a further
advance last year, and this year will probably have pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 400,000 and turnover of Pounds 15m.
To keep profits rising, Perry Poultry has to nurture its place in the
market. This it seeks to do by offering flexibility, service and quality:
orders are usually despatched the same day or the day after they come in and
the chicken is cut manually, achieving a greater accuracy than machine
cutting.
But the company also has to keep its costs down. It used bank finance for
its early development but last year preferred to expand using equity
finance. It had a cash injection of Pounds 250,000 from 3i, the venture
capital group, in exchange for 15 per cent of the equity. Now Perry Poultry
looks to TSB, its banker, only for working capital.
But its biggest overhead is labour costs. The company started with 30
employees and now has 270 on basic wages of between Pounds 137 and Pounds
160 for a 36-hour week. But there is little pressure for higher wages.
Unemployment in Bilston is too high for that.

FT  25 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY selling by independent traders coupled with the early weakness in the
fixed interest markets caused stock index futures to fall to a post-general
election low in a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The FT-SE futures contract for September delivery opened strongly at 2,592.
This proved to be the high of the day as independent traders holding long
overnight positions began selling the contract, sending September into
retreat.
The weakness in gilts, ahead of the gilts auction, also hurt sentiment, but
its successful completion was among factors that caused a small rally in the
September contract. However, sellers then emerged to send the contract to
the day's low of 2,566 early in the afternoon, before the firm opening on
Wall Street helped to produce a bounce before the close.
September finished at 2,582, down 9 from the previous session but around 17
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 35. Turnover
reached 7,130 contracts.
Volume in the traded options market was again high, totalling 46,028 lots,
boosted by yesterday's expiry of the June stock options. The FT-SE option
traded 12,152.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with 5,768 contracts dealt, followed by
British Steel on 3,610 lots transacted.

FT  25 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Volume rises as shares resume slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TROUBLED session on the UK stock market took a turn for the worse
yesterday afternoon when the latest ruling from the US Supreme Court brought
heavy falls in tobacco shares in London and New York. At the day's low the
FT-SE Index was 33 points down, but the market rallied as losses in the
tobacco leaders were halved after analysts took a closer look at the US
legal ruling. The final reading put the FT-SE at 2,532.6, down 28 points on
the day.
At least two large two-way trading programmes helped boost the day's equity
turnover to 582.1m shares from the 369.2m recorded in the previous session.
The split between buying and selling orders underlined current trends in the
London stock market; fund managers are selling stocks considered to have
over-performed in the euphoria which followed the UK general election, but
are also buying stocks likely to hold steady until a genuine recovery in the
economy appears.
Dealers reported substantial but highly selective business in equities. BAT
Industries was traded very heavily, and selling pressure was seen in oil
issues until Wall Street cheered London by commencing its new session with a
gain of 16 Dow points in UK hours.
ICI, however, fell sharply on turnover of fewer than 1m shares, while Lloyds
Bank, several pence firmer at the close, saw less than 500,000 traded.
The market was held back by the list of new issues known to be overhanging
fund managers. Lasmo edged higher after disclosing details of its plans to
sell the US assets acquired with Ultramar; the prospective pricing was at
least no worse than the London market had feared. Wellcome, which will give
details today of its planned public offering of stock, weakened but traders
pointed out that barely 500,000 shares changed hands.
The London market's other worry is still the international front, where
concern regarding Wall Street lifted somewhat after an unexpected fall of
2.4 per cent in US durable goods orders last month prompted suggestions that
the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates again in order to stimulate
economic activity. But deeper concerns regarding the outlook for the
Japanese equity market, as well as the economy, continued to unsettle
analysts in London.
On the home front, the resumed slide by equities brought the FT-SE 2,500
line into hazard. Some analysts fear that, if this level is breached, then
the market could be challenged all the way down to 2,420. However, the more
sanguine analysts hold to the view that London is well supported on
valuation grounds and will stabilise - if only Wall Street and Tokyo hold
firm.
Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained relatively light
during the most recent shakeout in share prices. The daily total has topped
the important Pounds 1bn mark only once in the past seven trading sessions.
The market is still nearly 100 Footsie points above its pre-general election
level and the absence of heavy selling indicates confidence ahead of the end
of the second quarter, now only a week away.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate cut hopes support Dow
after poor data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ANOTHER modest improvement was scored yesterday by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average as investors' hopes for a reduction in interest rates were boosted
by unexpectedly bad economic data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow blue chip indicator ended 5.08 firmer at 3,290.70, although below
the high for the day when the index momentarily breached 3,300. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, lost a slight 0.21 on balance
at 403.83, while the Nasdaq composite index was finally 1.97 off at 551.39.
Turnover on the New York SE was 194m shares.
The news from the Commerce Department, that durable goods orders fell 2.4
per cent in May, would normally have depressed market sentiment. Analysts
had expected a modest rise in May orders, and the reported decline suggested
yet again that the economic recovery is extremely sluggish.
The market rose on the news because investors interpreted the data as
increasing the chances of an easing of policy by the Federal Reserve. If the
economy remains weak, analysts believe that the Fed may cut interest rates
once more to boost business activity. These hopes were also buoyed by the
latest call for lower rates from the White House: President Bush said
yesterday that, because of low inflation, there was room for another cut.
Tobacco shares fluctuated wildly after the Supreme Court ruled that smokers
suffering from cancer can sue cigarette makers under state injury laws. The
Court rejected the tobacco industry's argument that all such lawsuits were
precluded by federal tobacco-warning requirements, which initially sparked
heavy selling, but when the market realised that the Court had restricted
the types of claims that can be pursued by litigants, stocks recovered
sharply.
RJR Nabisco fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 8 3/8 but rallied to end just Dollars
 1/8 off at Dollars 9 3/8 in very heavy turnover, and Philip Morris, the
other big cigarette group, rebounded from a more than Dollars 2 decline to
finish a net Dollars  5/8 up at Dollars 73 3/4 .
IBM rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 97 5/8 in busy trading on a press story
that several senior board members of the computer group have recently
purchased large amounts of IBM shares.
Syntex lost Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 on reports that broking house
Merrill Lynch had downgraded its rating on the stock. Weyerhaeuser, said to
be benefiting from rising lumber prices, caused by logging restrictions
related to conserving the natural habitat of spotted owls, put on Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 .
Canada
TORONTO marked another dull session in the countdown to the end of the
second quarter by recording slight losses in slow trade. The composite index
shed 3.4 to 3,339.6.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar plunges on trade data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was under a harsh spotlight yesterday, falling against most key
currencies on the back of disappointing durable goods figures.
New orders for US durable goods fell by 2.4 per cent in May, after April's
1.9 per cent rise. Economists had been forecasting a further increase of 0.3
per cent.
The dollar had already been weak in thin, early trading, with dealers
focusing on their chart indicators to predict that it was likely to have
trouble holding above a support level of DM1.5550.
A technical analyst at a Scandinavian Bank in London said: 'We are extremely
bearish for the dollar; the long-term market is bearish, the short-term is
bearish - (only) the medium-term is bullish, supported by a trend line.'
The pessimism was borne out and, after the disappointing figures, as well as
news that the figure for unfilled orders had worsened for nine months in a
row, the dollar fell through the February low of DM1.5562. It closed in
London at DM1.5520, the lowest since January, and fell further in New York
to end at DM1.5495.
The D-Mark continued to be supported by the unexpectedly high German money
supply growth figure announced on Tuesday. However, the dollar was also
weaker against sterling and even the yen, in spite of a renewed fall by the
Japanese stock market.
The move increased wariness among a number of dealers that a US interest
rate cut was likely to be on the agenda in the meeting next week of the
Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee.
Dealers added that pressure was likely to be increased by a railway strike
in the US which could lead to losses of millions of dollars in fresh fruit
and vegetables.
In response to the dollar's slide, the White House said the decline in
durable goods orders did not undercut the prospects of economic recovery but
added that lower interest rates would be justified.
The German currency was firmer against other EMS currencies, partly as a
lingering result of the higher than expected money supply growth figure
announced on Tuesday.
The D-Mark rose against the French franc in spite of another big French
trade surplus in May. It also edged higher against the lira and rose against
the pound.
Sterling languished at the bottom of the ERM, with virtually no buying. It
dipped against the D-Mark to DM2.915 from DM2.917, but gained more than a
cent to Dollars 1.878 in terms of the dollar. Sterling's index was stable
throughout the day but edged ahead at the close to 93.1. The pound finished
in New York at Dollars 1.8795.
In East Europe, Hungary abandoned its upbeat economic outlook for 1992 and
devalued the forint by 1.6 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market rates held steady during thin trading, with the City's books
well balanced and interest diverted by a Pounds 2.75bn auction in the gilts
market yesterday.
The Bank of England's initial forecast shortage was very low at Pounds 350m
and principally made up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing assistance,
which was expected to drain Pounds 284m from the system.
The forecast was later moved down to Pounds 150m, with the Bank making
barely any move to cover it. It bought only Pounds 12m of short-term band 1
bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent in the morning. The Bank also provided late
assistance of Pounds 40m. Late assistance is often used as a device to
control the activities of the commercial banks and can carry a tough
interest rate which is never declared.
However, the Bank of England indicated that in yesterday's case, as the
shortage was so low, it was merely used to bail out banks which had
belatedly realised they were short of cash.
The City was well balanced for cash yesterday and money rates barely moved.
The key three-month rate eased one tick to 10 1/32 per cent, while the
overnight rate moved between a low of 9 3/4 to a high of 11 per cent and
closed at 10 5/16 .
Dealers said the rates were under pressure for technical reasons and could
be expected to ease slightly across the board, perhaps to around 9 15/16 per
cent by the end of the month after a number of banks, particularly Japanese
houses, had paid up their roll-over money.
However, they added that any easing was unlikely to signal an imminent cut
in interest rates. Prospects of a cut were knocked back after Germany
announced a higher than expected money supply growth figure on Tuesday.
Short futures held up following Tuesday's slide and the successful auction
yesterday morning of Pounds 2.75bn of gilts. The auction was well covered,
and September gilt futures were strong after the auction with more than
53,000 lots dealt.
The sterling contract for September settlement saw nearly 10,600 lots
traded, against Tuesday's 21,623, and it recovered two points to close at
90.18. However, the general mood was summed up by one trader who said: 'It
is dullsville out there again.'

auction to success

UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied following the success of the Bank of England's
Pounds 2.75bn gilt auction yesterday, its largest auction of UK government
debt.
demand from domestic institutions for the latest auction stock - 9 per cent
Treasury due 2012 - whereas overseas investors largely stayed away because
of concern about the prospects for convergence of European interest rates
and lack of interest in long-dated issues.
Bids amounted to Pounds 4.45bn, giving a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.62. The
ratios on the Bank's previous auctions have ranged from 1.82 to 2.28, but
dealers pointed out that the low cover ratio at yesterday's auction still
compared 'reasonably favourably' with previous auctions given the large
amount of debt being sold.
The lowest accepted price was 98.31, yielding 9.11 per cent, while the
highest accepted price was 99.02, yielding 9.10 per cent.
'The auction generally went much better than some people had expected', said
one dealer, adding that the long end of the gilt market bounced after the
auction results emerged. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose
from 115 21/32 at the opening to trade at 115 27/32 by late afternoon.
Turnover in the futures market reached over 60,000 contracts with the Liffe
gilt contract rising from 97.11 to 97.24.
EUROPE'S main government bond markets ended the day slightly higher, helped
chiefly by the rally in the US Treasury bond market.
The German government bond market opened on a weak note, following the
release on Tuesday of worse-than-expected M3 money supply data for May which
has wiped out hopes of a cut in interest rates by the end of the year. The
bund futures contract tested the important support level of 87.60, falling
to 87.52, but ended at around 87.69 on a volume of over 40,000 contracts.
News that consumer prices in North Rhine Westphalia rose by 0.2 per cent in
the month to mid-June and by 4.3 per cent from June 1991 had little impact
on the market as the figures were in line with expectations.
The French government bond market closed on a firmer note, helped by the US
Treasury bond rally and news that a decision is likely to be taken next week
to set the date of the French referendum on ratification of the Maastricht
Treaty.
Speculation about the date of the referendum and news last Friday of a large
bond exchange programme by the French Treasury led to some weakness in the
French market recently. The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2023 ended with a yield
of 8.78 per cent, against its opening of 8.81 per cent.
US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the market yesterday in the wake
of an unexpected drop in May durable goods orders and a successful five-year
note auction.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 101
31/32 , yielding 7.82 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  7/32
at 100 1/16 , yielding 4.95 per cent.
Prices rose when the Commerce Department announced that durable goods orders
fell 2.4 per cent in May. The decline in orders was broadly based, and
contrasted with the 0.6 per cent increase expected by economists. The most
worrying aspect of the figures, said analysts, was the ninth consecutive
decline in order backlogs, which suggests that manufacturers are unlikely to
boost production in the near future.
The durable goods numbers immediately sparked speculation that the Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates again. Sentiment was helped by yet another
call for lower rates from the White House. In an interview with the New York
Times, President George Bush said he would like to see another monetary
policy easing, and that fears of higher inflation did not justify keeping
interest rates unchanged.
Prices received a further boost later in day when the Treasury's auction of
Dollars 10.5bn in five-year notes met strong demand from retail investors,
with demand exceeding supply by almost three to one.
JAPANESE government bond prices closed higher, helped by a 10-year bond
auction and a pick-up in buying interest in the debt market as the Nikkei
stock index fell through the 16,000 level.
The Finance Ministry sold Y472.67bn of a Y800bn new 10-year bond issue at
auction yesterday. The new No 149 issue has a coupon of 5.5 per cent, and
was sold at an average price of 99.64 to yield 5.556 per cent.
Dealers reported some hedge-selling in the morning as supply concerns
weighed on the market, but as the Nikkei index dropped, ending the day
253.32 points lower at 15,853.67, traders noted renewed buying interest.

stock case

<TEXT>
SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street broking house, yesterday paid a
Dollars 500,000 fine to the New York Stock Exchange in connection with an
alleged case of stock manipulation in 1990.
Mr Peter DaPuzzo, the brokerage's former co-head of equity trading, paid an
additional penalty of Dollars 100,000.
Both Mr DaPuzzo, an equity trader and a well-known figure on Wall Street,
and Shearson, accepted - without admitting or denying guilt - the NYSE's
findings that in November 1990 they improperly influenced the share price of
ConAgra, the food and agricultural products group. Their actions, the NYSE
alleged, made a stock offering that Shearson was handling the next day less
costly for the broking house.
According to the NYSE, Shearson's trading desk in New York, which was run by
Mr DaPuzzo, instigated a last-minute trade in ConAgra shares on the Pacific
Stock Exchange in San Francisco at the price of Dollars 33 1/4 .
The order changed the closing price of ConAgra from Dollars 33 3/8 - the
last reported trade on the NYSE - to Dollars 33 1/4 , the price at which
Shearson had previously arranged to sell the 4.4m ordinary stock offering to
investors on the following day.
As a result of the last-minute San Francisco trade, which violated NYSE
rules against artificially influencing a stock price before a public
offering, ConAgra received Dollars 550,000 less from its stock issue than if
the price had not been manipulated. Prior to yesterday's settlement,
Shearson made up that loss to ConAgra.
Mr DaPuzzo said yesterday: 'I agreed to settle with the New York Stock
Exchange because it was quickly becoming prohibitively expensive in terms of
money and time for me to continue defending myself.'
He also announced that he had retired from Shearson after more than 30 years
with the company, and had joined Steinhardt Partners, a leading Wall Street
money management firm.
Mr Manny Geronimos, the senior Shearson stock trader working with Mr DaPuzzo
at the time of the alleged stock manipulation, also agreed to a settlement
with the NYSE. Mr Geronimos received a censure and was temporarily suspended
from the securities industry.

futures bill

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES by three US stock exchanges to lower margin requirements on stock
index futures have rekindled a simmering controversy over the regulation of
such contracts.
Mr Nicholas Brady, the US secretary of the treasury, who contends that stock
index futures increase stock market volatility, has stepped back into the
fray to urge Congress to pass legislation granting the Federal Reserve
authority over stock index futures margins. The legislation has been
languishing for more than a year.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades the widely-used Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index future, and the Chicago Board of Trade, which trades
a Major Market Index future, recently lowered their initial margin
requirements for such contracts. The New York Futures Exchange, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange, which trades a NYSE
Composite Index, lowered its margin requirements last month. The exchanges
argue that stock index futures margins are too high and that lowering them
will not increase volatility.
However, a number of influential senators are pressing for reform. They say
it would take only a single day of big losses - paired with lowered futures
margins - 'to reignite public controversies similar to those of 1987 and
1989.' The senators have urged the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
futures industry regulator, to determine if current margin levels are
adequate.

CONTINENTAL Airlines, the largest of the US carriers operating under the

asking employees to take an average 10 per cent pay cut.
The debt-burdened carrier said the reductions would take effect around June
30.
Continental blamed the cuts on the domestic fare wars in April and May,
suggesting the airline industry's revenues overall would be about Dollars
4bn lower this year as a result. Continental claims the pay reductions would
prune over Dollars 100m from its annual expense bill.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BP of America, citing the impact of recession, last night said it planned to
cut its US operating costs by Dollars 125m by eliminating 600 to 700 jobs in
its corporate headquarters staff and refining and marketing divisions.
The job cuts, to be felt largely in the Cleveland, Ohio, region, where BP of
America is based, were presented as part of the British energy group's
programme of seeking Dollars 750m of cost reductions.
The new US cuts, which include the near halving of BP of America's
Cleveland-based corporate headquarters staff of 610 people, mirror the UK
head office job reductions announced in April. At that time, BP said it was
eliminating 700 of the 1,450 jobs from its head office at Britannic House in
London.
Beyond the 250 to 300 job cuts at it Cleveland headquarters, BP of America
also plans to eliminate between 375 and 500 refining and marketing jobs from
its BP Oil and BP Chemicals divisions in the US.
The US job cuts come less than three weeks after BP of America said it was
planning to dispose of assets in Florida and California, including more than
300 petrol stations and two distribution terminals. That decision marked a
turnround in BP's US strategy of building up its west coast network of
filling stations.
Last month, in another part of the group's worldwide cost reduction and
asset disposal programme, BP raised Dollars 314m by selling off its 56.94
per cent shareholding in BP Canada.
Mr Rodney Chase, the recently-named chairman and chief executive of BP of
America, last night said he regretted the new US job cuts, but added: 'We
must reduce our costs to stay competitive and meet the challenges of the
industry.'
Mr Chase called competition 'fierce' and said the recession had reduced
demand for BP products. He added that prices were down, both at the wellhead
and at the petrol pump.
After the new job cuts BP of America will still have nearly 35,000
employees. Its 1991 turnover was Pounds 9.3bn (Dollars 17.2bn).

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Compromise proposed on EC
investment services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREATION of a single EC market in securities trading moved a step closer
yesterday with the release of a new compromise proposal on the investment
services directive.
Spurred on by the recent accord on capital adequacy standards for EC banks
and securities firms, the Portuguese - who hold the EC presidency until next
week - have suggested a way to bridge the gap between feuding French and
British camps on the key issue of how quickly off-market share transactions
should be made public.
Finance ministers will be asked to consider the Portuguese plan when they
meet on Monday in Luxembourg.
Britain and Germany are against immediate or rapid disclosure of trades,
which would leave their market-makers exposed whenever a large trade went
through the system. France and the southern countries are broadly in favour
of more transparency which would have a less drastic effect on their
order-driven markets.
The Portuguese plan would involve a rolling system averaging out information
about prices and volume over six hours and delaying publication for two more
hours. 'This will ensure that market anonymity is respected and market
liquidity looked after,' said a European Commission official.
Transparency is the most important of several issues which have been holding
up the investment services directive since 1990, despite several rounds of
intensive ministerial and expert negotiations. The aim is to allow
investment companies to trade throughout the EC after 1992. 'If we sort this
one out the rest more or less clicks into place,' said the same Commission
official.
Earlier arguments about whether banks should be allowed direct access to
stock markets - a proposal resisted by Spain and Portugal - have now been
reduced to a debate over when direct access should be granted. But there is
still a question mark over how France will react to the Portuguese
proposals.
At Monday's meeting finance ministers are expected to reach a formal common
position on the capital adequacy directive, the broad lines of which were
agreed two weeks ago. Negotiations over the last fortnight are said to have
ironed out the outstanding technical difficulties.

soon after merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Smith, the newly-named Bank of America president and chief
operating officer and who was previously chairman of Security Pacific,
yesterday announced plans to leave his job.
The move - which comes just eight weeks after the finalisation of the
Dollars 4.2bn merger between Bank of America and Secpac - was last night
being seen by Wall Street banking analysts as the clearest sign yet that the
recently-completed merger of Bank of America and Security Pacific was
effectively a rescue of the latter.
Mr George Salem, senior banking analyst at Prudential Securities, called Mr
Smith's departure 'a clear manifestation that this was by no means a merger
of equals'.
Mr Salem claimed that recent heavy loan losses at SecPac suggested that in
the months since the bank merger was announced last August 'it became more
visible to Bank of America that they bought a bigger problem than they
bargained for'.
Mr Jim McDermott, president of Keefe Bruyette, the bank analysts, said Mr
Smith's resignation - which takes effect in October - was 'a bit of a
surprise because the exit came so early'. He said the departure showed how
the profitable Bank of America 'clearly dominates this merger'.
Mr Smith, who is 56, said he had found his new responsibilities at the
combined Bank of America 'to be less than I want'. The former SecPac
chairman, who will receive a severance payment of more than Dollars 1.8m,
said he did not have a new job lined up.
Mr Smith told the Financial Times last night: 'This had all the
characteristics of a merger, except that one side is always a little
stronger than the other.'
He said that while the title of president 'sounded great', he and Mr Dick
Rosenberg, the Bank of America chairman, 'never talked about or thought
about what my specific role would be until early in May.
'The bottom line is that I didn't want to be Number Two,' Mr Smith
explained.
The uneven nature of the bank merger, the biggest in US banking history,
became apparent when 1991 results showed Bank of America earned Dollars
1.1bn in net income, while Security Pacific suffered a loss for the year of
Dollars 765m.
The last set of separate results released before the merger's completion -
for the first quarter of 1992 - confirmed the unequal partnership.
Bank of America reported a 7 per cent rise in first-quarter net profits, to
Dollars 303m, and net loan losses of Dollars 219m that were less than half
the level of the first quarter of 1991.
By contrast, SecPac was hit by nearly trebled loan loss provisions of
Dollars 787m and a plunge into a Dollars 496m first-quarter loss, against
earnings of Dollars 96.5m in the first quarter of 1991.
In the nearest comparison to the Bank of America-SecPac merger, the top
executives of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank in New York
continue to work in harmony as chairman and chief executive of the
newly-merged entity, Chemical Banking.

<TEXT>
THE IRANIAN government has acquired a major stake in the main production
plant of Pneumant, eastern Germany's largest tyre company.
Iran has bought 40 per cent of the factory at Furstenwalde, east of Berlin,
with the remaining interest sold to a management-employee buy-out and to
other German investors. The disposal by the Treuhand, the German
privatisation agency, was for an undisclosed sum.
Iran has guaranteed purchase of the basic output of the factory over the
next 12 months, while additional production will be sold to 'untied'
European tyre dealers.
Pneumant has also concluded a consulting agreement with Iran which has
several old tyre factories which are to be modernised. Loss-making Pneumant,
which also has large factories in Dresden and Riesa, which are to be sold
separately, had turnover last year of DM180m (Dollars 113.9m) and roughly
one-fifth the output of Continental, Germany's largest tyremaker.
Continental co-operated closely with Pneumant last year and expressed strong
interest in buying the east German producer. However, Continental's interest
weakened and Pneumant was placed in liquidation last September.
An industry observer said the west German tyre giant wanted to make sure
Pneumant did not fall into the hands of a competitor before abandoning it.
The deal with Iran will secure 890 jobs over the longer term, the Treuhand
said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL WATER HOLDINGS yesterday reported its first annual result since it
came to the market in November 1991.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March came out at Pounds 5.24m and were
achieved from turnover of Pounds 47.9m. In the previous year pre-tax profits
were Pounds 2.97m and turnover was Pounds 42.1m.
A final dividend of 18.7p makes a 28p total. Earnings improved to 68.9p
(38.9p).
Sir John Wills, chairman, said that following consultation with the Director
General of Water Services, prices for 1993 would increase by an average 7.3
per cent - 1.1 per cent below the maximum permitted.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Regulator concerned about futureof LBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADIO Authority is closely monitoring the state of Crown Communications,
the lossmaking company which owns LBC, London's speech-based commercial
radio station.
On Monday Crown reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.58m for the six months
to March 31 against losses of Pounds 4.68m last time and Pounds 6.79m in the
year to September.
The main concern of the Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio,
is with the future of LBC, which has been increasing its share of the
audience and trading profitably.
It is believed the Authority has had preliminary discussions with potential
investors. The aim would be to try to safeguard LBC's position if the
financial position of Crown were to deteriorate.
Two years ago Crown shares were trading at 250p, but by this week had fallen
to 8p.
The company has been hit by the recession, exacerbated by losses from an
investment in RFM, a radio network with 89 stations in France.
Mr Christopher Chataway, Crown's chairman, said that the company would be
reducing its stake in French radio. Partners were also being sought for
other Crown businesses such as IRS, the commercial radio sales house.
Mr Chataway has assured shareholders that the company still has the support
of its banks. Last month Price Waterhouse, Crown's auditors, said they
believed there were adequate financial resources for the foreseeable future
but some aspects of the accounts relating to the RFM investment had been
qualified.
LBC's licence comes up for renewal in March 1993.
Meanwhile, Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, told the
Association of Commercial Radio Companies they were getting a bit too
agitated about the re-franchising round starting in the autumn.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Loss warning wipes 22p off Henlys' shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henlys Group, the motor trader, coach and bus manufacturer and distributor
which has changed its name from Plaxton, yesterday warned that it would make
a loss in the first half of 1992 and saw its shares slump 22p to 55p on the
news.
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the problem area was the coach and bus
manufacturing plant in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, where some of the 750
jobs would be cut in the autumn. Henlys had already cut coach production by
closing three plants and concentrating production at Scarborough.
Mr Wood said there were also teething problems with the group's new range of
coaches.
He said other parts of the group were showing improved results, but that
City forecasts of a small profit for the year were too optimistic. Hoare
Govett, the stockbroker, is now forecasting an annual loss of Pounds 2.5m.
In 1991 the group made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.8m.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall outlines reorganisation of
Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUPITER Tyndall Merlin, the fund manager for Pacific Horizon Investment
Trust, yesterday announced plans to reorganise the trust's capital
structure.
Jupiter Tyndall amassed a stake of 25.1 per cent of Pacific Horizons's
warrants, which it used to block offers from Martin Currie Pacific
investment trust, the latest of which was last week allowed to lapse.
The reorganisation would involve issuing zero coupon convertible unsecured
loan stock (Culs) in place of nine tenths of the existing ordinary share
capital.
A subsidiary of Pacific Horizon would then be set up which could tender for
up to 60 per cent of the loan stock issued at a price equivalent to 90 per
cent of the adjusted net asset value per share of the company.
Warrant terms would also be amended so that one warrant upon exercise, could
be exchanged for one ordinary share and nine zero Culs.
This structure would narrow the discount between Pacific Horizon's share
price and its net asset value per share. The shares added 1p to 23p
yesterday, the warrants 1p to 10p.
Jupiter Tyndall intends to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of
Pacific Horizon to consider the reconstruction plans. It will also seek to
appoint new directors and seek the resignations of certain existing
directors.
The board had unanimously recommended the Martin Currie offer in a statement
made at the beginning of this month, which also expressed concern at the
effect Jupiter Tyndall's management functions could have on its
independence.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: HSBC set to win bid for Midland today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE-month-old takeover battle for Midland Bank is expected to end
today in a convincing victory for Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
On the eve of the biggest takeover in British banking history, the mood at
both banks was restrained. 'We are treating this very much as routine,'
Midland said.
The offer period does not close formally until 1 pm today. But several of
Midland's largest institutional shareholders said last night they had
already notified their acceptance of the offer, which values each Midland
share at 440p, 10p above last night's closing price.
Schroders, the merchant bank advising Hongkong Bank, is expected to announce
the result of the bid before 5pm today.
This will almost certainly confirm that Hongkong Bank has gained control of
Midland, in which it already holds a 14.9 per cent stake. But it is likely
to take up to two weeks before all the Midland shares are transferred to the
new owners.
The success of the Hongkong Bank bid has been virtually assured since Lloyds
Bank decided on June 5 not to pursue its proposed counter-bid.
'I can't imagine anyone refusing to tender,' said one major institutional
shareholder, who said he would have strongly preferred selling his shares to
Lloyds.
Midland shareholders will get 120 shares in the new Hongkong Bank Holding
Company after the merger and Pounds 65 in either bonds or cash for each 100
Midland shares.
Last night in London a 'grey' market in the Hongkong Bank bonds was already
beginning in expectation that the bid would succeed.
Dealing in shares of the Hongkong Bank Holding Company will get under way in
London on July 11.

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Hoskyns, the UK-based computing services company owned by
Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, nosedived in the first half as the recession
and fierce price competition squeezed margins relentlessly, writes Alan
Cane.
Profits before tax in the six months to April 30 fell 35 per cent to Pounds
5.6m (Pounds 8.6m) pushing earnings per share 39 per cent lower at 3.9p
(6.4p).
Turnover fell to Pounds 95.7m (Pounds 102.8m) suggesting that the company's
reputation for unbroken growth may not be restored quickly.
The interim dividend of 0.75p is being maintained, however, in the
expectation of improved trading in the second half.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: ERF cuts loss and plans expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERF, the UK's last independently-owned truck maker, cut its pre-tax losses
from Pounds 4.47m to Pounds 563,000 in the year to March 28 in the teeth of
the worst UK truck market slump since the second world war.
Mr Peter Foden, the chairman, also disclosed plans yesterday to lessen ERF's
dependence on the volatile UK market by spreading sales to continental
markets, in what he described as 'one of the most important steps ERF has
taken for many years'.
However, the overall result for the year obscured a deteriorating
performance in the second half as a result of a large export contract to
Zimbabwe coming to an end.
At the interim stage to September 30 ERF achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds
330,000, reversing 18 months of losses.
Neither the figures nor the European expansion plan were enough to allay
market worries about the lack of recovery in the UK, on which ERF remains,
for the moment at least, heavily dependent. According to Mr Rod England,
ERF's sales and marketing director, 'there is no sign of an upturn'.
Its shares closed down 2p at 220p, influenced also by a final dividend
reduced from 3p to 2p after an unchanged interim of 2p. Losses per share
fell to 12.75p (44.41p).
A brief post-general election upturn had fizzled out.
Turnover for the year moved ahead to Pounds 118m (Pounds 103m) and there was
a profit at the trading level of Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 3.54m loss).
However, this was before an exceptional charge of Pounds 1m to cover the
development of a new range of environmentally 'cleaner' trucks, preliminary
expenses of the continental European venture and a further 53 redundancies
which have reduced ERF's workforce to a total of 754.
Mr Foden said that further development of both projects would increase
exceptional costs next year, probably to about Pounds 2m. In the absence of
a UK recovery, that was likely further to raise the company's gearing from
its current level of 17 per cent, up from 6 per cent last year.
However, the rise is expected largely to reflect increased on-balance sheet
leased assets to bring the new truck range into production. 'Borrowings for
operating purposes are likely to remain close to zero and will remain under
close control', said Mr Colin Fuller, finance director.
ERF expects to produce an unchanged 2,000 trucks this year but warned that
whether more redundancies were required would depend on the timing and
strength of recovery in the UK market.
It plans to unveil its attack on continental Europe at the Paris commercial
vehicle show in October, with first vehicles being shipped in November.
Initially it is setting up sales operations in France and Spain, and has
established two wholly-owned subsidiaries, ERF (France) and ERF (Espagne) to
be set up dealer networks and administer the business.
Mr Foden said it 'would not be unreasonable' for ERF to gain a 1 per cent to
2 per cent share of the French and Spanish heavy truck markets over the next
two to three years. At current market levels, that would add about 1,200
units to ERF's annual sales.
Currently, its exports are mainly in the form of kits to South Africa and
other African startes, plus New Zealand, accounting for about 30 per cent of
unit sales.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Wellcome sale may offer up to 330m shares: Medical charity
expected to reduce holding in UK drugs group to about 35%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME TRUST, the medical charity, is expected to indicate today that it
will sell about 320m to 330m shares in Wellcome, reducing its stake in the
drugs group to about 35 per cent, in the global offering scheduled for next
month.
Robert Fleming, which is co-ordinating the issue, is understood to have
received good indications of interest in the issue, particularly from UK
investors, but also from the US.
Wellcome Trust holds 73.5 per cent of Wellcome, which went public in 1986.
It said in March it wanted to reduce its stake to below 50 per cent,
although it aimed to retain a 25 per cent holding as a long-term investment.
A reduction to 25 per cent would involve the sale of 417m shares, worth
Pounds 3.8bn (Dollars 7.1bn) at yesterday's closing share price of 913p,
down 18p.
Fleming is to employ the 'green shoe' mechanism, whereby a further 15 per
cent can be sold. This allows the merchant bank to over-allot shares which
it can then buy from Wellcome Trust or it can buy shares in the after-market
to stabilise the price. Full use of the green shoe would mean a further 50m
shares being sold, taking the total available to around 380m. If demand for
the issue continues strong, the deal could also be increased, possibly to
the 417m share maximum.
It is thought that UK investors will be allocated roughly half the shares
available, with the US taking a quarter. The remainder would be spread
between the regional syndicates in Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, the
Pacific Rim and the rest of the world.
That would still leave Wellcome with a lower percentage of its shares held
in the US than rivals such as Glaxo. Only about 2 per cent of Wellcome's
shares are held in North America while 45 per cent of its turnover was made
there in 1991.
The group hoped the share sale would increase the proportion of its shares
held in the US and it is seeking a New York Stock Exchange listing as part
of the sale.
There has been some nervousness about new issues recently as the UK and
Japanese stock markets have weakened. Last week, GPA cancelled its flotation
at the last minute but analysts say GPA's issue was an entirely different
animal to the secondary offering of Wellcome shares.
The indicated figure of the number of shares to be sold will be fine-tuned
once the bidding process begins. The formal marketing campaign for the issue
starts today.
Under the timetable for the issue, the offer period will open on July 6 and
a closing date will be set two to three weeks later. The tender
book-building process will begin with investors putting in indicative bids
for the number of shares they are prepared to buy at certain prices to
regional syndicate managers. After the close of the tender period, a price
will be struck which will be the basis for a UK public offer.

FT  25 JUN 92 / The future comes into focus on screen: The Globex
after-hours trading system starts today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new trading system for futures and options launched today could mark a
turning point in the shift towards greater automation of financial markets.
Globex, the international after-hours screen trading system, has been five
years in development, at an estimated cost of close to Dollars 80m (Pounds
43m). An exuberant Mr Leo Melamed, head of Globex, is hailing the debut as
'the dawn of a new era'.
But scepticism about the short-term impact and long-term success of Globex
remains rife. There are questions about its ability to handle fast and
complex futures markets with the same efficiency as the raucous but
effective open-outcry trading pits.
Initially, 140 terminals in Chicago, New York, London and Paris will link up
on the system, jointly developed by Reuters and the world's largest futures
exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.
The system is designed to complement the traditional open-outcry technique
for trading futures and options contracts, in which traders yell and
hand-signal prices to each other on a trading floor. Globex will provide an
order-matching system for these products when trading floors are closed. For
example, the 10-year Treasury futures contract listed on the CBOT, one of
the first products to be traded on Globex, can now be traded during European
trading hours, when the Chicago exchange is closed.
As fund managers become increasingly geared towards a global investment
strategy, demand for liquid markets in key products through various time
zones will boost 'after-hours' trading, concentrated on Globex - or so the
theory runs. However, there are doubts about the level of demand for
overnight trading: the concept of globalisation, a buzz-word in the 1980s,
has failed to take off as expected, and liquidity remains concentrated in
domestic markets.
Reuters, which contributed an estimated Dollars 75m to the development costs
of Globex, is banking on the expansion of the system to cover the whole
range of financial instruments, including bonds and equities.
However, its investment in Globex should be seen in the context of a
research and development budget of around Pounds 70m a year. Other projects,
notably Dealing 2000, Reuters' foreign exchange dealing system launched
earlier this year, have involved far greater investment.
Globex taps a trend towards greater automation - as can be seen by changes
in the world's stock markets. 'I don't believe anyone in the business thinks
that electronic trading isn't coming,' says Mr Bud Frazier, a veteran grain
trader.
Many brokerages, which earn their money from executing trades, are
begrudging towards Globex, arguing that margins on futures executions are
already slim because of competition; and most independent floor traders,
known as locals, who make their living screaming and jostling in the pits,
regard Globex as an encroachment on their territory.
The system has the potential to offer greater efficiency and cost savings.
Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex, points out: 'A trader at a
single screen can access three major markets containing eight leading
contracts', creating savings for businesses in the longer term. However,
some executives familiar with the system doubt its ability to cope with a
heavy flow of business in volatile markets.
Nevertheless, many businesses say the system has sparked interest among
clients. 'We have to take the system, to stay abreast of our competitors,'
said one futures executive. Although the initial investment may deter some
companies, many conclude that the structure of costs, salaries and
commissions are edging them towards greater automation.
Even enthusiasts such as Mr Jack Wing, chief executive officer of Chicago
Corp, a large futures brokerage which has signed on for several Globex
terminals, expects trading volume - beyond a burst in the initial days - to
be slow. But, in time, says Mr Wing, 'we're quite optimistic that Globex
will be an important part of the landscape'.
Chicago Corp already has a round-the-clock trading desk and the jump to
Globex is less strenuous. Other brokers will use Chicago Corp to access
Globex rather than invest on their own. 'We're committed to 24-hour trading,
some are not,' said Mr Wing.
For the CME and CBOT, Globex is an opportunity to win back some market share
lost in the past decade to budding European exchanges. Mr William O'Connor,
chairman of the CBOT, told exchange members last week: 'Globex will become a
tool that we will use to defend our market share.'
Chicago has never lost sight of this purpose in spite of its drive to draw
in other exchanges as partners. Among foreign exchanges, only the Matif of
Paris has joined. Negotiations are under way with the Sydney Futures
Exchange and the Deutsche Terminborse in Germany. London's Liffe, which
balked at the conditions offered by Globex, continues to express an interest
in the system, but is also considering developing its own APT after-hours
trading system.
Four New York exchanges, though not the important New York Mercantile
Exchange which trades crude oil and other energy products, have agreed in
principle to join the system. Nymex is developing its own system, Access.
Initially, Globex is listing only futures and options on currencies and on
the 10-year Treasury note. But by the end of the year, with a total of 225
terminals in place, other currency contracts, Eurodollars, 90-day Treasury
bills, Libor, two-year and five-year Treasury notes and 20-year Treasury
bonds will join the list. Matif contracts on the Notional French government
bond will be added next year, with the CAC-40, the French stock index, Pibor
and Ecu bonds to follow.
'The real test will be the important Eurodollar and 30-year T-bond
contracts, which are traded in low volume in Europe,' said Mr Alex Cooper,
director of financial markets at Credit Lyonnais Rouse.
When Globex was proposed in 1987, it wowed the commodities trading world
with its concept of round-the-clock and round-the-world trading, embellished
by the vivid imagination of Mr Melamed, a science fiction author.
Five years later, it seems just another interesting addition to the gadgetry
of trading, although one that could come into its own when the next world
crisis erupts.

FT  25 JUN 92 / London Electricity cuts 300 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Electricity will cut 300 of the 400 jobs in its contracting business
which will halve its turnover by March 1993, the company said at its annual
results meeting yesterday. It will also abandon appliance servicing, as part
of a large restructuring of its non-core businesses.
This news eclipsed the company's 38 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to
Pounds 142.5m, compared with the pro forma pre-tax profit of Pounds 103.3m.
In addition, Mr Andrew Curry, recruited three years ago from Currys, the
electrical retailer, to mastermind retail and contracting, will leave the
company. He will be succeeded by his deputy, Mr Clive Vlotman, formerly of
Dixons. London said the restructuring of contracting would leave the trading
division too small to require a main board director.
The 38 per cent increase in profits was achieved in spite of a Pounds 17m
loss from contracting, including Pounds 11.4m of provisions for future
redundancies and restructuring.
The retail business also incurred a loss, of Pounds 11.5m, in spite of a 20
per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 33m. This included exceptional costs
as London continued to restructure the business by opening superstores and
shops within Debenhams stores to replace old-style outlets.
Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said retail and contracting would break
even in the year to March 1993.
Losses in retail and contracting meant most of the company's Pounds 137.3m
operating profit was generated by its main business, electricity
distribution, which made Pounds 158.3m compared with Pounds 97.2m the
previous year.
This was primarily to a 10.9 per cent increase in electricity tariffs in
April 1991.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Toronto judge adjourns O&amp;Y hearing on costs payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TORONTO judge last night adjourned until Monday a hearing on the issue of
how Olympia &amp; York Developments, the Reichmann family company under Canadian
bankruptcy court protection, will obtain an estimated CDollars 40m (Pounds
18m) needed to pay its overhead and restructuring costs over the next few
months.
The adjournment came several hours after O&amp;Y proposed to its creditors a
plan to sell an assortment of minor assets that carry a book value of
CDollars 70m and are held by the Canadian parent company and it
subsidiaries.
The proposal was aimed at countering creditors' objections to paying most of
O&amp;Y's costs without receiving any compensation. Lawyers for a number of
secured and unsecured creditors objected to the O&amp;Y proposal, with the
former arguing against putting up any fresh money and the latter saying the
proposal discriminates against them.
In the US, meanwhile, it emerged that O&amp;Y is hoping to raise at least
Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m) by selling a minority shareholding in its main US
property subsidiary to one or more investors.
The possible sale of such an equity stake would be part of a complex US
restructuring plan that began taking shape this week with the hiring by O&amp;Y
of Mr Patrick Ahern, a former Lehman Brothers partner who has been named as
chief restructuring officer in New York.
O&amp;Y's US subsidiary is the only significant part of the Reichmann empire
that has not been placed in administration or filed for bankruptcy
protection.
Mr Ahern was described by an O&amp;Y adviser yesterday as the US counterpart to
Mr Steve Miller, the chief O&amp;Y bank negotiator.
Mr Ahern will be working on the restructuring plan with US partners from
Price Waterhouse, the long-time auditor of O&amp;Y, according to the O&amp;Y
adviser.
The O&amp;Y adviser said discussions were already under way with prospective
investors who might buy a stake in the Canadian group's US company - Olympia
&amp; York Companies (USA). He declined to name the possible investors.
The Dollars 100m-plus will be needed by O&amp;Y by next year, to finance needed
repairs, maintenance and tenant improvements on US properties. The talks
with prospective equity partners are being handled by Mr John Zucotti, head
of O&amp;Y's US operations.
In a related development, O&amp;Y said that it had raised Dollars 32.5m as a
result of the sale of an 11 per cent shareholding in Hyperion Partners, an
investment fund.
This cash could help O&amp;Y to avert the need to file in the near term for
protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law.
Mr Nigel Hamilton, a partner of Ernst &amp; Young, administrator to Canary
Wharf, held a 'routine' meeting with representatives of the scheme's 12 main
lenders in Toronto yesterday.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Delors promises decentralised EC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, the European Commission president, yesterday struck a
conciliatory tone ahead of the Lisbon summit which begins tomorrow by
promising a more decentralised European Community. He also promised to scale
down EC finance plans and predicted the Community's early enlargement.
In uncharacteristic vein, he publicly apologised for the 'mistake' he
recently made in warning Denmark, on French television, that it might lose
EC farm subsidies if it failed to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
He claimed he said this because he had been 'so traumatised' by the fuss
French farmers have made about EC agricultural reforms. 'Henceforth', he
told a pre-summit press conference, 'I will say nothing about Denmark and
its future'.
Addressing the Lisbon summit's three big themes - EC financing, enlargement
and subsidiarity (making decisions at the lowest appropriate level of
government) - Mr Delors predicted the meeting would set 'concrete
guidelines' for a financing settlement by the end of the year.
He conceded the Commission had been 'over confident' in asking governments
to raise EC spending by one-third by 1997. He backed a compromise to stretch
revenue increases through to 1999.
The Lisbon summit, Mr Delors forecast, would agree that entry negotiations
with European Free Trade Association states could start once the EC reached
budgetary agreement and ratified Maastricht. Other applicants and potential
applicants in east Europe would have to wait.
By contrast, in his pre-summit letter to fellow leaders, Mr Anibal Cavaco
Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, who will host the Friday-Saturday
meeting, saw a budget settlement as the EC's only precondition for opening
enlargement talks. He did however stress the importance of consolidating
Maastricht decisions.
UK officials yesterday stressed their belief that Maastricht ratification
need not be wrapped up before talks with the Efta countries begin.
Danish rejection of Maastricht has aggravated tactical divisions over
enlargement, as well as spurring a growing over subsidiarity. Mr Delors
widened this debate yesterday by suggesting that, even in natural areas of
transnational legislation like the environment, responsibility for ensuring
compliance with EC rules could be handed to individual governments.
Asked whether uneven compliance might compromise the EC's vaunted single
market, he replied: 'The best (the single market) can be the enemy of the
good (subsidiarity)'. Part of the single market plan, the mutual recognition
by member states of each other's diplomas and technical standards, was based
on trust, he said. Perhaps, this 'climate of confidence could be extended to
other fields, such as competition and state aids rules'.
Mr Delors raised eyebrows by suggesting that, with state aids, 'below a
certain amount, there will not be any monitoring or policing by the
Commission'.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, has recently exempted small
public aids from any review by Brussels.

FT  25 JUN 92 / ANC rejects call for meeting: Statement says talks with de
Klerk would serve no useful purpose

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's political crisis deepened last night as the African National
Congress angrily rejected President FW de Klerk's call for a two-day meeting
to break the impasse in the country's peace process.
In a statement issued three hours after Mr de Klerk's attempt to defuse the
tensions that have built up since last Wednesday's Boipatong massacre, the
ANC said the proposed meeting 'will serve no useful purpose'.
'Once more the National Party has shown its lack of appreciation of the
depth of the national crisis it has plunged the country into,' said the ANC.
Earlier Mr de Klerk, who had cut short a visit to Spain to preside over
yesterday's day-long cabinet meeting, said he had been 'deeply disappointed'
at the ANC's decision on Tuesday night to withdraw from constitutional
negotiations, and said the government would try to put the peace process
back on track 'as soon as possible'.
Mr de Klerk went some way towards meeting ANC demands for an international
inquiry into the massacre of 42 people in Boipatong, a township near
Johannesburg.
He said ' a person of international repute' would join the Goldstone
commission, which is already planning to investigate the massacre. The
commission, headed by a respected South African judge, is a standing inquiry
into political violence, which has already been critical of the security
forces' behaviour. Mr de Klerk said the police would welcome an
international observer to evaluate their investigation. This was the only
concrete response to the ANC's terms for the resumption of talks which ended
in deadlock last month.
Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president, said on Tuesday the negotiations could
not resume until the government agreed to allow an international inquiry
into the massacre, to prosecute security force members involved in violence,
to ban the carrying of weapons in public and introduce other measures to
bring peace to black townships.
In Pretoria Mr de Klerk vigorously defended the security forces against ANC
allegations they had been involved Boipatong tragedy, and was critical of
ANC plans for 'mass action' in the form of strikes and rallies, saying it
was an obstacle to negotiations. The ANC described Mr de Klerk's criticism
as 'ludicrous in the extreme'.
In advance of last night's statement, the ANC yesterday called for the
reimposition of the sports moratorium. In a statement signed by Mr Steve
Tshwete, the ANC official instrumental in South Africa's readmission to
world sport, sports bodies were asked to postpone plans for participation in
international sport 'until the country is firmly on a road to democracy'.

The Stewart-Liberty family and Mr Bryan Myerson of Concerto Capital
Corporation arguably deserve each other. One would certainly not seek to
defend non-voting shares, or even Liberty's recent trading record. But the
appeal to high principle which forms part of Concerto's attempt to
enfranchise Liberty shareholders - including a liberal quote from the
Cadbury report on corporate governance - strikes a discordant note. Mr
Myerson may make his turn one day, as he did a couple of years ago when
Aquascutum sold out to the Japanese. But no one should shed any tears if he
gets stymied by the Liberty family's united front and the present lack of
Far Eastern interest in upmarket UK retailing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After Tuesday's interim figures from Airtours, yesterday's 85 per cent
increase in annual profits from Hogg Robinson suggests the travel industry
is springing into life. There is a danger of exaggeration, however. Hogg
Robinson's results, which in any case depend more heavily on business travel
than the leisure market, follow a year beset by the Gulf war and loss of
commissions on holidays booked with the now defunct ILG. Airtours' figures
reveal little about the all-important summer season.
Total summer holiday bookings through May were up an estimated 20 per cent
for the market as a whole, a large part of the increase simply reflecting
bounce back from Gulf war weakness in 1991. Hogg Robinson says its leisure
bookings are up eight per cent by volume and one per cent by price since the
end of March. Airtours' market share is growing, but the question is how
margins look at the end of the day. That depends on the extent of
discounting during the late booking period now getting under way.
Industry estimates suggest there may be excess capacity in the market of
some 200,000 to 400,000 holidays, depending on how normal take-up is
defined. That is not excessive by industry standards, but it still leaves
room for discounting by operators seeking to buy market share. Thomson's
share of the summer package market is still some 14 points ahead of both
Airtours and Owners Abroad. But at the end of May, it was also below 30 per
cent, a level with which it cannot feel entirely comfortable.

FT  25 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some recent worries about government funding must have been dispelled by
yesterday's Pounds 2.75bn gilts auction. Though the total was covered 1.62
times by bids - the lowest since auctions started in April last year - it
was still well above worst fears. The lack of spread between the average bid
yield and the highest accepted yield indicates a fairly heavy concentration
of demand around the auction price. The cover ratio would only have been
really worrying if a large number of bids had been below the market.
The still better news for Mr Lamont is that the auction revealed continuing
demand from domestic investors. Overseas buying of gilts has never been as
large as expected since the election and appears to have been even more
muted since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty. The 20-year
maturity on yesterday's auction was never likely to appeal to foreign
investors anyway, but domestic institutions clearly rose to the occasion
even though this may have been at the expense of the equity market.
The gilts market may thus not have all that much to fear from the funding
consequences of low growth. Confirmation that GDP fell by 0.5 per cent in
the first quarter may set off another round of forecast downgrading for the
year as a whole. But a weak economy with low inflation is likely to drive
switching out of equities and into gilts at a pace faster than the rise in
the borrowing requirement. A one percentage point decline in growth
expectations for the year as a whole implies extra government borrowing of
only Pounds 4bn - less than yesterday's total bids.

<TEXT>
Nineteenth-hole talk at Turnberry - venue of a BAT Industries golf day  -
was no doubt dominated last night by the long-awaited US Supreme Court
ruling on liability claims against the tobacco companies. Fears that the
verdict might open the floodgates to a spate of new civil suits initially
knocked 7 per cent off the BAT share price - dragging a still jumpy UK
market down with it - but the stock ended just 26p lower at 731p, as London
took belated heart from Wall Street's less panicky response.
Contrary to some early reports, it seems the Supreme Court has thrown out
many of the potentially more damaging claims. At stake was whether
plaintiffs can sue a company on the grounds that manufacturers had failed to
give adequate warning of the risks - an issue on which federal law and three
states had been in conflict.
Yesterday's decision appears to imply that this will not be allowed in
respect of claims arising after 1969, the date of an amendment to the 1965
US legislation which required health warnings to be put on every cigarette
packet. Obviously, some suits pre-date that deadline - and it is possible
that previously unsuccessful cases could be re-opened were a juicy award to
be made - but it is hard to dispute the industry's early claim that it has
scored a victory, not a defeat.
Even where cases do proceed on this basis, plaintiffs still have to convince
a jury, confront the reality that the causal link between smoking and cancer
has never been established in a court of law, and overcome the ultimate
defence that death or injury may have been caused by someone else's brand.
The anti-smoking lobby will no doubt keep up the attack on other fronts -
but even a gloomy scenario of 20 Dollars 10m awards a year would only cost a
cent on a packet of cigarettes or a fraction of the industry's profits.

This week's rather good results from the Post Office cannot diguise the fact
that the government still has the problem of finding a new boss for its
biggest nationalised industry. Chairman Sir Bryan Nicholson goes part-time
in October and will bow out next March and there has not been a whisper of
his replacement.
Bill Cockburn, boss of Royal Mail at 49, and John Roberts, the 47-year-old
head of PO Counters, are the obvious internal candidates. However, as all
the previous chairman have been imported, there's a good chance the private
sector will be tapped again.
But if the government is going to lure the right replacement it is going to
have to do something about the starting salary. Even after his latest rise
Nicholson gets only Pounds 170,000 a year - a mere pittance compared with
the BT chairman's earnings.

Never mind the quality, feel the name. This seemed to be the motto of many
of the entrepreneurs who were chasing up the share prices of London's small
merchant banks only a few years ago.
However, times have changed, and owning a famous nameplate no longer
attracts quality business the way it once did - otherwise Brown Shipley
would not be thinking of selling its 182-year-old merchant bank to
Kredietbank, its biggest shareholder.
Montagu Norman, the most famous governor of the Bank of England, used to
work at Brown, Shipley &amp; Co, as did ex-premier Sir Edward Heath. In its
heyday Brown Shipley was one of the great transatlantic banking
partnerships, on a par with the House of Morgan. Alexander Brown, a Belfast
linen merchant, had emigrated to Baltimore; his firm remains a force in the
business as does New York's Brown Brothers, Harriman which for over 100
years was part of the London firm.
It's a great pity - but Brown, Shipley &amp; Co has long since drifted off
course and seems to be following into retirement other once famous names
like Arbuthnot Latham, Antony Gibbs, Seligman Bros and Wm Brandts. The name
may linger on, but perhaps not much else.

What price Britain's presidency of the European Community? Certainly not the
minting of a special set of Ecu coins - the customary way for member
countries to mark their stewardship.
John Major's government is breaking the mould, perhaps reflecting the
seriousness with which the UK government takes its opt-out clause from the
single currency envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty.
Instead, for all the talk about keeping Britain at the heart of Europe, what
it will hand out on its assumption of the presidency next Wednesday will be
a 50p coin, commemorative issue, of course.
An insider at the Royal Mint says it would have 'loved' to strike an Ecu
coin for sale to collectors, but Chancellor Lamont - Euro-sceptic architect
of the Maastricht opt-out - vetoed the idea. Maybe the 50p alternative
struck him as a bargain price to pay for keeping calm among anti-federalist
Tory backbenchers.

What a pity that sweet stories aren't always true - the one about the Old
Lady being run by a woman, for example. It seems that Sarah Hogg will not,
in fact, take over from Robin Leigh-Pemberton as Governor of the Bank of
England on his retirement 12 months hence.
For one thing, as head of the prime minister's policy unit, she is too
valuable to John Major for him to countenance her leaving 10 Downing Street.
For another, although extremely able, she lacks the tribal City background
so far deemed essential in the governor's job.
What is more, Major is well aware of the criticism he'd invite by putting
one of his closest advisers in charge of the Bank at a time of growing
pressure for it to be given greater independence. Indeed, if European
economic and monetary union stays on track, the next governor will almost
certainly have to stand free of Whitehall, Treasury opposition
notwithstanding.
But the main reason why 46-year-old Hogg won't be taking up the governorship
is simply that she doesn't want the job. Hence the front-runners remain
deputy governor Eddie George and Warburgs' Sir David Scholey.
Even so, since no announcement of the successor is likely till around
Christmas, there is still time for some more adventurous suggestions. Let's
hope so, anyway.

FT  25 JUN 92 / A battle of political wills: South Africa's latest bout of
violence may yet prove a spur to political reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa is being given a look into what might be its future, and it is
likely to prove a salutary experience. Township slaughter and trigger-happy
police have raised fears that constitutional negotiations, already
deadlocked, will be abandoned. An apocalyptic vision of a country slipping
into ungovernability is gripping South Africa.
For the past 24 hours, the African National Congress (ANC) and the
government have been locking horns in a dramatic test of political will
which could either break the deadlock or push the country towards disaster.
Last night's angry rejection by the ANC of President FW de Klerk's proposal
of a two-day meeting to break the deadlock may suggest that South Africa is
moving towards the abyss. But the more likely outcome is that the days ahead
will see both sides make clear that they see no alternative to the
negotiating table.
The present crisis reflects a deep distrust between the two sides and the
wide gap over constitutional objectives. But the tragedies - the latest in
political violence that has cost more than 13,000 lives since 1984 - may yet
turn out to have provided an impetus to the talks, and not to have sounded
their death knell. Politicians' minds are being concentrated by a week which
has had all the ingredients of recurring South African nightmares.
Sharpeville in 1960, the 1976 Soweto students' uprising, the township wars
of 1984-86 - all are etched in the country's memory. Boipatong, until now an
anonymous shanty township near Johannesburg, joined this list last
Wednesday.
Unknown assailants slaughtered 42 residents including a pregnant woman and a
baby. The ANC blamed supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP), and accused the security forces of complicity. Three
days later, police opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, protesting against
the massacre, killing three people, and an outraged Mr Nelson Mandela
announced the suspension of constitutional negotiations.
Thus began South Africa's latest crisis, with the financial rand - the
investment currency - falling nearly 7 per cent in one day, talk of renewal
of sanctions, and calls for the involvement of the United Nations.
The sense of crisis deepened as old political instincts rapidly resurfaced.
Mr Mandela threatened 'mass action', a series of strikes, demonstrations and
boycotts. President FW de Klerk, driven by angry residents out of Boipatong
where he had gone to express his sympathy, took refuge in kragdadigheid -
the iron fist used by his predecessors - hinting at a government crackdown.
By Monday, however, as fury at home was matched by outrage abroad, the full
enormity of the crisis was dawning on a government that had become
over-confident, forcing President de Klerk to cut short a visit to Spain and
return in time for yesterday's cabinet meeting.
Were South Africa a democracy, Mr de Klerk's party would be out of office,
racial politics aside. Two official investigations into government
departments or agencies have revealed fraud running into millions of rands.
A combination of press inquiries and judicial investigations have produced
powerful evidence of state involvement in violence against its political
opponents, particularly the ANC.
Mr de Klerk's belief in his cause seemed undented, however, contributing to
his failure to grasp the consequences of seemingly endemic violence on the
peace process. Buoyed by the referendum in March in which 69 per cent of
whites endorsed his reform programme, the president has been able to point
to a string of successes: the repeal of most sanctions, re-entry into the
international sports arena (now in jeopardy), and warm receptions in
formerly hostile countries.
But central to his confidence is Mr de Klerk's belief that the National
party can lead a winning alliance in South Africa's post-apartheid
elections. Far from being depressed at the deadlock at last month's
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party
negotiating forum, Mr de Klerk seemed unshaken in his belief that his party
would remain central to the government of a future South Africa.
In private at least, ANC officials acknowledge that the electoral arithmetic
gives them food for thought. It assumes that the bulk of white voters (14
per cent of the population) would vote for Mr de Klerk. Both the coloured (9
per cent) and Indian communities (3 per cent) could be drawn into a minority
parties alliance in which the other leading black participant would be Chief
Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom party, drawing support from the country's
6m Zulus, 21 per cent of the black population. The right-wing Conservative
party (representing about a third of white voters) would, it is argued, have
no choice but to join South Africa's 'rainbow coalition'.
Put this calculation in the context of the government's constitutional
proposals, and the ANC's unease deepens. Mr de Klerk envisages not only
power-sharing in an executive, whose composition would reflect the principle
of proportional representation. At the Codesa negotiations the government
has insisted on a decentralised administration, giving provincial assemblies
considerable autonomy, with their powers entrenched in the constitution.
Such a system offers Chief Buthelezi the possibility of securing Natal as
his fiefdom, and the prospect of a Cape Province run by whites and coloureds
whose combined population outnumbers that of blacks. Add to this strategy
the existing white dominance of commerce, the civil service and the security
forces, and Mr de Klerk's confidence seems understandable. It is against
this backdrop, say ANC officials, that the violence can be explained. The
brutality, they claim, is intended to consolidate Inkatha's hold on Natal,
where some of the worst violence has taken place, make support for the ANC
dangerous and persuade ethnic minorities to choose the side with the greater
firepower.
But other explanations of the slaughter include allegations that it is the
ANC which has been responsible. A leading South African commentator
yesterday contrasted the outrage over Boipatong with the muted protest over
the slaughter of at least 23 people at the Crossroads squatter camp east of
Johannesburg last April. The fundamental difference behind the response both
at home and abroad, notes the commentator, is that 'Boipatong is a township
in which the ANC is the dominant political organisation; the IFP is
paramount in Crossroads'.
Wherever the truth lies, the ANC is discovering that an interim government
will not be achieved on the terms it anticipated. Earlier this year, Mr
Mandela said agreement on such a government was imminent, and his
supporters' frustrations are mounting. The reality is that neither the ANC
nor the government entered the May talks with an accurate assessment of the
other's position. They underestimated their policy differences, partly
through failing to take each other's stated position seriously, and failed
to realise the limits of their powers.
The negotiations are only now starting to grapple with the fundamental
problem of how to reconcile majority rule and minority rights. The parties
have sprinted through the preliminaries, creating a false sense of optimism
about the speed with which agreement can be reached on fundamentals.
Premature electioneering, in which Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk increasingly
see each other as rivals in the battle for power rather than partners in the
transition from apartheid, is also poisoning the atmosphere.
The wrong constitutional mix, warned Mr John Kane-Berman, executive director
of the South African Institute of Race Relations, an independent research
body, could exacerbate violence and civil strife. 'We do not want a
constitution which, like the Treaty of Versailles, merely lays the
foundations of the next war.'
The days ahead will show how much has been learnt by the negotiators from
the impasse reached last month. For its part, the ANC has so far performed
adeptly, doing enough to reflect the anger of its supporters, while setting
terms for the resumption of talks which should fall within the government's
grasp. Some are not new and have already been accepted in principle by the
government. These include a commitment to an interim government, hunting out
rogue elements in the security forces and abolishing the hostels whose
residents have been responsible for many of the killings.
The main stumbling block may be the ANC call for an international commission
of inquiry into the Boipatong massacre. But middle ground may be found. Mr
de Klerk yesterday pointed to the standing inquiry by a South African
judicial commission into political violence which has been critical of the
security forces. The same judge, who is about to investigate the Boipatong
tragedy, could be assisted by an assessor 'of international repute'. The
government also appears to be softening its resistance to international
monitoring, with delegations from the Commonwealth and the Organisation of
African Unity among the visitors to troubled townships.
The main question is whether Mr de Klerk and his cabinet have been jolted
out of their complacency by the events of the past few days, and now accept
that only a genuine attempt to tackle violence at its core will create the
right climate for talks. The imperatives driving the government to the
negotiating table are as strong as ever, whether an economy in recession or
the prospect of a repeat of the insurrection in the townships in the
mid-1980s.
For Mr Mandela the threat of 'mass action' could prove a two-edged sword. He
cannot afford to ignore that part of his constituency which consists of
frustrated youths who boycotted their schools in order to man the barricades
in the townships. Competing for their loyalty is the radical Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) which has remained aloof from Codesa, arguing that it will
lead nowhere.
What Professor Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, a leading commentator, described
as a 'massive growing young black population, increasingly urbanised, yet
unskilled, unemployed and politically volatile' may well interpret Mr
Mandela's appeal for action as a renewed call to the barricades.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Arts: Liza Minnelli - Pop
</HEADLINE>

   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
Liza tells us that when she was a youngster she used to sit on the stairs at
Sammy Davis Junior's Hollywood mansion and listen to the adults enjoy a
sing-song around the piano. Brando, Dali, Monroe, Dietrich, Sinatra did
their party pieces with James Stewart rather improbably rattling the
ivories. Ah, happy days.
Now, so many breakdowns, marriages and traumas later, Liza Minnelli stands
almost alone in perpetuating the show biz tradition she was raised in, the
old trouper for ever smiling through, alive only on stage. Any performance
by Liza Minnelli is bound to be heavily seasoned with schmaltz. When she
committed herself to holding a charity tribute, 'paying back something to
Sammy', the sentimentality was guaranteed to be boundless.
In the event the evening was beyond criticism because it raised over Pounds
500,000 for cancer charities in the UK and the US. It also delivered the
personalities that the audience craved. On to the stage in the round, like
bulls entering an arena for their brief moment of glory, bounced an
extraordinary mishmash of stars. Why, that's Jerry Lewis; it's Tom Jones;
surely Joan Collins; and Charles Aznavour; and Cliff. There was room, too,
for that ineffable sidekick of the stars, Lionel Blair, who can always be
relied on to put in an appearance rather than put on a performance. The only
time the audience hesitated was when Liza's sister, Lorna Luft, did her
party piece. In the event her Sammy Davis story capped them all - he was
actually present at her birth. No matter that many read their tributes from
the autocue - they'd answered the call.
The second half was all Liza. The voice may be dodgy, especially in the high
notes, and the movement less spring- heeled, but no one can publicly emote
like Ms Minnelli. There were too many of those noisy tuneless songs inspired
by positive thinking, epitomised by the newly penned 'Yes I can'. And the
Newley-Bricuse songbook featured too prominently. But you have to admire
Liza - if she'd been on the Titantic she'd have gone down tapping. There was
even a medley of real style, of classic standards ('Just You; Just me';
'Never be Another You'), the songs the stars sang 'At Sammy's House'.
At the end the greasepaint crown was passed on - the tributes transferred
from Sammy to Liza. Sinatra was on screen to seal the show, and then Jerry
Lewis gave Liza the first 'Sammy', which looked like an African fertility
symbol. Judging by the praises sung - his generosity, his friendship, his
professionalism - Davis is on his way to a swift sainthood. The man himself,
in a remarkably frank autobiography, painted a portrait of a frankly
reprehensible person redeemed by his honesty. But for one night the
audience, who enjoyed the privilege as cardholders of American Express, the
sponsors of the show, could take a peep at the garish, glitzy world of
entertainment and go thankfully home to their discreet beds.

It was a brave move on the part of English National Ballet to open a brief
Coliseum season with a programme of new works - and with tickets at half the
usual prices. The ballet audience is in decline, put off by the inhibiting
cost of seats, and hence not prepared to gamble on the unknown. Thus the
ghastly predictabilities, and predictable box-office returns, of safe titles
and full-length ballets whose name is more important than choreographic
merit.
I cannot say if ENB's gamble on Tuesday and Wednesday with five new pieces
will be justified in the accounts, for all the economy of the stagings, but
it is treasure in Heaven for a troupe that has looked artistically blinkered
of late. There were two creations for the company, Kim Brandstrup's White
Nights and Robert North's A Stranger I Came. Brandstrup takes as his
starting point a Dostoievsky story of a man obsessed with a girl whom he
meets while she is waiting vainly for her lover. Brandstrup opens out the
tale: his hero is a photographer, recording life rather than living it,
until this meeting turns him from dispassionate observer into passionate
player.
The narrative develops by being intercut with scenes in which the man
photographs groups of young lovers. Brandstrup studied film at Copenhagen
University, and his dance works often suggest cinematic structure. The
action flows, then lingers on incident. Revelatory images spring vividly
from a long shot of the narrative; dreams (the girl's longing for her lover;
the photographer's feelings for the girl) shadow each moment of the drama.
I find the resultant work allusive, haunting. Brandstrup's ability to fix
emotion with gesture is wonderfully exact; his choreographic language is
fluent, clear and true. Kevin Richmond, as the photographer, gives a
performance beautifully judged both in its intensity and in its control;
Josephine Jewkes is no less fine as the girl. The score is by Gerard
McBurney, based on piano fragments by Mussorgsky; minimal, efficient design
is by Fotini Dimou.
Josephine Jewkes and Kevin Richmond also take leading roles in Robert
North's A Stranger I Came. Seven Schubert songs provide a basis for a study
in high Romantic despair as Thomas Edur wanders the world, unhappy in love
(Miss Jewkes the woman), his every step dogged by his doppelganger fate (Mr
Richmond). North's choreography has a directness of response to the score
that disarms our suspicions that the songs are not to be so arbitrarily used
(the musical desolation of Die Leiermann is dissipated in character capers),
and the cast respond with no less direct interpretations. Edur is superb, an
Apollonian premier danseur who uses the classical vocabulary as his native
tongue, and can speak of feeling as well as of the beauties of academic
propriety. Here he gives the dance a Schubertian dignity and poignancy.
The remaining pieces in this programme were lighter in weight. From the
American choreographer David Parsons two clever jokes. The Envelope is about
an un-put-downable, inescapable letter, that passes among seven dancers and
won't go away, while fragments from Rossini overtures goad the quirky
movement ever onward. Sleep Study is about seven pyjama-ed people who behave
as insomniacs will know only too well: twitching, turning, lying on their
backs, sides, on each other, prey to every known form of fidget. Non-dance
as dance, and great fun. Both pieces are short, impeccably timed by creator
and interpreters.
And to close the evening, L, a choreographic tribute to Liza Minnelli from
Ben Stevenson. It proposes 13 men, three percussionists, and a torrent of
trick steps and show-biz cliches that make it a mockery of male dancing as
anything save cheap-jack physicality. It was singularly unexhilarating, and
unflattering to its cast.
English National Ballet is at the Coliseum until June 27

THE PLAYER (15) Odeon Leicester Sq, Screen on the Hill
GLADIATOR (15) Odeon West End
RAINER WERNER FASSBINDER ICA from next week
All the world loves a comeback. In Cannes, where Robert Altman's blissful
Hollywood satire, The Player, won best director prize, Altman gamely
insisted that he had never been away. But two decades have passed since his
last palpable hit, Nashville. During that period Hollywood's favourite
ageing hippy, the creator of MASH, McCabe and Mrs Miller and California
Split, has marked time with fidget-inducing filmed plays like Streamers or
commercial clinkers like OC &amp; Stiggs.
Altman has never been away? As soon believe Rip Van Winkle if he claimed he
had only nodded off for an hour. But in The Player Altman not only returns,
he returns in style. He takes up the red carpet nervously laid out for him
by Hollywood, puts it between his teeth and munches it happily for two
hours. The nominal plot, derived from screenwriter Michael Tolkin's novel of
Hollywood life and death, concerns the cover-up campaign of a young studio
executive (Tim Robbins) who has murdered a screenwriter suspected of sending
him poison pen postcards. The real plot, scribbled between the lines by a
lovingly acerbic Altman, concerns the follies of the film community as
millions of dollars are poured daily into an industry largely devoted to
recycling yesterday's waste.
We get the message in the virtuoso 10-minute opening shot. As the camera
serpentines around a studio forecourt, following strolling execs or peering
through windows, we eavesdrop on a dozen different conversations. The
bespectacled film-maker pitching 'The Graduate 2', the young writer
promising a script that's 'like Ghost mixed with The Manchurian Candidate',
the studio employee shouting 'Hey, you're Martin Scorsese' to Alan Rudolph .
. .
This is the Tower of Babel passing itself off as a communications industry.
The language spoken in Hollywood, as everyone who has been there knows, is
Gobbledegook without subtitles. But that language also has a nightmare
logic. 'I didn't know you had a drinking problem' says Robbins to fellow
studio whizz-kid Peter Gallagher as the latter sets off for an Alcoholics
Anonymous meeting. 'I don't,' comes the reply, 'but that's where all the big
deals are being made.'
Meanwhile there is the stark-eyed English director (Richard E. Grant) eager
to make a no-compromises anti-capital-punishment picture. This will end up
as a gaudy jailbreak romp starring Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, playing
themselves. There is Robbins's secretary-girlfriend sent to New York on a
Wolfe-hunting trip, to sign up Bonfire Of The Vanities author's new book,
while Robbins himself plays wolf to Greta Scacchi's fey Icelandic painter
(ex-girlfriend of the murdered writer). There is the Hollywood-influenced
priest at the funeral intoning 'It's been a long day - fade-out - thank
you.' And there is the ceaseless round of Tinseltown parties, where
celebrity-spotting becomes a form of delirium tremens. Oh look, there is Rod
Steiger; Harry Belafonte; Cher; Elliott Gould; Spiro Agnew; Benjamin
Disraeli; Plato . . .
Most of the above appear for real in The Player. How an Altman at low career
ebb persuaded them to lend cameo kudos to a low-budget comedy aimed at
savaging the hand that feeds them is a mystery. But what a beautiful
mystery. The film glides along like the invertebrate masterworks of Altman's
heyday: those films that seemed all grace and no structure. The camera
defies walls, passes through windows, peers under folded raincoats (where a
rattlesnake may be concealed), observes the overlapping chatter and makes
the filmgoer jump in pleasure at the surreal sight of a knee emerging from a
mudbath.
When in doubt, which is not often, Altman cuts to a comedy subplot serenely
tangential to the Tinseltown themes. Whoopi Goldberg crackles through the
story as a semi-crazed black woman detective, clearly overstrained by being
every oppressed social sector's equal-rights representative.
Like all masterworks, The Player is a film to be lost in. We are never more
certain of its sense of direction than when we blithely query 'Where are
we?' And we are only aware of faltering navigation when we can say 'Oh here
we are', stuck with the indifferent love scenes between Robbins and Scacchi.
Scacchi does her bushbaby-eyed, aren't-I-enigmatic routine. And though
Robbins won a Cannes best actor prize for his sweetly creepy anti-hero, his
natural passivity becomes dullish away from the film's satiric epicentre.
Elsewhere, The Player will be remembered as a satire that pours scorn over
its targets as if scorn were champagne not vitriol. It may also be
remembered as the opening shot of a new and exciting epic - who says that
some movie ideas are not worth recycling? - 'Robert Altman the Sequel.'
*****
Gladiator should have come as part of the publicity kit for The Player. This
is the kind of film Mr Altman is talking about when he suggests that modern
Hollywood, or a large part of it, is brain-dead. Somewhere in Chicago, high
school youngsters of all ages and races come together nightly in a giant
lock-up warehouse to box. It is illegal, semi-suicidal and highly paid:
Dollars 1000 for a night's work. Crooked promoter Brian Dennehy, a
Satanically-lit hulk peering down on the ring from his office window, would
like blood for starters, fear for main course and death for dessert. The
merry patter of fist on facial bone continues for 101 minutes, sometimes
interrupted by demented character work from Dennehy and Robert Loggia. The
latter enjoys himself as a foulmouthed trainer. 'Frig this,' 'Frig that,'
'Frig you' he says. I am giving you the TV and airline version.
But no amount of up-to-date expletives or multi-racial casting - James
Marshall as the white hero, Cuba Gooding Jr of Boyz N The Hood as his black
rival, Jon Seda as an excitable Latino - prevent this film from looking like
an old Warner Brothers white slave melodrama of the 1930s. We keep wondering
when Edward G. Robinson or Sydney Greenstreet will turn up, or James Cagney
prance in hitching his shoulders and snarling 'You friggin' rat.'
*****
I love the myths that grow up around film-makers at anniversary time. In the
new issue of Sight And Sound, six pages are devoted to the memory of Rainer
Werner Fassbinder who died 10 years ago this month. The critic writing the
main essay, carried away by his own certainties, claims that RWF's weird
tale of an abused transexual, In A Year With Thirteen Moons, was his most
autobiographical film and that the director 'took personal responsibility
for virtually all aspects of the film's production.'
Ah yes. And pigs have wings. I watched two day's shooting on this movie in
Frankfurt. Fassbinder, heavily into abusable substances at this time, failed
to turn up one morning, vanished one afternoon, and even when present for
filming tended to hand the camera to one of his actors to rehearse and
shoot. Between sessions of waiting-for-Rainer I and another critic buzzed
off to an ice cream parlour with main actor Volker Spengler. Since Spengler
was dressed in drag, these trips tended to disrupt traffic and attract even
more chaos around the production.
RWF was a genius but not always a hands-on genius. Many of his best films
were collaborative creations in the best Renaissance tradition, made with a
team of cronies who might have been dubbed the Scuola di Fassbinder. To
venture this idea does not diminish the achievement of his best work,
represented in the ICA's coming season: The Bitter Tears Of Petra Von Kant,
Effi Briest, Fear Eats The Soul, Fox And His Friends and the spellbinding
Merchant Of Four Seasons. Fassbinder, with and without help, created a
cinema that used seeming naivety of gesture and image to refresh our
perception of truth, jaded from long decades of looking at the true naivety
of Hollywood or the overwrought sophistications of Europe.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Casino raises the
stakes - French food retailers have been fighting on price. Now they are
finding that big is beautiful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the next few weeks, an army of bankers, brokers and lawyers will be
installed at Casino, one of France's largest food retailing groups, to put
the finishing touches to its acquisition of the Rallye chain of hypermarkets
and supermarkets.
For Casino, the addition of the Rallye stores offers a much needed
opportunity to achieve the critical mass that its own hypermarkets and
supermarkets need to survive in the increasingly competitive world of French
food retailing. For the rest of the sector, the Casino deal will make life
more competitive than ever.
At first glance, the problems of French food retailers look much the same as
those of their counterparts in other European economies. The French market
is mature and for the past year or so the hypermarkets and supermarkets have
been engaged in a ferocious price war.
Meanwhile the concentration of ownership within European food manufacturing
has eroded the retailers' bargaining power with their suppliers. The growth
of groups such as France's BSN, the Anglo-Dutch Unilever and Nestle of
Switzerland has put the retailers in a weaker negotiating position.
But the French food retailers also face problems of their own. They are
threatened by the rapid expansion of German discount outlets, notably Aldi
and Norma, in France. Moreover, the French companies' margins, at an average
of 1.5 per cent, are among the lowest in Europe.
So far, the French food retailers have adopted a dual response to these
issues. First, they have accelerated their expansion into other countries to
compensate for lack of growth in their own. The large hypermarket chains,
Carrefour and Promodes, have successfully diversified into southern Europe
and rather less successfully into the US. Some smaller supermarket groups,
such as Docks de France, have followed them into Spain.
Meanwhile, the retailers are confronting increasingly powerful suppliers by
expanding their own businesses to improve their bargaining position. The
five largest players in French food retailing - Carrefour, Casino and
Promodes, together with Leclerc and Intermarche, the associations of
independents - increased their share of retail sales from 16 to 20.6 per
cent in the five years to 1990 according to Insee, the state statistics
institute.
This expansion is continuing. Carrefour last year bought the Euromarche and
Montlaur chains. As Michel Bon, its chairman, says: 'Volume is the key to
success in our business'. Casino, which was in danger of being squeezed out
of the market with turnover of just FFr42bn (Pounds 4.26bn) compared with
Carrefour's FFr100bn, is following suit with the Rallye deal. Thanks to
Rallye, Casino will gain an extra FFr24bn of sales.
These deals are creating problems for the rest of the retail sector. 'The
level of sales needed for a company to remain competitive is increasing all
the time,' said one analyst.
After the Casino-Rallye deal, there will be three French hypermarket chains
with annual sales over FFr65bn - Carrefour, Promodes and Casino. Christiane
Thorne, European retailing analyst at Phillips &amp; Drew in London, argues that
that this will intensify the pressure on the other large players, Auchan and
Cora.
But size alone is not enough. The French food retailers have yet to complete
the reorganisation of their businesses so they can take advantage of their
new bulk buying power. Carrefour is introducing a more centralised structure
so that it can make the most of its size.
Promodes is going one step further. It already has a fairly centralised
buying operation in France and is now co-ordinating its activities across
Europe. This spring, it opened a new international buying office in
Switzerland to negotiate with its multinational suppliers.
The bulk of Promodes' buying is still conducted on a national basis. Despite
the internationalisation of food manufacturing, there are still huge
differences in taste from country to country so there are relatively few
truly international brands. But the Swiss operation does have the additional
advantage of helping Promodes in the new markets, notably Germany, where its
local competitors have been putting pressure on their suppliers to boycott
the French insurgent.
At the same time, the French food retailers are also trying to increase
their historically low margins by increasing their own-label portfolios  -
where margins are generally higher - and by investing in operational
improvements such as laser scanning, which ought to be operative in all
French hypermarkets by the end of next year.
These initiatives will be hampered by the continuing expansion of the German
discounters, which opened 60 new outlets in France last year alone, bringing
the total to 144. Some French companies have retaliated by expanding their
own cut-price chains, notably Carrefour with Ed l'Epicier. But the German
discounters still pose a serious threat, particularly to the urban
supermarkets under the Leclerc and Intermarche umbrellas.
Casino, aided and abetted by its army of advisers, may have won one round in
the fight for the French food market thanks to the Rallye deal, but the real
battle has only just begun.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Anger greets Labour decision on
selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHORUS of angry criticism followed a 13-8 vote by the Labour's national
executive committee yesterday to postpone the introduction of a one-member,
one-vote selection system for MPs.
The NEC reversed an earlier decision to put the change to the party's
conference and decided instead to include it in a general review of union
links. The NEC thus in effect shelved a nine-year campaign by Mr Neil
Kinnock, the party's outgoing leader, to exclude unions from the process.
Critics of the decision said it had served only to highlight the timidity of
the party when faced with the power of union bosses.
Several singled out Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, as the
main figure behind the reversal.
Mr George Howarth, MP for Knowsley North, commented ironically that it only
remained for Mr Edmonds to be officially confirmed as party leader. Another
high ranking party official described Mr Edmonds' behind-the-scenes
activities as akin to 'a rogue elephant' on the loose.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union and an opponent
of deep reforms, also let his deep displeasure with the decision be known
yesterday.
He said he had not been consulted on his inclusion in the review committee
and that he may not participate.
Defending the vote, Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary, insisted
that by including the plan in the review the NEC was avoiding making
'piecemeal' changes.
He added that while NEC backing for the change on selection procedures was
not in doubt, a full-scale 'divorce' between the party and the unions was
also not on the cards.
Other NEC members made clear that the move was taken to avoid embarrassing
Mr John Smith, now certain to be elected leader on July 18.
Amid growing union resentment at the public criticism of their influence,
the proposal would almost certainly have been voted down had it gone to
conference.
That confrontation may, nonetheless, take place after the reform-minded AEEU
engineering and electrical union yesterday tabled a conference motion
backing a one-member, one-vote selection process.
In an effort to calm tempers, Mr Kinnock used his last NEC meeting as party
leader to argue the case for his proposal. But he then voted to put the
issue to the review 'in the interests of party unity'.
Others were not so easily mollified. Opponents pointed out that the NEC
motion proposing that MP selection be part of the general review was moved
by Mr Robin Cook, campaign manager for the shadow chancellor, who in turn
was a GMB-sponsored MP.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory unease over upturn intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING DISQUIET among Tory MPs about the weakness of the recovery surfaced
yesterday in a public demand that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should
extend the stamp duty 'holiday' for many house purchases.
The call - in a Commons motion signed by 26 Tories - coincides with
widespread acknowledgement among cabinet ministers that the party's election
victory has failed to bring the promised revival.
Mr Lamont's colleagues now expect the Treasury to revise down from 1 per
cent to zero its forecast of output growth this year. But they denied that
the chancellor faced cabinet pressure to risk sterling's stability in the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System by forcing the pace
on interest-rate cuts.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is understood to be keen for a small
reduction in rates. But he is said to back the chancellor's view that any
such move must be dictated by the financial markets rather than by political
pressures.
Mr Lamont last week underlined the government's commitment to sterling's ERM
parity, telling Conservative MPs that a relaxation of the government's
anti-inflation stance would wreck the medium-term prospects for the economy.
The unease among Tory backbenchers about the slow pace of recovery falls
significantly short of a rebellion, but it is reinforced by a separate
attack on sterling's participation in the ERM.
Conservative opponents of the Maastricht accord have seized on the
stubbornness of the recession to strengthen their demands for a sharp cut in
interest rates regardless of the impact on sterling.
Yesterday's Commons motion was seen as a broader warning from the
government's supporters of their impatience at the depth of the recession.
It was signed by MPs representing a broad spectrum of opinion in the party
Mr Lamont has made it clear he intends to stick to his plans to reimpose
stamp duty on all house purchases. The temporary moratorium - until
mid-August - of stamp duty on house sales below Pounds 250,000 was announced
last December to stimulate the housing market.
But the message from many Tories is that the measure has so far failed to
provide any significant boost to the construction industry. Sir Malcolm
Thornton, the Crosby MP who organised the motion, said he would be seeking a
statement of intent from Mr Lamont before the Commons rises next month for
the summer.
There were signs at Westminster last night that Labour might seek to
capitalise on the motion by incorporating an extension of the stamp-duty
holiday in an amendment to the finance bill. That would leave the government
facing a possible defeat as its Commons majority falls short of the 26
signatures on the motion.
A handful of Tory backbenchers whose local councils have had their budgets
disrupted through the 'capping' of their poll tax or community charge
refused to support the government in the Commons last night, Ivor Owen
writes.
Their gesture made little impact, however, as the government secured a
majority of 58 (312-254) approving the order endorsing capping.
Mr Michael Shersby, MP for Uxbridge, criticised the rigid formula applied by
the Department of Education.
This, he said, had resulted in his local education authority being deprived
of Pounds 1m because 15 per cent of the schools in the borough had opted out
of its control by securing grant maintained status.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hint of help for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government said yesterday that it would consider providing extra
financial assistance for small and medium-sized businesses.
During discussions in the committee stage of the Finance Bill on a Labour
plan to retain the Business Expansion Scheme for manufacturing industry, Mr
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told the standing
committee that the government would 'watch carefully the development of
access to equity capital of small and medium-sized businesses'.
He spoke shortly before a Labour amendment to retain the BES for investment
in manufacturing was narrowly defeated by 18 votes to 16.
Labour MPs tabled the amendment to government plans to scrap the BES after
1993 on the grounds that help was needed for budding entrepreneurs. Mr Alan
Milburn, the Labour MP for Darlington, said there was a 'crying need for
investment in small manufacturing firms' to prevent a loss of ideas and
innovations.
Mr John Townend, Conservative MP for Bridlington, called on the government
for consideration of another form of help for small businesses after 1993.
He suggested that next year's Budget should allow the first Pounds 5,000 of
a company's retained profit to be tax-free.
Mr Dorrell admitted he had 'mixed feelings' about the government's plan to
end of BES assistance for manufacturing. But he said the government had
concluded that there were better ways of attracting money into new and
developing businesses.
The government has decided to broaden the tax relief measures for the film
industry that were announced in the Budget.
Mr Dorrell has tabled new clauses to the finance bill to provide relief up
to a limit of 20 per cent of pre-production expenditure and to extend the
planned 33 1/3 per cent annual write-off on film production to expenditure
on the acquisition of qualifying films.
Mr Dorrell said that the measures should encourage early research work on
films.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd attempts to calm Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, faced hostile questioning from
Conservative Euro-sceptics yesterday as he sought to soothe opposition
within the party to the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Hurd said the European Community had an opportunity to embody into its
workings the principle of decisions being made at the lowest appropriate
level.
Several of the 50 Tories who attended the meeting of the backbench Europe
and foreign affairs committee, remained unconvinced that a greater emphasis
on 'subsidiarity' would prevent an increase in European centralisation. 'The
unpersuadables were out in force,' said one MP.
Next week the Commons will have its first opportunity since the Danish
referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty to debate the European Community.
Mr Hurd is expected to open a general debate, without out a vote, on
Thursday.
Yesterday Mr Hurd said Maastricht was a 'prize' worth building on.
The conservative party is to take a first step towards widening public
information on its finances.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, is to be consulted on the
feasibility of publishing a similar amount of information as in companies'
annual reports. That could include, for the first time, detailed figures on
debts.
Mr Tim Smith, the Tory vice-chairman with responsibility for party finances,
hopes he may be able to make the changes before 1992-93 accounts next
summer. However, he has ruled out publishing a breakdown of donations.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hazards ahead for Charter's driver
 -Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN William Waldegrave hits a hold-up on the motorway his children have an
awkward habit of complaining from the back seat of his car that he hasn't
been doing his job.
Everyone knows that the Citizen's Charter was supposed to clear the
motorways of those infuriating cones. Driving along the M4 to his
constituency, Mr Waldegrave is as conscious as anyone that they are still
there.
The charter, launched with great fanfare a year ago as the centrepiece of
John Major's programme for the 1990s, has not lived up to its billing. It
has yet to dispose of its reputation as a pre-election gimmick rather than
the serious instrument of the promised revolution in the quality of public
services.
As cabinet ministers set out last week their contribution to the 19 charters
published during the first year, there was plenty of evidence of Whitehall
foot-dragging. Many of the charters have a distinct Sir Humphrey quality
about them - repackaging old promises or setting targets for customer
service so low as to be meaningless.
Others have produced nothing. No-one could explain, for example, that a year
after it promised to do so, the government has failed so far to set out a
few basic rights for those on jury service.
Many cabinet ministers have preferred to concentrate their efforts on the
traditional annual battle with the Treasury over the size of their budgets.
From their perspective ensuring money is efficiently spent - or delivers a
measured quality of service - ranks a poor second to the figure on bottom
line.
Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, is aware that his political
reputation depends on hitting the Treasury's global targets rather than on
the value-for-money commitments he squeezes from individual departments.
But it would be a mistake to conclude that the charter is destined to gather
dust in Whitehall filing cabinets.
Mr Major's sharp political skills are now widely appreciated, but colleagues
say few have yet understood his painstaking persistence. He has said the
charter will be at the centre of his programme - and he will mean it as much
in five years' time as he does now.
There is no echo from Downing Street of Westminster gossip that Mr
Waldegrave has been given a non-job. The chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster has still to prove himself a cabinet heavyweight. But Mr Major
insists as vehemently in private as in public that Mr Waldegrave - a
cleverer man than some of his backbench colleagues allow - will have his
full backing.
The prime minister has much more to lose if the charter flops. Mrs Sarah
Hogg, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, ensures that message is
heard across Whitehall.
So far, however, the charter has done little more than raise expectations.
In advertising terms it has an extremely high 'recognition' factor. And the
concept is popular. A wave of customer charters in the private sector
attests to a public mood in tune with Mr Major's championship of powerless
Davids against bureaucratic Goliaths. People like information  - whether
about the examinations performance of local schools or simply the name of
the Inland Revenue official dealing with their tax affairs.
Delivering on expectations will be harder than raising them - particularly
amid the financial austerity which will follow the economic recession.
There are two essential strands to the charter. The first is the drive for
efficiency - primarily through 'market-testing', contracting-out and
privatisation of many of the services now carried out by public-sector
workers. The second - the new element - is the commitment to specific
targets for standards of public-sector service.
The two should naturally complement each other. Mr Waldegrave's equation is
that more efficient inputs will equal higher quality output.
But he is not be helped by the clumsy construction of his department. Much
of the responsibility for the input side of the equation remains with Mr
Portillo while Mr Waldegrave is charged with the output side.
Mr Waldegrave's promised white paper in the autumn should indicate the
extent to which the public-sector machine can make this link between
efficiency and quality. But the important political point is that Mr Major
is as anxious as his minister's children to get rid of those cones.

FT  25 JUN 92 / More freedom urged for aid body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government-controlled Commonwealth Development Corporation should be
given greater financial freedom to support projects in the developing world,
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said yesterday.
Endorsing the role of the development corporation, which provides loans and
equity capital for projects in 68 developing countries, the commission said
the corporation's funds should be less vulnerable to Treasury cuts, and it
'should be free to expand its activities by financing more projects and
investing at a greater rate'.
The commission examined the corporation's role in Britain's aid policy and
the way it is managed. It said the corporation provided a very effective
form of aid and was highly regarded in the developing countries. Its
strengths 'fit well with the trend of international thinking on development
assistance', placing appropriate emphasis on the private sector as an
vehicle for growth in the developing countries.
The commission was asked in November last year to investigate whether the
corporation could improve its efficiency and reduce costs. Its report said
there were no significant savings to be made - although its assessment was
coloured by the development corporation's 'unique and ambiguous character'.
The report added that efficiency could be improved, but largely by loosening
government control. The corporation's contribution to aid policy was
'particularly important'.
The report identified areas for possible improvement:
The corporation should have its own equity capital. The lack of it 'gives
the impression that it is only an extension of government'. This should be
in the form of public dividend capital, and should be provided either as new
money, or by converting the corporation's outstanding borrowings.
The corporation's ambiguous 'quasi-commercial' status should be resolved by
dividing it into two parts - one to operate entirely commercially in
prosperous developing countries, and the other to be 'aimed at the poorest
countries'.
The organisation's funds should be set as a given percentage of the UK aid
programme. At present if it boosts its income the government can cut its
funding, reducing the incentive for it to expand its activities.
The report reached no conclusion on whether the development corporation
should be privatised, partly because of fears that this might compromise its
development role, but called for further consideration of this by ministers.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Output fall is less than feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in UK output in the first three months of the year was marginally
less than originally reported, according to figures released yester day.
Revised figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that gross
domestic product fell by 0.5 per cent in the first three months of this
year, giving a year-on-year decline of 1.5 per cent. This was slightly
better than the 0.6 per cent first-quarter fall reported last month.
Excluding oil and gas extraction, GDP fell 0.3 per cent in the first
quarter, compared with a provisional estimate of 0.4 per cent. The
year-on-year rate of decline was 1.6 per cent.
A slowdown in the rate of destocking meant that domestic demand rose 0.2 per
cent in the first three months of the year - the third consecutive quarterly
rise. Within this:
Consumer expenditure fell 0.7 per cent on the last quarter of last year and
was 1.8 per cent lower than a year before. The biggest falls in this
component of GDP were in cars (down 5.7 per cent on the previous quarter);
furniture and carpets (down 7.4 per cent) and clothing (down 4.6 per cent).
General government consumption fell 1.1 per cent on the previous quarter but
was 0.6 per cent up on a year before.
Fixed investment increased 1.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter, but was 2.2 per
cent down on a year ago.
Stock levels were broadly unchanged on a year ago, indicating an end to
de-stocking. Inventories fell by just Pounds 23m (at 1985 prices) after a
Pounds 709m fall in the last quarter of last year.
A breakdown of GDP analysed by output showed that production by the service
industries fell by 0.3 per cent on the previous quarter and by 0.9 per cent
on the same quarter a year earlier.

FT  25 JUN 92 / The Faltering Recovery: Debts ruin buy-out's high hopes -
Recession has hit the Midlands hard but it is not all gloom. Two companies
illustrate the contrasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Joinery, with gross liabilities of Pounds 3m, gave up the fight
against recession in April. For more than two years it had been struggling
to keep its balance on a skid pan of falling sales and high debts. Now Mr
Michael McLoughlin, the receiver, of KPMG Peat Marwick in Nottingham, is
looking for a buyer.
'It's easy being a financial pundit retrospectively,' Mr McLoughlin said.
Nevertheless, the management of Midland Joinery, a Burton-on-Trent window
frame manufacturer, was hopelessly unlucky with its timing.
The company was founded in 1922, and in 1988 Mr John Young and Mr Frank
Leyland led a management buy-out from Hunter Timber, part of Wickes Group,
at a cost of Pounds 3m.
Lazard Venture Fund Managers put together a package of Pounds 1.2m of
equity; directors and some employees put money in. Bank of Scotland provided
debt finance of Pounds 1.5m and Lazards lent a further Pounds 300,000.
Four years ago it looked sound enough, even if expensive. 'When we first
went in,' said Mr Leyland, 'we thought the funds were more than adequate;
although the gearing was high, we could ride out a short-term recession.' By
that he meant up to two years, noting that the timber trade was used to that
sort of downturn every 10 years or so.
But four years ago even the most pessimistic were not forecasting the
severity of the recession.
Things started to go wrong within a year. 'The marketplace began to shrink,'
Mr Leyland said. As Mr McLoughlin noted, 'The value of the assets goes down
but the borrowing doesn't go away - and there were two or three years of
very high interest rates.'
As the marketplace shrank, competition grew fiercer. The response of Midland
Joinery was to try 'to increase throughput', Mr Leyland said. It hired more
sales representatives and sought to make a bigger business of a stair
manufacture sideline, but found that market overcrowded.
It went into high-specification window-making in an attempt to target the
architects' market as well as the traditional builders' market. It increased
staff to service a potentially lucrative but not immediately profitable
contract with a DIY chain.
Turnover grew - Pounds 3.4m in 1989, Pounds 4.1m in 1990, Pounds 4.56m in
1991. But there were no profits. Midland Joinery was losing money even
before it attempted to pay its debt charges; operating losses in 1990 were
Pounds 352,000 and last year they were Pounds 330,000.
Although debt had already been restructured once, by the end of last year
Midland Joinery was desperate. The search started for a merger, for a new
injection of equity, for the sale of the company: in short, for a rescue.
The search foundered. The directors asked for the appointment of a receiver.
Of the original executive directors, only Mr Leyland remains.
So far eight of the company's 143 employees have been made redundant.
Mr Leyland awaits what Mr McLoughlin can provide, but as the months go by
and customers drift away to other suppliers, the chances of selling Midland
Joinery as a going concern diminish.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Queen mother with tusk disappoints: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'staff god' from Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, submitted for
identification at Sotheby's front counter, sold for Pounds 220,000 at the
auction house yesterday.
The staff is presumed to have been carved before 1820, when missionaries
destroyed the local religion. It has a stylised human head and other figures
and was probably treated as an object of worship. The price was at the lower
end of the estimate. Sotheby's tribal art sale was much concerned with queen
mothers, important figures in the culture of what is now Nigeria. The two
main lots failed to sell.
A 14 1/2 in-high Benin brass memorial head of an Oba (or queen mother), out
of which extended a carved ivory tusk more than 5ft long, was bought in at
Pounds 85,000. The tusk was created around 1814 as a memorial to Ose by her
son, the king Obanosa, even though he had had her executed after she plotted
against him. A Benin bronze head of an Oba, dated around 1600, was also
unsold at Pounds 90,000.
At Christie's an affectionate letter written by Mozart to his wife Constanze
in 1789, once owned by the soprano Jenny Lind, sold for Pounds 60,500. The
price was above estimate: letters from Mozart to his wife rarely appear at
auction.
The top price in a musical manuscript sale was the Pounds 297,000 paid for
Schubert's working manuscript of his quartet in B flat major written for his
family to perform in 1814 when he was 17.
Chopin's autograph manuscript of his Grande Valse Brillante was on target at
Pounds 60,500, while Beethoven's first jottings for his overture The
Consecration of the House made Pounds 33,000. The 50 lots brought in Pounds
612,000 and marked Christie's most successful sale in this market for many
years.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Complaints of sex bias at work up 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS about sex discrimination in the workplace increased by 40 per
cent last year, the Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday.
Releasing its annual report, the commission said the increase had been
caused by the continued rise in the number of women going out to work,
increased expectations among younger women and the higher profile of the
commission.
Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the commission, said the recession had also
played a part in the rise in complaints. 'Organisations are getting leaner
and some are getting meaner,' she said.
There were more than 9,000 complaints about employment issues last year
compared with 6,500 in 1990. The main areas of complaint involved
recruitment, pregnancy-related matters and unfavourable terms and conditions
of employment.
Sexual harassment complaints were up 35 per cent from 317 to 427. Some
complaints about sexual harassment in service delivery, rather than
employment, had also been received. There is no case law on whether the Sex
Discrimination Act covers services and the commission is backing a test case
involving a woman learner driver who alleges sexual harassment by her
driving instructor.
Ms Foster said the figures showed that sex discrimination was still a big
problem in the workplace. 'Yet while expectations of fair treatment are
higher than ever before, redress is more difficult to obtain because of the
complexity and cost of taking legal action,' she said.
Ms Foster said that if the government was serious about its Citizen's
Charter it needed to consider amendments put forward by the commission aimed
at strengthening and simplifying the equality laws.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will not be allowed to accept any insolvency work from a
debtor for whom they have previously worked, under draft ethical rules
issued by their professional bodies yesterday.
They will also be banned from being appointed as independent trustees to the
pension scheme of any company of which they are liquidator, administrator or
any other receiver.
The guidelines were issued by the Chartered Accountants' Joint Ethics
Committee - representing accountancy bodies throughout the British Isles -
and the ethics committee of the Society of the Practitioners of Insolvency.
The guidelines outlaw any insolvency appointment where there has been a
'material professional relationship' with the debtor.
That tightens existing regulations, which forbid appointment where there has
been a 'continuing professional relationship'.
The material relationship includes work - which may not be continuing - by
the firm as auditor, adviser to any director or other assignments which
might make the insolvency appointment prejudiced or seen to be prejudiced.
The guidelines say any insolvency practitioner should decline an appointment
by a debenture holder if he or she has a close business or personal
connection with the holder.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Lloyd's losses top 2bn
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES for the 1989 underwriting account increased to Pounds 2.06bn compared
with Pounds 510m in 1988, according to preliminary unaudited figures
released yesterday by Lloyd's, Richard Lapper writes.
Underwriting losses in 1989 were Pounds 1.37bn, while Names' personal
expenses amounted to Pounds 292m. An extra Pounds 398m was earmarked to
strengthen reserves for claims expected to emerge on business underwritten
in earlier years.
Syndicates in the non-marine and marine market were worst hit with losses
climbing to Pounds 1.76bn (Pounds 1.14bn) and Pounds 1.32bn (Pounds 821m)
respectively. Syndicates in the aviation and motor markets made profits of
Pounds 281m (Pounds 16m) and Pounds 597m (Pounds 52m) respectively.
The worst losses were heavily concentrated among a minority of syndicates
specialising in catastrophe reinsurance business. Five syndicates (255, 290,
298, 540 and 847) accounted for 34 per cent of the overall loss and two
agencies accounted for 37 per cent of the loss  - Gooda Walker with 25 per
cent and Feltrim with 12 per cent.
Lloyd's also gave details on the strength of its asset base last year. The
premium trust funds - into which insurance premiums are paid - rose from
Pounds 9.80bn to Pounds 12.25bn.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Names' anger defused: Coleridge apologises for Pounds 2.06bn
losses; Views of moderates gain prominence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHERE is the contrition?' Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's of London
is said to have remarked after seeing an early draft of his speech to
yesterday's annual general meeting.
Mr Coleridge more than made up for it in the final version. For good measure
he punctuated the long question-and-answer session which followed his
45-minute speech with countless apologies for the damage inflicted on Names
 -the individuals who underwrite the market - by the insurance market's 1989
losses of Pounds 2.06bn.
Many syndicates were overwhelmed by claims on catastrophe reinsurance
policies in what Mr Coleridge described as 'one of the darker chapters in
the long history of our society'. Mr Coleridge was flanked by his three
deputy chairmen as he said he understood the sentiments of 'despair, anger
and bewilderment expressed by Names'.
Mr Coleridge offered his regrets to dozens of Names who asked questions. He
was sorry for his failure to answer letters - he had received 850 in the
past two weeks.
He apologised profoundly for refusing to meet Mr John Harris, a Name who had
suffered losses of several hundred thousand pounds. 'If there is any
advantage for you to see me I'll do it in the next week if possible - I'm
extremely sorry.'
He was 'very sorry' about the fact that Names had discovered details of the
new levy in their morning newspapers rather than directly from Lloyd's. The
market was going through a period of 'intense media speculation', and any
delay risked 'more false and damaging rumours'.
Halfway through his presentation Mr Coleridge was congratulated by one Name,
Mr Alan Diamond, for his leadership. 'A lesser man would have walked away,'
said Mr Diamond. Mr Coleridge would take no credit, though. 'Whatever I do,
I know I'm wrong,' he said. 'There will be those of you who will disagree
with every word I have said.'
Mr Coleridge's approach succeeded in helping to defuse what had been
expected to be a tense, angry and even violent meeting. From the outset
dissident Names who had promised 'chaos' and 'civil war' were surprisingly
quiet.
As the day progressed the views of moderates who back Lloyd's Council - the
market's ruling body - were expressed more frequently. Ms Pamela Thomas
argued for a tougher stand against incompetence and negligence.
Mr Coleridge warmed to the theme. 'If there is anything, the whole book will
be thrown at them,' he said, reflecting on the possible evidence that might
be unearthed by investigations into the losses of catastrophe reinsurance
syndicates.
On the whole, the meeting was well-behaved, although one supporter of the
council could not contain his indignation. Handed a notice of an
extraordinary general meeting by Mr Richard Astor, who is pressing for a
no-confidence vote in the management, the Name screwed up the piece of
paper, spun round and threw it at Mr Astor. 'Scoundrel,' he shouted.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Transport minister cool on traffic switch to trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday poured cold water on hopes
that road traffic congestion could be eased by switching large amounts of
passenger and freight traffic to rail.
In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry, he said: 'We need to
be realistic about the scale of the contribution which the railways can make
to taking traffic off the roads.'
He said he was 'a great believer' in switching traffic to rail'. But he
added: 'The idea that we can get a massive switch from road to rail is, I
think, unrealistic.'
Less than a month ago Mr MacGregor extolled the virtues of the Department of
Transport's road-building programme, saying roads were 'good news' for the
environment.
His latest remarks are likely to reinforce fears among the environmental and
public transport lobbies that he is a 'pro-road' minister in the Thatcherite
mould.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Mr MacGregor's predecessor, had seemed intent on
breaking that mould. He had said he was 'enthusiastically and unequivocally'
in favour of seeing more passenger and freight traffic travelling by rail.
Mr Rifkind's critics point out that he failed to translate that desire into
reality. Mr MacGregor appears to be taking a more pragmatic approach. He
said: 'I want to see each form of transport making its most effective
contribution to the transport needs of the nation.
'The best way of achieving that objective is to maximise the amount of
choice and competition in transport provision, and to extend the
contribution made by the private sector to meeting the transport needs of
the community.'
The CBI claimed that investment in transport infrastructure had been
neglected for a decade until the mid 1980s, resulting in the worst transport
system in Europe.
Calling for a national transport forum, in which the government could enlist
more co-operation from both users and providers, the CBI urged ministers to
extend the policy of formulating and identifying national road spending
proposals to all areas of transport planning and expenditure.
After the meeting Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said that the
planned privatisation of British Rail risked becoming a 'poll tax on wheels'
unless the government first ensured that BR was viable, with adequate public
investment.
THE NUMBER of rail passengers in Britain fell 3 per cent last year while
pro-rail policies pushed up passenger numbers 20 per cent in Spain and 7 per
cent in the Netherlands, according to a survey published yesterday.
The survey, in Railway Gazette International magazine, also shows that
rail-borne freight traffic rose against the trend in Italy and Austria as a
result of measures to switch trans-Alpine movements from road to rail.
The survey put British Rail 10th out of 19 in a staff productivity league
table assessed by the amount of traffic handled. The magazine put Swedish
State Railways top of the league, followed by the national railways of
Finland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain.

A FRESH delay to the 'round-table' talks on Northern Ireland's political

British and Irish ministers have failed to agree a date for a bilateral
meeting, with local parties attending as observers, which had been assumed
to be the next stage of the talks.
Although a meeting today or tomorrow cannot be ruled out, Mr David Andrews,
the Irish foreign minister, is expected to be at the European Community
summit in Lisbon, almost certainly preventing a meeting before early next
week.
A deadline of the end of July has been set for the completion of all talks.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Road-rail fares war grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BITTER fares war has broken out between rail and coach operators on the
London-Glasgow and London-Edinburgh routes following British Rail's decision
to introduce a Pounds 29 return ticket.
National Express, the coach company, yesterday accused BR of abusing its
position as a nationalised industry by charging uneconomic prices. It also
cut its cheapest fares on the two routes to Pounds 25 return from Pounds 30
for seats booked at least seven days in advance.
BR's ordinary second-class return fare between London and Glasgow or
Edinburgh is Pounds 114. On some trains a 'saver' fare of Pounds 67 is
available; on others a 'super-saver' fare of Pounds 57; and an 'apex' fare
of Pounds 44 is offered to passengers who book at least seven days in
advance.
Last month, BR launched a direct attack on the coach market with a
'super-apex' return which has to be booked 14 days in advance. At Pounds 29,
it undercut the coach fare by Pounds 1.
Caledonian Express, the Scottish arm of National Express, yesterday labelled
this 'a blatant attempt to steal our passengers at prices that cannot be
justified'.
Mr Bernard Davis, Caledonian Express marketing director, claimed BR could
not cover its overheads at Pounds 29 a ticket. 'As a nationalised concern,
they appear to be ignoring commercial reality, especially now that
privatisation is the key issue in their future.'
British Rail's InterCity sector strongly denied that the fares were
uneconomic. The 'super-apex' fare had been introduced to fill under-capacity
trains with passengers who would not otherwise have travelled by rail. 'The
ticket has been highly successful in attracting passengers from the coaches.
But we have no plans to undercut their latest fare.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / MP says DTI ignored Maxwell warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN MP campaigning for the Maxwell pensioners has accused the Department of
Trade and Industry of ignoring warnings from the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation (Imro) that it felt unable to carry out its duties
adequately.
Mr Richard Page, the Tory co-chairman of the cross-party group of 100 MPs
who have taken up the pensioners' cause, has written to Mr William Reid, the
parliamentary ombudsman. Mr Page argues that the DTI failed to respond to
warnings from Imro about the difficulties of combining the Financial
Services Act with trust law; and this failure contributed to the inadequacy
of protection for Maxwell pensioners.
MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners believe an investigation by the
ombudsman would be critical to establishing the extent of government
responsibility. Mr Page's letter says Imro expressed concern to the DTI as
early as 1987 about the difficulties of combining the act and trust law, but
that the DTI took no action. In September 1990, he says, Imro submitted to
the DTI a paper on the same subject which the department also disregarded.
The letter is in response to a statement by Mr Reid earlier this month that
he might be able to consider any evidence that the DTI had ignored
representations about the adequacy of regulations. Making clear the limits
of his jurisdiction, Mr Reid had said he could not entertain complaints
against the Securities and Investments Board or Imro.
Although Mr Reid also said any evidence that the DTI's licensing of London &amp;
Bishopsgate International Investment Management in 1988 led to losses by the
pensioners could be considered, Mr Page's letter does not refer to this.
Downing Street said earlier this week it was satisfied that the appropriate
checks were made when the licence was granted: Robert Maxwell did not become
a director of LBI until some weeks after it had received its original
licence.
Although the government disputed the findings, the 1989 report of Sir
Anthony Barrowclough, then parliamentary ombudsman, led to aid for 18,000
investors who lost money when Barlow Clowes collapsed. Sir Anthony noted
'the lack of a sufficiently rigorous and inquiring approach' in the
government and the inadequacy of regulatory machinery before April 1988 when
the act was introduced.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration yesterday took its battle against excessive bank
regulation back to the Congress, proposing a bill that would roll back many
of the rules put in place by the banking bill of last November.
Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury secretary, said the bill would repeal some of
the most onerous measures of the November legislation, as well as in earlier
laws such as the Community Reinvestment Act.
'This legislation will remove needless statutory burdens that require banks
to spend more time filling out forms and filing reports than they do making
loans,' Mr Brady said.
With Congress near summer recess, and an election, the chances of a banking
bill being enacted this year are slim. Senior Treasury officials acknowledge
this.
Mr Jay Powell, Treasury under-secretary for finance said: 'It's late in the
year, but I wouldn't rule out some action on regulatory relief.' But he was
unable to explain why the bill had not been produced earlier.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESS prepared to intervene in the US rail dispute yesterday, as the
system ground to a virtual halt after a machinists' union strike against CSX
Transportation, one of the biggest freight lines.
There are Congressional powers to impose labour settlements on the rail
industry.
Mr Michael Boskin, White House chief economist, estimated that the strike
would cost the economy about Dollars 1bn a day and might lead to thousands
of lay-offs.
Testifying before the House energy and commerce sub-committee on
transportation, he said: 'A prolonged strike could well push us into
negative growth.' The car industry, which obtains parts and ships finished
products by rail, is particularly vulnerable.
The International Association of Machinists had failed to agree with CSX
over contracts.
However, Mr John Dingell, energy and commerce committee chairman, said there
was hope for a negotiated contract settlement. He noted that the work
stoppage differed from other rail strikes because there was a management
lock-out this time, as well as a walk-out by labour.

FT  25 JUN 92 / President calls for further rate cut by Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday called on the Federal Reserve to cut
interest rates further, on the grounds that the risk of renewed inflation
was now very slight.
His remarks, and a fall in US durable goods orders, helped to provoke a
sharp fall in the dollar yesterday. The dollar closed in New York at its
lowest level against the German D-Mark since January 8.
The president's concern about the sluggish rate of economic recovery
received some validation yesterday with the report that durable goods orders
in May fell sharply by 2.4 per cent, after revised increases of 1.9 per cent
and 2.1 per cent respectively in April and March.
Although the monthly durable goods figures are notoriously volatile, the
figures for last month were worse than the markets had expected and led to a
decline in long-term Treasury bond rates.
The Commerce Department said the drop in orders for transport equipment,
especially aircraft, and for defence goods accounted for most of the overall
decline - but no important industrial sector recorded an increase.
'I don't think the argument that lowering the rates will stimulate the long
term - shoot the long-term rates up - is valid any more,' Mr Bush said in an
interview with the New York Times. Inflation was not 'the big problem now.'
In the interview, Mr Bush expressed political frustration that the
statistical improvement in the economy this year had not been reflected in
the public opinion polls. These still show a popular perception of
continuing decline and a lack of confidence in his ability to manage the
economy.
He insisted he had to be 'a little careful about Fed bashing', but 'I don't
know of any president that would like to advocate higher interest rates -
and certainly I'm not one.'
The central bank, however, has preferred a cautious approach. It last
lowered the overnight federal funds rate on April 9 to 3.75 per cent from 4
per cent. In December it had cut the discount rate by a full percentage
point to 3.5 per cent. It was reported to have decided on a neutral stance
at the last meeting of its open market committee, in May.
Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, told Congress last week that considerable
progress towards price stability had been made, but that the bank 'fully
intends to guard against re-igniting inflation'.
Mr Bush's economic and political advisers are known to be concerned about
the halting economic recovery.
It is axiomatic that the president's re-election chances hinge in good part
on a more vigorous US expansion. The jump last month in unemployment - to
7.5 per cent - was precisely the sort of economic statistic that the
president does not need at present.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Argentina does debt deal with banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARGENTINE government and its leading bank creditors yesterday announced
they had reached a detailed agreement on a debt restructuring under the
Brady plan.
An outline agreement on Argentina's Dollars 23bn of medium-term
international bank debt and Dollars 8bn of interest arrears was reached in
April, and the detailed accord comes after two weeks of intense negotiations
in New York.
The final term sheet will be sent to all creditor banks shortly. Mr William
Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which heads the bank advisory committee,
said he expected the deal to be signed by September and completed by
year-end. However, there is no incentive payment, unlike in other Brady
deals, to encourage banks to sign early.
The menu available to banks is more limited than in any prior deal under the
Brady plan, the debt reduction initiative launched three years ago by Mr
Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary.
Argentina has resisted allowing banks the option of making new loans,
available for example in the Venezuelan and Mexican Brady deals. Banks have
only two choices: exchange their old loans for new 30-year bonds with a
discount to face value of 35 per cent, or exchange for 'par' bonds which
carry pre-set concessional interest rates. These bonds may be denominated in
dollars or D-Marks.
Bankers expressed concern last night that the freedom of choice of banks to
choose might be further restricted by multilateral agencies - the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which support Brady deals
with special financing. The agencies have indicated their support for the
deal is dependent on the right mix of reduction in debt service and in debt
principal.
Interest arrears will be treated separately, and Argentina has agreed to pay
interest on the past due interest.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Perot accuses Bush of dirty tricks campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS Perot yesterday bluntly accused President George Bush of
orchestrating a 'Republican dirty tricks committee' designed to discredit
his independent candidacy for the presidency.
Recent accusations against him would 'make Hitler's propaganda chief proud,'
Mr Perot said, adding that Mr Bush's anger over reports that the Texan
billionaire had investigated the president's family was 'a total act.' The
president, he said, was 'in charge of the whole process.'
Mr Perot's extraordinary tirade was vented in a television interview
yesterday morning, to be supplemented by a later news conference. Both
events had been hurriedly arranged to allow him to respond to a series of
recent reports that he had authorised investigations of the private lives of
public figures, including the Bush family.
He claimed that the spate of stories had come out now because the White
House thought he would announce his candidacy on his birthday, on Saturday,
and wanted to 'redefine' his personality.
'The good news is that this will hurt them, and hurt them badly, because the
American people are just furious with this little theatre programme they run
in Washington,' he said. Mr Perot's campaign telephone banks were
reverberating with public anger, he claimed.
Mr Perot's personal antipathy towards the president has never been a secret,
though he insisted yesterday he only had the 'warmest, kindest feelings'
towards Mr Bush and his family. He cited a 1986 letter from Mr Bush to thank
him for having brought to his attention rumours that Mr Bush's sons might
have been involved in the Iran-Contra affair.
But this disclaimer paled into insignificance when compared with the rest of
his remarks. It also drew a barbed response from Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the
White House spokesman, who said the letter had been written at a time when
Mr Bush considered Mr Perot a friend. 'I think he (Mr Perot) has taken care
of that now.'
The president himself, in a TV interview to be aired this week, described
the reports of Mr Perot's investigations of his family as 'beyond the pale,'
adding: 'Leave my kids alone, I say'. Governor Bill Clinton, the likely
Democratic party candidate, said Mr Bush was right in this.
More generally, Mr Perot has been under attack from left and right for
alleged disregard of civil liberties. His advisers had concluded that he
could not ignore all these charges and still maintain his populist campaign
for the White House.
Mr Perot did not deny yesterday that he had ordered private investigations
on occasion, in the course of his business dealings and as part of his
crusade to identify Americans missing in action or held as prisoners of war
in Indochina. He also conceded that he had his lawyers look into an oil
lease transaction in Texas alleged to have benefitted one of Mr Bush's
oldest associates. This, he said, was because he was considering buying a
parcel of the land involved.
'If you look at my whole life,' he declared. 'I have meticulously followed
the law. Anybody that knows me or knows anything about me would understand
that I would never even consider violating the great principles this country
is founded on. This is nothing but politics at its worst and lowest.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / EC set to approve subsidies for Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is likely to approve FFr6.6bn (Pounds 670m) of
French government subsidies aimed at returning Bull, the French computer
manufacturer, to profitability.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, will ask his
fellow-commissioners next week to clear the state aid. His investigation,
which began last July, found that the money would be used for genuine
restructuring and not simply to prop up an ailing company.
If Sir Leon had proposed blocking the aid he would almost certainly have
faced a fierce battle within the Commission, and a damaging row with the
French authorities at a sensitive time for relations between Brussels and
the member states.
The French government has already injected FFr2bn of fresh capital into
Bull, but to its annoyance the Commission's inquiry has held up a second
FFr2bn capital injection for nearly a year. Last month, Paris announced the
loss-making group would proceed with the second equity increase even though
the Commission had not approved it.
The Bull case has also prompted concern in the Commission about the alleged
sluggishness of Brussels' general competition inquiries, relative to merger
investigations, which are subject to a binding five-month deadline. Sir Leon
and his officials are already looking for ways to speed up their work.
Apart from the capital injection, Sir Leon's recommendation on Bull covers a
further FFr2.6bn of research funding and takes into account the FFr540m
investment in Bull by IBM, the US computer manufacturer, formalised last
month, and last year's investment by NEC, the Japanese electronics company.
That left the two companies with 5.68 per cent and 4.7 per cent of Bull
respectively.
Those agreements should help Bull realise its ambition of returning to
operating profitability by the end of this year and net profits by the end
of 1993. But Commission competition experts believe the combination of aid
and investment will not give Bull an unfair edge over its EC competitors.
The computer group's rivals are said to have raised few objections to the
French government's plan, which will involve heavy job losses and the
closure of several factories.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Germans urge rethink of European union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, QUENTIN PEEL and IAN DAVIDSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S employers and trade unions yesterday joined forces to urge the
European Community leaders meeting in Lisbon this week to answer growing
public doubts about the progress towards European union.
In a rare joint initiative, the two sides of German industry called for the
member states to push through the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, but
at the same time to face up to the 'visible fears and reservations in the
population at large'.
They warned that the Danish rejection of the treaty reflected a wider
backlash against 'a centralised, bureaucratic Europe, remote from its
inhabitants and lacking democratic legitimation'.
They called for 'further development' of the treaty to spell out the
principle of subsidiarity - maximum devolution of power away from the
centre. They also proposed a new inter-governmental conference to strengthen
democratic control and make EC decision-making more open to public scrutiny.
The declaration coincided with a highly critical analysis of the EC
agreement on economic and monetary union (Emu) delivered in London by Mr
Heinrich Weiss, president of the BDI, Germany's industrial federation, and
one of the signatories of the declaration. The others were the BDA, the
employers' federation, and the DGB, the trade union federation.
Mr Weiss suggested that many German employers had lost faith in Emu, and
would now prefer to postpone it until well into the next century.
Speaking at the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures
and Commerce, he said that Europe was not economically 'mature' enough for
monetary union. When it was finally introduced, it should be 'the last
stone, and not the first, in the edifice of integration'.
The BDI has traditionally been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of
economic and monetary integration among Europe's employers' organisations,
and Mr Weiss' open hostility to speedy economic union will be taken as a
further sign of a general cooling in public enthusiasm towards Emu in
Germany.
'The speed of integration has been too fast,' Mr Weiss said, adding in an
apparent side-swipe at Chancellor Helmut Kohl: 'There are too many
politicians who want to go into the history books as architects of the new
Europe.'
In the latest German opinion poll on the subject, carried out by the
Allensbach Institute, some 62 per cent of ordinary citizens said they did
not believe the European currency would be as stable as the D-Mark. Among
civic and business leaders, that proportion was higher, at 69 per cent.
Chancellor Kohl will be arguing strongly in Lisbon for some sort of
clarification or declaration on the principle of subsidiarity, which should
also help him satisfy the doubts of the 16 federal states in Germany,
anxious at what they see is an erosion of their local authority through
European union.
Popular support for the Maastricht Treaty has weakened in France, according
to an opinion survey which gives 54 per cent in favour and 44 per cent
against, Ian Davidson reports. The previous survey conducted by the CSA
polling organisation for Le Parisien newspaper in early June, gave 69 per
cent in favour and only 31 per cent against.
However, there has been a wide variation in the findings of different
polling organisations on the Maastricht issue, although, in every case,
supporters outnumber opponents.
The abstention rate may account for the difference and could easily
determine the result when the French vote in a referendum on the treaty,
probably in September. Yesterday's poll points to an increase in the numbers
who expect to stay at home, from 42 per cent in early June, to 50 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Moldovans warned on TransDnestr air attacks: Russian 14th

OFFICIALS from the Russian 14th army yesterday issued a warning that future
Moldovan aircraft attempting to attack civilian or military facilities in
the TransDnestr region would be shot down on sight.
The army statement came after Moldovan forces on Monday night strafed the
TransDnestr forces using three MiG aircraft.
At the same time, officials estimate that nearly 100,000 refugees have fled
the war-torn TransDnestr area as the fighting for the strategic city of
Bendery on the right bank of the Dnestr river continued yesterday.
Dnestr authorities say that hunger and disease threaten besieged Bendery,
where the exchange of sniper fire has disabled the city's main bakery.
The long running conflict between Moldova and the separatist TransDnestr
region, which fears that its parent republic will unite with Romania,
erupted over the weekend when Moldova temporarily seized the city. Over the
last few days Bendery has been transformed into a battleground where more
than 1,000 have been killed or wounded.
Backed by the Russian 14th army, Dnestr forces retook the city. Moldova
struck back again on Monday night, using three MiG airplanes to bomb the
TransDnestr line.
At a meeting scheduled to be held in Istanbul today, Russia, Ukraine,
Moldova and Romania are planning to discuss the TransDnestr conflict. Mr
Igor Smirnov, president of the breakaway republic, yesterday said he
welcomed Ukraine's recent decision to support his republic and expected
Ukraine and Russia to back the TransDnestr position at the meeting.
Mr Smirnov called on the 14th army to give his troops increased support and
warned that 'the people are demanding that we turn our artillery on
Kishinyov. If it is war, then let it be war.'
According to Mr Vasyl Muranets, chief border guard at the main crossing into
Ukraine, 80,000 have fled the carnage into neighbouring Ukraine.
Mr Alexander Narolsky, head of the TransDnestr government's evacuation
committee said the border guard's figure was a conservative estimate.
Mrs Nadiesda Osefian, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, is one of the newest
refugees. Yesterday morning, she left behind her husband in Bendery. He is a
telephone operator who will not leave his post.
'People are hiding in basements like rabbits,' said Mrs Osefian who fled
with only two dresses, a jacket, a bible and a small icon.

SLOVAKIA'S new cabinet will be dominated by hard-core nationalists after its
regional parliament yesterday approved the choices of Mr Vladimir Meciar,
the republic's new prime minister.
Eleven of 14 members of the cabinet will belong to Mr Meciar's Movement for
a Democratic Party in Slovakia, the eastern republic of Czechoslovakia,
which is on its way to independence following the strong showing of
nationalists in this month's elections.
Mr Meciar, whose party fell two seats short of an absolute majority in the
Slovak parliament, also appointed Mr Ludovik Cernak, a member of the
pro-independence Slovak National party as trade and economics minister.
The remaining two members of the Slovak cabinet claim to have no party
affiliation. They include Gen Jozef Tunycha, a former intelligence officer
in the Czechoslovak army named yesterday as Slovak interior minister.
Mr Lubomir Dolgos, the new Slovak privatisation minister, said yesterday
that 'the privatisation will continue in Slovakia but its negative effects
will be have to be corrected'.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Radical economic plan proposed for Italy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S prime minister-designate, Professor Giuliano Amato, yesterday
unveiled sweeping plans to tackle the country's huge public sector deficit
centring on cuts in welfare spending, a tighter rein on the state payroll
and greater accountability and autonomy for local authorities.
The plans were contained in a 23-page discussion paper delivered to the 16
parties represented in Italy's new parliament. Restoring the country's
public finances and bringing down inflation are the central elements in the
paper which seeks to provide a tight framework for Italy to comply with the
terms of the Maastricht treaty.
The 54-year-old deputy leader of the Socialist party, who was asked to form
a new government last Thursday by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, has
refrained from detailed proposals in order to obtain reactions from the
principal parties likely to support him. However, he is anxious to implement
essential measures as soon as possible.
The paper is an unusual example of strategic thinking and takes account of
all the criticisms directed at Italy's faltering economic and political
structure by its EC partners.
According to Prof Amato, the next government must address four essential
issues: the public sector deficit; electoral reform; organised crime; and a
clean-up of morality in public life.
On the economy, the paper says urgent decisions are necessary to curb public
spending, especially the generous pensions scheme, public health subsidies
and civil service employment. It also singles out the need to reform taxes,
limiting progressive taxation, and ending some tax holidays while making
collection more efficient.
However, Prof Amato says short-term measures such as a mini-budget must be
quickly accompanied by structural reform, reducing labour rigidities,
creating more competition, and privatisation.
So far he only has the backing of the four-party outgoing coalition led by
the Christian Democrats. This gives him a 16-seat majority in the 630-seat
chamber of deputies but is insufficient for such a radical plan.
However, Yesterday Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of
Italy, reminded the politicians yet again that time was running out. Talking
to the Italian bankers' association, he said the Bank had managed in the
past two weeks to protect the lira but the wave of speculation against the
currency had made quick action ever more pressing.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Shevardnadze puts down coup attempt in Georgia

<TEXT>
MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, survived a coup attempt in
Tbilisi yesterday after a battle in which loyal troops recaptured television
studios held by armed rebels loyal to the deposed president, Mr Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
The Georgian president then flew to the Black Sea and initialled an
agreement to stop the ethnic conflict in the breakaway region of South
Ossetia.
In the Georgian capital national guardsmen backed by tanks and helicopters
regained control of the TV building in an attack after a government
ultimatum ordered the insurgents to surrender within two hours or face an
assault. At least three were killed when guardsmen unleashed heavy barrages
of automatic weapon and tank fire at the rebels without waiting for the
government deadline.
Mr Patmary Adamishvili of the ruling State Council put the death toll from
the assault at three, with 26 hurt, but earlier put the toll at 40.
The government said the leaders of the short-lived rebellion, including a
top Gamsakhurdia lieutenant, had been placed under arrest. The rebels, put
at 300, seized the TV tower in the early hours of yesterday morning and
called for the return of Mr Gamsakhurdia, now in exile in the Russian
republic of Chechenia.
After the coup attempt Mr Shevardnadze, flew to the Black Sea resort of
Dagonmys and concluded an agreement with Russian president Boris Yeltsin
aimed at ending the conflict in the breakaway autonomous republic of south
Ossetia. Mr Shevadnadze said the coup had been partly aimed at preventing
him holding the talks.
'We have signed an agreement on the principles of regulating the
Georgian-Ossetian conflict, which includes everything, a ceasefire, mutual
co-operation and so on,' Mr Yeltsin said before signing the pact yesterday.
The Russian president was quoted in a pool report filed by western
correspondents from the Russian Black Sea resort. Mr Yeltsin said the two
sides would send buffer troops to separate the warring factions on the
borders of South Ossetia, which is part of Georgia.
South Ossetians want to merge with their ethnic kin in Russia's North
Ossetia. Leaders of South and North Ossetia took part in the meeting between
the Russian and Georgian leaders.
'In principle we have agreed over the next month to prepare a large
political treaty between Georgia and Russia,' Mr Yeltsin said. The package
of documents would propose measures to stop the conflict and end bloodshed,
he said.
The republic has suffered from increasingly bitter fighting in recent
months.

FT  25 JUN 92 / French watchdog sinks teeth in government
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S official accounting watchdog, the Cour des Comptes, yesterday
warned that public financial waste could not be curbed unless the government
took more notice of its recommendations.
The court could only be useful 'on condition that its conclusions. . . . are
taken up actively by the government and parliament,' said Mr Pierre
Arpaillange, the watchdog's president, in its annual report on
inefficiencies in France's huge public sector. This is the first time the
court has openly complained about being ignored.
Court officials estimate less than a third of their suggestions lead to
parliamentary action, well below the 95 per cent which their UK counterpart,
the National Audit Office, says it achieves. 'The government has proclaimed
its desire to fight corruption, so it should take our reports into account,'
said Mr Arpaillange. If not, it should give reasons for rejecting them, he
said.
Among the 28 examples of inefficiency in the report are inadequate financial
control of international co-operation accords by state-owned defence
equipment suppliers, which absorbed FFr7.4bn (Pounds 750m) of French
taxpayers' money in 1990. There is no central register of the 160 accords
the court has managed to track down, nor any system of measuring
performance, it says.
The court also highlights alleged property frauds at the Institut de France
state cultural academy; criticises marketing at Bull, the state-owned
computer company; and highlights inefficiencies created by European farm
subsidies.
The study highlights several examples of alleged dishonesty in public health
spending, including a private clinic which wrongly charged the government
for FFr4.5m-worth of operations.
Established in 1807, the court has wide investigative powers, but almost no
policing authority. A committee of senior civil servants was set up in the
1970s to put pressure on ministers to act on the court's suggestions, but
has not met for 10 years, say court officials.
The government last year set up an interministerial committee to discuss the
court's findings. It is due to meet for the first time later this year.
SUCCESS on industrial export markets helped France record a FFr4.5bn (Pounds
450m) trade surplus in May, bringing the surplus over the previous 12 months
to FFr9.4bn, the best result for 20 years. This is the fifth monthly surplus
in a row and puts the trade account on track to break even or make a small
surplus for the year, said Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry and foreign
trade minister. He attributed the turnround, from a FFr30bn deficit for the
whole of last year, to low inflation making French industrial goods
competitive on export markets.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Tobacco ruling to allow some injury suits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday ruled that suits can be brought against
tobacco companies under individual states' product liability laws, giving
the green light for some types of personal injury claim.
Ambiguities in the judgment, however, allowed both the tobacco industry and
the anti-smoking lobby to hail the court's 7-2 decision as a victory.
The ruling overturns the industry's claim that such suits should be barred
because federal law requires that cigarette packets carry health warnings on
the risks of smoking. Congress passed cigarette labelling laws in 1965 and
1969.
The decision comes in the context of a long-running case brought by Mrs Rose
Cipollone against three tobacco companies, after she had a cancerous lung
removed in 1983.
The Supreme Court justices expressed a range of views over what type of
claims could be brought under state liability laws.
The majority concluded that some of the claims brought in the Cipollone case
 -for example, that the defendants had failed to warn adequately about the
health dangers of smoking and fraudulently misrepresented the risks - were
precluded by the federal labelling law.
However, they also said that claims brought on other grounds - such as
intentional misrepresention by the tobacco companies - should be allowed to
proceed.
Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday affirmed its debt ratings for US-based tobacco
groups. 'Although the decision could result in a greater number of liability
filings against cigarette manufacturers, and an increase in legal expenses,
we believe it will take a considerable amount of time before the court
decision would affect creditor protection, if at all,' said the large Wall
Street rating agency.
In London, shares in BAT Industries initially fell 38p, but rallied later to
close 26p down on the day at 731p. Rothmans International was 19p lower at
1,091p.
In New York, shares in RJR Nabisco fell to Dollars 8 3/8 at one stage, but
recovered to close down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 3/8 . Philip Morris closed
up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 73 3/4 .
Philip Morris, whose brands include Marlboro, claimed that the decision was
'a significant victory'. It noted the court had held that smokers cannot sue
on the grounds that they were not adequately warned of the risks of smoking
once the 1969 legislation had been enacted.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK wins EC working hours deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK last night reached a compromise with its EC partners on European
Community limits to working time which it had previously said it could never
accept.
But final agreement was held up by a Franco-German dispute over the number
of months during which the proposed 48-hour limit on the working week should
be averaged.
The compromise came at a meeting in Luxembourg of ministers responsible for
working conditions.
Under the compromise, Britain secured a partial opt-out on introducing the
48-hour maximum working week. It would get a 10-year grace period, while the
other 11 EC member states must introduce the measure within three years.
In Britain's case, the EC council of ministers would 'review' the situation
after its additional seven-year grace period, leaving open the question of
whether the UK adopts it even at that stage.
But Britain would for the first time have to provide legal protection for
workers who do not want to work more than 48 hours and to bring in
legislation on mandatory time off.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK employment secretary, said: 'In a word, we've won.
I had to make on concessions whatsoever.'
She said that legislation the UK would have to enact to conform with the
planned EC directive was still 'a long way off' and that Britain had
'slashed the costs' of introducing it.
Despite her claim of victory, Mrs Shepard added: 'We have not ruled out. . .
the possibility of legal challenge' to the directive. The UK insists the EC
measure should not have been tabled under health and safety regulations,
which allow majority voting and override national vetoes.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour opposition's employment spokesman, said 'the
British government has been forced to concede much on the working-time
directive that will benefit British employees'.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary hailed 'a major step forward for the
UK and a major climbdown by the government'.
The compromise followed negotiations on Tuesday between Mrs Shephard and Ms
Martine Aubry, the French labour minister.
Although a deal was not finalised, this did not overshadow member states'
efforts to demonstrate unity in the face of current uncertainty over the
Maastricht treaty on the eve of tomorrow's EC summit in Lisbon.
Final passage of the EC directive will now be stewarded by the UK presidency
of the Community, which begins next week. Ms Vasso Papandreou, the EC social
affairs commissioner, said how the UK handled the issue 'will be a test of
the British presidency and whether it acts impartially'.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Leaves learn to make vaccines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE humble cowpea plant is nurturing a potentially far-reaching medical
advance which could help prevent Aids and other infectious diseases.
The plant, which produces the black-eyed bean, is being used to produce
animal and human vaccines.
The first experimental vaccines, against foot-and-mouth disease and Aids,
are growing in a greenhouse at the John Innes Centre in Norwich.
If these experiments are successful, the manufacture of vaccines for a wide
range of diseases could be transformed.
The drugs industry would make immense savings because growing plants is far
cheaper than today's methods which use live animals or cell cultures.
Patients would also benefit from cheaper plant-grown vaccines, especially in
developing countries, because, being more stable, they could be stored for
years without refrigeration.
The plant vaccine system has been developed by Agricultural Genetics Company
(AGC) of Cambridge in collaboration with Prof Jack Johnson of Purdue
University, Indiana, and Dr George Lomonossoff of the John Innes Centre.
Details will be announced at a scientific meeting of the Royal Society in
London next week.
The scientists hope to be able to use it to produce vaccines for other
diseases, including hepatitis and the common cold.
The first vaccine, for foot-and-mouth disease, is already giving promising
results on guinea pigs at the Institute of Animal Health in Surrey. Tests on
a second plant-grown vaccine - against HIV - are now under way.
The system is based on the cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The scientists
discovered that its structure is particularly well suited to genetic
engineering. They have hooked antibody-stimulating proteins from animal
viruses on to exposed 'loops' on the surface of CPMV.
In animals, natural CPMV produces the strong immune response that is
essential for successful vaccination. But, as a plant virus, CPMV cannot
actually infect animals. This should make it safe for use in humans.
AGC's production system involves infecting cowpea seedlings with genetically
activated CPMV and harvesting the plants after two weeks to extract viral
particles, which are then formulated into a vaccine.
Each cowpea leaf contains enough material to make 200 doses of
foot-and-mouth disease vaccine.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Rabin calls for partners committed to peace
</HEADLINE>

   JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister-elect, yesterday capitalised on
the Labour party's triumphant return to power in the country's election on
Tuesday by calling for coalition partners who share his commitment to Middle
East peace talks.
The US yesterday pushed for a speedy resumption of the peace talks, while
most Arab and Palestinian leaders welcomed Mr Rabin's victory.
However, Jewish settlers, still building in occupied Arab lands, vowed
yesterday to block Mr Rabin's plans for Palestinian autonomy within nine
months.
'We are against autonomy in the strongest of terms. It is a precursor to a
Palestinian state,' said settler spokesman Bob Lang. 'We will fight by every
democratic means possible that it should never happen.'
Labour's win over Mr Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party left Mr Rabin, premier in
the mid-1970s, in a commanding position with 45 seats against Likud's 32.
With the support of Labour's traditional small party allies in the Knesset
(parliament) he found himself in the unexpected position of leading a
majority government without having to forge costly deals.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said he hoped the next round of
bilateral peace talks would take place 'just as soon as it is conveniently
possible in the aftermath of the formation of a new government'.
The last round ended in Washington in April. Although the Arab and Israeli
participants have agreed to hold the next round in Rome, no date has yet
been fixed.
The Likud was consigned to opposition for the first time since 1977, unless
it was prepared to join Mr Rabin as a junior partner on Labour's terms. The
Labour leader has often signalled that he favoured an alliance with Likud,
but the vanquished party showed little sign of accepting what would be a
humiliating deal.
Likud ministers and officials went to ground yesterday, offering almost no
comment to the media on the election. Earlier, Mr Shamir hinted that he
might soon retire, saying he was near the end of his 'personal road'.
Egypt said the result could give a 'strong push to peace efforts and the
reaping of a golden opportunity to achieve historic reconciliation between
Israel and the Arabs'.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation,
said Israelis had voted 'against war and the terrorism of Shamir'. Mrs Hanan
Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian negotiating team, said she hoped Mr
Rabin would move quickly to fulfil his pledge to reach a speedy interim
settlement allowing Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
Mr Rabin did move quickly to revive an issue which earlier this year caused
an unprecedented rift between Israel and the US. He said he hoped his
willingness to curb Jewish settlements in the occupied territories would
prompt the US to release Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees Israel wants to
help it finance the absorption of more than 300,000 immigrants from the
former Soviet Union.
However, Mr Rabin said he was not prepared to freeze all settlements, the
price Washington had demanded for the loan aid.
Mr Baker said it was better 'not to speculate or engage in questions like
(the loan guarantees)' until a new Israeli government had actually been
formed.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Lloyd's attacked by Names over Pounds 2bn 1989 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON came under sustained criticism from the Names whose assets
provide the market's capital base at its annual general meeting yesterday,
when losses of Pounds 2.06bn for the 1989 year were announced.
An estimated 5,200 Names, nearly a sixth of the insurance market's
membership in 1989, attended the meeting, held at its City headquarters, and
dozens spoke out in a meeting lasting a record 6 hours 6 minutes.
But although many were fiercely critical of Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's
chairman, and the governing council, the meeting was generally
good-tempered, with very little heckling.
Mr Valentine Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members,
the biggest Names' organisation, which represents over 9,000 Names, said
afterwards: 'The meeting was held in a more constructive manner than
generally expected.'
Mr Coleridge fielded questions in a marathon 5 hour 20 minute session during
which the harshest attacks came from Names on syndicates which participated
in 'spiral' reinsurance business, in which syndicates and London market
companies reinsure each other's catastrophe exposures.
Mr John Harris, one of over 4,000 Names on the lossmaking Gooda Walker
syndicates, for example, said: 'Some of us put our trust in the history and
reputation of this institution and we feel totally betrayed.'
Gooda Walker's losses amount to Pounds 491m, nearly a quarter of the total.
Mr Harris received warm applause when he said that he had been offered
totally 'irresponsible advice' by the Gooda &amp; Partners agency - which was
part of the Gooda Walker empire - to become a member of several 'spiral'
syndicates.
Another Gooda Name, Mr Michael Deeny, said that Lloyd's had 'failed to
regulate the market and allowed the disastrous growth of the spiral'.
'We had hoped you might acknowledge some level of responsibility for what
has happened,' added Mr Deeny, who said that Gooda Walker Names were victims
of 'at best gross negligence and at worst fraud'.
Mr Coleridge himself bitterly criticised the performance of Gooda Walker and
Feltrim 'spiral' syndicates, whose losses had 'crucified Names'. Lloyd's
would 'not flinch' from taking action once a number of reports into the
circumstances of these losses were complete.
Many Names criticised Lloyd's for the imposition of a levy on the Central
Fund, which will cost them an average of Pounds 20,000 a head, while others
focused on the Council's rejection of a bail-out scheme to help the hardest
hit Names. In his opening address, Mr Coleridge reported that Pounds 398m of
the Pounds 2.06bn loss had occurred because of a continuing influx of United
States pollution and asbestos-related claims. 'Huge uncertainty continues to
surround the outcome on pollution claims,' he added.
Mr Coleridge faces a further grilling this week from a delegation of about
40 members of parliament. According to Lloyd's, invitations were issued to
all 651 MPs.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (13): Hassle-free perks - Developments in
leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken 11 years, but the British government's determined effort to tax
the company-provided executive car out of existance is now bearing fruit.
Very many UK companies are now thinking about offering managers cash
instead.
But, given that most executive cars are non-essential 'perks' provided as
part of a package to attract the most suitable candidates for senior
management jobs, companies know they must tread warily.
While many companies would prefer to get out of the business of car
provision entirely, they recognise they must offer alternatives which take
the 'hassle factor' out of personal car ownership.
This is where employee car leasing schemes come in. These schemes aim to
give individual employees access to the economies of scale in car purchase,
maintenance and administration more typically associated with fleet
operation rather than individual ownership.
So today, fleet managers are not just considering which method best suits
their organisation when executive cars must be acquired, they are also
having to deal with the complexities involved with 'cash for cars' schemes
or whether they should support personal leasing plans.
Mr Colin Grant-Wilson, managing director of Lease Plan, says that employee
leasing, from the employee's point of view, is of particular relevance to
people who have 'perk' company cars, have relatively high-cost company cars
and who have to pay higher rates of marginal taxation.
He suggests that personal leasing schemes would have been introduced very
quickly if the UK had elected a Labour party government which then had
implemented the personal tax changes promised before the recent general
election. Because the Conservative party was re-elected, the immediate
pressure for change has been eased slightly.
'Personal leasing will eventually be an important part of the company car
scene. But it will take time. Not many companies are prepared to be
pioneers,' suggests Mr Grant-Wilson.
Those companies willing to push forward rapidly are offering support to
leasing companies in various ways - such as deducting from salaries the
employee's payment to the leasing company and acting as guarantor should an
employee default on payments or leave the company.
However, the Inland Revenue has yet to decide whether such an agreement is
sufficiently at arm's length from the employee and that the car is not a
company car by another name and therefore liable to company car tax.
Because of grey areas such as this, Lease Plan is still some months away
from finalising details of its own personal leasing schemes.
Mr Grant-Wilson says that, when they arrive, the new programmes will allow
companies wishing to move from a company car scheme to manage effectively
the transition to an employee leasing arrangement.
'In this way, continuity of benefit levels will be maintained and employers
deciding to discontinue or reduce their company car schemes will have the
assurance that their employees have a viable alternative which will not
expose them to the full economic risk of operating an individual car. As
with a company scheme, Lease Plan would underwrite the residual value and
maintenance budgets and so provide fixed-cost motoring for the individual.'
There will still be some drawbacks. For example, leasing companies will have
to recover their higher administrative costs, associated with handling a
large number of individual customers. Charges would also have to reflect the
fact that individuals are usually not such good credit risks as
corporations.
It is worth recalling that the 'perk' cars era started because companies in
the 1960s and 1970s were looking for other ways to reward employees because
high personal taxes made simple pay increases relatively unattractive.
The government's counter-attack started in 1979 when it said it aimed to
reduce the UK's personal tax rates but, to compensate, it also wanted to
eliminate the provision of 'perks' being handed out in lieu of extra pay.
The screw has now tightened to the extent that, according to Mr Tony
Vernon-Harcourt of Monks Partnership, the remuneration advisers, 10 to 15
per cent of UK companies will probably cease to provide executive cars and
give managers cash instead. These typically will be the financial
institution with a small number of highly-paid staff who all do low annual
mileages or US-owned companies who dislike the UK company car system on
principle. Another 25 per cent of companies will include a cash alternative
among the choices offered to senior people, he suggests.
There are other clear trends in the company car sector: the cars provided
are generally getting smaller, companies are keeping them longer and there
is a small but steady shift away from companies buying cars outright - still
the most popular method of acquisition.
Mr Vernon-Harcourt suggests that this trend has probably been accelerated by
the recession and the lack of availability of funds. With the banks
reluctant to stump up new loans, companies are prefering to use the
financial facilities available to them for other things apart from cars.
This year's budget again increased the amount of income tax which
individuals must pay for the benefit of using a company car. The budget
might also affect companies' acquisition policies because it raised from
Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 the limit on the cost of cars above which
capital allowances and tax relief for lease rental payments are restricted.
This makes contract purchase schemes relatively less attractive because
these were developed in response to demands from customers wanting to avoid
the Pounds 8,000 rental write-off restrictions.
Conversely, it should increase demand for contract hire because the entire
contract hire rental on cars costing up to Pounds 12,000 - which covers the
bulk of vehicles bought by fleets - can now be offset against pre-tax
profits as an allowable business expense.
This important change does not really have an impact on executive cars which
cost more than Pounds 12,000. The Pounds 8,000 limit was fixed in 1973 when
that sum would have bought an executive car. To have kept pace with
inflation the chancellor would have had to lift the limit to Pounds 22,000.
Contract purchase also continues to offer real benefits to those companies
or organisations - such as banks and insurance companies - which have
difficulty clawing back any VAT they pay. Under the terms of a contract
purchase scheme, companies avoid paying VAT on the purchasing component (but
not on the service and maintenance element).
The primary disadvantage with contract purchase is that, as it has been
developed from hire purchase, a deposit must be paid up front.
Some companies use lease purchase - another name for hire purchase - when
acquiring company cars. This method enables the vehicle to be bought for a
nominal sum at the end of the contract period. In contrast, with finance
leasing, the leasing company is the legal owner of the car and must bear all
the operating risks.
Also on offer as a method of acquisition is contract hire, which is a lease
under which a contract hire company provides specific services in addition
to finance and carries certain risks, mainly the risk associated with a
car's residual value.
Fleet management contracts remove from the fleet user the administrative
burden of running company cars and keeps costs under tight control.
But financing of cars is quite separate from their management - this might
cause administration complications - and all the operating costs and
residual value risks remain with the fleet user.
The car leasing companies so far have been carefully tailoring their
contracts to suit the demands of their customers within the constraints of a
changing tax system. Those customers have been corporations.
Now, like the company fleet manager, the leasing groups are having to
re-think their position and consider how they might develop contracts to
suit individuals as well.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (10): Mercedes expects standstill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES, balancing short-term expectations of a revival in export markets
this year with a 9 per cent fall in domestic new car registrations, expects
its passenger car business to stand still during 1992.
And no-one is prepared to make forecasts over a longer term.
The Japanese quality motor market remains unstable, the rest of western
Europe shows faint signs of recovery, and the US a modest reversal of the
catastrophic slump.
Mercedes group sales in the US rose 18 per cent in the first four months of
this year while the overall market rose by only 2 per cent.
'In spite of this, there is no reason for excessive euphoria,' said Mr
Werner Niefer, group president.
Mercedes sales last year fell 25 per cent as the US market reached its
lowest level since 1982, and the current upturn marked no more than a
gradual return to normal.
'Unfortunately,' Mr Niefer added. 'We cannot expect help from the Japanese
market either.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (11): Only one way to go - US makers' plans
for exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FEAST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICA'S Big Three car makers are waking up to the idea of exporting to
Europe once more. The sales numbers are still small, but their commitments
mean there is only one way to go: up.
Several factors are behind the change, not the least of which is the
decision by some of Japan's North American car transplants to start
exporting.
If Honda and Mitsubishi can sell American-made cars in Japan and Europe, so
can General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
At the same time, tumbling American sales and the increasing share of the
vehicle market taken by Japanese companies have left the Big Three with
excess vehicle-building capacity.
Exports would help fill those production lines once again.
Underlying all this is America's huge imbalance in trade. Sixty per cent of
last year's Dollars 66bn deficit was attributable to cars and components.
The Big Three recognise they have to reduce the imbalance.
Chrysler, by far the smallest of the trio, is making the most progress. It
sold 44,200 vehicles in Europe last year, way ahead of the 16,000 North
American imports by General Motors and 13,000 by Ford.
In a market of 13.44m, they are hardly numbers which will concern sales
leaders such as Volkswagen and Fiat. But US plans call for big sales
increases of North American-made vehicles in Europe, and that represents a
change of direction.
GM and Ford have always sold handfuls of transatlantic imports alongside the
cars and trucks they make locally. They never put much effort into promoting
them because, historically, the policy was to build cars where they are
sold.
That is still very much the case - and one being followed today by Japan's
car makers as they establish manufacturing and design presences in Europe.
Ford's North American numbers were led by the Probe coupe, mainly in Germany
as a rival to the VW Corrado and Opel Calibra. More recently, it started
selling the Explorer four-wheel-drive sports-utility.
The company's primary purpose is to plug gaps in Ford of Europe's model
line-up. Even so, it reckons it could triple today's European sales to
50,000 by the middle of the decade.
Certainly Ford's next export promises to be more significant. It is the
replacement for the Probe, which goes on sale in America next month and in
Germany later this year.
It will not arrive in Britain until next year, but it will have right hand
drive.
But even Probe is not a pure Ford. It is based on the Mazda MX6 and is made
in Michigan by Mazda, in which Ford is a 24 per cent shareholder. To that
extent, it could be categorised as an export by a Japanese transplant in
North America.
General Motors makes no bones about European sales expectations for future
North American models. Mr Richard Lee, the executive in charge of exports,
recently said he wants them to reach 125,000 by the middle of the decade.
The task seems to devolve on Saturn and a new generation minivan - the type
of people-carrier which Renault popularised in Europe with the Espace.
Mr 'Skip' LeFauve, president of GM's recently-formed Saturn division, has
always maintained that exports must be a central part of the strategy. All
that is missing so far is a date.
But it will be a brave development. Saturn is a range of medium-sized
saloons, coupes and estate cars which would compete directly with GM's
established European brands, Opel and Vauxhall.
In the main, the American companies are concentrating on model types that
are not widely available in Europe, such as off-road sports-utilities and
minivans.
GM's new minivan, due in 1995, is expected to be sold by GM's Vauxhall
dealers in Britain and by Opel in mainland Europe. In this way, GM will fill
a neglected European market niche as well as its production lines in
America.
Chrysler's European approach has had to be different. Forced to abandon the
region in 1970 by bigger troubles back home, it sold its former Rootes and
Simca factories in Britain, France and Spain to Peugeot. It was a
transaction which turned the French group into Europe's market leader.
Chrysler may have been out of Europe for a decade but it was not idle.
During the absence, it solved its financial problems, launched a vehicle
which revolutionised the American market, and bought American Motors -
makers of the world-famous Jeep - from Renault.
The new model was the minivan. Together with the similar vehicles which GM,
Ford and the Japanese were forced to bring out, Chrysler's minivan has
practically killed the estate car in America.
It has also become the cornerstone of Chrysler's manufacturing return to
Europe. Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman, and Chancellor Franz Vranitzky of Austria
were among the dignitaries who recently dedicated the Graz factory which now
produces Voyagers.
The enterprise, known as Eurostar, is a 50-50 joint venture with
Steyr-Daimler-Puch. it will be making 50,000 Voyagers a year by 1994-95.
Voyager and the Jeep ranges have spearheaded Chrysler's European sales
drive.
America's sudden interest in exports is not confined to Europe. It needs to
sell more to Japan - and that requires making right-hand-drive vehicles.
The country's car makers have until recently been reluctant to do so,
although the picture is now changing. As it does, new market opportunities
will open up in Britain, Australia and the many other countries around the
world which drive on the left.
Chrysler has already engineered some current models for right hand drive,
and says all future models will be. GM and Ford are thinking along the same
lines.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (9): Free-for-all is over - Speed Limits and
the Autobahns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was July 19, 1986, on the A5 autobahn between Frankfurt and Kassel. A
Porsche 911 was flying up the outside lane at 180 kph when a red BMW swerved
out of the central lane into its path.
What happened next may well come to be seen as the deciding moment in the
lingering sacrifice of one of Germany's most sacred cows: the right to drive
at speeds without limit on the open roads.
The Porsche driver slammed on his brakes, skidded, and crashed into a car
and caravan in the slow lane. The caravan broke free and collided into a
stationary Opel Kadett on the hard shoulder. Both occupants of the Opel were
injured.
The red BMW was never traced, so the injured parties decided to sue the
Porsche driver for damages. Last March, in court number six of the Federal
Supreme Court in Karlsruhe, the judge decided they were right. Because the
Porsche driver was not observing the 'recommended maximum speed' of 130 kph,
he was partly liable for damages, he ruled.
'The free-for-all on the roads is over,' the newspapers declared. '130 kph
has come through the back door.'
The roads lobby refused to be moved.
Mr Gunther Krause, the Minister of Transport, insisted that 'a general speed
limit on the autobahns is not necessary.'
A spokesman for Mercedes-Benz declared: 'The case has no effect on the speed
limit.'
But few others would agree. Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the state
of Lower Saxony, criss-crossed by main transit routes, said: 'The time of
unrestricted, reckless driving on Germany's roads is over.'
The lack of a speed limit on Germany's open roads - it is the last member
state of the European Community without one - has causes which lie buried
somewhere between a national machismo for aggressive driving, the elevation
of the motor car, and above all the highly-tuned varieties, to the ultimate
status symbol, and the lobbying power of the mighty motor industry.
Against all the evidence advanced by neighbouring states, the German
government refuses to accept that speed limits would improve road safety, or
reduce atmospheric pollution.
The opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), as well as the Greens, have
stepped up their campaigning for a change. Mr Klaus Lennartz, deputy
environment spokesman for the SPD in parliament, cites opinion polls showing
that 71 per cent of the population is now in favour of a speed limit.
In an urgent appeal to Chancellor Helmut Kohl last February, Mr Lennartz
called for his personal support to introduce a general limit. He cited
steadily rising accident tolls on the autobahns (as opposed to all German
roads) since 1985, including the numbers fatally injured.
He quoted evidence to show that noxious exhaust emissions - even with German
catalytic converters - increase at an exponential rate with faster speeds.
And he said that although only 1.4 per cent of the German road network was
actually without a speed limit, that same tiny proportion carries 30 per
cent of all traffic movements, which consume an equivalent proportion of
overall petrol use.
The chancellor's office replied to the letter only three months later - and
two months after the Karlsruhe decision. Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, minister of
state, said that the government 'does not consider that rigid speed limits
are an appropriate means of improving road safety.'
He said that the cause of most accidents was not the absolute speed of the
vehicles involved, but the fact that they were travelling at 'a speed
unsuited to the prevailing traffic conditions.'
He said that the evidence available to the government did not suggest that
the introduction of a maximum speed limit of, say, 130 kph would have 'any
significant effect' in reducing energy consumption, and therefore no
appreciable effect in reducing noxious exhaust emissions.
The introduction of modern technology would be more important in improving
road safety, he said - a clear reflection of the arguments of the motor
industry. The car manufacturers maintain that high performance German cars
such as Porsches, BMWs and Mercedes would not be so well developed - or sell
so well on the world market - if there was not the demand generated by the
free-wheeling German motorways.
The latest eruption in an increasingly anguished debate is the suggestion
that the European Commission will soon be able to force Germany to toe the
speed-limited European line. Mr Karel van Miert, the transport commissioner
in Brussels, denies any such intention. But the threat has already aroused a
backlash.
In the present climate of resentment at excessive Brussels' 'interference'
in national preserves, Mr van Miert's caution is likely to continue. The
debate in Germany will therefore probably be decided in the confrontation
between the government, the motor industry, and the courts, with steadily
rising pressure from the environmentalists.
At the last meeting of Germany's annual traffic courts' assembly, Mr Roman
Herzog, president of the constitutional court, the country's ultimate legal
authority, spoke out in favour of a maximum speed limit 'if it is not fixed
too low. A speed of 130 kph is constitutionally OK.' But he also warned that
a speed limit which was not enforced would do more harm than good.
The legal argument is that German traffic regulations say that whatever the
speed limit, drivers must be 'constantly in control' of their vehicles.
It also says that they must drive at a speed 'appropriate' to traffic
conditions. And it says that a driver can only avoid damages for an
'unavoidable' accident - defined as one which an ideal driver, travelling at
a reasonable speed, would have been able to avoid.
Mr Hannskarl Salger, president of the traffic courts, believes that 170-180
kph is probably the 'sound barrier' of controllability for both driver and
vehicle.
The overwhelming body of legal opinion is now on the side of considering the
speed of vehicles in an accident as a clear contributory factor for damages.
That means that whatever the government and the roads lobby may or may not
decide, the chances are that German road hogs will now have to start paying
a stiff price for their speeding.
And that is why the sorry story on the A5 outside Frankfurt back in 1986 may
be seen as the coup de grace for free speeding on the autobahns.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (12): Fresh demands on designers - Innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY DANIELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The designer of the executive car finds himself increasingly surrounded by
pressures and constraints. In order to remain competitive, it is essential
that he strives to make his next car even more comfortable, better equipped
and safer.
For the first time, however, he is also under pressure to make it smaller
and lighter.
Audi's chairman has already said that the recently announced new Audi 80
will be the last of that company's cars to be heavier than its predecessor.
Mercedes managers admit that for all its apparent sales success, the current
S-class would have been smaller and lighter if they had begun work on it 18
months later.
Two factors are at work here. One is sheer social pressure. In a few years,
one senior car designer has suggested, it will be about as socially
acceptable to drive a large, heavy, thirsty car as it already is to wear a
wild fur coat.
The other factor is Corporate Average Fleet Economy (Cafe) - the official
test fuel consumption averaged across all the cars made by a company in a
given year.
Cafe targets have long been set (together with penalties for non-compliance)
in the US. They are about to be increased, and they may also be adopted in
Europe.
There are several engineering techniques available to improve fuel economy.
The problem is that the most easily available have been exploited already.
Ever since the energy crises of the 1970s, cars have had more efficient
engines, more gear ratios and better aerodynamics. The only thing left is
weight reduction.
It has become increasingly clear that significant weight savings can only be
achieved by abandoning current principles of car construction, and in
particular the sheet steel body.
Today's car structures have already been ruthlessly optimised by computer
analysis, yet cars are getting no lighter.
That is why so many leading car manufacturers are beginning to look very
seriously at aluminium as an alternative to steel.
The alternative lightweight material, plastic composite, is very much 'on
hold' because of today's emphasis on easy recycling.
Audi, working in conjunction with Alcoa, has actually committed itself to
part-aluminium construction for its next new model.
By reducing body structure weight by perhaps 30 per cent, aluminium opens
the possibility of a benign spiral of weight saving.
A lighter body implies a smaller engine to achieve the same performance,
driving throughout a lighter gearbox, with lighter brakes, and so on.
The only question is whether car designers will actually work in this
direction and so achieve better economy, or whether they will be tempted to
retain existing drivelines and turn the body weight saving into even better
performance. The social pressure argument, and the looming threat of
'European Cafe', suggests not.
Some designers also suggest that savings could be made by changing the shape
of the executive car. Most of them have been surprised by the success of
'one-box' designs such as the Renault Espace.
There is no doubt that executive cars designed along similar lines could
offer as much space as existing models, and more comfort and convenience, in
a more compact (but taller) shape.
The question is whether enough buyers would be prepared to abandon the trend
towards ever longer, lower but essentially conventional-looking models.
It is at least possible, therefore, that the executive car of the future may
look more different than it really is under the skin. It is certain, for
example, that nothing is likely to replace the reciprocating internal
combustion engine in the foreseeable future, although some engineers remain
enthusiastic about the long-term prospects of a 'hybrid' car with electric
drive and a very small gas turbine to provide the power generation.
A pure electric executive car seems most unlikely; the electric-car quota
soon to be demanded by US legislation is certain to be fulfilled by
city-runabout designs.
Transmissions are also unlikely to see any drastic change. The majority of
executive cars in 10 years' time are likely to have five-speed automatic
transmissions, although their control systems will have become much more
ingenious both in their ability to shift smoothly and to assess the driver's
style of progress and adapt to it.
This is just one of the many ways in which electronics will make cars easier
to drive and more comfortable.
Certainly, electronics will spread ever more from engine and transmission
management, where it already holds such sway, into chassis engineering.
Development departments everywhere are looking at means of exploiting
electronic control to achieve a smoother ride and more secure stability and
handling.
Many such developments will depend on the ability of systems to tolerate
faults without endangering safety, which is why engineers are concentrating
so hard on failure analysis, duplicated systems and the most secure means of
communication between different electronic modules.
This area of engineering interlinks with the other likely advance of the
coming decade, into intelligent guidance systems to assist the driver and
take an increasing share of the decision load.
Most big car companies can now demonstrate prototypes which are capable, for
example, of automatically tracking lane markings and of maintaining a safe
distance from the vehicle in front, enabling the car to be put 'on
autopilot'.
Such systems can interface with 'intelligent' roadside signs and other data
transmitters, and potentially also with other vehicles, to provide automatic
navigation. We are reaching the stage where such concepts, many of them
developed under the pan-European Prometheus programme, are beginning to look
really promising - so long as hardware prices can be contained and the
necessary standardisation of systems achieved.
Prometheus is about safety as well as convenience. Because most accidents
are in the final analysis the result of a driver being presented with one
more decision factor than he was able to cope with, such 'ergonomic
unloading' should make travel by car much safer.
It is certain, in fact, that apart from being much lighter, slightly smaller
and much more economical, the executive car of tomorrow will be far safer
and easier to drive.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (1): Challenge looms from Japan - Hints of

Stirrings of recovery in North America, the world's single most valuable
market for executive and luxury cars, are producing some cautious sighs of
relief in the boardrooms of Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Jaguar, BMW and other
European companies specialising in the sector.
Although total car sales in the US so far this year are responding only
sluggishly to President George Bush's efforts to prod life into the economy,
the executive sector appears to be pointing the way to sharper growth in the
future.
Thus Mercedes' US sales in the first five months of the year were up by 18
per cent, BMW's up by nearly a quarter and those of Jaguar - among the
companies hardest-hit last year - by more than a tenth.
More positively still, in May both Jaguar and Rolls-Royce reported a
doubling of sales compared with year-ago levels.
For most of the European companies, however, it is a case of one step
forward after two steps back: Mercedes' US sales dropped by one quarter last
year, for example, while Jaguar's sales fell by one half. Audi, Volkswagen's
executive car arm, is enjoying sales up nearly 20 per cent this year - but
only after seeing its sales nearly halved in 1991.
For a few European companies, there is not even the step forward: five
months into 1992, luxury sports car maker Porsche's US sales have sunk
further, to fewer than 2,000 units, compared with annual sales of up to
30,000 a year in the late 1980s.
On the surface, at least, the predictions now emerging from several of the
industry's leading forecasting groups suggest that the executive car
industry's problems should all soon be over. According to DRI-McGraw-Hill,
for example, the sector will remain the fastest growing one in North
America, at least until 1996, as a result of post-war 'baby boomers' moving
into middle-aged affluence and their disposable income rising as their
children leave home - a phenomenon being replicated, to a lesser extent, in
much of Europe.
For cars typified by Mercedes' mid-range 300 Series, Volvo's 700 Series and
BMW, DRI says it believes there is the potential for 60 per cent sales
growth in the US over the next five years or so.
The growth forecast is far from confined to North America, however. On DRI's
projections, all the leading car producing nations of the world will soon be
starting a sharp upturn which by 1996 should see global car sales of a
record 40m units, some 21 per cent above last year's level.
There are good reasons, however, for the subdued, cautious air in the
western industry's boardrooms.
If the European companies are starting to enjoy renewed growth in North
America, their Japanese rivals are, for the most part, enjoying more. While
everyone else lost sales last year, Nissan's Infiniti, Toyota's Lexus
executive and luxury car franchises actually added sales, as did Honda's
Acura operation. In the first five months of this year, Lexus sales have
risen by more than 70 per cent and Infiniti's by nearly 40 per cent.
Europe has yet to feel anything like the full force of Japanese competition
in the executive and luxury sectors.
Japanese manufacturers are taking a 'softly, softly' approach to gaining
share in an area of the market which traditionally has provided Europe's
indigenous producers with high profit per unit.
The European industry knows, however, that in the longer term it faces a
challenge within Europe no less severe than that already being experienced
in North America.
Later this year, Toyota and Honda will join Nissan in producing cars in the
UK. The production of all three, however, is targeted at the volume car
market, giving the Japanese producers the flexibility to import many more
high-value cars from Japan, without seriously running foul of the EC-Japan
'understanding' under which Japan will continue to market cars 'prudently'
throughout the transition to an open market.
Whereas only a few years ago chief executives of companies such as BMW and
Mercedes were prone to put on a bold front about such competition, implying
that the Japanese industry would not be able to match the Europeans in areas
such as design sophistication and engineering integrity, the mood now is
sharply different.
Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of BMW, now accuses the Japanese industry
of 'an aggressive policy of conquering markets, creating a scenario of
ruinous competition everywhere.'
In perhaps the most outspoken attack on the Japanese industry made by a
senior German motor industry executive, he attributed the Europeans'
problems in the US market 'not to the products as such, but rather to the
prices of our cars - particularly when other manufacturers dump their
products below cost'.
German concern is being heightened both by the immediate sales prospects for
Europe and by the fact that costs are becoming an acute worry within
Germany. While some big markets such as the UK and Spain are starting the
process of recovery, their growth is likely to be almost entirely offset by
the fizzling out of demand in Germany as the boom generated by unification
goes into reverse. Germany accounts for 30 per cent of all European sales.
The prospect is of fierce competition for executive car sales in Europe. At
the same time, the fast growth - albeit from a very small base - that
European executive car exporters to Japan had been experiencing has largely
gone into reverse. The bursting of the Japanese 'bubble' economy last year
took new car sales down by 4 per cent.
Part of the problem is that, for example, Mercedes' smallest car, the 190E,
sells for roughly the same price as a fully-equipped Lexus in Japan. Cutting
costs is perhaps the single biggest problem facing the European industry,
and Germany's in particular.
Current estimates are that the Japanese industry has a cost advantage of
about one third over its German counterpart.
Another form of competition is also emerging. General Motors, the world's
biggest car maker, has been undergoing a massive restructuring of plants and
products in an attempt to defend its still-shrinking market share. Its
Cadillac division is now eyeing Europe for a renewed sales push. Chrysler
has just started production of its up-market 'minivans', also pitched at the
executive sector as an alternative to conventional cars, in Austria.
Competition from North America may become an established feature of the
European scene by the late 1990s.
Adding to the industry's concerns within Europe is the continuing
controversy over differential prices charged by manufacturers within the EC,
fuelled initially by consumer group claims that prices in the UK were far
higher than some other markets in Europe.
The UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the EC competition Commission
have both produced reports on the subject. The MMC found no evidence of
systematic profiteering but the EC report found differences, in extreme
cases, of up to 40 per cent. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner,
has warned that the industry must 'put its house in order'.
Overall, the likely effect is to be, if not actual price cuts, a slowing
down of the rate of price increases, putting yet more pressure on costs and
profitability.
Needless to say, this is a prospect not at all likely to bother both
business and private users of executive and luxury cars. The current buyers'
market is likely to remain for a very long time to come.

FT  25 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Clouds gather over BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of negative stories drove British Aerospace down sharply. The fall
started early as the market focused on a company presentation at Tuesday's
aerospace and defence conference at Charterhouse Tilney, where the company
had talked of problems in its civil aviation order book.
The early doubts were quickly followed by unconfirmed speculation that BAe
would issue a profits warning within the next few days.
Sentiment was further weakened by reports that UBS Philips &amp; Drew was about
to issue a sell note detailing large provisions likely to be required
because of problems in the regional aircraft division.
Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite is already predicting that BAe will
have to make provisions of around Pounds 1bn for rationalisation and the
regional aircraft subsidiary. He also believes the company will be forced to
cut the dividend by 50 per cent, but he adds: 'The defence side continues to
trade strongly.'
The shares reacted by falling 20 but were helped off the bottom by bargain
hunters and eventually settled 17 down at 250p after 5.6m traded.
BP drilling fears
British Petroleum shares, weakened on Tuesday by a series of profits
downgrades by leading broking houses, were given further rough handling
yesterday following reports that drilling at the company's latest operations
in Colombia had been suspended for environmental reasons.
Cusiana is widely regarded as one of BP's biggest exploration triumphs in
recent years. At the close of business, BP was trading a net 6 lower at
238p, with specialists said to have been very nervous about the stock
finishing below a previous long-standing closing support level of 240p.
Turnover was a good 5.7m shares.
Tobaccos upset
Tobacco issues finished above the day's lows but still well down after the
US Supreme Court ruled against them on liability from personal injury
lawsuits by smokers.
The court ruled that, in spite of the health warning printed on cigarette
packets since 1966, the manufacturers are not protected against legal
action. This could have important implications for the industry, with a
possible 50 cases waiting to be heard in the US, seeking millions of dollars
in damages.
Rothmans 'B' ended 19 weaker at 1091p, while BAT Industries, with a larger
exposure to the US tobacco market, lost 24 at 733p, after touching 705p.
Turnover in BAT was a hefty 9.5m shares.
Mr Simon Willis, analyst at County NatWest, said it is important to remember
that the tobacco industry pushed for the case to be heard by the Supreme
Court, believing it would be protected by the post-1966 health warning.
Although this has proved wrong, he pointed out that each case will have to
be decided individually, and as yet no big award has ever been made against
the tobacco companies.
Wellcome weak
Speculation surrounding Wellcome's share offer, with some details due to be
announced today, helped to weaken the shares, which dropped 18 to 913p.
Although the drugs group is only due to indicate the size of the offer, talk
in the market focused on the price, with most talk putting the shares at
between 800p to 850p. At the moment, Wellcome Trust holds 75 per cent of the
group and is today expected to relinquish up to two-thirds of its holding.
A big agency cross in Granada saw 6.55m shares moved at 255p, while total
turnover in the stock reached 17m with the price down 11 at 255p.
More holiday price war worries knocked 13 off Airtours at 253p and a further
2 from Owners Abroad at 73 1/2 p. Solid results from First Leisure sent the
shares forward, although they receded in late trading to close a net 3 up at
308p. Rank Organisation was in demand, edging a penny ahead to 670p in
chunky volume of 2.5m.
The latest news about the flotation of Lasmo's North American oil refining
businesses triggered an initial flurry of selling which saw the shares down
to 169p, but was quickly followed by covering of short positions taken out
in the stock. The shares ran up to touch 177p but later slipped back to
close 2 firmer on the day at 174p. Turnover was a hefty 5.3m shares.
Another downgrade in publishing group Pearson, this time said to be from
Cazenove, further depressed the shares, which closed 23 lower at 380p.
A downgrade in RTZ left the shares 10 adrift at 584p. SG Warburg cut Pounds
30m from its profits forecast for this year to Pounds 355m and snipped its
dividend forecast from 21p to 20.5p, blaming poor gold and copper prices.
Some exceptionally heavy business associated with programme trade activity
was said to have been behind the more excessive moves in banking shares.
The UBS Phillips &amp; Drew buy recommendation boosted Abbey National 3 to 277p,
but worries about exposure to losses in India continued to unsettle Standard
Chartered, 6 off at 425p. Merchant banks gave further ground, SG Warburg
ending 18 cheaper at 512p and Kleinwort Benson 5 lower at 286p.
Reports of a broker profits downgrade left Redland 12 off at 498p. Dealers
said some analysts had reduced their estimates to around Pounds 210m.
The second line construction stocks included several weak performers,
notably CALA, down 8 at 64p, and Costain, off 3 at 48p.
Whitbread 'A' fell 8 to 411p in spite of comment by chairman Mr Sam
Whitbread that 'we are beginning to see the first tentative signs that
business may be looking up'.
Bass, hit Tuesday by negative comments from Lehman Brothers, eased 3 to
595p, although Lehman's preferred companies, with more emphasis on the
international spirits trade, fell even further. Guinness lost 11 to 558p and
Allied-Lyons 8 to 641p.
Ratners slipped another  1/2 to 7 1/2 p on further good turnover of 3.6m
shares.
The poor sentiment in British Aerospace spilled into Rolls-Royce, which
declined 6 to 155p as turnover rose to 7.2m shares.
A profits downgrading knocked Vickers down 8 to 139p. US investment bank
Lehman Brothers reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 11m to Pounds
20m to reflect continued difficulties at the company's Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars sub-sidiary.
A profits warning by Henlys Group caused a slide in the shares of 22 to 55p.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei back below 16,000
in low volume

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average closed at its lowest level since October 1986 yesterday
as selling of speculative theme stocks dragged the index below 16,000 again,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell 253.32, or 1.6 per cent, to 15,853.67. The index
rose to the day's high of 16,313.33 in the morning on buying by investors
trying to cover short positions. However, arbitrage selling and liquidation
of holdings by dealers amid low volume pushed prices lower, and the Nikkei
hit the day's low of 15,816.04 just before the close.
Volume rose slightly from 211m shares to 220m. Falls led rises by 666 to
250, with 176 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
lost 13.84 to 1,233.37, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 3.65 to
961.73.
Analysts said the Nikkei's decline, triggered by last Wednesday's rumours of
financial trouble at Daikyo, the condominium builder, would continue unless
uncertainty surrounding the financial soundness of certain companies
disappeared. Investors are especially nervous about real estate companies
and banks, which have been affected by the plunge in asset values.
Mr Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew commented: 'The market needs proof
that the companies are in as sound shape as they say they are.'
Banks and construction and real estate companies were among the heaviest
losers of the day. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y60 to Y1,480, Mitsui
Fudosan slipped Y10 to Y800 and Shimizu, the contractor, lost Y36 to Y889.
The five most active issues of the day were bio-technology theme stocks.
Meiji Milk Products, the most active, dropped Y49 to Y961 and Morinaga Milk
Industry Y50 to Y804.
Steel issues were weak on earnings worries. Leading steel companies face
redemptions of equity-linked bonds issued in the bull market of the late
1980s. According to Kleinwort Benson, Nippon Steel needs to repay Dollars
1.8bn this fiscal year, and Kobe Steel faces Dollars 1.5bn in redemptions.
Nippon Steel declined Y8 to Y261 and Kobe Steel lost Y2 to Y288.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 219.05 to 18,826.86 in volume of 16.1m
shares.
Roundup
WITH THE exception of Hong Kong, the tribulations of Tokyo left the region
in muted form yesterday.
HONG KONG climbed for the third day in a row, the Hang Seng index gaining
67.35 to 5,965.21, but after a day's high of 5,987.91. Turnover expanded to
HKDollars 3.59bn from HKDollars 2.99bn. Cheung Kong rose 40 cents to
HKDollars 26.10 and Hopewell put on 15 cents to HKDollars 5.80.
SEOUL fell to a 4 1/2 -year low, the composite index losing 8.00 to 551.99
in turnover of Won171.1bn. Securities shares were among the weakest issues,
with a decline of 1 per cent in their index value.
AUSTRALIA was encouraged by futures gains, the All Ordinaries index closing
3.7 up at 1,647.6 in turnover of ADollars 319.6m. The recently listed
Fairfax gained 2 cents to ADollars 1.50 in volume of 2.8m shares.
TAIWAN reversed early gains as profit-taking set in. The weighted index
finished 35.40 down at 4,655.08 in turnover of TDollars 41.3bn.
Cement and construction shares showed the biggest losses, with Chia Hsin
Cement off TDollars 1.50 at TDollars 55.00.
MANILA gained ground on bargain hunting, the composite index rising 23.71 to
1,477.57. Turnover decreased to 324m pesos from 394m.
NEW ZEALAND weakened slightly. The NZSE-40 index shed 2.80 to 1,530.53.
KARACHI climbed as the government announced plans to disinvest shares of the
state-run utility Sui Northern Gas, which rose Rs8.25 to Rs54.50. The
100-share index closed 35.52 higher at 1,524.13 on a 45 per cent rise in
turnover.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: German steel shares transcend cyclical
slump - The industry's rationalisation plans are looking good to investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stuck at the bottom of the world-wide cyclical slump, German steelmakers
have done well in the equity market this year.
Relative strength and momentum statistics from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf put
the sector consistently high in the performance charts since mid-March. Even
after some profit-taking over the past week, Hoesch, Klockner-Werke and
Thyssen are standing nearly 20 per cent above their lows for the year.
The steelmakers seem finally to have abandoned their 'every man for himself'
policy and implemented classical techniques for improving buoyancy. They are
off-loading excess costs, notably by cutting highly paid workforces. Some
70,000 are expected to lose their jobs by the end of the decade. At the same
time they are merging, co-operating and, in the process, rationalising the
overall structure of the industry. However, while British Steel and Usinor
Sacilor represent virtually the entire steel output of the UK and France
respectively, Germany still has five steel specialists.
That will come down to four in short order, when Krupp formally completes
its takeover of Hoesch. After that, according to Mr Gerhard Cromme, the
tough Krupp chief, the number is likely to fall eventually to three, but
'never' less than two. He and Mr Heinz Kriwet, boss of Thyssen, Germany's
leading light in steel, are determined that their businesses will remain
independent.
Survival prospects are not so bright at the bottom of the heap, where
Klockner-Werke, a 3.4m tonne per year producer, is feeling the squeeze.
Announcing the second passed dividend in succession earlier this year after
net profits had slumped from DM78.3m to DM1.5m, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr,
its chairman, bravely remarked that he saw no reason to get out of steel.
'Everyone is now talking to everyone else in the steel industry,' he added.
In the interim, however, the shares are trading on a current price/earnings
ratio of around 40, according to forecasts by Mr Chris Heminway of Robert
Fleming, falling to just above 7 in three years' time.
The impulse for the exchanges between steelmakers was the Krupp move against
Hoesch last October, which showed that, in spite of obstacles built into the
German corporate and financial system, an aggressive takeover of a leading
German company can be mounted, and implemented.
Whether that is now true for foreign bidders remains to be seen. Thyssen,
currently busy knitting together its conventional and special steels
subsidiaries (and cutting 5,000 jobs in the process), has said it is not in
the market to buy.
Mr Cromme, of Krupp, in charge of a 9.5m tonne outfit, says he has enough to
do. At present, while tying up the Hoesch deal, he is also trying to
persuade the authorities of his right to subsidies for his purchase and
rebuilding of the run-down east German EKO Stahl business.
The most likely next stage in the restructuring round is expected to include
more co-operation deals, such as that struck recently between the steel tube
divisions of Hoesch and Mannesmann, which will tie existing steel groups
closer together.
The German industry looks in far better shape now, ahead of the expected
upswing in the cycle. In spite of a pay award of 6.4 per cent, compared with
a 5.5 per cent average in Germany this year, rationalisation looks likely to
improve competitiveness at least in terms of labour costs per tonne. And
although manufacturers complain about selling prices down at 1982 levels,
analysts are unanimous that the worst of the cyclical slump is over.
They also speak with one voice of the industry leader, Thyssen - 11m tonnes
of steel a year and a wide range of diversified interests to ease it over
the cyclical bumps - as the long term quality German steel stock.
Although Thyssen's pre-tax earnings this year are expected to take a
pummelling, and Mr Kriwet has suggested that he might not be able to match
last year's DM10 dividend, analysts put it on a prospective p/e of about 13
and their forecasts signal accelerating upwards movement from 1993 onwards.
If Hoesch had remained independent, it, too, would have ranked among the
favoured. But absorption by Krupp - 'for an absolute song', according to Mr
Heminway - has taken it off the market, and investors have been left to
speculate, short term, on the value of the Krupp shares in the takeover
package.
When Krupp comes to market, later this summer, Mr Michael Geiger and Mr
Robert Sassoon at County NatWest advise caution. Mr Cromme's transformation
has yet to free Krupp of its heavy gearing and a commitment to pay back
state subsidies.
If the EKO deal goes through, Krupp will have to find substantial funds to
bring it up to scratch. And while Mr Cromme speaks confidently of the
synergistic savings from his Hoesch link, he has work to do to extract them.
It is a little early to 'get positive'.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses show signs of
responding to economic news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a suggestion yesterday that bourses will respond to good economic
news, when it comes, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw movement in derivatives after equity hours, DAX index futures
dropping on a steep fall in US durable goods orders, then recovering on
positive German inflation data. At the official close, the DAX was 2.65
lower at 1,768.49 after a 2.68 fall to 702.19 in the FAZ at midsession,
turnover easing from DM4.7bn to DM4.6bn.
Daimler fell DM5.90 to DM795.50 in market hours and, going ex a DM13
dividend, lost another net DM6 to DM776.70 in the afternoon. Dealers said
that investors been buying Daimler put options heavily to hedge the downside
as they waited for a final ruling on Germany's participation in the European
jet fighter project.
Among second liners VEW, the power utility group, rose another DM6.50 to
DM228 for a two-day gain of DM13.80. After hours, VEW said that it had
bought control of Harpener, the holding company which, before it was
swallowed by the ill-fated Swiss Omni group in the late 1980s, had half of
its sales in power generation.
PARIS opened the the first day of the new trading account firmer, helped by
a May trade surplus of FFr4.5bn. The CAC 40 index closed up 3.84 at
1,899.64, after reaching an intraday high of 1,913.97.
Peugeot slipped FFr10 to FFr738 after Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, warned
that the European car market could contract by 1 per cent in 1992. He said
that he expected a further decline in Germany, while Spain, Portugal and
Belgium were likely to improve.
Total finished up 80 centimes at FFr232.90 after reports that US and
international offers in the government's sale of a 12.4 per cent stake had
been oversubscribed two-fold.
Elsewhere Michelin extended Tuesday's gains, up FFr6.00 at FFr202.70.
MILAN dropped to a fraction above its 1992 low as hopes faded that the new
premier Mr Giulio Amato, will assemble an effective government. The Comit
index ended 3.70 lower at 468.99. Olivetti saw more speculation about
alliances in the computer industry, edging up L20 to L3,233; Fiat dropped
L70 to L5,410 but recovered to L5,445 on the kerb.
ZURICH fell as banks and insurers came under selling pressure, the SMI index
of leading shares ending 8.8 easier at 1,838.3. UBS came under pressure from
rumours, later denied, that Moody's Investors Service planned to downgrade
the bank's triple-A rating; the bearers topped the active list as they
closed SFr70 lower at SFr3,570, after SFr3,520.
MADRID, plagued by bad economic news, saw the general index down another
3.71 at 239.99. The construction sector was badly affected following a
meeting on Tuesday between the dindsutry and government. Tabacalera fell to
an intraday low of Pta5,450 on news of a US ruling which may open
manufacturers there to lawsuits, before recovering slightly to close down
Pta120 at Pta5,590.
OSLO took little comfort from Tuesday's rise and the market returned to
negative territory. The all-share index fell 3.53 to 413.32 in turnover of
NKr222m. Dealers were disappointed with the pricing of Hafslund Nycomed's
offering of its B shares in the US at Dollars 22.50 per share. The B closed
NKr3 weaker at NKr164.
ISTANBUL gained 3.7 per cent on expectations of parliamentary discussions
this week on tax reform. The 75-share index closed up 142.16 at 3,982.53,
its highest close since April 16. The reform proposals would provide tax
relief for mutual funds which invest 25 per cent of their portfolios in
stocks.
TEL AVIV hit a new record in high turnover following the Labour party's
general election victory, the blue chip share index soared 8.93, or 6.5 per
cent to 146.15.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities hit by uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM uncertainty now motivates Brazilian equities, according to Mr
Alvaro A. Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa). The
last few days seem to confirm Mr Vidigal's observation, writes Bill
Hinchberger.
At noon yesterday, the Bovespa index was down 2.2 per cent at 20,097. On
Tuesday, it closed just 12 points off following a 6.6 per cent drop on
Monday. On Friday it had registered a 10.6 per cent rebound. Although he
remains bullish on the long term road to economic reform, Mr Vidigal
admitted that the short term is 'unpredictable', mostly because of the
political crisis engendered by allegations of corruption involving close
associates of President Collor de Mello.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Study group sees market
remaining in broad balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD copper market is likely to remain in broad balance this year as a
modest rise in consumption is matched by increased supplies, according to
industry experts attending this week's inaugural meeting of the
International Copper Study Group in Geneva.
The group, set up last January, brings together government and industry
representatives from 18 producing and consuming countries representing over
60 per cent of world copper trade. Zambia, the third biggest copper
exporter, has stated its intention to join the group and Japan, the biggest
importer, says it will join if the terms of reference can be amended. This
would increase the proportion of copper trade covered by the group to 78 per
cent.
Russia, once one of the top three copper producers, has also expressed an
interest in joining. Mr Alexei Shevtsov, a senior Russian official, said
Moscow was ready to provide data on production and consumption and was
interested in information on technology, environment and investment.
The group is designed to improve copper market information and undertake
regular assessments of the market situation and outlook. However, this first
meeting, which ends tomorrow, attended by over 100 delegates from about 30
countries, has been dominated by procedural and administrative issues. These
include the location of the group's headquarters, appointment of a
secretary-general and the initial work programme and budget. Lisbon,
Santiago and Montreal have all offered to host the organisation.
Commentaries on the market situation presented to the meeting indicate that
while there are already signs of a pick-up in demand for copper in the US
market, this may be offset by stagnant consumption in the recession-hit
Japanese and European markets. An unpublished Canadian government assessment
suggests that continued overall growth of world copper output could put some
downward pressure on prices this year, assuming no major supply disruptions.
'While copper consumption is expected to experience significant growth
beginning in 1993, prices to 1995 are likely to be adversely affected by
further increases in copper mine capacity,' the assessment says. However, it
predicts that prices will subsequently strengthen with strong demand and a
slowdown in the growth of world copper supply.
The Canadian view appears to be generally shared by copper consumers, though
some producer countries are more optimistic. Mr Ernesto Tironi, Chile's
representative at this week's meeting, said rising demand coupled with
production problems in Peru, Zaire, Zambia and the former eastern bloc
countries could lead to demand outstripping supply by end-1992 or early
1993. Chile is by far the world's biggest exporter.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ghana polishes up gold coast
image - Massive new investment in an underdeveloped, high potential area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GHANA'S METEORIC gold boom continues unabated as a result of stable economic
policies and massive new investment in one of the least developed high
potential gold belts in the world.
According to the Minerals Commission production surged last year to 844,674
troy ounces - a 56 per cent increase over 1990 production. The government is
predicting that the 1m-ounce mark, the highest level Ghana has ever produced
in its history, will be reached this year as new projects come on stream and
operational difficulties in the major expansion activities are ironed out.
Foreign exchange earnings from gold are forecast at USDollars 350m in 1992,
making gold, for the first time in more than two decades, Ghana's number one
foreign exchange earner.
The gold mining boom is directly attributable to the government's overhaul
since 1983 of the restrictive investment laws and incentives in the mining
sector, its commitment to a radical economic adjustment programme and its
flexible approach to foreign investors. Since 1983 at least Dollars 500m has
been invested in the sector.
Last year's huge production increase was clearest evidence to date of the
successes of government policies. The giant of Ghana's gold industry Ashanti
Goldfields Corporation, owned 55 per cent by government and 45 per cent by
Lonrho, increased its production to 569,452 ounces, up 42 per cent from
1990, as a result of the opening of its new Sansu oxide plant and the
continuing rehabilitation and development of its underground mines.
Two other projects also became fully operational last year - the Dollars
100m Billiton Bogusu project, majority owned by the Shell subsidiary
Billiton International Metals (Netherlands), produced 61,678 ounces in 1991
and Teberebie Goldfields, majority owned by Pioneer Incorporated of Boston,
produced 79,111 ounces. These projects are expected to produce at least
100,000 ounces a year each when initial operational difficulties have been
overcome.
The future looks promising and the government is estimating annual
production of 2m ounces by 1996. Several new projects, with ultimate
estimated capital investments of up to Dollars 800m over five years are
scheduled to take off in the coming months to increase production levels
still further. The first, and most exciting, development is the
privatisation of the two underground mines at Prestea and Tarkwa, owned by
the State Gold Mining Corporation. Both mines, which last year produced a
combined 48,000 ounces, have extremely high potential but have been severely
constrained by poor management and inadequate new investment. Because of
dilapidated equipment and outmoded mining methods they have production costs
of about Dollars 350 an ounce.
Mining operations in both areas have so far concentrated on narrow,
relatively high grade, veins. Proposals for buying the mines have been
submitted by, among others, two South African mining houses, Rand Mines and
Gold Fields of South Africa, and by Billiton International Minerals. Both
mines have considerable potential for expanding underground production and
developing new surface mining operations of oxide and sulphide ores.
One mining expert believes that if investment of Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m
is put into each concession both Prestea and Tarkwa have the potential
within three or four years to produce in excess of 200,000 ounces a year
each. The Tarkwa mine has geology very similar to the vast gold deposits in
South Africa's Witwatersrand area and the South African bids are tipped as
the front runners. A government decision on the privatisation proposals is
expected very soon.
The second major expansion of reserves and production is being undertaken by
Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, which has set a production target of 1m
ounces a year by 1996. A recent evaluation of reserves by Minproc Engineers
is believed to have suggested reserve levels of at least 20m tonnes with
grades in the range of six to eight grams per tonne. A new financing package
of about Dollars 250m for the next four years is being put together by the
company at the moment. To reach the 1m-ounce level major capital investment
is required in continued expansion and mechanisation of underground
operations, development of additional open-pit oxide and sulphide reserves
and installation of new refractory ore treatment facilities with capacity of
at least 3m tonnes a year. Mechanisation and new investment will also help
AGC to reduce its costs of production, currently at about Dollars 260 to
Dollars 270 an ounce at the Obuasi mine, to the Dollars 200 an ounce
achieved by Teberebie, Bogusu and AGC's own new Sansu oxide operation.
The government has also said that it is preparing to divest itself of 20 per
cent of the equity in AGC by December, reducing its share holding to 35 per
cent, and is considering a joint placement on the London and Accra stock
exchanges.
Ghana-Australian Goldfields, majority owned by Golden Shamrock Mines of
Australia, is scheduled to start production in September with reserves
estimated at about 15.9m tonnes and an average grade of about 2.1 grammes a
tonne. Estimated annual production is 100,000 ounces with a total capital
costs for the project of about Dollars 60m.
In addition decisions will be taken within the next 12 months on two more
medium-sized, low-grade open-pit mining projects
Cluff Mining (UK and Zimbabwe) has completed a feasibility study for a
significant discovery at Ayanfuri, in Western Region, with estimated
reserves of 7m tonnes and an average grade of 2 grams a tonne. The company
has undertaken a rights issue to raise Dollars 15m on the London Stock
Exchange for a total estimated capital investment of Dollars 25-Dollars 30m,
which is expected to produce 40,000-50,000 ounces a year.
Abosso Goldfields, majority owned by Ranger Explorations of Australia, is
seeking finance for a drilling programme to confirm and expand reserves. So
far 3m tonnes of resource have been identified with an average grade of 2
grams a tonne.
In addition to these new projects both Teberebie and Bogusu are planning
expansion programmes to realise production of 125,000 and 140,000 ounces a
year respectively.
Since Ghana, known as the Gold Coast in colonial times, started gold
production at least 40m ounces have been mined. Considerable expansion is
under way as well as efforts to reduce production costs among all producers
to Dollars 200 an ounce. But mining experts point out that most recent mine
development and exploration has occurred in established areas. Many other
areas with known prospects and favourable geology have yet to be explored
systematically. Such exploration, encouraged by further liberalisation of
investment laws, could produce results to make Ghana a major world producer
for decades to come.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uganda in Dollars 54m cobalt
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UGANDA SIGNED a development agreement for a Dollars 54m project yesterday
that should see that country become a substantial cobalt producer,
contributing about 5 per cent of western world output by 1995.
Barclays Metals of the UK, part of the Barclays Bank group, is marketing
agent for the project, and BRGM, the state-owned French mining group, is the
technical agent. Each will have a 27.5 per cent stake with the Ugandan
government owning the rest.
The aim is to produce for at least 15 years an annual 1,000 tonnes of cobalt
 -an essential metal in some of the superalloys used by the aerospace
industry and for some motor industry products - from waste dumps at the old
Kilembe copper mine on the edge of the Queen Elizabeth National Park in
south-west Uganda.
The partners plan to built a pilot plant as part of a detailed Dollars 4m
feasibility study over the next 12 months. This will provide the basis for a
full scale, Dollars 50m, bioleaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning
plant at Kasese.
Copper production stopped there in 1972 since when various methods to
recover cobalt have been looked at and found to be either too expensive or
too polluting. However, BRGM (Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres)
has developed a method where thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, a naturally
occuring bacteria that is being used by some copper, gold and uranium miners
to liberate metal from ore, can be employed.
The partners claim that bioleaching is not only the least costly way of
extracting Uganda's cobalt, it is also the most environmentally-friendly
method. They suggest cobalt can produced profitably at its long-term
historic average price of Dollars 10 to Dollars 12 a lb. Cobalt is at
present about Dollars 25 a lb on the European free market, having doubled in
price recently following production and political problems in Zaire and
Zambia which between them account for about 70 per cent of western
production of the metal.

An extremely active and extended afternoon fixing session on the London
bullion market saw heavy selling before GOLD was fixed at Dollars 342.30 a
troy ounce, down Dollars 1.70 from the morning fix. Brokers reported large
Middle East sell orders as the fix began, with dealers in New York reporting
bids ranging up to 200,000 and 350,000 ounces. Dealers said there was no
sign of producers in the market and no initial indications of official
selling. London's robusta COFFEE prices closed steady and New York arabica
futures moved above lifetime lows by midday as the markets awaited
developments at the slow-moving ICO talks in London. London September COCOA
touched a new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 511 a tonne before recovering some
of the loss by the close. Dealers said that the Ivory Coast and Ghana, under
pressure to pay off debts, had large amounts to sell in the near future.
'Until people think they have sold enough to satisfy the IMF, the market is
going to remain depressed,' said one trader. Three-month ZINC extended an
early short covering move on the LME, breaking above Dollars 1,240 a tonne
and almost reaching Dollars 1,250.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weak brew for Sri Lankan tea
sector reforms - A look at the government's partial privatisation of the
plantations sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKA has been forced to undertake its most ambitious privatisation
exercise in an attempt to revive its tea industry.
However, only the management of the estates is being taken over by the
private sector. Overall control, including hiring and firing, will still be
in the hands of political appointees, a fact that is causing some concern to
aid donors such as the World Bank.
In an attempt to sharpen up the management of the estates Sri Lanka - the
world's largest tea exporter - is turning back to the expertise of the
private companies that made Ceylon tea famous from the time a young English
planter called James Taylor planted the first tea bush in 1876.
For the past 20 years, since they were nationalised by the left-leaning
government of Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, the ownership and management of the
island's largest tea, rubber and coconut estates has been vested in the
State Plantations Corporation and the Peoples Estates Development Board.
Traders say bureaucratic and centralised control over the state-owned
plantations has led to waste, corruption and mismanagement. Continuing
losses and the prospect of a drop in production this year because of a
drought has forced the government's hand.
Now the administration of President R. Premadasa has broken up the holdings
of the two giant, state-owned tea plantation corporations and the ownership
of 452 estates has been transferred to 22 regional plantation enterprises.
The patent need to modernise the tea industry and improve its efficiency has
overcome reluctance government reluctance to confront problems arising from
the island's colonial history, Sinhala/Tamil racial tensions and troubled
relations with neighbouring India. Plantation labour is 90 per cent Indian
Tamil, descendants of workers brought from south India by British planters
in the late nineteenth century.
'The point is that we have come to the end of the road,' says Mr Rupa
Karunatilleke, plantation industries minister. 'What we need most is
professional managers not government-appointed bureaucrats who worship
financial regulations and administrative rules'. Sri Lanka remains the
world's largest tea exporter with 225m kg sold abroad last year. While there
was a 3 per cent drop in exports in 1991, far more worrying was the 15 per
cent drop in export income. The turmoil in the former Soviet Union and the
financial isolation of Iraq, both major buyers, explains this loss. 'But
Iran and Pakistan have promised to buy more,' says Mr AR Munsoor, the trade
minister, who recently visited Iran and had talks in Colombo last month with
a top-level Pakistani trade delegation.
'We are fully alive to the importance of meeting the challenge of new
technologies and consumer tastes,' says the minister. 'The volume of CTC
(cut, tear and curl) teas traded in the world market exceeds the volume of
orthodox teas.' At present only 3 per cent of Sri Lankan production is CTC,
the type favoured in the UK.
The boards of management of the regional plantation enterprises will be
selected by the president on Mr Karunatilleke's advice. 'Competent persons
with experience in plantation agriculture as well as in the tea trade will
be selected,' says a ministry official.
None the less, they will be political appointees, and the temptation to
'give jobs for the boys' will remain strong, says Mr. CV Gooneratne, an
opposition MP. The government admits that 'hiring and firing' will be
entrusted to the regional plantation enterprises rather than to the private
sector managing companies.
The World Bank pointed out recently that Sri Lanka's estates were generating
large losses and were important contributors to the losses of the
government-owned banks. 'While we understand the political sensitivity of
the issue and wish the government success in the use of private management
contracts, we must note that the international experience with this approach
has not been successful where ownership has continued in the state sector,'
it warned.
Nevertheless, the bank and the International Monetary Fund have recently
released Dollars 75m, the second tranche of a Dollars 450m Extended
Structural Adjustment Facility.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper climbs to 7 1/2 -month
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER SUPPLY fears helped to lift prices of the metal yesterday. On the
London Metal Exchange copper's price reached its highest level in seven and
a half months while on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) futures
contracts touched lifetime highs.
Traders suggested the market was particularly concerned that labour contract
negotiations at Asarco, the big US copper group which produces about 450,000
tonnes a year, were making slow progress. There were also labour tensions in
the Polish copper industry and bad weather had affected Chile's output.
However, analysts said copper's fundamental situation was bullish. Mr
William Adams at Rudolf Wolff said it now seemed likely that, instead of the
50,000 tonnes surplus expected at the begining of this year, there would be
a 100,000 tonnes copper deficit in 1992. Mr Robin Bhar at Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken has lifted his copper price forecasts for this year from Dollars 1 a
lb to Dollars 1.05 and for 1993 from Dollars 1.05 to Dollars 1.15 a lb.
On Comex the July copper futures contract touched a lifetime high of Dollars
1.05.90 a lb at one point yesterday morning, up 11 cents from Tuesday's
closing level. At the LME the price of copper for immediate delivery closed
last night at Pounds 1,245.50 a tonne, up Pounds 9.50, while three-month
metal ended at Pounds 1,263.75, up Pounds 6.50 a tonne.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Accountancy Column: Closing the gaps between expectation and
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALLISTER WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT spate of spectacular corporate failures has prompted investors,
creditors and commentators to look for scapegoats. Depending on the nature
of one's vested interests, it is possible to blame management, the
institutions, market conditions or the regulatory system.
Increasingly, however, it has been found convenient to blame the auditor.
Auditors are, in turn, quick to point out that allegations of their
culpability are merely a manifestation of the 'expectation gap'.
The expectation gap is a popular professional cliche. It has been defined as
the difference between what auditors do and what the public assumes they do
or thinks they ought to do. The narrowing of the gap is clearly the
principal motivation behind the Auditing Practices Board's (APB) current
proposals for the future development of auditing.
These include plans for the revision of existing audit reporting practice.
The APB has isolated three key public misconceptions. First,
misunderstandings of audited financial statements, such as assuming that
they carry some element of guarantee that the entity concerned will continue
in existence. Second, misunderstandings as to the type and extent of work
undertaken by auditors, such as assuming that auditors prepare the financial
statements on which they report. Third, misunderstandings about the level of
assurance provided by auditors, assuming, for example, that an unqualified
audit report provides absolute assurance that no fraud has occurred.
In order to address these misconceptions, the APB is suggesting that the
form of the audit report be expanded to include descriptions of the
respective responsibilities of auditors and directors regarding financial
statements. A similar approach has been recommended by the Cadbury report.
That the public misconceptions cited by the APB and Cadbury exist is
undeniable. Whether or not they are best dealt with through the APB's
proposals for an expanded audit report is a different matter. Most of the
efforts by the accounting profession to narrow the expectation gap are
inevitably flawed because the true nature of the gap has not been fully
identified.
Up to now, whenever the question is addressed, discussion tends to focus on
issues such as fraud, going concern and the responsibility of directors for
the preparation of the accounts.
What is seldom addressed is the distinction between the two main components
of the expectation gap - namely the financial reporting component and the
auditing component. In my view, this differentiation needs to be clearly
made in order to make sensible judgments as to the way in which the various
elements of the expectation gap should be addressed.
The financial reporting component of the gap comprises those elements which
relate to the purpose, nature and meaning of financial statements. The
auditing component relates to the role and responsibility of the auditor in
auditing and reporting on those financial statements.
The financial reporting gap includes the misconception that a balance sheet
gives an indication of the value of a company. More important, there appears
to be a general lack of appreciation of the extent to which the figures
presented in a company's financial statements are based on judgments and
estimates.
Furthermore, because of the wide range of alternative accounting options
available to directors under existing accounting rules, similar transactions
can be reported in the accounts in different ways depending on where the
directors wish to be on the spectrum between aggressiveness and conservatism
in their financial reporting. The auditors are unlikely to be in a position
to do otherwise than to state in their report that the accounts give a 'true
and fair view'.
It would seem that at present the APB is placing an unrealistic onus and
impractical hope on the audit report as a means of narrowing both components
of the expectation gap. This is because the principal elements of the gap
lie not in the words in the audit report, but in the financial statements on
which the auditor is reporting. Or, putting it another way, they lie in the
basis of preparation and presentation of the financial statements and not in
the method by which the financial statements are audited or reported on by
the auditor.
While it is undeniable that the audit-related elements of the expectation
gap exist, they are of secondary importance compared with the financial
reporting-related elements. If the accounting, legislative and regulatory
frameworks under which the financial statements are being prepared are
inadequate, then it will make little difference whether the audit report
runs to two paragraphs or two pages.
The narrowing of the gap requires a multi-pronged attack with the
co-operation of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), the Stock Exchange and
the Department of Trade and Industry, as well as the APB. The expansion of
the audit report is an important aspect of this process - but it is only one
aspect and should not be dealt with in isolation.
Perhaps a good starting point would be to provide an authoritative
explanation of the meaning of 'true and fair', which has become a piece of
ill-understood jargon. This is an issue which lawyers and accountants have
been grappling with for many years, which perhaps indicates that it is a
significant element of the expectation gap that needs to be addressed as a
first step in the bridging process.
Auditors are an easy target when things go wrong. However, at present there
is a strong danger that they will simply find themselves assuming
responsibility for legal and regulatory shortcomings not of their making.
The form of accounts whose authentication is the auditor's responsibility is
dictated by law. To blame the auditor for its deficiencies is to blame him
for limitations in the wider environment of financial reporting which at
present he can do nothing about.
Unquestionably the public is entitled to reassurance over the various
misunderstandings which the APB has outlined, but the audit report is not
the place to pursue these issues. It is not only inappropriate but
potentially misleading for an audit report to deal with the nature of
financial statements. Moreover, as media comment has demonstrated, the
result is to exacerbate the expectation gap.
To bridge both the financial reporting and the auditing components of the
expectation gap will require much more than defensive, if well-intentioned,
proposals from members of the auditing profession. The ASB, the Stock
Exchange and the DTI, in addition to the APB, have a part to play in
ensuring that a thorough, on-going reform of financial reporting procedures
is immediately set in train.
The expansion of the audit report will be an important aspect of this
process, but only one of a number of much-needed improvements. Merely to
make audit reports more compendious just because the DTI, ASB, Stock
Exchange and institutional investors are reluctant to face up to their
responsibilities will solve nothing.
In fact, such a step may well widen the expectation gap rather than bridge
it. The criticism already levelled at auditors over the financial reporting
expectation gap - an area for which they have little or no control - is
wholly unjustifiable. It is time that the profession dropped its air of
apologetic defensiveness. The fault lies in the wider environment of
financial reporting; its redress is a collective responsibility.

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Investors get ready to deal
in HSBC securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the UK equity and bond markets are preparing to trade in
securities issued by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, ahead of
today's final closing date of its offer for Midland Bank.
Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, said yesterday it would
launch an equity option on HSBC shares if the offer for Midland was declared
unconditional.
HSBC has said that it would list sterling-denominated shares on the London
Stock Exchange if the offer went through. The merged bank is likely to be in
the top 20 UK companies ranked by market capitalisation.
The steering committee which controls the FT-SE 100 Index of leading UK
equities ruled earlier this month that HSBC shares will qualify for
inclusion in the index.
Stock options are increasingly popular with institutional investors as a
tool to manage portfolio exposure to individual equities. The option will be
the 69th individual stock option traded on Liffe and the first since the
exchange merged with the London Traded Options Market in March.
The exchange already trades options on Midland Bank shares, which will be
phased out when the last outstanding contract expires in December. The HSBC
option will follow the same contract specifications as other equity options,
with each contract carrying a nine-month expiry date.
On Friday, 'grey market' dealing - trading before the issue price has been
announced - begins in the Pounds 454m subordinated loan stock offered to
Midland shareholders under the offer.
Banks not involved in underwriting the bond issue were generally optimistic
on the prospects for the deal.
Under the revised offer unveiled last month, the 10-year paper will be
priced to yield 2.4 per cent more than UK government bonds, more generous
than the 1.6 per cent yield spread originally proposed.

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: SocGen in move to revive TME
index
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale, the French bank, has launched an unusual domestic bond
issue linked to a French government bond index, in an attempt to revive
interest in the moribund index.
The issue is designed to provide a straightforward yield curve play for
investors who take the view that the French yield curve - which is currently
inverted - is set to shift to a positive shape.
Societe Generale hopes to restore interest in the index - the Taux Moyen
D'Etat (TME) - on long-dated government bonds. After a period in vogue in
the late 1980s, the market in bonds linked to the TME collapsed as the yield
curve became more inverted.
The FFr1.5bn 10-year issue pays interest of 60 basis points above the TME
index. The deal met with strong demand, particularly from French insurance
companies, according to Societe Generale.
It was also boosted by the French Treasury's announcement last Friday of an
exchange programme under which some existing bonds linked to the TME index
will be redeemed.
Societe Generale believes that the projected shift in the French yield curve
will be mirrored in other European markets. It plans to create indices
similar to the French TME index on other European government bond markets.
The bank plans to launch products linked to these new indices. 'We plan to
export this idea to Europe,' said Mr Antoine Paille, director of options at
the bank.
Tomorrow, Societe Generale will launch a FFr300m to FFr500m 10-year
Eurobond. The bond will pay TME plus 20 basis points, with a floor at 7.5
per cent. But if the TME reaches 11 per cent, the floor disappears.
In addition to bond issues, the bank is to start making markets in caps and
floors (options with upper and lower limits) on the TME.

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Depressed conditions keep borrowers
away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW-ISSUE activity in the international bond market ground almost to a halt
yesterday, with depressed conditions in most European markets and poor
currency swap opportunities keeping potential borrowers away.
General Electric Capital Corporation, the financing arm of the US industrial
group, added CDollars 50m to its CDollars 100m five-year issue launched last
week. The 8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.80, against 99.95 last week.
The issue was made under GECC's medium-term note programme and carries no
independent documentation. Using the MTN structure cuts issuing costs for
the borrower.
Following the recent pattern for larger MTN issues, the bonds were fully
underwritten by the dealers to the programme, lead-managed by Kidder
Peabody. Other than the documentation, the issue was little different from a
conventional syndicated Eurobond issue.
Elsewhere, syndicate officials said the European Investment Bank was hoping
to raise funds in both the French franc and Italian lira sectors. Both
sectors have suffered in the aftermath of Denmark's rejection of the
Maastricht Treaty on June 2.
However, while French franc bonds are supported by strong domestic economic
fundamentals - yesterday CAR, the state-backed financing agency,
successfully added FFr1bn to an existing domestic issue - the lira bond
market remains volatile. Bankers said yesterday that the EIB may find it
difficult to assemble an underwriting group for a lira bond issue.
Against this, the EIB has shown itself willing to compromise to promote
favoured sectors of the Euromarket.
For example, its Ecu350m 10-year deal launched on Monday was priced to yield
12 basis points more than French government Ecu paper, with full fees paid
to underwriters. Before the Danish vote, the EIB borrowed in Ecu at a yield
spread of just 4 basis points - with underwriters offered minimal fees.
Swiss franc bonds issued by Heron, the UK property company which is
negotiating a debt restructuring with bank creditors, resumed trading having
been temporarily suspended trading on stock exchanges in Switzerland.
The bonds now trade 'flat': investors no longer pay accrued interest when
purchasing bonds. There are no interest payments due until November, by
which time Heron hopes to have presented restructuring proposals to
bondholders. The bonds reflect that further interest payments are unlikely
to be made.
Dealers quoted Heron's six outstanding Swiss franc issues at around 20 per
cent of face value yesterday, for yields of 40 to 50 per cent. However,
there was little or no dealing activity in the stock.
Heron has continued to service bonds issued in other currencies. On Monday,
it met an interest payment on a Dollars 100m floating-rate note issue.

<TEXT>
JAPAN's Ministry of Finance may ease the regulations on shelf registration
for domestic bond issuers, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The MoF is considering making credit ratings a criterion, allowing companies
with a single-A rating or better to make a shelf registration. It may also
lower quantitative hurdles for other borrowers, the official said.
Securities companies last November urged the MoF to take such moves because
the Tokyo stock market slump has slashed the pool of firms eligible to make
shelf registrations, a brokerage official said.
The MoF introduced the shelf registration system in October 1988, shortening
the period between initial registration and bond issuance to less than a
week from several weeks.
Brokerage officials said the MoF's decision on the deregulation is likely to
be made as early as July, but the MoF official declined to comment on the
timing.

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Saudi-owned network wins right
to buy UPI
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Press International, the embattled US news agency, will be sold to
the London-based Middle East Broadcasting Centre for Dollars 3.95m in cash,
a federal bankruptcy court judge has ruled.
The Saudi-owned news network, which uses satellites to broadcast news to the
Middle East, said it was willing to inject up to Dollars 12m over the next
two years to make UPI viable and profitable.
Judge Francis Conrad said: 'Lord knows, in this economy, we need to keep as
many reporters alive and eating as we can.'
In accepting the Middle East Broadcasting offer, Judge Conrad rejected a
competing bid of Dollars 3.75m from Mr Leon Charney, a US property lawyer.
Mr Charney said he had been forced into a last-minute bidding war and said
he might appeal the decision, agency reports suggested.
During the bankruptcy court hearing to determine the fate of the 85-year-old
news agency, all three potential rescuers increased their offers.
The Rev Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who earlier this month
withdrew his Dollars 6m bid for UPI, raised his offer for some of the wire
service's assets, its name and access to its photo library to Dollars
900,000 from Dollars 500,000.
Middle East Broadcasting, which raised its bid from Dollars 3.5m, was the
early favourite of UPI creditors, who are owed about Dollars 60m. After the
decision Mr Dennis O'Dea, lead attorney for the creditors, said: 'The
proposal is the highest and best offer for the assets of UPI.'
Mr Charney, who initially offered to pay Dollars 3.6m in cash and equity for
UPI, increased his offer to Dollars 3.75m in cash and said he was willing to
match Middle East Broadcasting's infusion of funds to revive UPI.
Whether anyone can save UPI remains to be seen. The news agency has filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors twice in the past 10
years. It is currently owned by Infotechnology, a company that itself filed
for bankruptcy protection last year.
Mr Robertson rescinded his earlier takeover offer after advisers said he
would need to spend about Dollars 31m in the next 18 months to make the news
agency viable.
At the bankruptcy hearing Judge Francis Conrad said: 'The overriding concern
is for UPI employees. They must be living in Dante's hell.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC plans revision of proxy
battle rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW rules making it easier for shareholders in US companies to challenge
management during proxy battles and forcing corporations to disclose more
information about executive pay have been proposed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
The proposals, which were unanimously approved by the SEC's four
commissioners at a meeting in Washington, are part of a campaign by the US
watchdog to give shareholders more say in the management of companies.
The new rules will not come into effect until the SEC has received comments
on its proposals from the public and corporations.
On the proxy issue, the SEC's plan is to simplify the disclosure
requirements imposed on shareholders when they discuss in writing how they
might vote in an annual meeting.
At present, a shareholder needs prior approval from the SEC when
communicating in writing with more than 10 other shareholders.
Oral discussions between shareholders would be exempt from any type of
filing. The SEC also proposed that big shareholders should be allowed to
include a criticism of a company's performance in their proxy statements.
In the past, US corporations have been against the easing of proxy rules,
arguing that it would allow big institutions to organise opposition to
management in secret. The SEC first proposed altering its proxy rules in
June 1991, but the watchdog was forced to tone down the substance of some of
the changes after receiving more than 900 comment letters, many of them
hostile to the proposals.
Business groups are likely to express their dissatisfaction with the new
rules during the public comment period. The SEC, however, is determined to
make life easier for dissident shareholders who want to challenge the way
companies are being run.
Mr Richard Breeden, the commission's chairman, said yesterday that he would
like to see the changes take effect in time for the 1993 proxy season.
Under the proposed rules on executive pay, companies would be required to
provide shareholders with clear information on what executives are earning,
laid out in chart form rather than in pages of dense text.
Management would also be forced to show how executive pay relates to company
performance, and how it compares with the performance of similar companies.
The United Shareholders Association, a Washington-based pressure group,
welcomed the proposals. Mr Ralph Whitworth, president, said: 'The SEC's
proposals will usher in a new era of activist ownership to help reinvigorate
the competitiveness of American corporations.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bombardier forecasts profits
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the Canadian-based aerospace and transit equipment group, has
predicted that higher aircraft deliveries would bring improved profits this
year.
Bombardier's total backlog of firm orders had reached CDollars 6.2bn
(USDollars 5.21bn) and will approach CDollars 7bn by year-end, Mr Laurent
Beaudoin, chairman, said. The backlog would approach CDollars 8bn in a year.
About two-thirds of the total is for aerospace products.
In the first quarter to the end of April, Bombardier earned CDollars 32.7m,
or 21 cents a share, up 28 per cent from a year earlier. Sales for the
period were CDollars 938m, against CDollars 658m in the same period last
year. The latest results include contributions by two recent acquisitions.
Mr Beaudoin would not comment on analysts' estimates that earnings for
fiscal 1993 would be between 90 cents and 95 cents a share. However, he said
he expected the group's results to show an improvement over fiscal 1992
figures.
The chairman said defence products accounted for only 10 per cent of
Bombardier's CDollars 4bn annual sales. But missile and surveillance systems
developed by its Short Brothers and Canadair units were projects with a
long-term future, he added.
In civil aircraft development, a Bombardier engineering-marketing team is
currently working on the 70-passenger regional aircraft. Mr Beaudoin said
the model would be lighter than the proposed Fokker 70 and that it was
designed for a more specialised market.
About 20 potential customers have put down deposits for the Global Express
super business jet now being studied as a derivative of the 50-passenger
regional jet.
Learjet, the Kansas-based aircraft subsidiary, was offering a new model
against the backdrop of a business jet market which was showing signs of
recovery in spite of the persistent recession, Mr Beaudoin said.
Bombardier stock has been weak recently because of problems with its Belgian
transit equipment unit; speculation over aircraft certification delays; and
lay-off notices at Short Brothers of Northern Ireland.
The company blamed the recent 90-day lay-offs on the winding-up of two older
aircraft programmes, foreseen when Bombardier bought the unit in 1989.
Bombardier has reorganised its British, French and Belgian rail equipment
units into a new holding company, Eurorail, which will continue to be
financed by the parent in Montreal. BN, the Belgian unit, is expected to
return to profitability by year-end after a reorganisation.
'Despite many design changes and technological problems, we're pushing to
deliver the first Channel Tunnel rail set by year-end. Only then can we get
some idea of the margin we may make on the total CDollars 650m rail car
order,' Mr Beaudoin added.
Bombardier's UTDC unit in Ontario is negotiating a CDollars 350m underground
rail order with the city of Toronto.
Bombardier's contracts to develop new generation underground trains for New
York and Paris have reached the evaluation stage. A prototype nine-car train
set is scheduled for delivery to New York this summer, and Bombardier's ANF
unit in France will deliver a similar set of prototypes to the Paris transit
system this autumn. Eight pre-production sets will follow next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Guido Roberto Vitale, the managing director of Euromobiliare, the Italian
merchant bank now controlled by Midland Bank of the UK, is to step down at
the end of September.
No direct successor has been named. However, Mr Sencar Toker, European
managing director of Midland Montagu, the UK bank's investment banking arm,
is to become chairman of Euromobiliare's executive committee, which
effectively runs the company.
Euromobiliare also announced yesterday that it is spending L30bn (Dollars
25.3m) to buy Cofimedit, an investment management subsidiary of the
Fondiaria insurance group, which currently has around L1,000bn in funds
under management.
Mr Vitale, one of the founders of Euromobiliare in 1973, was one of the
leading figures in the liberalisation of Italian merchant banking in the
mid-1980s. Under his guidance, the bank conducted a series of daring deals
which challenged the monopoly of the country's most established financial
institutions.
However, Euromobiliare has suffered badly from the more difficult trading
conditions of the past two years. Mergers and acquisitions have declined,
while profits from equity activities have slumped.
Those factors, plus heavy write-downs on a stake in the VM motors company in
which Euromobiliare led a management buy-out in 1989, contributed to a L976m
group loss last year against net profits of L9.5bn in 1990.
The figures, along with Midland's assumption of a majority stake and
suggestions that Mr Vitale himself was tiring, may have prompted yesterday's
decision. However, Mr Vitale will remain on the board as a director.
Euromobiliare said acquiring Cofimedit would substantially reinforce its
existing fund management activities. The company has three regional offices
apart from its Florence base, and it should allow the bank substantially to
improve its coverage in retail fund management.
According to Euromobiliare, the acquisition marked one of a number of
initiatives now being taken to 'relaunch' the bank, which would seek to
concentrate on its core businesses of fund management, investment banking
and corporate finance and securities trading.

ST GEORGE Building Society, Australia's largest housing loans group,
yesterday unveiled taxable profits for the 11 months to end-April of
ADollars 44.49m (USDollars 33.4m), compared with ADollars 45.62m for the
full year to May 31 1991, Reuter reports from Sydney.
St George said it was issuing the results to ensure an informed market
before its Australian Stock Exchange listing on July 2. It will change its
status to a bank on July 1.
'The directors believe that, subject to completion of the audit process, the
group operating profit after tax and extraordinary items for the year ended
May 31 1992 will not be less than ADollars 48m,' St George said.
The profit was before a ADollars 3m extraordinary loss relating to the cost
of converting to bank status. St George said the figure represented
annualised earnings per share of 45.2 cents, against 45.0 cents previously.
Assets were ADollars 9.3bn at April 30, up 9.2 per cent from the end of the
previous year. Net tangible assets were ADollars 4 for each of the society's
109.1m shares, against ADollars 3.83.
St George will still focus on residential lending and retail deposits, and
it intends expanding its network in Victoria and Queensland.
St George said that, while the operating environment had been difficult, it
looked forward to more favourable trading conditions with the recovery of
the economy and business and consumer confidence.
'The directors expect there will be opportunities for St George to increase
its home and consumer lending receivables, and believe that St George is
well placed to meet the competitive challenges of the banking environment,'
it said.
St George said it has a capital adequacy ratio of 10.5 per cent, above the
Reserve Bank minimum of 8 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Toshiba pulls the plug on audio
equipment business - A look at the challenge the Japanese group is facing as
a new president takes over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics combine, has discreetly pulled out of
making radio-cassettes, compact disc players and other kinds of audio
equipment.
No factories have been closed or jobs cut. The operations have been quietly
subsumed into the group's television and video products business.
Nevertheless, a famous name has disappeared from hi-fi stores the world
over.
Toshiba's move out of audio is a sign of the way in which even the largest
Japanese groups are being forced to respond to a worldwide recession in the
electronics industry and a sharp increase in the cost of capital.
Moreover, Toshiba, which operates in information processing and power
engineering as well as consumer electronics, has been hit particularly hard
by the rapid onset of technological change in the computer and semiconductor
industries. In the late 1980s, it reaped bumper profits from pioneering new
ranges of memory chips and portable computers. Today, it is under pressure
in both markets.
Toshiba still prides itself in a wide product range, high research and
development spending, and its technological prowess. But these boasts are
hedged by a new-found concern for husbanding resources, particularly
capital.
'Our basic philosophy is to meet the needs of the people,' says Mr Fumio
Sato, who takes over as president tomorrow. 'However, before we used to make
anything that would sell. Now we must consider quality. That means, among
other things, our profit margins.'
Mr Sato, a softly-spoken mechanical engineer, was chosen by a group of
senior directors headed by the out-going president, Mr Joichi Aoi. He plans
to develop his predecessor's strategies rather than make any radical breaks
with the past. Yet he believes that, over time, companies must 'evolve
structurally in order to avoid becoming out-of-date'.
This challenge is particularly urgent today. After growing rapidly in the
late 1980s, Toshiba faces stagnant sales and falling profits, while the need
to keep pace with technological innovation demands greater investment. The
group's consolidated profits fell in the year to March by 44 per cent, and
sales were flat. The current year is unlikely to be much better.
Toshiba is trimming consolidated capital investment and research and
development spending by a few percentage points to Y480bn and Y310bn
respectively - but is not planning any large cuts.
Mr Sato says that following the decline in the Tokyo stock market, the
company's cost of capital has risen, so greater attention is being paid to
increasing capital efficiency. He gives the example of the clean room, the
building where the critical stages of making semiconductors are carried out
in an ultra-pure atmosphere.
Building clean rooms is so expensive that Toshiba is examining ways of
cramming more machines into a smaller space inside the clean room, for
example by removing control panels and housing them outside the clean room.
Cutting costs by pulling out of a business, as with audio, is a last resort.
The company prefers to move production overseas, particularly in Asian
countries where labour costs are low. If necessary, production can be
transferred entirely to local partners.
This policy is unaffected by the recession in the industry: even though
Toshiba has cut the Japanese parent company's capital investment budget for
this year by 25 per cent, the group total, including overseas subsidiaries,
is down by just 1 per cent.
Mr Sato believes Toshiba's future rests firmly in computer and semiconductor
manufacture, which account for about half the group's sales.
However, he acknowledges the group faces serious problems. In semiconductor
manufacture, Toshiba, like other Japanese makers, is losing money, since
prices for memory chips have plunged due to weak demand and intense
competition.
This is in sharp contrast to the late 1980s when Toshiba stole a march on
the rest of the industry by pioneering the mass production of IM D-Ram
memory chips, a top-selling product, and reaped profits from being first
into the market. However, the race to produce the next generation memory
device, the 4M D-Ram, resulted in no clear winner and wafer-thin margins.
Similarly, in computers, Toshiba beat other manufacturers in bringing to
market in the late 1980s a mid-priced portable laptop machine equipped with
many advanced features. But other manufacturers have since followed
Toshiba's lead, driving down prices and paring margins to the bone. Laptop
machines, a luxury five years ago, have become a commodity. Mr Sato says
Toshiba is planning to launch a new range of laptops later this year, but
declines to give details.
Mr Sato believes that to stay abreast of technological change Toshiba must
seek partners - as well as continuing to invest heavily in its own R and D.
Yesterday, the group announced a venture with Apple, the US computer maker,
for the joint development of multi-media - products which combine computing,
television and audio technology.
It already has a joint venture with IBM, the world's largest computer
company, for making colour liquid crystal displays for computers. It is
considering a second agreement with IBM for the joint development and
production of flash memories - a new generation microchip which could
replace the hard disk memory.
These partnerships are not restricted to hardware. Last year, Toshiba paid
Dollars 500m for a 6.25 per cent stake in the film and television interests
of Time Warner, the US entertainment conglomerate. Toshiba also took a 25
per cent stake in Time Warner Enterprises Japan, a Tokyo-based company which
will control Time Warner's Japanese businesses.
The complex structure of the deal reflects Toshiba's innate caution, as does
the relatively small size of the investment, which pales in comparison with
the multi-billion dollar acquisitions of Hollywood film and television
companies made by Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial.
Mr Sato says modestly that consumer electronics is a business about which he
still knows quite little. It is clear that his interests lie in the solid
virtues of engineering rather than the capricious delights of Hollywood.
Last year he served as the president of the Japan Society of Mechanical
Engineers. Among the society's main concerns was recruiting enough young
Japanese into engineering.
To the chagrin of industry, many engineering graduates turned their backs on
manufacturing in the late 1980s for the high salaries of financial services.
However, Mr Sato, says that more recently young people seem to be changing
their minds. 'The collapse of the bubble economy has led young people to
re-evaluate the merits of manufacturing.'
Manufacturing is very dear to Mr Sato. He is convinced that, even though the
current downturn in the Japanese economy is severe, recovery will come
eventually because Japanese industry retains its international
competitiveness in manufacturing. 'As far as manufacturing is concerned,
Japan will stay in a strong position for some time to come.'

TAIWAN'S central bank has agreed to provide USDollars 790m to help fund
purchases of aircraft by EVA Airways, the island's second international
airline, Reuter reports from Taipei.
A central bank official said the loan was the largest made from Dollars 10bn
of foreign currency reserves which the bank set aside in February to finance
major economic projects and overseas investment by local companies.
The Dollars 790m will be lent to a consortium of 15 local banks, headed by
state-owned Chiao Tung Bank, which agreed to a 12-year loan of USDollars
1.05bn to EVA earlier this year.
EVA, set up last July by the Evergreen Group, the container shipping
operator, will use the loan to buy four Boeing 767s, eight Boeing 747s and
six McDonnell Douglas MD-11s that it has already ordered. All are to be
delivered by 1995.
The airline flies five jets to eight destinations, most in south-east Asia.
It will start flying to the US at the end of the year and hopes to start
flights to Vietnam and Australia.

fourth quarter'

<TEXT>
FIRST Chicago, the leading midwest regional bank, expects over-ambitious
third-quarter production schedules in the auto industry to increase the risk
of the US economy petering out in the fourth quarter.
First Chicago said that the auto industry, a pillar of the US economy, could
provide a repeat of America's disappointing 1991 economic performance.
Last year, the industry, whose production is concentrated in the midwest,
led an incipient recovery then badly faltered in the fourth quarter,
prolonging the recession.
Despite lacklustre selling rates, the industry's third-quarter production is
scheduled to rise by 15.5 per cent from the second quarter to a 11.8m
monthly rate, its highest level for the three years.
Sales, including imports, last month reached 12.7m. This represented a
recovery from their trough of a 11.2m monthly rate at the start of the Gulf
war, but was still below the 1990 peak.
While the boost in production may add more than 1.5 percentage points to the
US real GDP for the next quarter, the bank said, 'the auto industry could
place a drag on growth in the fourth quarter'.
It noted, however, that automakers might yet trim their production schedules
more realistically for the third quarter.
On the bright side, the bank said the market share of US-based car
manufacturers, including Japanese cars made in the US, had risen to 83 per
cent from 78 per cent between May 1991 and May 1992.

KYMMENE, the Finnish forestry group, made a FM370m (Dollars 87m) loss (after
financial items) in the first four months of the year. This compares with a
FM73m loss for the same period of 1991 and a deficit last year of FM843m.
Mr Harri Piehl, the company's chief executive officer, said Kymmene would
make a 'significant loss' this year but it would be 'clearly less' than in
1991. He added that earnings are expected to 'have turned into profit' by
the end of the year.
A gross profit of FM618m for the first four months amounted to 14.2 per cent
of turnover and contrasted with a figure of FM604m for the same period of
last year, or 14 per cent of turnover.
Turnover was slightly up on the first four months of 1991 to FM4.36bn from
FM4.32bn a year earlier.

water brands
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, the French foods group which sided with Nestle of Switzerland in the
battle for Perrier, is selling two Italian mineral water brands formerly
owned jointly with the Agnelli family's IFIL holding company.
Although worth only around L25bn (Dollars 21m), the deal represents a
further upheaval in the European mineral water business in the wake of the
Perrier takeover. Following that transaction, the European Commission
expressed concern about the shares of the French mineral water market held
by Nestle and BSN.
The sale of BSN's Sangemini and Fabia brands is not believed to be linked
with the Perrier deal. Rather, BSN has now decided to concentrate on
Ferrarelle and Boario, its two biggest-selling marques in Italy. Ferrarelle
and Boario account for around 80 per cent of the L500bn turnover of BSN's
Italian mineral water activities, against L100bn for the two marques being
sold.
Sangemini and Favia are being acquired by a joint venture between Terme
Demaniali di Acqui, a quoted holding company, and Mr Massimo Violati, whose
family controlled Sangemini until 1987.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMEN of seven French state-owned companies were yesterday
re-appointed for fresh three-year terms by the cabinet, which also confirmed
the change of leadership at Bull, the loss-making computer maker.
This concludes the first stage of a review of the top jobs in France's
powerful public sector. The second round, a dozen jobs covering banking,
insurance, public transport and energy supply, is due to be settled at next
Wednesday's cabinet meeting.
Yesterday's reappointments include Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the controversial
chairman of the bank Credit Lyonnais. He has been criticised for expanding
too fast and making too many risky loans, but has the support of Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the prime minister. The remaining six are the chairmen of Air
France; Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging group; Elf Aquitaine in oil;
the Thomson electronics group; Banque Hervet; and Anvar, the applied
research agency.
Mr Beregovoy has said he wants to make as few changes as possible in the 45
public sector jobs up for review this year. But he is expected next week to
ask for chairmen of Banque Nationale de Paris, the largest government-owned
bank; Electricite de France, the power utility; and Aerospatiale, the
aircraft maker, to step down because they reach the statutory retirement age
of 65 next year.
Other jobs expected to come up for review next week include the
chairmanships of the three state-owned insurance companies, Union des
Assurances de Paris, Groupe GAN and Assurances Generales de France. One or
two insurers could see changes as a side-effect of the retirement of Mr Rene
Thomas, chairman of BNP.
Snecma, the aircraft engine maker, could see a change because its current
chairman, Mr Louis Gallois, is a candidate to replace Mr Henri Martre at
Aerospatiale.

year's sales and profits

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER at Daimler-Benz, the German engineering, aerospace and electronics
group, is likely to be around the 'magic DM100bn mark' this year, up from
DM95bn (Dollars 60.1bn) last year, the company's chief executive reiterated
yesterday.
At the company's annual meeting in Berlin, Mr Edzard Reuter said that
profits were also likely to be ahead of last year's result, but gave no
other details.
This confirms Mr Reuter's optimism as signalled last month when Daimler
reported a 14 per cent increase in first-quarter net profits (to DM480m) and
turnover up 16 per cent to DM22bn.
He stressed that the group's aim was to continue increasing the dividend in
line with growth in profits. It lifted the dividend last year, from DM12 to
DM13 a share, for the first time in six years, following an 8 per cent rise
in net profits to DM1.9bn for the year.
He outlined a number of general risks facing the company in the remaining
months of the year,
but he said Daimler faced the future with 'quiet and confident optimism'.
At Mercedes-Benz, Daimler's vehicle subsidiary, turnover is expected to rise
4.5 per cent to DM70bn this year.
On the passenger vehicle side, he said the new S-Class luxury car model was
proving extraordinarily successful. However, general weakness in world
markets meant that in total unit sales of cars were not as good as had been
hoped at the beginning of the year.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING differences between the two main shareholders of Fondiaria, Italy's
third-biggest insurer, yesterday led to the appointment of Mr Carlo Sama as
a second managing director to flank Mr Alfonso Scarpa.
Mr Sama is managing director of Montedison, the industrial group controlled
by Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), of which he is also deputy chairman.
Ferruzzi, which used to own the majority of Fondiaria, shares control
through a holding company owned jointly with Mr Camillo De Benedetti.
Under Mr Scarpa's guidance, Fondiaria has managed to steer a course through
changes of ownership and the vicissitudes of the Italian market to emerge as
one of Europe's most dynamic insurers.
It has drawn closer to Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB) in Germany
and Royal Insurance in the UK. Fondiaria now owns 20 per cent of AMB, while
earlier this year it was a founder-member with AMB and Royal of European
Partners for Insurance Co-operation, a joint venture to co-ordinate the
three companies' future expansion in Europe outside their home markets.
But although Fondiaria has remained profitable, there have been growing
rumours that Ferruzzi has been dissatisfied with its performance. The
comments have gained credence in view of the decline in the Ferruzzi group's
own financial performance.
Ferfin has regularly denied any plans to pull out of Fondiaria. However, the
carefully-orchestrated leaks about keeping a close eye on Mr Scarpa's
management, indicates a growing concern with Fondiaria's future.
Both men stressed yesterday that the appointment was harmonious. 'Carlo Sama
was nominated to underline the Ferruzzi group's interest in Fondiaria and
scotch certain rumours about disinvesting", said Mr Scarpa.
'Ferruzzi has a very important investment in Fondiaria and it is right that
there should be a manager-entrepreneur who occupies himself more directly in
its running,' according to Mr Sama.

PIRELLI, the loss-making Italian tyres and cables concern, yesterday
announced it had agreed the first of a series of disposals aimed at lowering
its debts and speeding a return to profitability, writes Haig Simonian.
The group is selling for L41.9bn (Dollars 35m) its bedding activities, one
of the seven business units in the diversified products division now up for
sale. The transaction, which involves one of the smallest business units
under the hammer, will realise an extraordinary gain of L25.4bn for the
parent company.
The bedding business, which makes beds, mattresses and associated textile
products, has a turnover of around L100bn. The disposal should ease the
Pirelli group's net indebtedness by around L63bn, it said.
The business is being bought by Overseas Partners International and
Eurosuez, an offshoot of the French Suez banking group.

FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: AMB seeks a solution to its BfG
poser - A look at problems facing Germany's second largest insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER recent weeks, bankers and insurance executives have been holding secret
meetings in Paris and Frankfurt.
At stake is the fate of BfG Bank, Germany's sixth-biggest private commercial
bank - and ultimately the independence of Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligungs (AMB), majority owner of BfG and Germany's second largest
insurance group.
AMB is under siege from Assurances Generales de Paris (AGF), a state - owned
French insurance company which has amassed a 25 per cent plus holding in
AMB. Exploiting an arcane aspect of German company law, AMB's management has
refused to register the votes attaching to the majority of the AGF stake.
Although relations between AGF and AMB are in public far from cordial, the
two parties are holding behind-the - scenes talks in which the fate of the
loss-making BfG Bank plays a central role.
Last week, Mr Wolf - Dieter Baumgartl, chief executive of AMB, met Mr Michel
Albert, president of AGF, in Paris. Also attending the meeting were
representatives of Credit Lyonnais, the big state-owned French bank.
Thereafter, high - level talks have taken place in Germany.
It is thought that AGF is trying to broker a deal whereby Credit Lyonnais,
the state-owned French bank, buys a stake in BfG.
This would suit everybody. It would remove pressure on AMB to carry on
supporting its banking subsidiary.
In return for this favour, AMB management could be expected to come to a
compromise over AGF's voting rights. The big French bank would gain access
to the German market.
While other big German banks reported record profits for last year, the BfG
parent bank announced on Tuesday that it lost DM277m (Dollars 175.3m) in
1991, compared with a profit of DM338m in 1990, reflecting rationalisation
costs and the bank's exposure to problem country debt.
Mr Paul Wieandt, BfG's chief executive and architect of its restructuring in
recent years, has made no secret that he would welcome an international
banking partner - and that the financially-strong Credit Lyonnais would be a
good choice.
For its part, AMB has made it clear that in principle it would welcome a
reduction of its commitment to the bank.
AMB bought its majority stake in BfG in 1987 for DM1.9bn. The idea was to
develop BfG - then known as the Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft - as a banking
outlet for its insurance products. It got more than it bargained for. For a
complex series of reasons, BfG soon proved to a serious drain on AMB's
resources. It was inefficient and had to engage in costly rationalisation.
It had high exposure to problem sovereign debt, requiring increasingly heavy
provisions. It was also involved in the costly rescue of Co op, the retailer
which nearly went bankrupt in 1989.
The net result is that in 1990 and 1991 AMB - together with BGAG, the trades
union holding company which holds the balance of BfG shares - had to inject
a total of DM1.5bn into the bank.
It seems certain that BfG requires a further capital injection, despite
signs of an improvement in operating performance at the bank last year.
On Tuesday, Mr Wieandt said that after exceptional and extraordinary costs
and revenues, the parent bank made a partial operating profit - that is,
excluding own-account trading results - of DM60m last year, compared with a
loss of DM259m in 1990.
However, he made it clear that the bank's difficulties were not yet over,
partly because further rationalisation is required, partly because of the
bank's high exposure to problem country debt. That exposure - to a total of
32 countries - stands at DM3.3bn and the intention is to increase provisions
from 51 per cent of this sum at the end of last year to 60 per cent by the
end of this year.
Mr Wieandt indicated that the bank's equity capital may need a boost of at
at least a further DM450m, to make sure that the bank can continue to expand
its lending under tougher capital adequacy rules.
Market sources suggest that the shareholders may have to inject a further
DM400m, mainly to help the bank increase its provisioning.
According to Mr Wieandt, the bank is unlikely to be able to stand entirely
on its own feet until 1994.
This means that there is a considerable economic incentive for AMB to come
to an agreement with Credit Lyonnais and AGF in the months ahead.

price
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader, coach and bus manufacturer and distributor
which has changed its name from Plaxton, yesterday warned that it would make
a loss in the first half of 1992 and saw its shares slump 22p to 55p on the
news.
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the problem area was the coach and bus
manufacturing plant in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, where some of the 750
jobs would be cut in the autumn following a review by management
consultants.
Henlys had already cut coach production by closing three plants and
concentrating production at the Scarborough plant. Mr Wood said that despite
this action more was needed as demand had fallen again, even after a 60 per
cent drop in the previous 18 months.
He said that there were also teething problems with the group's new range of
coaches. Henlys, which has half the UK market for luxury coaches but does
not export them, has been trying to enter the Continental European market by
introducing a range meeting European standards.
Mr Wood said that other parts of the group were showing improved results,
but that City forecasts of a small profit for the year were too optimistic.
Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, is now forecasting an annual loss of Pounds
2.5m.
In 1991 the group made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.8m, including an interim
loss of Pounds 4.5m.
Mr Wood said that cash flow was within budgeted levels and balance sheet
gearing was in line with the 65 per cent recorded at the end of 1991.

Cassidy Brothers, the USM-quoted toys, games and sports goods group,

Mr Thomas Cassidy, the chairman, said that orders were 10 per cent up on

pointed to a further increase in turnover which the company was well
equipped to satisfy.
Earnings per share advanced to 9.07p (4.32p) and a proposed final dividend
of 1.65p (1.5p) makes a total of 2.4p (1.5p).

year to March 31.
In what the company termed 'a miserable year' sales fell to Pounds 59.6m
(Pounds 66m). Profit on property sales contributed Pounds 318,000 (Pounds
186,000). In the comparable 12 twelve months the pre-tax loss was Pounds
383,000.
Mr Christopher Latham, chairman, said that within importing activities panel
products trading had remained comfortably in profit, but timber trading had
produced a mixed performance overall.
The final dividend has been cut to 2.25p (4.5p) for a reduced total of 3.75p
(6.5p). Losses per share came though at 8.7p (7.1p).

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Arthur Lee rises to Pounds 604,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Arthur Lee &amp; Sons, the steel and plastics maker, rose 6p to 98p
yesterday following the announcement of a rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 323,000 to Pounds 604,000 for the half year ended March 31.
Directors said the improvement in part reflected action to reduce costs,
particularly of raw materials and staffing levels where numbers fell to
1,268 against 1,427 a year earlier.
Turnover of the continuing operations slipped from Pounds 53.7m to Pounds
51.3m. Earnings amounted to 1.28p (1.05p) and the interim dividend is a
same-again 1.65p.
The directors pointed out that although the volume of deliveries in some of
the group's steel-based operations was currently showing some modest uplift
compared with the levels attained in the depth of the recession and, in
plastics, demand for medical moulding was encouraging, competition remained
intense.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bristol Water turns in Pounds 5.24m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL WATER HOLDINGS yesterday reported its first annual result since it
came to the market in November 1991.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March came out at Pounds 5.24m and were
achieved from turnover of Pounds 47.9m. In the previous year pre-tax profits
were Pounds 2.97m and turnover was Pounds 42.1m.
Sir John Wills, chairman, said the improvement in profits had been achieved
with the assistance of a cost-cutting programme which had helped secure the
effi-ciency gains necessary for the core business to grow satisfactorily.
The board took a conservative view of diversification, he said, believing
that the maintenance and development of the core water supply business
should be the company's first priority.
A final dividend of 18.7p makes a 28p total. The dividend is covered 2.5
times by earnings per share of 68.9p (38.9p).
Following consultation with the Director General of Water Services, prices
for 1993 would increase by an average 7.3 per cent - 1.1 per cent below the
maximum permitted, Sir John said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Courts (Furnishers) suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.05m to
Pounds 8.09m for the year ended March 31, with the trading environment
remaining exceptionally difficult throughout the period.
The 11 per cent downturn in profits was after taking account of interest
charges of Pounds 5.37m (Pounds 5.52m), a transfer to deferred profit of
Pounds 5.31m (Pounds 5.55m) and property disposal losses of Pounds 560,000
(profit Pounds 1.64m). On the plus side there was a Pounds 1.28m share of
profit from the new Trinidad associate.
Earnings worked through at 19.7p (23.8p). A final dividend of 3.17p holds
the total at 5p.
Group turnover increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 184m. The figure excluded
any contribution from the Trinidad associate but included the depreciatory
effects of the 66 per cent devaluation of the Jamaican dollar.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Price competition causes Hoskyns' dive to
Pounds 5.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Hoskyns, the UK-based computing services company owned by
Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, nosedived in the first half as the recession
and fierce price competition squeezed margins relentlessly.
Profits before tax in the six months to April 30 fell 35 per cent to Pounds
5.6m (Pounds 8.6m) pushing earnings per share 39 per cent lower at 3.9p
(6.4p).
Turnover fell to Pounds 95.7m (Pounds 102.8m) suggesting that the company's
reputation for unbroken growth may not be restored quickly.
The interim dividend of 0.75p is being maintained, however, in the
expectation of improved trading in the second half.
Mr Geoff Unwin, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected the
grim trading conditions prevailing. In addition, the company's strong
performance in the first half of 1991 made comparisons even less favourable.
'Our order book in most parts of the business is looking healthier and our
increasing headcount reflects a stronger demand for our services. However,
we still se no signs of recovery in certain areas and margins remain tight.'
Hoskyns has proved a reliable performer over the past 13 years, coupling
sound management with market leadership in fast growing areas such as
facilities management.
Mr Unwin said that while consultancy and systems integration work were
producing reasonable returns, the education and training market was
exceptionally tough.
Price competition was forcing down profits margins in facilities management
to unwise levels.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Recession trims First Leisure interim
profit - Pounds 70m discos and bowling alleys expansion planned over the
next two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST LEISURE, the ten-pin bowling, discotheque and theatre group, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits lower at Pounds 11.7m, compared with Pounds 12.1m,
for the half year to May 3 1992.
The results reflected the continued effect of the recession, with turnover
showing a marginal decline from Pounds 46.88m to Pounds 46.11m, as spending
was reduced.
Lord Delfont, chairman, said that the group had yet to experience any
sustained improvement in customer demand and he expected difficult trading
conditions to prevail throughout the second half.
Mr John Conlan, chief executive, said the group managed to hold ground in
some key divisions and he expected an improvement in second half trading,
particularly in discotheques and bowling, as more new openings and
refurbishments come on stream.
He said that the expansion programme would be unaffected by the current
trading climate. There are three discos and eight bowling alleys planned to
open over the next two years, which together with refurbishments will
involve a Pounds 35m a year capital expenditure plan.
The profit was struck after taking account of a decline from Pounds 1.45m to
Pounds 1.03m on property disposal profits but after a drop in interest
charges from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.6m.
Earnings per share rose, from 5.83p to 5.88p, and the interim dividend is
raised to 1.88p from 1.745p.
The resorts business, which includes Blackpool Tower, turned in the best
relative performance, increasing pre-tax profit 17 per cent to Pounds 1.4m
after fine Easter weather improved demand.
Profits from ten-pin bowling Pounds 7.2m, with Mr Conlan pointing out that
last year's figures also benefited from four new outlets, compared with just
one for this period.
Discotheques profits declined from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 6.1m, with the
jewel in the group's crown - the Empire (now Equinox) in London's Leicester
Square - closed for a Pounds 2m refurbishment.
COMMENT
Sticking slowly but tenaciously to its unglamorous niches, First Leisure
continues to enhance its market share and maintain its margins. Yesterday's
interim figures were a bit better than expected and the company is confident
of second-half improvement as refurbishments and expansion pay off. But its
warnings of tough second-half trading led to a shaving of full-year
forecasts to around Pounds 32m for a p/e of 19. The rating fully reflects
First Leisure's recessionary strengths and growth potential when the economy
improves. Investors looking for greater exhilaration in the leisure sector
will find it more diversified and underperforming stocks.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Southern Business shows 10% advance to
Pounds 7.11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Business Group, the photocopier and vending machine supplier which
has had its share price overshadowed until recently by criticism of its copy
agreements and accounting practices, has announced a 10 per cent increase in
interim profits.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 6.47m to Pounds 7.11m in the six months to
March 31 helped by recent acquisitions.
Mr David McErlain, chairman, said an aggressive marketing programme launched
a year ago led to a small increase in copy volumes.
Turnover was 10 per cent higher at Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 24.9m), reflecting
organic growth, the impact of acquisi-tions and some price increases.
Mr McErlain said the group continued to consider opportunities for further
acquisitions complementary to its activities which offered a good potential
return on the initial investment.
Forward contracted income, revenue the company stands to receive from
outstanding contracts, increased by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 305m.
Net borrowings were stable at Pounds 2.8m with gearing at 5 per cent.
Earnings per share were 8.8 per cent ahead at 4.93p (4.53p) and the interim
dividend is raised by 11.7 per cent to 1.15p (1.03p).
The company has recently renewed a five-year agree-ment with Canon, which
accounts for about 85 per cent of the photocopier machines Southern Business
supplies.
The shares closed unchanged at 110p.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: AAH improves 12% to Pounds 32.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AAH HOLDINGS, the diversi-fied distribution group, reported a 12 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 on the back of a strong
performance from healthcare services.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 28.7m to Pounds 32.2m. Turnover rose
from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.3bn.
Sales benefited from the group's acquisition of two warehouses from
Medicopharma, a significant competitor, which withdrew from the UK market in
November.
A subsequent inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission delayed
integration of the acquired warehouses and recommended the divestment of a
third warehouse in Aberdeen. The group is now rationalising the two new
warehouses into its network.
Healthcare services, which now account for 73 per cent of trading profit,
reported increased profits of Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 22.4m).
Environmental services also reported increased profits of Pounds 4.3m
(Pounds 3.6m) helped by increased tenders for local authority land
maintenance and waste management contracts.
Three divisions continued to be affected by the recession: builders supplies
saw its profits fall from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2.6m, consumer products fell
from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2m and distribution services were down from
Pounds 1m to Pounds 600,000.
Mr Bill Pybus, chairman, said he was confident that all three would pick up
once the economy improved. Their share of the overall trading profit, which
increased to Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 32.9m), is likely to continue to fall.
Increased working capital pushed up average borrow-ings to Pounds 39.8m
(Pounds 28.3m) against shareholders' funds of Pounds 138.2m.
A final dividend of 10.95p lifts the total to 16.35p (14.85p). Earnings per
share rose to 31.8p (29.7p).
COMMENT
The group's mainstream healthcare businesses will be further boosted this
year from the withdrawal of Medicopharma, which in the past has been
regarded as one of its most significant competitors. With the MMC inquiry
out of the way the group has started rationalising its warehouses, which is
expected to lead to a reduction in the total number from 27 to 15. First
time contributions from retail pharmacies acquired during the year should
ensure that the division continues to report increased profits. More than 85
per cent of the profits are now generated by two divisions, healthcare and
environ-mental services, in growing markets. Forecast pre-tax profits of
Pounds 38.5m put the shares, which yesterday rose 5p to close at 518p, on a
prospec-tive multiple of 15. They look fairly priced at a premium to the
market.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Regulator concerned about future of LBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADIO Authority is monitoring closely the state of Crown Communications,
the loss-making company that owns LBC, London's speech-based commercial
radio station.
On Monday Crown reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.58m in the six months to
March 31, a performance that compared with losses of Pounds 4.68m at the
interim stage last time and losses of Pounds 6.79m in the year to last
September.
The main concern of the Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio,
is with the future of LBC, a station that has been increasing its share of
the audience and trading profitably.
The Authority, it is believed, has had preliminary discussions with
potential investors to try to safeguard the position of LBC if the financial
position of Crown were to deteriorate.
Two years ago Crown shares were trading at 250p, but by this week the price
had fallen to 8p.
In common with other media businesses the company has been hit by the
recession, but in Crown's case this has been exacerbated by losses from an
investment in RFM, a radio network with 89 stations in France.
Mr Christopher Chataway, Crown's chairman, said yesterday that the company
would be reducing its stake in French radio but maintaining a presence.
Partners were also being sought for other Crown businesses such as IRS, the
commercial radio sales house.
Mr Chataway has assured shareholders that the company still has the support
of its banks. Last month Price Waterhouse, Crown's auditors, said they
believed there were adequate financial resources for the foreseeable future
but some aspects of the accounts relating to the RFM investment had been
qualified.
LBC's licence comes up for renewal in March 1993.
It is clear that if LBC were to become embroiled in any way in the financial
problems of its parent there are investors ready to move in.
The general stance of the Radio Authority is to try to keep stations on the
air where possible.
Meanwhile in a separate development yesterday Lord Chalfont, chairman of the
Radio Authority, told the Association of Commercial Radio Companies they
were getting a bit too agitated about the re-franchising round starting in
the autumn.
'The Radio Authority has no predisposition to change for change's sake,'
Lord Chalfont said.
Later he added that the 'large majority of existing stations would get new
licences if they were performing successfully.'

Pounds 15m

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOGG ROBINSON, the travel, transport and financial services company,
yesterday announced a sharp increase in profits compared to 1990-'91, when
its travel business was hit by the Gulf war.
Pre-tax profits rose 86 per cent to Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 8.16m) in the year
to March 31, on sales up 11 per cent at Pounds 102.5m (Pounds 92.5m).
At the interim stage, which covers the busy summer holiday period, profits
improved by almost a quarter to Pounds 10.85m on sales of Pounds 52m (Pounds
48.6m).
The results were slightly ahead of expectations and the shares gained 7p to
220p.
Mr Brian Perry, chairman and managing director, said all divisions had
performed well, especially financial counselling and European transport.
Bookings for this summer through the company's 214 high street travel
agencies were running at about 8 per cent ahead of last year.
'But it's been declining in the last six weeks and a hoped for surge after
the election didn't materialise,' he said.
The travel division turned from operating losses of Pounds 2.63m - caused by
the Gulf war and Pounds 3m of cost cutting - to profits of Pounds 4.44m.
Following last year's rationalisation involving 200 job losses, productivity
increased 16 per cent. Business travel also improved.
Transport, which covers commercial freight operations in Europe and the
Falkland Islands, lifted operating profits to Pounds 4.66m (Pounds 3.92m).
Turnover was helped by a five-month contribution from Belgian trailer
company Dens group, acquired last year for Pounds 6.83m.
Financial services, which saw good growth advising on employee pensions,
lifted operating profits to Pounds 4.65m (Pounds 3.66m).
Interest payments fell to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 4.44m) due to lower interest
rates and a Pounds 4m fall in net cash to Pounds 29m at the year end.
Earnings almost doubled to 14.01p (7.4p). The total dividend payment for the
year is 6.3p (5.55p), via a recommended final of 3.8p (3.3p).

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Tarmac begins disposal programme with US
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, has announced the sale for Dollars 42.5m (Pounds 22.9m) of its
Californian contracting and aggregate operations, making it the latest
British construction group to begin a disposal programme to reduce heavy
borrowings.
Mr Neville Simms, recently appointed chief executive, wants to raise between
Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m from sales of non-core businesses.
Earlier this week Costain, another large British construction group,
announced plans to float off part of its profitable Australian coal mining
subsidiary in a further move to reduce borrowings.
Wimpey, the construction and engineering group which is Britain's second
biggest house builder, has raised more than Pounds 300m during the past 12
months from disposals. Taylor Woodrow, another large contractor, has
announced a similar programme to dispose of non-core and underperforming
assets to reduce debts.
At the end of last year Tarmac had net borrowings of Pounds 456.9m and
gearing of 51 per cent. Mr Simms has said that he wanted to reduce gearing
to 25 per cent, mainly through disposals. It is hoped that more than Pounds
100m will be raised from a first phase of sales, to include the Californian
construction business and the British oil refining interests at Ellesmere
Port and Dundee.
A second phase of disposals will include Econowaste, the UK waste disposal
business, which went on the market last week, and which Tarmac expects to
fetch between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m.
Granite Construction of the US has bought the Californian businesses. The
businesses were acquired by Tarmac in 1986 for about Dollars 20m.
Tarmac, which is Britain's biggest house builder, also has housebuilding
operations in Washington state and Maryland, which are being retained.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BTP alters focus after Pounds 18.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the specialist chemicals company, yesterday reported a marginal
increase in profits over the previous record year, in difficult trading
conditions.
Mr Rob Martin, finance director, said the new year had started on a 'firm
note,' mainly because of foreign markets, which will account for two thirds
of sales this year. There was no sign of demand rising in the UK.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds 18.2m
on sales up 14 per cent at Pounds 175m (Pounds 153m). Margins in the
chemicals division had come under particular pressure in the UK due to the
recession and because growth had been concentrated in the less profitable
overseas markets.
Earnings fell from 15.39p to 14.81p, but the company proposes an increased
final dividend of 5.75p (5.45p) giving a total for the year of 8.85p (8.4p).
Due to the Pounds 28m rights issue in February, part of which was used to
buy two French adhesive businesses, the year ended with Pounds 6.5m of cash,
compared with Pounds 8m of debt last year.
Mr Martin said benefits would increase from reducing dependence on the UK
market. By the end of this year, the company would derive only a third of
its sales from the UK, down from 38 per cent in 1991/92, with another third
derived from continental Europe and 20 per cent in the US.
Sales in the chemicals division rose 20 per cent to Pounds 91m but operating
profits were only 10 per cent up at Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 10.2m). Industrial
sales rose to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 46.7m) but profits fell from Pounds 4.58m
to Pounds 4.08m following poor performances in the storage and coatings
businesses.
BTP shares fell 3p to 238p.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wagon Industrial falls in line with
forecasts to Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Wagon Industrial Holdings fell from Pounds 21.5m to
Pounds 14.1m in the year to March 31, pretty much in line with forecasts.
The shares rose 1p to 442p.
Mr John Hudson, chief executive, said Wagon had 'taken the bad news on the
chin' - there were exceptional costs of Pounds 2.06m, provided for in the
first half, relating to factory and product restruc-turing.
While continuing its policy of 'selective' and 'infilling' acquisitions,
often from the receiver - thereby enlarging the customer base for modest
outlay and increasing throughput - the group has undergone 18 months of
'rationalising our main sites and downsizing the continuing ones'.
With its net cash pile growing to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 12.2m), Mr Hudson
said Wagon would continue its acquisition strategy 'indefinitely'.
Trading profits of the material handling and storage side fell to Pounds
8.81m (Pounds 10.7m) on turnover of Pounds 99.4m (Pounds 105.8m). Link 51
and the other shelving and racking companies 'experienced flat or declining
volumes', according to Mr Paul Taylor, chairman.
The engineering division's profits declined to Pounds 3.02m (Pounds 6.54m)
on turnover of Pounds 58.2m (Pounds 62m).
Mr Hudson said Paul Forkardt, the German machine tool maker, had a bad year
as its East German and eastern European markets disappeared and its western
markets suffered from recession.
Automotive products provided the best news with a profits advance to Pounds
5.43m (Pounds 4.82m).
Earnings were 23.72p (38.51p) per share at the basic level and 23.72p
(35.89p) fully diluted. The total dividend was maintained at 17p with an
unchanged final of 10.675p.
COMMENT
With the recovery in UK markets neither immediate nor even anticipated in
the longer term, Mr Hudson and his team have shown themselves to be good
managers in recession. In bold moves they have actively tackled the thorny
cost base problem - working capital is down Pounds 7.3m, capital expenditure
is one-and-a-half times depreciation, Pounds 4m-Pounds 4.5m has been lopped
off the fixed overhead and cash generation has been good in a bad year.
Cheap infill acquisitions suit slow economic growth, though Wagon has the
cash for anything larger, should it want to splash out. Pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 19m are expected for the current year, with earnings between
32.3p and 34p per share. This gives a prospective multiple of about 13.3. As
a quality cyclical stock with recovery potential, accumulation would carry
little risk.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: ML Pounds 2.24m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL losses of Pounds 3.26m at ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence
and electronics distribution company, pushed the company into a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 2.24m for the year ending March 31 1992 compared with a profit of
Pounds 6.29m the previous year.
ML, which parted company with its chief executive on Tuesday, said it was
planning to make disposals to reduce its 114 per cent year-end gearing.
Mr Timothy Sallitt, the chairman and acting chief executive, said that the
results were 'unsatisfactory'.
Cutting debt remained a high priority. That would be achieved by cuts in
working capital and 'disposals of under-utilised assets and businesses not
central to the company.'
The exceptional losses were the result of staff cuts of 20 per cent over 15
months. An extraordinary Pounds 762,000 loss was a consequence of disposals.
The reduction in the company's size was reflected in the turnover for the
year of Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 92.4m). The loss per share was 5.1p (8.3p
earnings) and the final dividend is cut to 1p (2.6p) for a 1.85p (3.45p)
total.
Mr Sallitt said the disposals would not be in the company's defence
businesses of weapon launching and decoy systems, which were performing
strongly.
The company said it would return to profit this year with analysts
estimating more than Pounds 2.5m pre-tax.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: London Elec up 38% and stresses dividend
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Electricity yesterday reported a 38 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 142.5m for the year to March 31 and made the strongest
dividend statement of any electricity company so far.
'We have always maintained the prudent policy of growth broadly in line with
underlying earnings, and expect to see that sustained,' said Mr Roger Urwin,
chief executive. The company increased its final dividend to 11.8p (10.45p)
for a total of 16.8p (10.45p).
This followed warnings by other companies that the bumper dividend increases
of this year would be a one off.
Underlying London's confidence are the best customer service and the lowest
tariff increases this year of all 12 regional electricity companies.
The core electricity distribution business accounted for most of the advance
from the pro forma pre-tax figure of Pounds 103.3m. Earnings per share rose
from 34.7p to 47.5p.
About Pounds 39m of the increase in distribution operating profit to Pounds
158.3m was due to an extra increase in tariffs in April 1991, to compensate
for undercharging the year before.
The electricity supply business made Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 9.8m) after bad
debts rose from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 12.6m.
The City forecasts pre-tax profit of Pounds 162m-Pounds 183m this year,
putting the company on a prospective p/e of between 6.5 and 7.5. The
dividend is expected to be 18.5p-19p.
COMMENT
London is nothing if not upfront, and should be commended at least for
attacking retail and contracting, where other companies have left them to
vegetate. And publicly pouring money into restructuring suggests that it
believes it can turn the businesses round. Roger Urwin inspires City
confidence, and the company's direct approach means it is good at giving
nitty gritty numbers. But - perhaps because of its directness - London has
always been bad at marketing itself. Manweb, for example, has a similar
strategy, but has won hearts by promoting itself as the company that 'sticks
to the knitting.' Whether this bodes ill for London's retailing operation
remains to be seen.

FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Kenwood just over-subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC offering of shares in Kenwood, the kitchen appliance manufacturer
which will begin trading on the market next week, was only just
over-subscribed, Schroders, the merchant bank sponsoring the flotation said
yesterday.
Subscribers will therefore be allocated only slightly less than they wanted.
Some 11.61m shares were on offer.
The same number of Kenwood shares were placed with insititutions at 285p on
June 17, valuing the group at Pounds 104.5m.
Schroders said it was aware that there was institutional demand for shares
at the placing stage which had not been immediately satisfied.
The same institutions did not, however, appear to have applied in any great
scale for additional shares in the public offering.
Analysts said the relatively low subscription level and the soggy nature of
the market in general might lead advisers to other imminent flotations -
like MFI, Taunton and Anglian Windows - to reconsider their pricing in order
to avoid leaving shares with underwriters.
The Kenwood placing was structured in such a way that institutions which
applied for shares in the placing also participated in underwriting the
public offering.
Analysts said that given the current gloom pervading the stock market, the
institutions declined the public offering because they were nervous they
might be left with an undersubscribed offer.
Depending on conditions in the stock market, the institutions could try to
build the stakes they require in the aftermarket once the shares start to
trade on July 1.
Analysts do not expect the shares to open at a significant premium to the
flotation price.

<TEXT>
JLI Group, the dried fruit, nuts and pickle ingredients processor, raised
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 3.17m in the year to March 31,
just beating the forecast made with its most recent rights issue.
The company made two rights issues during the period, raising Pounds 20.7m
net and increasing the share capital by 125 per cent, and made or lined up
five acquisitions.
group has decided to concentrate on its food processing businesses where it
can add value and improve margins.
Group turnover in the 12 months fell to Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 90.1m), though
this was after the merchanting division sales fell from Pounds 24.1m to
Pounds 8.2m before being discontinued.
Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive, said some of the acquisitions had been
loss-making when they joined the group, but had been turned round,
Reduced interest payable of Pounds 940,000 (Pounds 1.7m) boosted pre-tax
profits. A lower rate of tax partly offset the effect of the increase in
share capital, which held earnings per share growth to 16 per cent from a
restated 8p to 9.3p.
As forecast with the rights, a proposed final dividend of 3p (2.87p) lifts
the total to 4.5p (4.3p).

FT  25 JUN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Don't overdo the UK deficit hysteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One advantage - some may say disadvantage - of an undergraduate education in
economics some years ago is that one is unlikely to tremble with rage at a
budget deficit, a supposedly low level of savings or similar examples of
national fecklessness. The effects of budget deficits depend on the
circumstances; and they cannot just be compared with a person with too much
debt.
To illustrate my theme I shall be citing material from rival City analysts,
who - for all my occasional strictures - do useful research, which should
not be spurned because of the quotes extracted from them by the media on one
month's figures.
I shall start with the reliable Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers. He
estimates that the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement this financial
year is more likely to be Pounds 32bn than the Pounds 28bn published at the
time of the Budget, because of revenue shortfalls from a slower recovery.
But you haven't heard anything yet. The deficit for the following year,
1993-94, admitted to be Pounds 32bn by the Treasury, will be more like
Pounds 41bn according to Salomon. If Salomon is right, this will be due to
slower economic growth than forecast and also because the company has a more
pessimistic view of the tax yield of a given gross domestic product than the
Treasury has.
Salomon puts the 1993-94 deficit at 6.3 per cent of GDP - more than twice
the Maastricht guidelines, although the latter are probably meant to apply
over a cycle as a whole. Adding back privatisation proceeds gives Pounds
46.5bn or more than 7 per cent of GDP.
It comes as an anti-climax after these horror stories that Salomon should be
expecting public spending cuts of just Pounds 1bn to take effect next year.
The cuts would carry through to later years, but there would be nothing
further. Phillips &amp; Drew, never to be outdone, talks about spending cuts
plus tax increases totalling Pounds 9 1/2 bn per annum.
The interesting thing about the Salomon projections is that after pages on
the gloomy fiscal outlook, we are told that the rise in public sector
borrowing will be matched by higher private savings and lower credit demand.
In addition a fall in the underlying rate of inflation to just over 3 per
cent is expected next year. It does not quite say that gilt yields are bound
to rise, but comes very close to doing so.
Another set of analysts, Mark Cliffe and Chris Dillow of the Nomura Research
Institute explain why they are not worried about the financing of the
deficit. Their view is that when economic activity is depressed the private
sector will save more and that this will finance the budget deficit.
To my mind the most interesting chart in the Nomura paper is the historical
one reproduced above. This shows that, for all its short-term fluctuation
the gross UK savings ratio in the past three decades has been more than
twice what it was before the first world war when gilt-edged yields were
below 3 per cent. The relevance of this to budget deficits is that the
latter make an extra call on domestic savings over and above the claims of
business investment.
It is instructive to recall that the low 19th-century savings ratio did not
inhibit economic growth. Nor did it prevent a current payments surplus from
arising. The share of investment in those years was even smaller than the
share of savings. In view of the growth record, this suggests that the
productivity of capital has shown a long-term tendency to fall and this may
be more worrying than any supposed savings shortage.
The problem with the analysis of historical statistics is that there is
never a savings shortage or excess after the event. For the world as a whole
savings have to be equal to investment - rather large statistical errors
apart. For an individual country they can only differ through cross-border
investment flows. The question is how any prospective gap is eliminated.
There is certainly no automatic tendency for higher budget deficits to drive
up nominal interest rates. During the period since 1990 that large budget
deficits have emerged as a problem, UK long term bond yields have fallen
from nearly 12 per cent to about 9 per cent. Even in Germany where the swing
of the budget into deficit has been very large and reflects medium term
unification costs rather than recession, long term nominal rates have fallen
slightly.
The problem is tackled from another angle by Tim Congdon in the April issue
of the Gerrard &amp; National Economic Review. Congdon was associated with the
theory that deficits crowded out private investment. But the moral that
Congdon draws today is not that a budget deficit is without impact, but that
its impact depends on how it is financed.
If it is all fully funded - that is, met by the sale of gilts - he would not
expect it to boost, or even sustain, activity. When full funding applies,
the home or overseas public have to take up government securities, so that
their holdings of cash and bank deposits remain the same.
Congdon argues, that for the deficit to be effective in sustaining activity,
some parts must be met by the creation of money - or deliberate
underfunding. In practical terms this means that the government would borrow
stated and limited sums from the banking system through Treasury bills.
The net effect depends on what happens to the whole structure of interest
rates. I cannot pretend to have worked out what would happen if the
government were deliberately underfunding to boost the money supply, but
also tried to limit any fall in short term interest rates to avoid weakening
the ERM parity.
As no-one has a satisfactory model of how the monetary system works I cannot
see that there would be any harm in reinstating some broad money supply
guideline, which would be consistent with non-inflationary growth. Whatever
it is, it would be higher than the 5 per cent recorded in the past 12
months. I have in mind a presumptive rule to be followed unless there are
good reasons why not, rather than an iron rule to be followed in all
circumstances.
The expert group advising the EC Central Bankers Committee is hard at work
on broad money trends. So the UK would be in good company. The worst that
can happen is that the money would pile up on deposit - that is velocity of
circulation would fall - or that the rule would be overridden by the needs
of exchange rate policy or other events.
Economic policy has suffered from the belief in known truths. It is time to
move to a more sensitive analysis in terms of risks and opportunities. Of
any economic claim we should ask: what is the worst that could happen if the
holder is wrong? And what opportunities might we be missing if some rival
theory is right after all? I am not advocating short-termism or that
anything goes, but merely avoiding a pretence to knowledge that we do not
have.

<TEXT>
Sir, We learn from David Goodhart and Michael Smith ('Playing catch-up with
the private sector fat cats', June 23) that Britain's public servants
deserve far more money if they are to stay in the same league as their
colleagues in the private sector.
I had assumed that the words 'public service' and 'job security' meant
something - can one imagine a judge getting the sack for incompetence? So
one has to look abroad to see if noble traditions survive. They do - in the
US, a supreme court judge gets Pounds 86,344 a year at current exchange
rates. General Colin Powell, with allowances, gets Pounds 57,211.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: Parties which came out ahead in Maxwell affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CRISPIN DRUMMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A curious silence from one corner of the City prompts a comment about one
element of the Maxwell affair that Bronwen Maddox has not explored: who came
out ahead?
Aside from amounts retained by the Maxwell family interests, and advisers'
fees, most of the missing Pounds 900m-odd was paid across in 1990-91
ultimately to bona fide shareholders exiting Maxwell Communications
Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers. These investors had originally
taken the decision to back Robert Maxwell and his companies, and in the
absence of willing buyers for their shares they should by rights have
incurred the full consequences of corporate failure. But the share support
operations enabled them to avoid such a fate, by benefiting from the receipt
of hot money taken from MGN pensioners and others.
There is of course no obligation for shareholders who should have lost out,
but didn't, to reimburse those that shouldn't, but did. But it is important
to identify where most of that missing money went, and to reflect that at
least some parties - including eventually some pension funds - did
comparatively well out of the Maxwell affair.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write in response to Mr Burt's letter (June 23) on the London School
of Economic's bid for County Hall.
We are not asking the government to give us County Hall. Rather we are
seeking access to the site and to the information which we need in order to
finalise a bid that will give us the space we need to expand (currently we
have 25 per cent more students than the accepted university grants committee
norms); to develop the research-led, post-graduate teaching activities which
will be needed as the UK develops a mass system of higher education; to
respond to demands for greater interaction with the commercial life of
London by developing an 'International Social Science Park' and in other
ways and to expand our post-graduate management education activities.
We feel that this makes perfect financial sense and are confident that we
can demonstrate this.
We agree that our standing in the future will be a function of the quality
of our teaching staff and students and it is to preserve that quality that
we need more space. It is not the grandeur of the County Hall that attracts
us, it is its location and its size.

<TEXT>
Sir, I should like to object in the strongest terms to remarks made by
Malcolm Rutherford in his review of As You Like It (Arts, June 18).
Commenting on the performance of Bette Bourne as Jaques, Mr Rutherford
states that there is an 'underlying suggestion' that Jaques is suffering
from 'some fatal disease, quite probably Aids'.
The patent leap in your reviewer's mind from the actor's deliberate choice
of a campy, languid persona in his interpretation of Jaques to
homosexuality, to Aids, displays an appalling insensitivity. Such a
generalisation, made on such insubstantial evidence, is profoundly offensive
 -and not only to people whose lives have been directly affected by Aids.

Sir, Arthritis Care is totally in favour of improving efficiency, in or out

hospital out-patient departments can cause more pain and damage to their
joints than the treatment they receive alleviates.
If Andersen Consulting's research results in a patient with arthritis having

FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: Righting the wrongs of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK RITTNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Pensions after Maxwell' (June 20) and its warnings are
timely.
There is very much more wrong with the pensions world than the issues of
custodianship, and the ownership and control of pension funds and their
surpluses (if any).
For all their well-meaning aims, the Fowler reforms have been a bureaucratic
nightmare and have lead to administrative chaos. As pensions become more
attractive (solely because of the tax breaks available) so governments have
had to devise ever more convoluted (and expensive) rules to prevent
individuals and companies from having too much of a good thing. An entire
government department, countless actuaries, lawyers and even accountants
have as their raison d'etre the policing and restriction of pension
contributions and benefits. In addition, the failure of government to oblige
employers to fund employees' personal pensions when they do not wish to join
a company scheme has reinforced the corporatist approach to pension
provision and discouraged individual initiative. And why retain tax relief
in its present forms?
The setting up of the Goode Commission offers a marvellous opportunity for
these issues to be explored and for the fundamental assumptions of the last
40 years to be questioned. One of the most attractive features of the
Thatcher era was the challenge to ingrained prejudices and to vested
interests. Having appointed a very distinguished lawyer to be chairman of
this commission, the secretary of state will surely resist the temptation to
pack the membership with pensions industry establishment figures whose
life-long habits of thought have inhibited them from thinking anew and
creatively about old problems. Mark Rittner,

FT  25 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The future of school education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EDUCATION white paper due to be published next month will set out the
government's plans for state schools in England and Wales for the next 25
years. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is determined that it should
enhance parental choice by increasing the number of schools opting out of
local education authority control. But opting-out is raising questions over
the future of school education to which the white paper will need to find
convincing answers.
So far fewer than 250 of the 25,000 schools in England and Wales have become
grant-maintained - funded from Whitehall, with their governors enjoying
almost unfettered control over management, budgets and recruitment. But with
the Conservative election victory, the trickle is turning into a flood, as
150 requests for information now pour in every day. By the next election,
most of the 4,000 secondary schools are likely to have opted out. The white
paper will include measures to allow the smaller primary schools to opt out
in consortia.
Such growth is likely to increase the sort of problems of access which have
appeared in areas where schools have already opted out. In the London
borough of Bromley, for example, several hundred parents recently found that
there was no place for their children next autumn at the nearest secondary
schools, as opted-out schools cast their nets more widely. Similar problems
have emerged in the London borough of Hillingdon. Local education
authorities may find themselves hard-pressed to ensure school places for all
as opting-out becomes the norm. Parents could find that their choice has
diminished rather than increased.
Progress indicators
These problems will be exacerbated once information about examination
results, truancy rates and other indicators of schools' progress is
published in league tables. It is entirely right that such information
should be collected and disseminated - but it is clear what the consequences
will be. Middle class and highly motivated parents will gravitate towards
schools with the best results, while those at the bottom of the league
tables will find it harder to attract able children. A rational headteacher
 -whose salary reflects the size of the school roll - will try to select
entrants who are less likely to depress performance.
Serious deficiencies
Two consequences follow from this. The first is that there will be a group
of pupils no grant-maintained school will wish to accept - including those
with poor attendance records or a history of disturbance. Yesterday's Audit
Commission report has highlighted serious deficiencies which already exist
in provision for the one in five children with special educational needs.
These will be harder to tackle if schools become fussier about their
entrants.
The second is that such pupils will be concentrated in schools remaining in
local authority control, which will become the educator of the last resort.
This will increase, rather than decrease, the number of inner-city sink
schools which the government hopes to tackle. The creation of a series of
'sin bins' is a policy no government should contemplate.
One solution which the white paper might consider is a funding incentive to
encourage grant-maintained schools to accept a fair share of children with
special needs. Such pupils could attract additional per capita grants, for
example. The local education authority might also be given the right to
nominate a proportion of pupils to grant-maintained schools to ensure that
all schools accept a cross-section of abilities and backgrounds.
Whatever the solution, it is clear that there remains a role for an elected
local education authority even after opting out has become the norm. Rather
than providing school education, the local education authorities would then
assume a new purchaser role, ensuring that all children have equal access to
education and planning local provision. The white paper should resist the
temptation to abolish them in favour of some quango or Whitehall control. If
it does, it will rue the day - and, as with the poll tax, virtually every
independent voice will have told it so.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Leading Article: New direction in Israel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To a world which was growing cynical at the prospect for progress in Middle
East peace negotiations, the result of Tuesday's Israeli election marks a
refreshing new departure. Not only has a party that promises to engage much
more constructively in the peace process emerged as the overall winner.
Labour has also won by a margin convincing enough to put it at the centre of
a coalition government that can proceed rapidly to implement its full
agenda, starting with a freeze on Israeli settlement activity in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and interim autonomy arrangements for the
Palestinians there. The west, and especially the US administration, whose
tireless efforts to keep Israel and its Arab foes at the negotiating table
had an important influence on the election campaign, has every interest in
welcoming the new Israeli government and helping it to keep its promises -
as well as prodding the Palestinians and Arab states to stick to theirs.
The victory achieved by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the 70-year-old Labour leader, is
the most decisive result produced by Israel's notoriously fissiparous
electoral system in at least 15 years. It is also a humiliation for Mr
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, which has dominated the country's politics to
increasingly baleful effect in the interim and which has blocked all
worthwhile progress in the Middle East peace talks for the last six months.
Above all, it is a sign that Israelis are tiring of the politics of
isolation and are coming to understand that political intransigence carries
a price, in deteriorating relations with the US and reduced access to
American aid.
Cautious pragmatist
Labour's 45 seats, coupled with the 12 won by the Meretz party to its left
and the usual handful for the Israeli Arab parties, mean that it is in
control and has no need to strike onerous coalition deals with religious or
right-wing rivals.
Indeed, Mr Rabin, a cautious pragmatist who campaigned on a ticket giving
'security' at least as much weight as 'peace' and was widely assumed to be
manoeuvring his way towards another national unity government with the
Likud, may find his party's mandate uncomfortably strong as he comes under
pressure from the newly-confident left to step up the pace. He will be as
conscious as anyone of the dangers of confrontation with the right - and
especially with Jewish settlers in the occupied territories - as Israel
moves towards the difficult territorial decisions that it has avoided for
the past 25 years.
High expectations
Even the first steps down this path will be far from easy. Settlers have the
capacity to play havoc with an attempted freeze on new settlements and with
the Palestinian elections that Mr Rabin will want to stage as a prelude to
allowing limited self-government. Externally, there is a danger of the
Labour victory generating excessively high expectations that will later be
dashed - when, for example, Mr Rabin fails to talk directly to the Palestine
Liberation Organisation or makes clear that his idea of exchanging territory
for peace is much more limited than those of his enemies and even his
allies.
For the Labour leader, as for most Israelis, there is no question of handing
back much more than the densely populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank
and Gaza, only extremely limited flexibility over Syria's demand for the
return of the Golan Heights, and absolutely no question of giving up
sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem. He has also consistently argued that
there is no room for an independent Palestinian state. Israel's Arab
negotiating partners - who will never have a better opportunity to advance
their cause through talks than now  - would do well to bear these eventual
obstacles in mind, and concentrate on transitional measures rather than
demanding to know the shape of a final settlement in advance.
For the time being, though, momentum is all. President Bush and Mr James
Baker, his sec-retary of state, understand that and will want to encourage
the new Israeli government to plunge now into intensive negotiations with
the Palestinians. If Mr Rabin agrees, and if he can make a freeze on new
settlements stick, then Israel can reap its reward in the form of the
Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees that Washington has been withholding.

Changing Fortunes: The world's money and the threat to American leadership
By Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten Times Books New York. Dollars 25
The lightness of touch Mr Paul Volcker achieves in his account of the
beginning of the Third World debt crisis perfectly captures the flavour of
this delightful book.
'The crisis landed on our doorstep - or, more literally for me, at a fishing
ranch in Wyoming - early in the week of August 9. That morning, I had great
difficulty catching anything. That afternoon, I was visited by the chairman
of the Continental Illinois Bank, who flew out to tell me the bank was in so
much trouble that it would need Federal Reserve support. The next day my
office called to tell me Mexico was about out of money, so I headed back to
Washington almost fishless.'
In several decades of public service, Mr Volcker, the former chairman of the
US Federal Reserve, and Mr Toyoo Gyohten, a former top official at Japan's
Ministry of Finance, participated in nearly every important episode in
international monetary policy. They have produced a wry, deftly understated
account of momentous events, unblemished by any trace of pomposity.
The book grew out of series of seminars at Princeton University and
obviously benefited from the editing skills of Mr Lawrence Malkin, a senior
correspondent at the International Herald Tribune. It is organised as a
series of paired essays. The pattern is for Mr Volcker to provide a lengthy
US perspective on an important episode - such as his battle against
inflation in the early 1980s. Mr Gyohten then provides a shorter, but often
surprisingly pithy, account of the same events as seen from Tokyo. As
monetary history, the effect is unique: a full, rich stereo sound in place
of the usual mono reproduction.
Perhaps the book's greatest virtue is its ability to put events in a long
perspective. Changing Fortunes opens in the 1950s long before Japan is
perceived as any kind of economic threat. Mr Gyohten enters the story as an
impoverished graduate student at Princeton trying to survive on one
ham-and-lettuce sandwich a day. By the end, the tables are almost completely
turned. It is American, rather than Japanese, goods that are seen as cheap
and shoddy. It is the US, rather than Japan, that is running big external
deficits. It is the US, rather than Japan, that is dependent on the goodwill
of foreign investors. Mr Gyohten, once supplicant, has become a courteous
paymaster.
Mr Volcker's account of events is tinged with a kind of sadness or
resignation. He explains how, for the first decade or so of his career, he
took both American pre-eminence and the Bretton Woods international monetary
system for granted. 'It's hard now, after all the changes in exchange rates
and disturbances in financial markets, to recapture the strength of the
emotional and intellectual commitment to the international stability of the
dollar and the fixed gold price,' he writes.
One of the book's highlights is a vivid account of the collapse of Bretton
Woods during the Nixon presidency. Mr Volcker, then a Treasury
under-secretary, reported to John 'Typhoon' Connally, Mr Nixon's
strong-minded Texan Treasury Secretary. Mr Volcker recounts how he feared
the suspension of gold convertibility and devaluation of the dollar would be
seen as a humiliation for the US. In the event he learned 'a good lesson
about what masterful politicians can do.' Like Churchill after Dunkirk,
Nixon and Connally managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In the
US at least, the emergency package was seen as a triumph and a fresh start.
Twenty years later, Mr Volcker remains nostalgic for the stability of
Bretton Woods. 'The monetary system has not been put back together in a way
that really seems to satisfy anyone. And somehow we are still complaining
about unfair military, aid and trade burdens.'
The book offers a fascinating account of the Plaza and Louvre exchange rate
accords of the mid and late 1980s. But it is clear that neither author has
much respect for these half-hearted attempts to co-ordinate policies. Mr
Gyohten criticises Mr James Baker, then US Treasury Secretary, for
aggressively pushing policies that were in the US rather than the global
interest. 'I am forced to argue that the pattern of policymaking did corrupt
the fundamental long-term relationship between Japan and the United States,'
he writes.
Mr Volcker is a little more circumspect, but he too criticises the US for
being 'incapable of matching our action to our analysis'. Both emphasise the
failure to back exchange rate pronouncements with concrete budget, trade or
structural policies.
Changing Fortunes ends on a somewhat pessimistic note. It was no accident,
the authors argue, that the breakdown of Bretton Woods led to weaker growth,
higher inflation and an increase in protectionist pressures. Yet while
praising the regional exchange rate stability achieved through the EMS, they
have little confidence that another era of global stability can be
established. The main reason is the immaturity of the world's biggest
economy: lacking a firm commitment to either price stability or budgetary
balance, the US is incapable of providing the necessary leadership. How
frustrating for officials such as Mr Volcker who retain memories of brighter
times.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Arts: Don Pasquale - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is unlikely that Donizetti realised what a favour he had done opera-house
managements when he wrote Don Pasquale. The opera has been popular since the
day it was first performed and yet, with just four singers, no need for big,
expensive voices, a small chorus and modest sets, it involves less than a
grand opera budget.
Thus Don Pasquale is often called for. Even when the rest of Donizetti's
output was mostly languishing in neglect, this well-made comic opera had a
ready audience. The Royal Opera has been playing it since 1973 in the
production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, which looks more tasteful now than it
did 20 years ago (how styles change]) and the opera has never failed to put
across its wit and considerable charm.
The present cast is a partial reconstitution from the revival of two years
ago. The mainstay then was Paolo Montarsolo as Pasquale and he is back,
giving every impression that he has lived the role for a lifetime. As he
curls up in a favourite armchair, he really seems fond of the old fellow,
comfortable in his crumpled smoking-jacket, at home in his fusty bachelor
drawing-room, at ease even with his rheumaticky wheezes and slow shuffle.
Montarsolo is also Italian, which helps in getting the words across. The
patter in his duet with Dr Malatesta went at just about the fastest rate
this production can have seen and the French baritone Francois Le Roux as
the double-dealing doctor, visibly a sharp operator as quick on his feet as
he was to flash a winning smile, did well to keep up with him.
The two young lovers were played by Judith Howarth and Raul Gimenez, able
singers both. The soprano is careful to bind one note to another and makes a
Norina in whom one always has confidence, firmer of voice than many who take
the role, not a flighty canary of a singer. Her whistling high F in the
opera's final moments arrived without warning. Gimenez is at his best in the
scene of the nocturnal tryst, where he touches upon the top notes with
moon-lit delicacy.
There is more opportunity for expressive singing in the bel canto style than
the four singers find between them, but with Bruno Campanella providing a
stylish lead from the pit the musical standard is very respectable. One
change in the staging is that the cats, which were such a feature of
Pasquale's household, have gone. Or perhaps this production has simply
outlived them: Don Pasquale always has been an opera with nine lives.
Performances continue until July 2 (Box Office 071-240 1066)

Even Anglophile continental Europeans tend to see the British attitude
towards rabies as hysterical, and who can blame them? You might think from
talk in this country that continentals were frothing at the mouth and
dropping like flies. The Full Treatment (7.30 ITV) looks at ways animals can
influence our health 'including how changes in the quarantine rules might
affect the spread of rabies in Britain'. Scarcely at all so far as humans
are concerned.
In promoting its shock report on the motor car in cities, This Week (8.30
ITV) trots out that favourite statistic, 'cars in London's rush hour'
(whatever that may be) 'now travel as slowly as the horse and cart 150 years
ago, 11 mph'. The implication is that there was a golden age when Londoners
raced around at 30 mph. When was that? And what is wrong with 11 mph? If you
want to go faster you simply buy a big motorbike. BBC1 launches its latest
bit of tabloid telly, 999, a copy of America's '911', which is what you dial
for emergency services in the US. The idea is to tell 'real life stories of
heroism' performed by ambulance crews, firemen and so on. Let's hope the
British version is less ghoulish than its American model (9.30).

FT  25 JUN 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The effective use of consultants is surprisingly rare. Many companies treat
their advisers as if they were junior clerks and get them to perform tasks
that they could easily do themselves. Few consultants complain as they are
paid by the hour in most cases rather than by the job. Cowie at Lay &amp;
Wheeler demonstrated how to get full value out of the experience that
consultants bring. He employed Coopers &amp; Lybrand to advise, but released
them once the advice had been taken. As it happens, the recommendation was
identicalto his own empirical research. However, he now had confidence that
the choice was rational since it was confirmed by an outsider.
So often a solution which is logical for the computer is unusable by humans.
If not controlled, the computer rapidly becomes the master rather than the
servant. Eight character codes can be neat and tidy but wines are rarely
called 'ZX456GF'. Any system which relies on short codes must provide help
for the poor user. It must be considered a black mark against Kerridge that
it ignored this obvious problem in the first implementation. Modern database
systems all incorporate the sort of name finding required as a standard part
of the package. However, they have learned from the mistake and adapted the
system to a more human- centred approach. It is always important to ensure
that any system offers a path for growth. The two common options are to
choose a manufacturer with a wide range of computing power available or to
develop the system in a portable fashion. The advantage of open systems is
their ability to switch to other hardware. Lay &amp; Wheeler has demonstrated
that it can be done in reality, not just in the salesman's patter.
Lay &amp; Wheeler suffered some disruption and the benefits have not come as
quickly as expected. However, this is balanced by the reduced stockholding
(saving Pounds 50,000 in interest charges alone) and better management
information for the future.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Lay &amp; Wheeler - Company
Snapshot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Founded in 1854 by an ancestor of Richard Wheeler, the current chairman and
managing director, Colchester wine merchant Lay &amp; Wheeler is one of the
largest independent wine merchants in the UK.
Nature of business: The company imports and distributes more than 1,000 fine
wines from around the world. It supplies restaurants and hotels in addition
to operating two retail outlets and one wholesale outlet in Colchester.
Turnover: Pounds 17m a year.
Employees: 120
Technology file
Lay &amp; Wheeler's applications software was originally developed for IMP
hardware and moved to the current ICL system last year. This was possible
because the applications software was developed for the 'open' Unix
operating system.
Software:
Standard accounting 'modules' from Kerridge Computers' range of packages
form the backbone of Lay &amp; Wheeler's custom-built sales order processing,
point-of-sale and stock control applications. The software was installed in
phases Between November 1988 and October 1989. The sales order processing
system is standard across all of Lay &amp; Wheeler's selling operations and the
stock control system handles up to 5,000 product lines.
Hardware:
The system is based on an ICL DRS 6000 computer running Unix System V,
release 4.0. Access to the system is either through standard terminals or
via a standard PC, with a total of 55 screens spread across four locations.
Network connections are through British Telecom Kilostream lines. The
standard PCs located at the selling outlets can run a skeleton point of sale
system in the event of a network failure.
Costs: The total cost of software and hardware is pounds 250,000 on a
lease-purchase arrangement. Annual costs include pounds 11,000 for software
maintenance and pounds 22,000 for hardware maintenance.

Lay &amp; Wheeler negotiated the transfer to a new computerised system
</HEADLINE>

Selling wine seems straightforward. You set up your shop, you place some
attractive bottles in the window and wait for the eager buyers to hand over
the cash.
Wine, however, can be sold in a variety of ways. In addition to the obvious
retail premises off the high street, traditional wine merchants sell
wholesale to restaurants and hotels. They sell wine 'in bond' or 'en
primeur' to private customers. They might operate a wine supermarket or a
cash-and-carry store.
Lay &amp; Wheeler, an old, established wine merchant based in Colchester, Essex,
uses all of these methods to sell wines and other beverages. Choosing a new
computer system in 1988, Lay &amp; Wheeler wanted one to serve all its outlets
and provide integrated information systems for its management.
'We were operating a 19th century computer system for a 21st century
operation,' says Ross Cowie, Lay &amp; Wheeler's financial director. 'Although
we sell our products in several different ways, they are inter-related. The
fine wines side supports both the wholesale operation and the mail order
service. The retail outlets sell a range of drinks products by the bottle
and by the case. And, if we are holding a wine tasting, it might be for both
retail and wholesale customers.'
In late 1987, Lay &amp; Wheeler's management looked at its operations with the
aim of supporting them with a new computer system. Although based in
Colchester, Lay &amp; Wheeler distributes wines, spirits and beers throughout
south east England and runs a national mail order operation.
The company has two retail premises in Colchester - a small shop in the
centre of the town, which was established in 1862, and a wine 'supermarket'
on the outskirts. It also operates a wholesale 'cash-and-carry' warehouse
next door to the wine supermarket.
The new computer system had to cope with these different outlets and, as
staff are moved between operations, had to present a common 'interface'.
Lay &amp; Wheeler needed to replace an ageing system running on a Burroughs B90
computer with a system to control order processing, distribution and
invoicing, handle stock movements, and produce good management information.
The Burroughs system processed the mail-order and the wholesale sales
invoicing and distribution operation. It could not handle stock movements -
nor did it offer any useful management information.
Rather than buy a computer and try to fit the software to the job, Cowie
wanted to find the right software from the outset.
Selecting a new system can be fraught enough - even for experienced
companies. Lay &amp; Wheeler took a cautious approach. Cowie and his colleagues
worked out a specification which covered the business aspects of the new
system.
Cowie called in consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand to ensure he looked at the
right kind of company to build and install the system.
Cowie's attitude to the consultant was pragmatic, however. Consultants are
expensive and, once Coopers and Lybrand's staff had done their job, Cowie
saw no further need for their services.
With Coopers and Lybrand's help, Cowie drew up a shortlist.
'We shortlisted four suppliers and looked at their proposals carefully. We
chose Kerridge Computers because it seemed to have the right attitude and
fitted in with our way of working.'
Cowie signed the contract with Kerridge in May 1988 with the aim of moving
across to the new system by October at the start of the company's financial
year.
The software used to create Lay &amp; Wheeler's system was drawn from a mixture
of standard components and custom-written programs. Kerridge supplied a
suite of standard applications modules for accounting functions such as
sales ledger, management accounts and cashbook.
The sales order processing system - the all-important front-end of Lay &amp;
Wheeler's operations - had to be built from scratch.
A main reason was the complex pricing and discount structure which Lay &amp;
Wheeler uses. 'We needed the ability to go to as many as 72 different prices
for the same wine - 36 by bottle and 36 by case,' says Cowie.
The main installation problems came from the custom-built parts of the
system and, although it was close to being ready for the October start date,
Cowie was not satisfied.
Problems with the pricing of cases and calculation of deposits delayed the
transfer: 'About 10 days before the target date, I decided we would have to
wait another month. It was a bit of a risk going live in November - it is
our busiest time. But we wanted to get it right.' Cowie says the delay only
caused minor problems as far as the annual accounts were concerned.
Once the central accounts were installed and Cowie was happy with them, Lay
&amp; Wheeler phased in the other parts of the system through 1989. These
included the point-of sale systems for the shop, the wine supermarket and
the cash-and-carry warehouse.
In October 1989, Lay &amp; Wheeler embarked on its 'first serious effort in
stock control'.
Lay &amp; Wheeler carries about 3,500 current product lines and may have as many
as 5,000 recorded in the system. Each product has an eight-character code
which works like an engineering part number. The code identifies the type of
product, the vintage, and the size.
'Our first effort failed, not because of the software but because of our own
systems. The main problem was coping with internal movements of stock.'
The fine-tuning has continued during the last two and half years and Cowie
is now satisfied that the stock system works well: 'We now get good
management information - reports for the buying department and lower stocks
held. We have reduced stockholding by about Pounds 500,000 and, at our last
stock take we found only two mistakes,' he says.
Cowie admits that the introduction of the new system has been hard work. He
also admits that he 'never really thought about the user', especially with
the product coding system and the problems of entering it at the point of
sale.
Kerridge has got round some these problems by incorporating a search program
which can find products by name.
Lay &amp; Wheeler's story is a classic of software development. The definition
of the business problem, the selection of the supplier and the installation
and fine-tuning of the application software all have a familiar ring to
them.
There is one difference, however. Lay &amp; Wheeler's system runs on the Unix
operating system and the company is now on its second hardware platform.
The applications software was moved to the new hardware last August with few
problems, proving that the principle of open systems - that you can move
software easily - really works.
BUZZWORDS
EN PRIMEUR is a form of wine 'futures'. Wine is bought while still in the
barrel for subsequent delivery - usually after two years.
IN BOND wine is shipped from the vineyard and held in a bonded warehouse,
allowing the duty and tax payments to be deferred until final delivery.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Ringing in change at
the supermarket checkout - The days of clipping money-off coupons are over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of coupons as a marketing tool has always been regarded as fine in
theory; rather less than perfect in practice. The trouble is that they are
fiddly, costly and imprecise, often hitting the wrong type of customer at
the wrong time in the wrong place.
Magazine advertisements containing coupons are widely regarded as offering a
bluderbuss approach to marketing when more closely targeted methods are
called for.
A recent unseemly squabble among UK food retailers - when Tesco offered to
redeem everyone else's coupons, prompting a spoiling campaign from its
rivals - has also tarnished the coupon's image, even though that battle
looks as though it is drawing to a close.
But several retailers are now experimenting with better ways of issuing
coupons. In September, Superdrug will install up to 10 'instant coupon
machines' on the shelves of its top 160 drugstores, providing shoppers with
the opportunity immediately to redeem promotional offers on various
products. This is seen as a powerful means of influencing shoppers at the
crucial moment of decision.
Others retailers are exploring ways to utilise the mass of marketing
knowledge that they gather from their electronic point of sale (Epos)
equipment at their check-outs to produce electronic coupons. If successful,
these systems could revolutionise the coupon industry, delivering a highly
potent marketing weapon for both brand managers and retailers alike.
Next month, Asda, the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain, is launching a
trial of an electronic coupon system at five stores using technology
licensed from Catalina Marketing, a nine-year-old US company which was
floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March.
The Coupon Saver system is a small machine next to each supermarket till
which is linked into the store's Epos network and instantaneously monitors
purchases. Bar-codes on specified products trigger the issue of coupons
which are then handed to the shopper along with their bill.
'It is like having a brand manager standing at every customer's shoulder
giving a coupon to all those people they want to attract,' says John
Eustace, Catalina's UK licence holder. The beauty of the system, he
suggests, is its flexibility. For example, brand managers can simply attempt
to 'lock in' customers by issuing money-off coupons whenever their products
are bought. Or a manufacturer can encourage a shopper to switch brands by
issuing a coupon for their brand, whenever one of their rivals' products are
scanned.
Retailers can encourage return custom by issuing loyalty coupons for
frequent shoppers or entice them to spend more by issuing coupons for bigger
packs or multi- buys. Coupon Saver can also be used to support advertising
campaigns or product launches.
It can even be used in conjunction with a personalised store card to issue
'reminder' coupons to individual customers. For instance, a razor blade
manufacturer whose products are on average bought every two months could
issue a coupon to an individual shopper seven weeks after they made their
last purchase, lessening the likelihood that they will lose it.
Catalina pays for the installation of the machines and sells the 'rights' to
issue coupons in about 400 different product categories to the retailer and
various brand managers.
It costs upwards of Pounds 10,000 to install the system in a store with 25
check-outs. Catalina's UK customers will initially be charged at a rate of
about Pounds 75 for every thousand coupons issued.
Catalina's coupon system is already operated by 32 retailers in 5,000 stores
across North America. Its machines read 64m shopping baskets a week - 40 per
cent of the total - and are used by 300 brand manufacturers.
A study by the US Food Marketing Institute last year suggested that in spite
of their prevalence, the applications of such front-end electronic marketing
systems were still in their infancy.
But the report also raised concerns about their long-term effectiveness,
consumer privacy, data ownership and fair trade practices.
Similar systems are now being touted around the globe, especially in Europe
and Australasia. But whether they will have such an impact overseas is open
to doubt.
The structure of the UK food retailing market, in particular, is very
different from that of the US on many levels.
In North America, for instance, IBM is the computer standard for most
retailers. Although Asda operates the same IBM system in the UK, Tesco uses
Siemens-Nixdorf equipment while J. Sainsbury uses ICL, complicating the
design of universal systems.
The predominance of retailers' own brand products in the UK may also muddy
the waters. In many categories, the brand managers' biggest rivals are the
retailers themselves and there is clearly a potential conflict of interest
in promoting individual brands.
But the rival food retailers will be watching Asda's experiment with
interest. If it is a success, they are likely to move quickly to install
their own systems.

FT  25 JUN 92 / People: Salaryman for West Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Midlands Development Agency has a new representative in Japan - a
former salaryman from Mitsubishi - who had, until this week, never been to
the West Midlands.
Yasuhide Shigematsu, 54, says he knew the region 'by reputation' and feels
that 'there is more due to happen in Europe than in North America as far as
Japanese companies are concerned. I wanted to be part of that,' he adds. He
is currently spending two weeks finding his way around the place.
To date, the West Midlands has attracted around 60 Japanese companies
employing over 8,000 people, as well as seven of the country's banks that
have recently set up representative offices. The agency contends that
today's inward investment decisions are affected less by recession in the UK
than by Japanese companies' own domestic problems, however, which means the
Japanese are significantly delaying all decisions about overseas expansion.
One of Shigematsu's tasks while he is in Britain is to make recommendations
as to whether his future marketing strategy should adapt to this change by
concentrating more heavily on specific sectors - in contrast to the more
generalised approach that has been applied until now.
Shigematsu comes from the machinery division of Mitsubishi; outside Japan he
worked on the sales and marketing side in both the US and South Africa. He
also points out that he has been involved in setting up two joint ventures,
one in China and one in Taiwan. He takes over from Ichiro Fujita, a banker
with fluent English who had been promoting the region to the Japanese for
the past four years.

Continental Europe. He will have responsibility over France, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands and Spain. He replaces Ray Miezelis who retired earlier this
year for personal reasons. The continental businesses had a turnover last
year of IPounds 400m, generated operating profits of IPounds 39.8m and
employ about 3,850 people.
Dermot Smurfit is replaced as chairman and chief executive of Smurfit UK by
Patrick (Paddy) Wright (above). He is a past president of the Confederation
of Irish Industry. Michael Smurfit's son Anthony who is chief executive of
the UK print and packaging division will report to him. The UK operations
had a turnover last year of about IPounds 193m and made profits of IPounds
13.6m.
*****
Michael Latham, the former Tory MP for Rutland and Melton who retired at the
last election, is returning to his old stable, the Building Employers
Confederation (BEC), as public affairs consultant to it and its private
house-building subsidiary the House-Builders Federation.
He comes at the invitation of Ian Deslandes, acting director general of the
BEC. The two have known each other since the mid-1960s when they were
working at the Conservative research department. Latham became the director
of the HBF between 1971 and 1973, and, before winning Melton in February
1974, brought in Deslandes as his successor.
Deslandes is now pleased to be employing the services - and political
contacts - of 49-year-old Latham about three days a week. Since recession in
the construction industry is BEC's main preoccupation at present, one of his
first tasks will be to help persuade the government to prolong the stamp
duty 'holiday' on house purchases beyond August.
Latham, who says his other main interest apart from the construction
industry is 'reconciling Christian and Jewish interests' is now also the
director of the Council of Christians &amp; Jews. While he felt that 18 years in
the Commons was enough, he mentions that he is considering standing for the
European parliament in two years' time.

FT  25 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Intervention notice is valid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGINA v LAUTRO EX PARTE ROSS
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Glidewell,
Lord Justice Stocker and
Lord Justice McCowan):
June 11 1992
AN INTERVENTION notice served by a self-regulating organisation on a member
is not invalidated by failure to give prejudicially-affected non-members an
opportunity to make representations as to why it should not be served. But
where such an opportunity is not given the non-member should, and in the
case of Lautro now does, have a right to apply to have the decision to serve
the notice set aside or to appeal.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr David Hugh Ross,
sole director of the Winchester Group plc, from a judgment of the Divisional
Court of the Queen's Bench Division (FT, July 17 1991) refusing his
application for judicial review of a decision by the Life Assurance Unit
Trust Regulatory Organisation Ltd (Lautro) to issue an intervention notice
affecting Winchester.
LORD JUSTICE GLIDEWELL said that Lautro was a self-regulating organisation
(SRO), recognised under the Financial Services Act 1986.
Norwich Union was authorised under the Act to carry on investment business,
but was a member of and subject to control under Lautro's rules. Winchester,
as an appointed representative of Norwich Union, was exempt from the
requirement of authorisation.
Lautro's rules, current in October 1990, empowered it to prohibit a member
from entering into transactions or from soliciting or carrying on business.
That power of intervention was exercisable by notice to the member, stating
why intervention appeared desirable to Lautro for the protection of
investors.
Rule 7.3(12) provided that where the reasons related to matters which
referred to a person identified in the notice other than the member, and
were in Lautro's opinion prejudicial to that person, Lautro 'shall . . .
serve a copy of the notice on that person'.
A member of Lautro on whom an intervention notice was served could apply to
set it aside or appeal. A person other than a member on whom a copy was
served had no prior opportunity of making representations as to why the
notice should not be issued, and was given no right under the rules to set
it aside or to appeal.
In October 1990, Lautro investigated Winchester's business. In its opinion,
there was evidence to show there had been serious breaches of the Lautro
rules in respect of business conducted for Norwich Union by Winchester. It
resolved to exercise its intervention powers.
On October 31, an intervention notice was served on Norwich Union and copies
were served on Winchester. On November 1, Norwich Union suspended Winchester
as its appointed representative.
Winchester sought a meeting with Lautro which took place on November 6. It
complained it had had no opportunity to make representations, and lacked
particulars of the allegations against it. It said the allegations in the
intervention notice were unfounded.
Lautro later accepted that some of the facts were not correct and that some
of the allegations must be qualified, but decided intervention remained
necessary and desirable in the interests of investors.
On January 11 1991, Norwich gave three months' notice of termination of its
agency agreement with Winchester.
Winchester was only ent-itled to conduct investment business as Norwich's
app-ointed representative. Once that position was suspended, and then
terminated, it was unable to conduct any investment business.
The Divisional Court refused an application by Winchester for judicial
review of the intervention notice.
On the appeal, the major issue was whether Lautro's failure to give
Winchester an opportunity to make representations before service invalidated
the notice.
Mr Collins for Winchester submitted first that in exercising its functions
as a recognised SRO, Lautro was under a duty to act in accordance with
natural justice - to act fairly in the circumstances.
There was no doubt that Lautro was obliged to exercise its powers fairly in
relation to members, at Common Law and by statute (see Lloyd v McMahon
(1987) AC 625,702 and paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the 1986 Act).
Second, Mr Collins submitted that duty was owed not merely to Lautro
members, but also to persons who would be prejudicially affected by its
decisions
The issue arose because of the self-regulatory structure which had been
created under the Act.
A recognised SRO controlled those authorised persons who were its members.
The authorised persons controlled their appointed representatives. Lautro
decisions, particularly in relation to intervention notices, would
frequently have a very considerable effect on appointed representatives.
When a decision-making body was called on to reach a decision arising out of
the relationship between two persons only one of whom was directly under its
control, and it was apparent that the decision would be likely to affect the
second person adversely, then as a general proposition the decision-making
body did owe some duty of fairness to that second person, which in
appropriate circumstances might well include a duty to allow him to make
representations.
That would particularly be the case when the adverse effect was on the
second person's livelihood or ability to earn.
Rule 7.3(12) defined with some clarity the persons who should be served, and
to whom in appropriate circumstances Lautro owed a general duty to act
fairly.
Third, Mr Collins submitted that fairness required Winchester should be
given the opportunity to make representations before the decision to issue
the notice was reached.
The decision whether to exercise the power of intervention, and to serve a
notice before hearing the persons to whom it was directed or whom it would
affect, must be balanced against what Lautro regarded as the interests of
investors. In that sense it would be moved by considerations similar to
those which affected a court deciding whether to grant an injunction ex
parte.
If a decision-making body was to exercise intervention powers without giving
the opportunity to make representations beforehand, its procedures should
provide that those who might otherwise expect to have been allowed to make
representations should at least be allowed to make immediate application to
set the decision aside and appeal.
At the relevant time, rule 7.3 gave no such rights to non-members.
In February 1992, however, the rules were amended to give non-members served
with an intervention notice the right to appeal (see new rules 7.28 and
7.3(12)). When the intervention notice was served, Lautro's rules were
defective in not giving a right of appeal.
While the power to decide to serve an intervention notice without first
hearing representations from persons affected was not in itself so unfair as
to invalidate the notice, a lack of any means by which the person could
immediately thereafter challenge the notice was a breach of the requirements
of fairness which the law should imply.
If Lautro did not afford a non-member served in accordance with rule 7.3(12)
the opportunity to apply to rescind the notice, and/or to appeal, then the
lack of such remedies would be unfair and the procedure unlawful.
However, Mr Collins had expressly limited his challenge to Lautro's failure
to allow the making of representations before service of the notice. That of
itself did not invalidate the notice.
Although at the relevant time Lautro's rules, and thus its procedure, were
defective in the respects outlined, it was not required by law to afford to
Winchester the opportunity to make representations as to why a notice should
not be served before deciding whether or not to serve it.
The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed.
For Winchester: Andrew Collins QC and Cherie Booth (Manches &amp; Co).
For Lautro: Michael Beloff QC and Richard Gordon (Slaughter and May).

FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to break financial silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party is to take a first step towards increasing the amount
of information published on its finances.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, is to be consulted on the
feasibility of publishing a similar amount of information as in companies'
annual reports. That could include, for the first time, detailed figures on
debts.
With the government determined to fulfil its pledge to reduce Whitehall
secrecy, Mr Tim Smith, the Tory vice-chairman with responsibility for party
finances, hopes he may be able to make the changes before 1992-93 accounts
are published next summer.
However, he has ruled out publishing a breakdown of donations. In spite of
occasional controversy surrounding gifts - such as from companies within the
collapsed Polly Peck empire of Mr Asil Nadir - the party argues that donors
have a right to confidentiality.
At present, the Conservative party only publishes a limited set of annual
accounts, audited by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. These show income and expenditure
but not full figures on assets and liabilities.
A move to greater accountability would follow pressure for more openness
from the 'Charter' Group of Conservative activists who want greater
democracy and accountability within the party.
Sir Norman Fowler was appointed Conservative party chairman last month with
a brief to shake-up party organisation. Senior Tories recognise that
Conservative Central Office needs to restore confidence among constituency
associations that finances are effectively and efficiently used at head
office.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand's conclusions are likely to increase the pressure on Sir
Norman to publish more financial information.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Call for guidelines in corporate NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH authority and trust hospital boards should agree a set of principles
governing their corporate behaviour, Mr Philip Hunt, director of the
National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, said yesterday.
Mr Hunt, speaking at the opening of the association's conference in
Harrogate, joined a growing call for the National Health Service to develop
its own distinct managerial ethic.
In addition to a code of ethics for managers, said Mr Hunt, health boards
needed to 'accept their responsibility for setting the parameters within
which their managers operate'. This would involve an authority declaring its
commitment to factors like quality objectives and accountability to the
community.
He said there was a need to establish a clearer strategic, long-term vision
for the NHS, moving away from interminable debates about structures and
regional tiers of management. This must include giving more attention to the
personal development of staff and enhancing their contribution to the
service.
Mr Bill Darling, association chairman, called on the government to give
assurances on the introduction of arrangements for the care of elderly and
handicapped people in the community. Ministers are determined the reforms
will go ahead in spite of worries that they might complicate the
introduction of the council tax. But important funding issues remain to be
resolved.

FT  25 JUN 92 / NUM overtaken in size by Equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONCE mighty National Union of Mineworkers was last year overtaken in
size by Equity, the actors' union, as affiliates to the Trades Union
Congress saw their membership decline to the lowest level since 1947.
The NUM's decline to 44,352 at the end of last year compares with 200,000
during the 1984-85 miners' strike and 53,112 in 1990. Membership of Equity
has risen from 32,525 in 1984 to 44,379.
Figures published by the TUC yesterday show that membership of its
affiliates fell last year by 440,000 to 7.76m out of a total workforce of
more than 24m. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said: 'Whilst these
figures are disappointing, they say more about the state of the economy than
they do about trade unions.' Unemployment increased by 700,000 last year.
The TUC said it remained the largest national trade union organisation in
western Europe. It added that union density in the UK - the percentage of
the workforce who are members of unions - compared well with other developed
countries.
Of the 72 affiliated unions, 57 recorded a drop in membership last year,
costing the TUC more than Pounds 500,000 in lost affiliation fees.
The three largest unions were among those hardest hit, with the TGWU and GMB
general unions both suffering a 7 per cent decline to 1.13m and 862,000
respectively. The engineering section of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union fell 11 per cent to 622,000.
Britain's smallest union - the Sheffield Wool Shear Workers Union - lost one
member, down from 17 to 16.
Gainers included the Nalgo public service union, up from 744,000 to 759,000
and the CPSA Civil Service union, up 1,889 to 124,566.
The latest membership figures mean the TUC's general council will be reduced
by six to 50 members. The TGWU, GMB, AEEU and MSF general technical union -
whose recorded membership fell from 653,000 to 604,000 - will all lose one
seat, as will the UCW communication workers' union.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Arthur Winspear, a pioneer on Lex: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR WINSPEAR, one of the creators of the Financial Times Lex Column, and
for many years a corporate finance executive at SG Warburg, has died aged
70.
Arthur Winspear began his career at the Investors Chronicle and moved to the
FT in the mid 1950s to become a specialist Lex writer. He brought both a
keen intelligence and a sharp critical faculty to the job, developing the
style of logical analysis and sharp opinion which has become the hallmark of
the column.
He was also, however, noted for a certain eccentricity, working in an office
with files piled to the ceiling, and being notoriously late with copy, which
was often written out longhand with a pencil.
This led to a much-related episode when, having missed the deadline for Lex,
he sought to make up time by tossing the copy out of an upper window at the
FT's old premises in Coleman Street to a courier waiting below to take it to
the printers. Unfortunately the Lex Column became lodged on an inaccessible
window-ledge.
The high point of Winspear's FT career came with the famous 'Aluminium War'
between November 1958 and January 1959, when the old guard of the City of
London sought to block a bid by Tube Investments and Reynolds Metals for
British Aluminium. Winspear pursued a fiercely independent line, unaffected
by the commercial links between the FT's new owner Pearson - which had
bought the paper in 1957 - and Lazard Brothers and Whitehall Trust, which
were heavily involved in the campaign to block the bid.
He attacked a plan for the issue by British Aluminium of a blocking
shareholding to Alcoa, and finally advised the rejection of another
defensive device, a consortium offer by leading City institutions. The
affair is remembered at the FT particularly for establishing the paper's
editorial independence.
Victory for TI brought fame to its previously little-known adviser Siegmund
Warburg, and in 1960 the merchant banker recruited Winspear himself to help
establish a more enduring presence in the rapidly developing field of
corporate finance. He became a director of Warburgs in 1965, a position he
retained until his retirement 20 years later.
He was involved in innumerable takeover battles, and colleagues particularly
remember his close involvement in the building up of the Reed group,
including its takeover of Wall Paper Manufacturers.
The exceptional powers of analysis and great clarity of expression which had
become apparent on the Lex Column also served him well at Warburgs. He
became popular for his Yorkshire sense of humour, although his wayward
observation of deadlines continued to create anxiety among his colleagues.
Arthur Winspear had undergone several major operations in the past few years
and his health remained poor, although he continued to be active.
After his retirement he took pride in helping to fend off repeated takeover
bids for Johnson Group Cleaners, of which - along with The Development and
Realisation Trust - he remained a non-executive director until his death.
He leaves a wife, Joan, and two daughters.

MR MICHAEL STONEY, a former senior executive in the Maxwell business empire,
yesterday 'vigorously denied' any dishonesty in relation to documents naming
him as a signatory to more than Pounds 180m in 'unusual' payments from
Mirror Group Newspapers last year.
Mr Stoney, group managing director (finance) of MGN until December last
year, was named alongside Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell in the
chairman's review issued on Tuesday with the group's 1991 accounts.
Mr Anthony Burton, his solicitor, said last night: 'In so far as it is
inferred in the reports about Mr Stoney, my client vigorously denies that
his conduct in relation to all or any of these transactions was dishonest.'
Mr Burton said he was considering the MGN document and press reports
surrounding it, and would take 'whatever action we consider appropriate'.
Mr Stoney has been working full-time with accountants from Arthur Andersen,
administrators to the private Maxwell companies, since the end of last year,
helping in their efforts to investigate movements of funds through the
business empire.
He has also answered questions posed by Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson
Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, trustee and manager
of the Maxwell pension funds.
However, Mr Stoney, through his solicitors, declined to answer questions
posed by MPs on the Commons social security committee earlier this year,
citing 'his common-law right of silence'.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Revenue loses Pounds 9m case over Nissan UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALLEGATION that Mr Frank Shannon, former finance director of Nissan UK,
and two of the company's advisers conspired to cheat the Inland Revenue of
Pounds 9m was thrown out by a magistrate at Worthing, West Sussex,
yesterday.
After a 2 1/2 -day hearing, Miss Daphne Wickham, a stipendiary magistrate
appointed by the Lord Chancellor's Department to deal with the case, decided
that the Revenue had produced insufficient evidence to justify committing Mr
Shannon and his co-defendants for trial at a crown court.
The three defendants were: Mr Shannon, 58, of Brighton, East Sussex; Mr
Brian Laventure, 52, of Haslemere, Surrey, a partner in Grant Thornton; and
Mr Gerald Compton, 46, of Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, a partner in
Kidsons Impey. The Revenue alleged they had conspired to cheat it over
stock-relief claims.
After reviewing the evidence the magistrate discharged the three men and
awarded them their costs out of central funds. Reporting restrictions were
not lifted.
After the hearing Mr Shannon declined to comment, but his solicitor, Mr
David Kirk of Stephenson Harwood said: 'We are delighted.'
Last month Mr Shannon and Mr Michael Hunt, 58, of Hove, East Sussex,
assistant managing director and deputy chairman of the former importer and
distributor of Nissan vehicles, were sent by the Worthing court for trial at
the Old Bailey charged with cheating the Revenue of Pounds 170m.
In that case it is alleged that the money found its way to Mr Shannon and Mr
Hunt after false invoices were filed for freight payments.
Mr Shannon is on bail of Pounds 225,000 and Mr Hunt of Pounds 200,000.

FT  25 JUN 92 / German scheme for cheap Euro-fighter 'nonsensical'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GERMAN plan to scrap the European Fighter Aircraft project and replace it
with a cheaper warplane is 'a folly,' Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence
procurement minister, said yesterday.
In a statement that he described as 'friendly plain speaking from Britain',
Mr Aitken said the claims by Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence minister,
that a new fighter would save money were 'nonsensical'.
The development phase of the EFA had been paid for and 'it would be
extraordinary for the coalition partners (UK, Germany, Italy and Spain) to
throw away DM15bn' (Pounds 5bn).
Mr Aitken was responding to Mr Ruhe's proposal on Tuesday that the EFA be
replaced with a lighter aircraft to save money but still provide jobs for
the German aerospace industry. He had previously called for complete German
withdrawal from the project.
Mr Aitken said the proposal 'horrified' the UK government. Mr Ruhe seemed to
be advocating a less capable aircraft that might be less effective against
the latest Russian Fulcrum and Flanker fighters. Mr Aitken said those
aircraft were being sold to other countries, so the end of the Cold war had
not eliminated the danger from them.
Furthermore, the question mark over the EFA had come 'at the worst possible
moment', given the strains on European unity following the 'no' vote earlier
this month in the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Ruhe had 'gone out on a limb', Mr Aitken said. 'There are strong pro-EFA
factions within the principal (German) parties.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA is to meet western donor nations in Paris today for a two-day meeting
overshadowed by fears that the momentum of economic reform could be
jeopardised by a worsening drought.
India is seeking from the consortium of donor nations under the chairmanship
of the World Bank Dollars 6.7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in aid pledges for 1992-93 -
most of which would be dispersed over the medium term. It is also seeking
Dollars 3bn in emergency balance of payments support for the coming year -
of which Dollars 2.4bn is expected to come from the IMF and the World Bank.
The meeting is seen as a guide to the mood among givers of aid  - in
particular whether they push for tougher conditions on future assistance.
The World Bank in its annual report on India's economy praised reforms over
the last year but emphasised the need to maintain momentum.
The government's fear is that reform could be set back by a bad monsoon  -
exacerbating inflation and increasing food imports. Rainfall is forecast as
likely to be well below normal, worsening the drought in central and western
India.
The World Bank says India will require a gross capital inflow - grants and
loans - of Dollars 9.8bn in 1992-93 to finance its current account deficit
and debt repayments.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Office space glut hits Tokyo property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GLUT of office space has finally struck the Tokyo property market, with a
resulting decline in rents, according to a study by KK Halifax Associates,
the property agent and developer.
While the excess of office space may be seen as a natural result of the high
pace of building in recent years combined with the slowdown in the economy,
many analysts had expected the plunge in property prices in the past year
would have little impact on rents.
Halifax, however, says rents are already falling, and it forecasts an 11 per
cent decline in rates this year, largely because Japanese companies have
largely stopped seeking new leases.
It says that about 12m sq ft of office space was built in Tokyo annually
from 1981 to 1985, but that this increased to 30m sq ft a year in the
subsequent five years, an annual increase of 6.42 per cent.
Between 1985, the office population in Tokyo increased by 13 per cent to 4m,
but additions to floor space rose 42 per cent, leaving a current potential
surplus of 62m sq ft. Large additions to current stock are also expected
this year and next, after which the momentum will give out.
Halifax says the vacant-building rate should climb from less than a quarter
of 1 per cent in 1990 to 2 per cent this year. Vacant space in older
buildings has climbed from 8.75m sq ft in 1990, to 29m sq ft on May 1.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Japan's employers launch attack on US trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese employers' federation, Keidanren, has launched an
unprecedentedly strong attack on US trade and economic policy.
In a report on bilateral relations, the Keidanren accuses the US of dragging
its feet over economic reform and warns of the danger of protectionism in
moves to establish a North American Free Trade Area. It also expresses
concern about the US insistence that its own institutions and practices are
to be applicable as norms of the world economic and social system.
The report has been published just days before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, is due to leave for the Munich summit of Group of Seven leaders.
On his way he will visit Washington for a meeting with President George Bush
to discuss bilateral trade and economic imbalances.
The Keidanren argues that Japan and its main trading partners must achieve
kyosei - symbiosis - which is the organisation's catchword for harmonising
institutions and commercial practices.
It says Japan and the US have been discussing such harmonisation for three
years in talks called the Strategic Impediments Initiative. The Keidanren
says Japan has made progress in opening its markets as requested by the US,
though more needs to be done.
However, it says: 'The SII process is designed to be a two-way street.
Unfortunately, the US is lagging in its response to the structural issues
raised by the Japanese side.'
The Keidanren singles out contradictions in US policy - contrasting US
demands for further deregulation in Japan with its requests for intervention
by Tokyo to boost imports in specific sectors.
The report also makes criticisms of the Japanese economy, including the
opaqueness of commercial dealings, a tendency to work over-long hours and an
exaggerated emphasis on market share.

MR Nick Greiner, premier of New South Wales, Australia's most populous
state, resigned yesterday five days after a finding against him by the
Independent Anti-Corruption Commission, writes Emilia Tagaza in Canberra. He
was replaced by Mr John Fahey, the industrial relations minister, who
becomes Liberal party leader as well.
The commission found Mr Greiner had acted corruptly in sanctioning the
appointment of Mr Terry Metherell, an independent MP, to a senior public
service job.
Mr Greiner was forced to resign after three independent MPs who hold the
balance of power in the state parliament had threatened to vote with the
opposition Labor party in a no-confidence motion.
Mr Greiner had offered to stand down until the Supreme Court ruled on his
appeal against the commission finding and to resign if the court upheld the
finding.
The offer was rejected by the independents.
Two other ministers also resigned yesterday: Mr Tim Moore, the environment
minister, who the commission found had helped arrange the appointment to the
public service job, and Mr Michael Yabsley, the tourism minister, who had
said he would quit if Mr Greiner resigned. Mr Metherell, has also quit the
public service position.

<TEXT>
SEOUL is making progress in stabilising South Korea's overheated economy,
the Bank of Korea, the country's central bank, said in its revised economic
forecast for 1992 yesterday. The government has informally adopted a target
of 'triple seven' economy this year: 7 per cent GNP growth rate, 7 per cent
inflation, and a Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.7bn) current account deficit.
The bank predicts the economy will grow 7.3 per cent against 8.4 per cent in
1991.
Inflation will slow to 8 per cent from 9.3 per cent in 1991 due to lower
economic growth and moderate wage increases. The current account deficit
will shrink to Dollars 6.7bn from Dollars 8.7bn last year as the trade
deficit narrows to Dollars 4.3bn due to improved export growth.
Exports will rise 9 per cent, reflecting a recovery in Seoul's main overseas
markets and the won's depreciation. Imports will grow 5.6 per cent as the
economic slowdown curbs demand.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Pace of democracy splits Hong Kong legislature
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S legislature last night split over the pace of democratisation in
the colony, bringing to an end an almost three-year pact which sought more
popularly elected seats for the colony's 1995 elections.
The members of the legislature voted 25 to 23 against a motion by liberal
legislator Mr James McGregor which asked for the Legislative Council's
reaffirmation of the October 1989 'Omelco consensus' struck by members of
both the Legislative and Executive (cabinet) councils.
The Omelco consensus called for a much faster introduction of elective
democracy in the colony than Britain and China had previously agreed. For
the 1995 elections it proposed that 30, or half, the legislature should be
directly elected, instead of the 18 earlier agreed by Beijing and London and
the 20 subsequently achieved by the UK through negotiation.
The vote underlines the clear divisions over how best to deal with China
ahead of the colony's transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Those who voted against Mr McGregor - all of whom were either appointed
members or elected to the legislature through a limited franchise - said
they saw no possibility of China agreeing to more elective democracy before
1997. It was, therefore, better to work with China rather than unnecessarily
angering it, they said.
Mr McGregor's supporters - who included all popularly elected politicians -
said that only through an increase in representative democracy could the
people's rights be safeguarded and Hong Kong be assured of the 'high degree
of autonomy' it was promised in 1984 when Britain and China agreed the terms
of the transfer of sovereignty.
The vote highlights the difficulties facing Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's
incoming governor. He will be one of the British government's key advisers
on how to deal with China on a range of political issues in the lead up to
1997. But he will have to tender that advice in the full knowledge that he
represents a divided community.
The decision by the legislature also weakens the position of Britain which
has, since early 1990, said it would raise the issue of faster
democratisation with the Chinese government. On a visit to the colony in
May, Mr Alastair Goodlad, a junior foreign office minister responsible for
Hong Kong, said Britain would take up the issue with China soon.
In early 1990 the UK had achieved an increase to 18 from 10 popularly
elected seats for the 1991 elections and an undertaking from China that no
fewer than 20 members would be popularly elected in the 1995 elections. The
spirit of this agreement was incorporated into the Beijing-drafted Basic Law
 -the colony's post-1997 constitution - and passed by the Chinese parliament
in April 1990.
China has said repeatedly that it will not change the Basic Law before 1997
and has denounced those who want its amendment as 'subversive'.

complaint, which was lodged with the Bombay police.
A statement from the bank emphasised that it was co-operating fully with

FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Settlers are defiant but anxious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEWISH SETTLERS in the occupied territories, who for the past two years
enjoyed unprecedented government support, reacted with a mixture of shock,
defiance and disquiet to the crushing general election victory by Labour and
its strongly anti-settler allies, Hugh Carnegy writes.
'People are disappointed. They are subdued and there is some anxiety,' said
Ms Sondra Baras, a resident of Karnei Shomron in the northern West Bank.
'But no one is packing their bags, that's for sure. We are not going to be
taken out of here and nothing is going to be dismantled.'
There was no escaping the fact that the settlers, scattered in their
fortress-like townships in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were among the
principal losers in the election as Israeli voters turned their backs on the
right-wing ideology that fuels the drive to people all of Eretz Israel - the
biblical Land of Israel - with Jews.
The settlers had grown accustomed to material and political support from the
Likud party since it came to power in 1977. Since mid-1990, when Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed a coalition with small far-right and
religious parties, the patronage increased dramatically, led by Mr Ariel
Sharon, the pro-settlement housing minister.
Settler numbers in the West Bank and Gaza grew by around 20 per cent to
100,000 - excluding a further 120,000 in Arab East Jerusalem. Construction
began on more than 20,000 new apartments. Overall, the government was
estimated to be spending around Shk3bn (Pounds 660m) a year on settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza.
Now the settlers are facing a very different outlook. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
Labour leader, supports settlement in East Jerusalem and other areas he
deems important to maintaining Israel's security. But he has signalled a
willingness to freeze what he calls 'political settlements' and promises to
channel government funds away from them to investment within 'Israel
proper'.
He will face strong resistance. 'If Labour wants to freeze the settlements
and conduct negotiations on a Palestinian state, the Likud and the whole
nationalist camp must stop it, not necessarily in parliament but with
settlements,' said Ms Geula Cohen of the Tehiya party, which lost all its
three Knesset seats in the election.
Ms Baras pointed out another problem for Mr Rabin. The government is pledged
to buy back at state expense any of the 9,000 vacant apartments in the
territories which cannot be sold by their builders.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Likud faces period of feuding over
selection of new leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, the familiar self-assurance of Israel's Likud leaders, cultivated
over a decade-and-a-half in power, evaporated, Hugh Carnegy reports. Mr
Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister for seven of the last nine years, managed to
prop up a smile, but the crumpled features of his colleagues at the party's
election headquarters told the story.
The Likud, which swaggered into government under the late Menachem Begin in
1977, had now suffered the kind of defeat it then inflicted on the Labour
party. The party's total of 32 seats in the Knesset (parliament) was eight
less than it won in 1988 and the lowest it has held since 1969.
Mr Shamir, in a rare show of emotion, appealed for unity in a flailing
speech to party workers in which he vowed that the Likud and its vision of a
'Greater Israel' would bounce back. But in the short term it is more likely
that the party will be riven by internal feuding over the succession to Mr
Shamir which began well before Tuesday's vote.
At 76, the tenacious Mr Shamir may yet hang on awhile in an effort to hold
the party together. But he himself signalled that he will not go on
indefinitely. 'I am at the end of my personal road,' he said.
The election loss must be laid largely at his door. The master for years of
reactive leadership, he was found hopelessly wanting when the challenges to
Israel of the last two years demanded initiative. He lost the confidence of
many Likud supporters by his stalling approach to the Middle East peace
process. He allowed the economy to drift when it faced the burden of mass
immigration from the former Soviet Union and he did nothing to prevent his
potential successors fighting a bitter public battle.
The consequence was that more than half the 250,000 immigrant voters plumped
for Labour and its allies. Significantly, it also appears that thousands of
the Likud's old bedrock supporters among Sephardi (oriental) Jews in hard-up
Israeli development towns defected.
The senior candidates to succeed Mr Shamir will be Mr Moshe Arens, the
outgoing defence minister, Mr Ariel Sharon, housing minister, and Mr David
Levy, the foreign minister. But the party may look for rejuvenation to Mr
Binyamin Begin, son of Menachem Begin and a charismatic figure, who has
already said he would stand.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Rabin will be no pushover for the peace
process - A look at the end of Likud domination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS fanciful to think that a country can change character overnight, but
to many Israelis yesterday it felt like that was exactly what had happened
after Tuesday's general election.
In the space of a day, 15 years of government dominated by the
uncompromising nationalist ideology of the Likud party were swept aside,
replaced by a resurgent Labour party promising to make peace with Israel's
Arab neighbours in a spirit of compromise and concession.
Words such as 'revolution', 'earthquake' and 'historic' littered the
comments of politicians, newspapers and ordinary people as they digested the
election's implications. 'Welcome to the new Israel,' gushed an enthusiastic
Labour supporter in Jerusalem.
The result was a defeat for the Likud that matched its own dramatic rise to
power in 1977 under Mr Menachem Begin. He was the charismatic champion of
'revisionist' Zionists who proclaimed Israel's biblical right to all of
Eretz Israel - the 'Land of Israel' including the Arab territories occupied
in the 1967 Six Day War.
It was symbolic that Mr Begin, long out of office, died shortly after the
election was called. Under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, his cautious
successor, the Likud's foundations were about to shake. Likud's election
loss was due in part to the defection of thousands of the country's poorer
Sephardim, or oriental Jews, whom Mr Begin had made the bedrock of the
party's support.
They, like most of the 300,000 recent immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, voted Labour in large part because of the dismal state of the
economy. But they were also sufficiently reassured by Mr Rabin's image as a
tough military man to support Labour's commitment to cede some of the
occupied territories in exchange for peace.
In the end, the potency of Likud's stance on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and expanding Jewish settlements was blunted by the obstacle it clearly
placed in the way of the US-brokered Middle East peace process, which has
proved highly popular among Israelis weary of years of conflict.
But how much will things now change under Mr Rabin, himself a cautious
pragmatist?
Ironically, he may find himself having to rein in 'doves' in his own party
and his allies in Meretz, the bloc of small left-wing and pro-peace parties
which will be Labour's chief coalition partner. Both the Labour doves and
Meretz espouse a much more radical commitment to giving up 'land for peace'
than Mr Rabin.
However, he should be able to move quickly to repair Israel's relationship
with the US, bruised by a series of rows between the Bush administration and
Mr Shamir's government. Labour's policy on the peace negotiations is much
more in tune with Washington, which considers 'land for peace' the essential
basis of any settlement.
Mr Rabin also said yesterday he was hopeful that his commitment to stop
government funding and subsidies for most of the Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza would prompt Washington to release Dollars 10bn (Pounds
5.4bn) in loan guarantees which Israel badly wants to help finance
immigration. President Bush withheld the guarantees because of Mr Shamir's
absolute refusal to freeze the settlements.
In the peace talks, Mr Rabin has laid out a position which is clearly
distinguished from Mr Shamir's government. Apart from his ultimate
willingness to cede at least some territory in a final settlement, Mr Rabin
is prepared to grant greater powers to the Palestinians in the interim stage
of autonomy for the occupied territories than the 'municipal autonomy'
offered by Likud.
He says an autonomy accord, which he plans to reach within nine months of
taking office, would include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from main Arab
population centres and transfer of control of day-to-day administration to a
Palestinian authority.
Mr Rabin says he would concentrate his efforts on reaching agreement with
the Palestinians, before attempting a settlement with Syria. He says Israel
should not 'go down' from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967,
for security reasons.
But Mr Rabin was at pains yesterday to stress that he would be no pushover.
He said Israel would continue to exercise control over defence, security,
foreign affairs and the Jewish settlements during the autonomy stage.
His stance on settlements is a long way from what the Palestinians are
demanding. He is committed to expanding Jewish settlements in Arab East
Jerusalem, the immediate West Bank hinterland, border areas such as the
Jordan Valley, and the Golan Heights. His objection to settlements is
confined to those in the West Bank and Gaza heartlands which he labels
'political' or ideological, settlements.
Labour has been careful not to spell out exactly how much territory it would
be willing to give up. The only policy guide it has ever published on the
subject was a plan drawn up in 1970 by the late Yigal Allon, then deputy
prime minister. The Allon plan envisaged annexing to Israel large chunks of
the West Bank and Gaza and ceding the rest to Jordan.
The plan is now considered out-dated, partly because the growth of Jewish
settlements has complicated the picture. But Labour officials suggest they
would be willing to cede more than was then envisaged. The plan's underlying
emphasis on keeping what is considered vital for Israel's security remains
valid.
As big a task for Mr Rabin as the peace process is regenerating the domestic
economy. Here the consensus among economists is the need for radical
reforms, such as industrial privatisation and liberalisation of the capital
and labour markets, to help generate growth urgently needed to alleviate
unemployment running at 11.5 per cent and about 40 per cent among
immigrants.
Mr Rabin talks of diverting the Shk3bn (Pounds 660m) now spent each year on
Jewish settlements to investment inside Israel. He hopes winning the US loan
guarantees will free funds for a big programme of infrastructural
investment. His goal is to revive immigration, which has slipped under the
burden of unemployment but which is still regarded as a vital demographic
asset for Israel.
However, Mr Rabin's commitment to economic reform looks suspect. He has said
he favours only limited privatisation of the 150 state-owned companies, not
wanting so-called strategic companies - such as the airline El Al - to slip
out of government control.
He also comes from the traditionalist wing of Labour that was firmly
socialist and which continues to support the strong ties with the Histadrut
trade union federation which has been one of the main forces opposing
wholesale market reforms.
It is ironic that the man who will preside over what a Meretz leader
yesterday called a new era in Israel comes from the generation of the
state's founding days. The outlook for Middle East peace is nevertheless
brighter as a result of his election. But Yitzhak Rabin faces many
formidable tests, at home and abroad, to prove he can indeed lead Israel to
peace and prosperity.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
RABIN'S MAIN POLICY COMMITMENTS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Re-order national priorities away from Likud's commitment to holding

FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Washington looks forward to a less
frosty relationship

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between the US and Israel have rarely been frostier than they have
over the past two years, and the Bush administration's pleasure at the
prospect of dealing with a new Israeli government is scarcely disguised.
President George Bush and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir never got along.
They clashed on policy - notably about the issue of US loan guarantees to
help resettle Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and about
Likud's refusal to give up occupied territories in return for a Middle East
peace settlement - but their conflict was compounded by personal antipathy.
Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, have always had a
much warmer relationship with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader, who as
defence minister was a frequent visitor to Washington earlier in the Bush
administration.
The US administration yesterday refrained from direct comment on the Israeli
election results, but Mr Baker made perfectly clear his belief that the
likelihood of a Labour government should provide new impetus to the Middle
East process, which has been largely stalled since the last round of
negotiations in Washington in April.
'I would hope that we could see the next round of bilateral discussions
taking place just as soon as it is conveniently possible in the aftermath of
the formation of a new Israeli government,' Mr Baker said yesterday.
While no one believes that progress in the peace talks will be easy, even
with a Labour government, Labour is expected at least to be less dogmatic
than Likud on the principle of giving up, in exchange for peace, some of the
occupied territories.
On issues such as settlements policy and Palestinian self-government, the
Labour party stands much closer than Mr Shamir's Likud to the Bush
administration's view of the necessary components for a Middle East peace
settlement.
A shift in policy on settlements - even though Mr Rabin rules out only
'political' settlements, not those which serve some security purpose - could
open the door for Israel to revive its request for the US to guarantee
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn) of loans to help with the resettlement of Jewish
immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
However, Mr Baker refused to speculate on that possibility, warning that it
might be days or weeks before a new Israeli government was in place.
In Congress, too, aides said that while some members might see the Israeli
election results as an opportunity to revive the loan guarantees issue, any
discussion before the formation of a new government would be premature. They
noted that congressional opposition to the loan guarantees was based not
only on Israel's settlements policy, but on a more general reluctance to
vote for any kind of foreign aid in an election year.

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE resounding general election victory by the Labour party is more than
anything a remarkable endorsement by Israelis of the leadership of a man who
first became prime minister 18 years ago and who has never displayed the
qualities of a natural politician.
It was the enduring popularity of Mr Yitzhak Rabin that carried Labour to
its triumph, overturning the long domination by the right-wing Likud party
that began shortly after Mr Rabin was forced to step down as Labour leader
in 1977 amid a scandal over his wife's illegal foreign bank accounts.
Once he had at last unseated his successor Mr Shimon Peres in a party
leadership ballot in February, Mr Rabin set about beating the Likud with a
highly personalised campaign which played heavily on his record as a tough
general and defence minister. The message was that voters fed up with
Likud's poor performance in office could support Labour's more conciliatory
stance on the Middle East peace process without worrying that the government
would be 'soft' on security issues.
Mr Rabin is an unlikely figurehead. At 70, his famous growling voice is
prone to crack into a smoker's cough. His rhetoric is stolid, not inspiring.
He appears flushed and weary and does not readily break into a smile. During
the campaign, Likud tried to damage him by reviving stories of the breakdown
he suffered as chief of staff on the eve of the 1967 Six Day War - he says
it was exhaustion - and his reputation as a heavy drinker.
These attacks apparently made no impact on Mr Rabin's electability - his
most precious quality for Labour which had suffered four election failures
under Mr Peres. But, judging by his rather frail appearance, there may well
be a legitimate question mark over Mr Rabin's physical resilience.
For now, however, the chief issue is how different his policies will be from
those of the Likud which refused to give up any of the occupied territories
in peace negotiations.
Mr Rabin, born in Jerusalem under the British Mandate when only 150,000 Jews
lived in all of what is now Israel, is committed to sustaining 'the Jewish
State' - that is, an Israel in which Jews form the overwhelming majority. It
is for this reason above all others that he is prepared to give up those
parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza most heavily populated by Arabs.
'I have never believed that by swallowing over 1.5m Palestinians of the
territories Israel will be able to be a Jewish democratic state. It would
become a bi-national state. That is not the way I interpret the Zionist
dream and the dream of generations of Jews about the return to Zion.'
However, he warns there is no 'short cut to peace', and that it has to be
achieved without compromising Israel's security.

WITH A few predictable exceptions, Arabs have reacted positively to the
Labour Party's election win. The Palestinians have urged Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
the party leader, to move quickly towards autonomy negotiations.
Among the most favourable reactions were those of Egypt and Jordan, which
hailed the victory as an opportunity for a new era in peacemaking.
In Cairo, Dr Osama al-Baz, a senior foreign policy official, said Egypt
hoped the result would 'give a strong push to peace efforts and the reaping
of a golden opportunity to achieve an historic reconciliation between Israel
and the Arabs'. In Amman, Dr Kamal Abu Jaber, Jordan's foreign minister, saw
it as 'the end of an era and the beginning of a new page in Israeli
politics'.
Positive reactions in Arab capitals to the defeat of Mr Yitzhak Shamir
reflect a general belief that Middle East peace negotiations were doomed as
long the Likud government was in power.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the chief Palestinian spokeswoman, expressed a common
view when she told reporters in Amman that 'the peace process has been
rescued from Likud attempts at sabotaging it'. She hoped that as soon as the
new government was formed it would 'proceed with the steps that it announced
earlier'.
This was a reference to Mr Rabin's promise to freeze 'political settlements'
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip - those deemed not vital to Israel's
security - and move quickly to begin negotiations on Palestinian self-rule
in the occupied territories under the Camp David formula of 1978.
US-sponsored bilateral peace talks are due to resume in Rome next month
between Israel and her Arab neighbours - including Syria, Lebanon and a
Palestinian-Jordanian team.
The talks, launched amid much fanfare in Madrid last October, have made
little progress. The presence in Rome of new Israeli negotiators seems
certain to promote a more constructive atmosphere.
But Palestinian delegates to the talks warned that while the Labour party
would be more flexible on autonomy, it was likely to adopt a hard line on
the final status of the territories. The Palestinians want their own
independent state, possibly in confederation with Jordan.
Syria reacted cautiously to the change in Israel, although it applauded Mr
Shamir's defeat. Mr Farouk al-Shara, foreign minister, said Damascus
reserved judgment. Syria is seeking the return of the Golan Heights seized
in the 1967 war, and annexed by the nationalist government of Mr Menachem
Begin in 1981.
Mr Rabin has spoken of 'creative solutions' to resolve the Golan issue, but
has not gone into details, beyond raising the possibility of Israel
continuing to utilise the heights while recognising Syrian sovereignty.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation welcomed the Labour victory. Mr Nabil
Shaath, a senior adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, said he hoped
Mr Rabin would 'stop settlements immediately and will proceed to bring about
quick action to install a Palestinian interim self-government by November
1'.
But in Jerusalem, Dr Mehdi Abdul Hadi, a prominent academic, said the
Palestinians would now have to think more seriously about the implications
and practicalities of autonomy. 'We have to be prepared. They will want us
to meet them half-way.'
Palestinians in the territories have been engaged in planning for interim
self-rule. Under such a formula Israel would retain responsibility for
security, but would pull back from population centres allowing the 1.75m
Arabs of the territories to administer themselves.
Sour reactions to the Labour victory came from Iran and its proxy Hizbollah
militia in Lebanon. Tehran Radio said there was 'no fundamental difference'
between Labour and Likud. 'The victory of the Labour party. . . . in no way
signifies a decrease in the Zionist regime's expansionist expectations,' it
said.
In Beirut, a Hizbollah leader said the guerrilla warfare against Israel's
south Lebanon security zone would continue.
The Lebanese government, on the other hand, said it hoped Mr Rabin would
facilitate Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon under the terms of Security
Council Resolution 425 passed during an Israeli incursion in 1978. Mr Rabin,
as defence minister in a national unity government in 1985, helped set up
Israel's 15km-wide security zone in southern Lebanon.

FEARS are growing among US police and FBI agents that Mr Sidney Reso, the
senior Exxon executive who went missing on April 29, may be dead.
Law enforcement officials have said that Mr and Mrs Arthur Seale, the former
Exxon security guard and his wife who were arrested last week and charged
with kidnapping Mr Reso, have been questioned by police but are refusing to
co-operate.
The FBI, while seeking other suspects, is less and less certain whether the
Seales - who are alleged to have demanded Dollars 18.5m in ransom before
they were captured last week - had an accomplice.
'If Mr and Mrs Seale are the only parties involved, we would not be
optimistic about Mr Reso still being alive,' one law enforcement official
said.
'We continue to hope there are additional co-conspirators still holding Mr
Reso,' the FBI said yesterday. 'We continue to work on the premise that he
is still alive, absent information to the contrary. But, as time goes on,
one becomes less optimistic.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / Big cloud over tobacco: The US Supreme Court filters a layer
of smoke obscuring state liability laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court ruling on smokers' lawsuits has hung, like an ominous
black cloud, over the tobacco industry for 15 months. Yesterday, it knew the
worst: the nine justices of the highest court in the US decided by 7:2 that
smokers can sue tobacco companies under state liability laws.
Despite the emotion surrounding smokers' suits, the Supreme Court was
dealing with a narrow, but fundamental, legal principle - the relationship
between state and federal laws in the US. Given the record of the judges it
was likely a majority would be loath to pre-empt the authority of the states
entirely.
The case on which the decision is based is Cipollene v. Liggett et al. Mrs
Rose Cipollene, a life-long smoker, sued three tobacco companies after
having a cancerous lung removed in 1983. She died in 1984, but the suit was
pursued by her husband and when he died, her family continued the fight.
The Cipollene case was remarkable among the raft of smokers' suits because
it progressed - at least briefly. In 1988, a Newark-based jury awarded Mr
Cipollone Dollars 400,000 on the grounds that the Liggett tobacco company
had misrepresented the risks of smoking in its advertisements for
Chesterfield and L&amp;M cigarettes. Although the jury found contributory
negligence on Mrs Cipollone's part, this was the first verdict requiring a
tobacco company to compensate the family of a smoker who had died of cancer.
Two years later, however, the award was overturned by a federal appeals
court. The court concluded that jurors had been allowed to consider Mrs
Cipollone's smoking habits after 1966 - when the federal law requiring
health warnings on cigarettes packets came into force - but not the tobacco
companies' post-1966 marketing practices.
This question of whether federally mandated warning labels protected tobacco
companies from personal injury claims under state liability laws came to
dominate the debate, with more contradictory rulings ensuing in other
courts.
With a fundamental judicial issue at stake, the Supreme Court agreed to
intervene in early 1991 - a move, incidentally, supported by both the
tobacco companies and the Cipollene plaintiffs.
But, for all the jubilation in the anti-smoking camp yesterday, it remains a
moot point how far the Supreme Court ruling will advance smokers' suits.
Only two justices - Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas - said they would bar
all suits under state liability laws, the other seven offered a range of
views on what type of claims are precluded by federal labelling law, and
which are not. This should provide the lawyers with plenty of grounds for
argument in the future.
Secondly, as the tobacco companies have noted all along, the ability to
bring state liability cases to court, does not automatically mean that they
will be won. The tobacco industry has mounted skillful defence tactics in
the past - and arguments such as contributory negligence will doubtless
resurface.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japan construction cartels hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has saddled 66 construction companies
that have admitted to rigging bids with an enormous pile of paperwork in an
effort to prevent them from forming cartels again.
The paperwork consists of obtaining individual signed pledges from all
company employees - and there are more than 100,000 of them - that they will
not take part in illegal activities. The boards of the 66 companies must
also approve resolutions to refrain from violating the anti-monopoly law.
The measure appears to be a mildly more severe slap on the wrist for the
guilty companies, following a 'cease and desist' order issued against the
companies in May, after which they were forbidden to bid on selected
government contracts for one month.
The action by the FTC is aimed at the practice by which Japanese companies
rig bids among themselves in an effort to pass work in rotation among the
companies. Although the government says the practice is rare, the US
believes cartels are normal in the industry and it has objected.
There was disappointment in May when the FTC decided against prosecuting the
66 companies, which had admitted to routinely rigging bids. The FTC,
however, argued that obtaining convictions under Japanese law would have
proved impossible, since individuals rather than companies would have to be
prosecuted. It is not entirely clear how obtaining pledges signed by
everyone from the chairman of the board to a crane operator will prevent bid
rigging.
Kajima, one of the bigger companies involved, says it will have to collect
some 13,000 pledges, all validated with a personal seal. It says, however,
that some companies have asked the FTC to reduce the number of signatures
required.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Genoa fearful of any storm in the port - A
look at prospects for regaining past maritime glories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENOA'S hopes of reclaiming its crown as one of Europe's leading maritime
centres are in danger of being dampened by renewed labour unrest, a history
of which has spoiled the reputation of Italy's biggest port.
Once a byword for seaborne trade, Genoa's importance as a port collapsed
during the 1970s owing to abysmal labour relations, inefficiency and poor
management. Crucial developments like containerisation were delayed, while
constant strikes prompted shippers to look elsewhere for reliable services.
Traffic shifted to smaller ports, such as La Spezia to the south, where
lower costs and better services compensated for geographical disadvantages.
Today Genoa is trying to make up for its past, pinning its expectations on a
huge new facility at Voltri, six miles to the west.
When fully operational, Voltri will dwarf all the Mediterranean's other
container ports. The 1m square metre site, opening next year, will be able
to handle three of the world's biggest container ships simultaneously.
Volume in the first year is expected to reach 100,000 containers, rising to
250,000 in 1995 and 500,000 by the end of the decade.
The project represents Genoa's ambition to regain its position in the
Mediterranean, and even to challenge bigger, more established ports like
Rotterdam and Hamburg for business between Europe and the Far East.
Voltri's case is based on geography. The new port is closer to many of
Europe's main population centres than Mediterranean competitors or big north
European rivals. Mr Rinaldo Magnani, the chairman of Genoa's port authority,
notes that Genoa is nearer Vienna, Zurich and Munich than is Rotterdam, and
is also 430km closer to Budapest, the door to the emerging markets of
eastern Europe.
Offloading at Voltri rather than at Rotterdam could save up to two weeks
sailing time for shippers from the Far East, port officials calculate.
Depending on the type of vessel, this could make trips between Dollars
200,000 (Pounds 108,108) and Dollars 500,000 cheaper. Cargo can be
discharged sooner, reaching customers faster due to Genoa's proximity to
many central and southern European destinations.
Genoa's problem is to convince sceptics that Voltri represents a definitive
break with the old port's reputation for politicisation, poor service and
bad labour relations. Mr Magnani's trump card is Fiat, Italy's biggest
private-sector company. Within its shift away from its core automotive
business, the group is leading the development of Voltri through Sinport, a
subsidiary of its Cogefar-Impresit building and civil engineering arm.
Sinport, which is investing L180bn (Pounds 81.33m) in the new port, has
taken 95 per cent of the shares in Voltri Terminal Europa (VTE), the company
awarded a 60-year concession to run the new facility. The port authority
holds the remainder of the equity.
Fiat's role as shareholder and manager is being cited as proof that Voltri
represents a change for the better. There are some signs of success. Mr
Giovanni Leodari, the senior Fiat-Impresit executive who heads Sinport,
draws attention to the opening of a new roll-on roll-off ferry terminal at
Voltri at the end of June - about a year ahead of schedule. The ro-ro
facility, to be used by the state-owned Finmare shipping group for a fast
ferry service between the Italian mainland and Sicily, proves shippers'
confidence, he says.
But Mr Leodari's main job is to persuade big international 'round the world'
shipping groups to berth at Voltri. Currently, the large container vessels
plying the Far East to Europe route sail through the Suez canal but
discharge at ports like Rotterdam rather than stopping in the Mediterranean.
'In the past, shippers weren't able to find the service they wanted,' says
Mr Leodari. 'So they just by-passed the Mediterranean ports and sailed on.'
Today, the big ports of northern Europe account for 77 per cent of the
European Community's seaborne trade, against 23 per cent for those in the
Mediterranean.
The aim is to reach long-term agreements with a number of leading shippers.
On paper, Voltri's case is strong - the harbour is both large and deep
enough for the biggest container vessels and boasts 1,400m of linear
quayside. The new facility offers an area the size of 140 football pitches
for storing and trans-shipping containers.
A newly-opened spur means Voltri has direct access to Italy's motorway
network. Rail connections have been improved so that containers heading
north can reach the main lines to Milan and Turin without having to pass
through Genoa.
Voltri is also aiming to create a broader package of services that could
involve closer links with leading ports in the Far East. Mr Leodari would
clearly like to emulate Singapore, where the volume of container traffic has
grown by 20-25 per cent a year in the past five years.
This month's upsurge of labour trouble at Genoa's old port could hardly have
come at a worse time. . Dockers at one terminal last week refused to handle
a cargo in protest at the gradual privatisation of facilities, being pushed
through by Mr Magnani, himself an ex-docker. On Tuesday, dockers blocked a
second attempt to restart operations. Port officials are playing down the
conflict and stress it could not happen at Voltri, which will not be covered
by the existing national dock labour scheme. But the incident provided an
uncomfortable reminder of the sort of trouble that sent Genoa's reputation
sinking in the first place.

FIFTEEN nations have agreed on the first steps to turn their Asia-Pacific
Economic Co-operation (Apec) group into a permanent institution, writes
Peter Ungphakorn in Bangkok.
At a three-day meeting that ended in Bangkok yesterday they agreed to set up
a small secretariat, initially headed by an official seconded from one of
the member governments.
'This really represents a new stage in Apec's development. Whereas before it
was a dialogue organisation, now it will be an institution,' said Mr Ted
Delofski, head of the Australian delegation. Since its creation almost three
years ago, Apec's main achievements have been to hold annual meetings of its
trade and foreign ministers and to devise 10 programmes for co-operation in
subjects ranging from fisheries to lowering trade barriers.
Some members, most notably Australia and New Zealand, barely disguise the
fact that they see Apec as an insurance policy in case the world breaks up
into warring trade blocs.
The 13 other members are: the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.

FT  25 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Munich summit lends impetus to farm talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl is in contact with both the US government and the
European Commission in an urgent effort to break the deadlock in the Uruguay
round of trade liberalisation talks, the German government spokesman said
yesterday.
'He believes that all possible efforts must be made to reach a conclusion in
the Uruguay round before the (Group of Seven economic) summit in Munich,' Mr
Dieter Vogel said: 'He is not the only one making an effort, but he is
perhaps a little more heavily involved than others.'
Also in Bonn, Mr Joseph Connor, president of the International Chamber of
Commerce, emerged from a pre-summit briefing with Mr Kohl claiming the
German leader had responded positively to an urgent call for a breakthrough.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the main German board member at the ICC, said world
industry would be sent a negative signal by failure to make significant
progress at the Munich summit: 'Business will conclude that we are entering
a protectionist world. Every business will act as if that world already
existed.' The ICC delegation said its concerns had 'hit a responsive chord'.
The ICC told Mr Kohl that the credibility of the G7 leading industrial
nations had been stretched to the limit by the Uruguay negotiations.
Referring to the 'at best fragile condition' of the world economy, Mr
Schimmelbusch, who also heads Metallgesell-schaft, the German industrial
group, said a collapse of the Uruguay round would further retard
international growth.
In London, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), told world grain traders that the recent EC
decision to reform the common agriculture policy (CAP) had enabled the
Uruguay round 'to gain greater focus'.
Remaining doggedly optimistic about a positive outcome, he noted:
'Courageous and wise political decisions are urgently needed.' He warned
that a settlement of the EC-US farm trade dispute was only a first step to
completing the round.
Market access and services negotiations had been stalled by the farm trade
dispute. Disagreements over 'bananas, shipping and financial services'
remain unresolved, he said.
In Bonn, Mr Vogel said that there had so far been no significant shift in EC
positions on farm trade reform, but the German government was making 'very
serious efforts to find at least a political agreement before the summit'.
He said that it was unlikely - and undesirable - that either this week's EC
summit in Lisbon, or the Group of Seven summit in Munich, should be turned
into detailed negotiations on agricultural trade: 'There will not be any
game of agricultural poker between the EC and the US in Munich,' he said.
Instead, German and British negotiators hope to draft a compromise that can
be accepted by France, and then presented to US negotiators perhaps in
Washington next week.
Reflecting the particular problems that France has in agreeing a farm trade
settlement, the French trade and industry minister, Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, yesterday expressed doubts that the Gatt negotiations can be
resolved before US presidential elections in November.
Negotiators in the five-year Uruguay Round will continue to work on various,
technical issues in the meantime, he said, during a presentation of French
trade figures.
France has been rocked by two weeks of protests by farmers who claim cuts in
farm prices will put them out of business.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Trade surplus to May best for 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESS on industrial export markets helped France record a FFr4.5bn (Pounds
450m) trade surplus in May, bringing the surplus over the previous 12 months
to FFr9.4bn, the best result for 20 years.
This is the fifth monthly surplus in a row and puts the trade account on
track to break even or make a small surplus for the year, said Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, industry and foreign trade minister.
He attributed the turnround, from a FFr30bn deficit for the whole of last
year, to the fact that low French inflation had made French industrial goods
competitive on export markets.
France's export success was the main component in growth so far this year,
as investment and consumer demand in the domestic economy continued to
perform sluggishly, he said.
Last month's surplus is slightly smaller than the FFr7.57bn surplus recorded
in April and reflects a fall in both exports and imports. Exports declined
by 5.7 per cent to FFr103.4bn from April to May, while imports fell by 3.2
per cent to FFr98.9bn.
This bought the surplus for the first five months of the year to FFr17.9bn,
representing a FFr37bn turnround from the FFr19.01bn deficit in the same
period of last year. The industrial account represented the FFr30bn of this.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Commission warns on double taxation agreements: Brussels
opts for modest, more consultative stance on corporation tax levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC governments yesterday were warned not to enter into double taxation
agreements with countries outside the EC as some treaties could be
potentially discriminatory.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner responsible for fiscal matters,
confirmed that the European Commission was studying bilateral double
taxation treaties to establish whether they disadvantaged companies based in
other EC countries.
The most recent and important example of such a treaty is that between
Germany and the US. But the Commission is unlikely to act precipitately
against potentially discriminatory agreements. Instead, Mrs Scrivener
yesterday outlined a softly-softly approach on corporate tax.
The Commission's modest proposals on corporate tax are likely to relieve EC
governments - notoriously sensitive about tax matters - at the same time as
they may disappoint tax hardliners.
They follow the report of an expert committee - chaired by Mr Onno Ruding,
the former Dutch finance minister - submitted in March. The Ruding report
called for radical harmonisation of EC corporate tax rates at between 30 and
40 per cent, and rapid action to eliminate differences in national
corporate.
But Mrs Scrivener said many of the committee's suggestions went 'beyond what
is absolutely necessary in the Community in the initial phase.' The
Commission has rejected the idea of a maximum corporation tax rate, and
believes that, although a minimum rate is 'worth examining thoroughly,' 30
per cent would be too high.
Mrs Scrivener's concerns are more practical than ideological. Tax matters
have to receive unanimous approval of member states, and, as the
commissioner said yesterday: 'I would like to avoid a situation where we
make proposals which spend 17 years gathering dust.'
That was roughly how long it took to motivate member states' discussions on
earlier company tax proposals aimed at easing the fiscal situation for
multinationals which have subsidiaries in several EC countries. The plans
outlined yesterday are likely to be transformed into legislation by the end
of the year and should nudge forward the process.
First, the Commission is keen to make sure existing plans are adopted and
implemented. It is urging member states to ratify a 1990 convention on the
double taxation of cross-border asset transfers. So far only two member
states have approved it. Two more parent-subsidiary directives also need to
be adopted.
Brussels is also suggesting specific action on some of the Ruding
committee's recommendations, most of which it believes could be enacted
through consultation and agreement, rather than legislation.
The main aim is the elimination of outstanding double taxation problems.
Directives will be produced extending the parent-subsidiary directives to
all companies. A consultation procedure will be set up to pre-empt tax
disputes over cross-border asset transfers. The Commission would also like
to start talks with EC governments on the treatment of dividends from
'foreign' companies and dividends from domestic groups. Some member states
tax foreign-source dividends more heavily.
Mrs Scrivener believes such measures would go some way towards eliminating
tax disadvantages of cross borders collaboration, but with the Commission
under fire for its alleged tendencies towards centralisation, she is
reluctant to push member states too far.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FLEDGLING democratic movement is trying to establish itself in Serbia
against overwhelmingly odds, in the form of an uncompromising domestic
regime and international isolation.
Mr Dobrica Cosic, recently elected president of the reconstituted Yugoslavia
(consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), is now engaged in extensive talks
with opposition movements in Serbia, with the aim of eroding the powers of
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president.
Although Mr Cosic was one of the architects of the plan for a greater Serbia
promoted by Mr Milosevic, he now recognises that this plan has failed
miserably.
Already, the Serbian president has lost control over sections of the army,
which in theory is now directly under the control of Mr Cosic. In addition,
he has lost the support of the influential Serbian Academy of Sciences, the
Orthodox church, and the university.
Managers of major enterprises have denounced Mr Milosevic for his
catastrophic economic policies, while the students, on strike now for 11
days, are demanding his resignation.
For his part, Mr Cosic, whose authority in Serbia is considerable, wants to
create a broad platform of support to pave the way for free and democratic
elections later this year.
'The question is whether Mr Cosic has the strength to carry out his plan . .
. and prevent the country from sliding into civil war,' said a senior
European Community diplomat.
'We do not know how Milosevic will react. He is still capable of generating
conflicts, for instance in Kosovo,' the diplomat said. 'Moreover, when the
people reach a certain level of economic deprivation, they will take to the
streets, and nobody will be able to control masses which will not be
demanding democracy,' he explained.
These efforts are also being hindered by fears that additional sanctions
will be imposed. 'The small democratic movement will be completely
destroyed', he adds.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (7): Posh Gorbals - Slum Transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW, like most other big British cities, made big efforts after the
Second World War to disperse its population from the centre to the suburbs.
One result was a fall in population - from 1.12m in 1939 to only 700,000
today. Another was the so-called doughnut effect: Glasgow has a rich centre
and a poor periphery. The metaphor does not work completely since not all
council tenants were moved to the peripheral estates, where until the 1970s
most housing was built by the public sector for rent.
But most recent inner city residential developments have been privately
developed. In the Merchant City, attractive but derelict warehouses and
factories close to the City Chambers (city hall) were handed over to private
developers by the city council and made into residential units which are
either unsuitable for families or beyond the pocket of working class people.
In 1980s terminology, it was 'yuppified'.
Now, however, an ambitious pilot scheme, backed by the Glasgow Development
Agency, the Glasgow District Council and Scottish Homes, the housing
enabling body, aims to develop a low cost housing community close to the
city centre.
The project, called the Crown Street regeneration project, is to take place
in part of the notorious Gorbals, which is a microcosm of Glasgow's changing
fortunes over the past 100 years.
The Gorbals, on the south bank of the River Clyde only five minutes from the
city centre, was once a respectable middle class area. Then from the 1860s
the once fashionable four storey tenements in the area were occupied by
Irish immigrants and Highlanders driven to the big city by famine and
clearances. So overcrowded were the buildings that a system known as
'ticketing' was introduced, which stipulated the numbers who could live in a
four storey building. By the 1880s one seventh of Glasgow's population lived
in ticketed buildings.
With industrialisation people continued to pour in. By the early 1900s, the
still elegant stone facades of Hutchesontown in the centre of the Gorbals
concealed a hidden Glasgow. Families ate, slept, gave birth and died in one
room.
The cheap housing attracted further immigrants from Ireland and Eastern
Europe and from Pakistan. These added their own cultures to the distinctive
street life of the area. But the area became best known for the violence of
the so-called razor gangs. By the 1950s the Gorbals had the worst slums
north of Naples.
The post-war planners in Glasgow decided to start from scratch. The first
area in the city to be tackled was Hutchesontown/ Gorbals. The Hutchesontown
Redevelopment Plan was finally approved in 1957. The area was to be a green
city of tower blocks.
It was not a success. The communities felt cut off and alienated. Within a
short time the tower blocks - built using the 'tracoba' method of system
building imported from Algeria - suffered from dampness and condensation.
Lifts broke down. The dampness proved incurable. By 1982 the last residents
were moved out. Five years later Hutcheson E - the most notorious of the
blocks - was demolished.
There are 40 acres standing empty in Hutchesontown owned by the city
council. It is here that the Crown Street regeneration project will take
place. The plan is to build 1,000 four storey tenements. The first two
floors will be three and four bedroom maisonettes with gardens back and
front. The top two floors will form single level one and two bedroom
apartments.
Twenty five per cent of the dwellings will be for rent with the rest for
owner occupation. The entire project will cost Pounds 80m. Scottish Homes
has put up Pounds 9m as seed money (in England it would be defined as city
grant.) Because the council owns the land, and there is a high level of
subsidy, the housing that is not for rent will be cheap. Maisonettes will
start at Pounds 50,000 and flats at Pounds 32,000.
Mr Mike Galloway, the director of the project which is only at the stage of
examining design tenders, says, 'what we are attempting here is
revolutionary. We are going for urban regeneration without gentrification.
We are going to build a genuine lower middle class community here. There
will be shops and community centres. We even have plans for a budget hotel.
People from different walks of life will want to live here because it is so
close to the city centre.'
The peripheral estates which have tens of thousands of residents are a
different problem. The estates, consisting of a mixture of three to four
storey blocks of flats and tower blocks, have become almost as infamous as
the Gorbals. They are characterised by high unemployment (30 per cent in
some cases), by alienation and loss of community spirit, by vandalism, drugs
and other symptoms of deprivation.
It is unfair to say, however, that because the estates are out of sight they
are out of mind. Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University sits on the
partnership committee for the Castlemilk estate, to the south of the city.
This is one of four partnership areas in Scotland designated by the
secretary of state for Scotland - joint ventures between central government
and local community organisations.
Professor MacGregor says, 'Over 10 years hundreds of millions of pounds will
be channeled into the estates in all kinds of areas, housing, training,
employment and training. One of the things we are doing is to improve links
between Castlemilk and East Kilbride where there are good employment
prospects after the recession.'
In other areas organisations such as the Glasgow Development Agency, the
Glasgow District Council and the Confederation of British Industry in
Scotland are involved in initiatives on the estates. Professor MacGregor
says, 'it is early days for the initiatives. But it is not true to say that
the city council is spending money on tarting up the centre and on the arts
that it should be spending on the estates. It is doing both.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (6): Attractions galore - Land and subsidies bring
in the investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW has for the past 10 years been vigorously trying to attract new
businesses. The city on the Clyde urgently needed to replace some of the
thousands of jobs lost in shipbuilding and engineering.
The city has concentrated on building itself up as a service centre based on
retailing, tourism, financial services, scientific research and providing
companies with regional headquarters. It would also like to encourage
manufacturing but has not done as well as a number of other places in
Scotland.
Professor Alan MacGregor, of the social and economic research department at
Glasgow university, says: 'People still think of Glasgow as an industrial
city but it has not been an industrial city for a long time now.
Manufacturing occupies only 16 per cent of the workforce. Apart from
anything else there is not the land available for manufacturing.
'Manufacturers nowadays generally want greenfield sites. There have been
lots of manufacturing companies drawn to places close to Glasgow like East
Kilbride. But in the city itself, like other cities, there is not the room.'
In setting out its stall to attract service companies, Glasgow has a
formidable array of attractions. It is a development area so that companies
qualify for Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) from the Scottish Office
Industry Department.
Through Strathclyde region, Glasgow receives assistance from the European
Social Fund directed at people through training programmes, and from the
European Regional Development Fund which is aimed at infrastructural
improvements. There is also EC money available for former coal and steel
producing areas.
This all amounts to a considerable subsidy to Glasgow, some of which filters
through to individual companies. The Economic Policy Unit of the City
Council estimates that Regional Selective Assistance alone can account for
30 per cent of fixed project costs.
On top of this, much of the work of the Scottish Development Agency, before
its winding up in 1991, was devoted to Glasgow. It offered a range of
practical and financial assistance and was able to build, rent and sell
offices and factories at low cost.
The SDA has now become Scottish Enterprise, which operates through a network
of local enterprise companies of which Glasgow's is the Glasgow Development
Agency. The GDA can still act as an enabling body in the property sector.
As an example the GDA recently bought 35 acres of the land on which the
Glasgow garden festival was held in 1988 at a cost of Pounds 5m. The GDA
will look for a private developer for the land when the property climate
improves. By putting land into a project as a form of equity the GDA can
make the scheme more economical for the developer.
There has been heavy investment in Glasgow's infrastructure. Mr Stephen
Ince, the economic development officer at the City Council, says: 'We
estimate that Pounds 2.4bn is likely to be invested from 1991 and over the
next three or four years, mostly in offices, shops, transportation and
communications.'
Much of the office stock in the city centre has been renewed in the past few
years, and new offices built. The council's economic policy unit claims that
Glasgow's office rents are typically only 35 per cent of those in central
London and Paris, and 50 per cent of the rate in Madrid, Milan and
Frankfurt.
Wages are similarly low, with non-manual male and female wage rates between
only 70 per cent and 74 per cent of the greater London rate. The potential
savings of operating in Glasgow increase because of the high degree of
labour market stability in the city.
The council estimates that annual staff turnover in service industries in
Glasgow is less than 7 per cent, compared with 20 per cent in London and 15
per cent in the south-east of England.
As for high quality staff there are two universities - Glasgow and
Strathclyde - with 8,000 students graduating from these and the polytechnics
and further education colleges each year.
Communications is another important factor influencing relocation decisions.
Here too Glasgow, scores highly. It is relatively free of congestion for a
big city. Glasgow is the only major city with a motorway running through its
centre.
The suburban rail network, underground and bus links form one of the most
comprehensive in Britain. There are inter-city rail connections to all major
UK cities. Glasgow airport is less than 15 minutes from the city centre. It
provides flights to 60 domestic and international destinations including
more than 190 flights a week to London.
Finally the city prides itself on its quality of life. Like many towns and
cities in Britain, Glasgow can claim that employees can live in pleasant
surroundings only a few minutes from work, with no problems parking on
arrival, and get swiftly out into the countryside, compared with the hour or
so it takes to get to work London. Glasgow also sees itself as a
cosmopolitan city with a vibrant cultural life, including concerts, ballet,
opera and restaurants.
With all this, Glasgow has been successful in attracting new service
companies ranging from regional headquarters of financial services groups to
government departments to software systems and engineering.
In spite of this month's decision by BP Exploration to pull out of Glasgow
over the next year or so, the city has attracted 17 concerns involving just
under 7,000 net new jobs between 1986 and 1991 (see table).
Unemployment at 14.5 per cent amounts to just under 60,000 jobs.
Unemployment is traditionally high in Glasgow but these new jobs in services
have made a significant dent in what the overall total might be especially
when taken together with new jobs in tourism.
The table shows that Glasgow is on the way to becoming a second tier
financial services centre.
It has won a fair share of government department relocations and is laying
the basis for a research and development network which can lock into the
universities.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (8): A lot to offer - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOURISM has been one of the key elements in the renaissance of Glasgow.
In 1982 there were 700,000 visitors to Glasgow, many of them day trippers.
By 1990 the number had risen to 3m. Of these, 1.5m were staying visitors
with an average stop of two nights. Around 500,000 were from abroad.
It has been estimated that the total tourist 'spend' in that year was Pounds
217m accounting for 10 per cent of tourist spending in Scotland as a whole.
In terms of foreign visitors, the amount spent was Pounds 109m or half the
total. This accounted for almost 20 per cent of the Scottish average.
Glasgow became the third most popular short break destination in the UK
after London and Edinburgh.
According to the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board 22,000 people in Glasgow were
employed in tourism in 1990 out of a labour force of 350,000. This figure
does not include the self-employed and represents 6.3 per cent of the
workforce.
How has this transformation come about? Admittedly, 1990 was exceptional,
marking Glasgow's designation as the EC City of Culture and last year,
visitors again dropped back a little.
But the City of Culture year was only a stage in a concerted drive by the
Labour-dominated city council to diversify the city's economy.
First, it would spruce up the city centre. Second it would develop retailing
at all levels. Third it would win inward investors from financial services,
government departments and high technology companies. Finally, there would
be an attempt to exploit its rich cultural heritage to attract visitors.
Glasgow claims to have the largest cultural infrastructure in the UK outside
London and has some 200 cultural and performing arts organisations.
The authorities' attempts to increase tourism received a lift from set-piece
events such as the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 visited by more than 4m
people in five months.
Then there was the City of Culture year in 1990. Some 3,700 events of
different sizes were staged throughout the year. A report on the year's
impact on Glasgow, by Professor John Myerscough, an economist specialising
in the economic impact of culture, concluded that: 'The initiative generated
a positive net economic return to the regional economy of Pounds 10.3m to
Pounds 14.1m. Extra employment arising from Glasgow 1990 was estimated at
5,350'5,580 person years.' The year of culture also attracted about 600,000
extra visitors. But although culture spearheaded the campaign to develop
tourism it was not the whole story.
The much brighter image of Glasgow had attracted the general leisure tourist
before 1990. The shopping/hotel/ restaurant infrastructure was well
developed by 1990. The speciality shopping in Prince's Square and the
Italian centre are both appealing to an international audience.
Americans started to add Glasgow to London, Stratford and Edinburgh on their
list of cultural destinations. International visitor numbers were further
boosted when, under the government's open skies policy for Scotland, Glasgow
airport won the right to operate transatlantic flights, ending the monopoly
held by Prestwick. There are now daily flights between Glasgow and
destinations in the US and Canada.
Glasgow is increasingly seen as a starting place for trips to the Highlands,
to the Robert Burns country in Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire, to Loch Lomond
and the golf courses of St Andrews and Gleneagles.
The Greater Glasgow Tourist Board claims that 'Greater Glasgow is the only
destination in Western Europe that can boast 13,000 beds, a purpose-built
conference and exhibition centre and international airport all within 15
minutes of each other'.
The Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre can house concerts for 10,000
and has seen performers as diverse as Pavarotti and Paul Simon in recent
years. But its main function is to house trade shows and conferences in its
five halls.
Business visitors are another important element of Glasgow's tourism drive.
There are a number of four star business hotels like the Holiday Inn and
Forte Crest. Next April the city will get its first 5-star hotel with the
opening of the Glasgow Hilton.
The 300-room hotel costing over Pounds 36m will include a grand ballroom for
up to 1,000 people, a specialist conference centre and 11 boardrooms.
Mr Ronald Roy , the chief executive of the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and
Convention Bureau, reckons the importance of business tourism should not be
underestimated. He says, 'rounded up I estimate that about half the Pounds
200m-odd Glasgow earns from tourism comes from business visitors,
particularly conferences'.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (5): University challenge - Education is one of the
biggest employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER education occupies an important place in Glasgow. Currently there
are two universities and eight colleges which between them have about 60,000
students. Some 12,000 people are directly employed by the colleges making
further education the single largest employer after government departments
including health organisations.
The universities include the University of Glasgow, the second most ancient
university in Scotland and one of the oldest and largest in the UK. It was
founded in 1451. Then there is the University of Strathclyde, founded in the
1960s.
At the other end of the scale Glasgow Polytechnic should in the next few
months, barring last minute hurdles, unite with Queen's College in the city
and become Queen's University with around 11,000 students. Similarly,
Paisley College, located in Paisley to the west of Glasgow, should soon be
designated Paisley University. This will give Glasgow four universities.
Whether the universities are ancient or newborn, all of them have been
encouraged in the past decade by the government to be more businesslike in
the way they run themselves and more entrepreneurial in finding new sources
of funding.
This can mean forging closer links with industry and the marketing of
research. It can also mean business schools selling market research and
information on contracts and contract law.
The University of Glasgow claims to be the largest science-based university
in the UK outside London and also has one of the largest medical schools. It
also has a veterinary medicine department. Its most oversubscribed
undergraduate course is film and theatre studies.
With its size and range - there are 21,000 students altogether - Glasgow
University is well placed to develop closer research and technology
crossovers with industry.
Mr Mike Brown, the press and information officer and Mr Richard Blackmore,
the intellectual property manager, outline some of the projects the
university has been involved in. The veterinary department has developed
Virol, a vaccine for cattle. The department of naval architecture is heavily
involved in research for platform safety on oil rigs in the North Sea.
The Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division (GUARD) of the
Department of Archaeology has been associated in research for upgrading the
A47 road to motorway standard.
The university's department of cardiology is involved with Siemens-Elema of
Stockholm to market software for the Computer Assisted Reporting of
Electrocardiograms (CARE). This has been called the software for heartbeats
programme.
In all, Mr Brown estimates that the university derives Pounds 14.5m from
sales of research, technology and other forms of liaison with industry. This
is distinct from funding by the government Research Council. Taken together
with other ancillary activities such as the visitor's centre and the museum
and art gallery, the sales of research and other services makes up more than
10 per cent of total revenue.
Sir William Kerr Fraser, the principal and vice chancellor, says: 'We attach
enormous importance to our links with industry and our research in science
and medicine. Given what Glasgow is trying to do in developing new
industries, we have an important role to play. We supply new graduates in a
wide range of disciplines. Our staff are available for consultancy and there
are areas such as health care, where our research can be important.'
The University of Strathclyde is similarly-business minded. The university
started life as the Royal College of Science and Technology in 1796. It
currently has 9,000 students in four departments and 3,000 staff.
Dr Hugh Thomson, the university's director of research and development,
says: 'We are highly collaborative with industry. When I last did the
calculation I estimated that between 14 and 15 per cent per cent of our
income came from research contracts or technological crossover.'
The crossover extends across a wide range of subjects. The faculty of
engineering worked with industry in developing aids for the disabled and in
the replacements of joints for sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis and
similar complaints.
The Faculty of Science is active in waste biotechnology. One research
project funded by Rhone-Poulenc aims to establish a bank of microbial
organisms which interact in the absence of oxygen. After testing to
establish the effects of environmental variables such as temperature and
moisture content the idea is that these microbial associations will then be
used to target specific waste streams, breaking down the waste and
controlling pollution.
Dr Thomson gives an example of where pure research has come to have a
valuable commercial application: the department of pharmacy within the
department of science developed a muscle relaxant drug called atracurium.
This is marketed by the Wellcome corporation in the US.
In the university's accounts for 1991-92 royalty income from atracurium was
Pounds 1.2m. 'Atracurium started life as a pretty academic exercise,' Dr
Thomson says.
Another example of entrepreneurial spirit is to be found in the Strathclyde
Business School, which
has just completed a new Pounds 11m centre. It is expected eventually to
become self-financing through the sale of contracts and other services.
Surprisingly, given the assumed success of science parks in England like
those at Cambridge and Warwick, the West of Scotland Science Park, in which
both Glasgow University and Strathclyde have an interest, is not deemed to
work too well - at least by Dr Thomson.
'It works perfectly well as a business park. But there has not been real
crossover with the universities. I don't know why exactly. I suppose if it
were not 20 minutes drive away things would be easier. But we are trying to
develop small incubator units here where companies involved in technology
can set up and avail themselves of research and expertise,' Dr Thomson says.
Dr Thomson says he would not advise people to read too much into what he
says about the science park. ' There is a lot of collaboration with
industry. Glasgow has become a dynamic place in recent years. There is a lot
of buzz, a lot of self confidence. The universities are very much part of
the revival.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (4): Buildings for commerce - New offices spring up
to house the service sector economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR several years the private and public sectors have collaborated in
improving and expanding the office stock in the heart of Glasgow, as part of
the policy of making it a centre of service activities and attracting new
businesses.
The Glasgow office property market began taking off from 1987 as developers
became aware of the city's new potential. A surge of activity began as
developers rebuilt or heavily refurbished the office buildings in the
business core of the city around St Vincent Street.
Part of the pressure came from local businesses such as solicitors,
accountants, stockbrokers and advertising agencies who were expanding
rapidly and found that their existing offices were both too small and
inappropriate for the computer age.
The Scottish Development Agency, which in Glasgow was the forerunner of the
Glasgow Development Agency, had been trying for several years to persuade
developers to look at new sites in Glasgow. It had identified areas of
derelict or semi-derelict property adjacent to the core of the city to which
it envisaged the city's office area expanding, and thus attracting company
headquarters or large branch offices to Glasgow.
As Mr Ted Webster, senior partner of the chartered surveyors Richard Ellis,
used to point out in the late 1980s, improving the accommodation of
indigenous Glasgow businesses was essential to the process of attracting
incomers. 'You've got to have the local business community well-housed
before you can get many people to come in from outside,' he said.
From the late 1980s many buildings around St Vincent Street and West George
Street were refurbished or rebuilt, often behind their original facades if
these were subject to preservation orders. Office rents in the central
business area, which comprises about 8m sq ft of office space between George
Square and Charing Cross (the total rises to 12m sq ft including the Park
area immediately to the west), increased from about Pounds 8 per square foot
for space in prime locations in 1987 to reach a sustained average peak of
about Pounds 18 in 1989.
According to Mr David Rooney of the chartered surveyors Lambert Smith
Hampton, the market reached its zenith in that year, with some deals being
done at Pounds 20. It was not until the end of 1990 that the recession began
to be felt seriously in the Glasgow property market.
Now the market presents a more depressing picture. New development starts
have come to an end and Richard Ellis calculates that about 650,000 sq ft of
office space is available for rent, with a further 224,000 sq ft due for
completion before the end of the year.
Whereas the annual take-up of quality office space was running at 500,000 sq
ft in the late 1980s, it fell to 350,000 sq ft in 1991 and only 165,000 sq
ft had been let in the first five months of this year.
Mr Rooney says that Glasgow is experiencing the tail-end of the 1980s boom
as the last projects initiated in that period come to completion, and 'no
one has the appetite to start new construction on the gap sites'. Much of
the overhang consists of second hand office accommodation, 10 to 30 years
old, which has been vacated by businesses trading up to more modern
premises.
This accommodation will be difficult to shift for the time being, he
believes, as rents are being driven down by aggressive negotiators.
Yet people in the property industry are not as gloomy as one might expect.
Mr Webster says: 'It is not a sign of ill-health to have empty buildings. If
there wasn't any, people looking for space would go away again.' Glasgow, he
points out, traditionally has a stable office property market with demand
growing steadily because of the size of the city's hinterland and its large
potential workforce, but not outpacing supply, which grows because of the
relative ease with which new developments can get underway.
The largest single empty building, Tay House, which covers 160,000 sq ft
with a wing built on a bridge across the M8 motorway, would be suitable for
any company seeking a large amount of high quality space for immediate
occupation.
The decision of BP Exploration announced this month to leave its
headquarters in St Vincent Street in the next year or so will free more high
quality office space, although some space has already been taken by Abbey
National.
Mr Ken Campbell of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley says there is now 'a brake on the
market which I see running for the next 12 months. But we are not in free
fall: there is no resemblance here to London.'
The most significant new development in the Glasgow's office property scene
is the Broomielaw project. For years the business district has been
gradually expanding south from St Vincent Street towards the river Clyde.
The Broomielaw project leapfrogged straight to the riverfront; it involves
creating nearly 1m square feet of top quality office space in an area which
in 1987 consisted of semi-derelict warehouses and shops.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (3): The importance of image - Glasgow puts a brave
face on recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION has cast a pall of uncertainty over Glasgow, and yet in strictly
relative terms the city is suffering less from the downturn than many
others.
The recession came late to Glasgow, as it did to the rest of Scotland.
Unemployment in Glasgow was still falling just over a year ago when it was
rising fast in southern Britain, and at that time the city's commercial
property market was only beginning to experience a downturn. Even now
unemployment is only 1.5 per cent higher than in October 1990.
The good news, however, is purely relative because overall unemployment in
Glasgow is high at 15.5 per cent, with male unemployment at 21.6 per cent
and the rate of joblessness in some areas running at 30 per cent or more.
Much of Glasgow is still doing reasonably well, but the improvement of
recent years has not brought unemployment down to a level most people would
consider acceptable.
The continuing recession is having a depressing effect on morale. Mr Stuart
Gulliver, chief executive of the Glasgow Development Agency, says the task
of medium term development is made more difficult by the stodgy economic
climate. 'You go along to a company to offer assistance with improving the
skills of its workforce and you find employees being made redundant almost
while you are speaking to them.'
But the emphasis on Glasgow's long term recovery and the initiatives being
taken to accomplish it sometimes distract attention from the fact that the
city is a fundamentally vibrant place. Although its population is now less
than 700,000 and slowly dropping, it is the centre of services for an area
of more than 2.5m people, and Scotland's largest consumer market.
Being a centre of service industries may not have the prestige that Glasgow
once enjoyed as a big manufacturing centre, but manufacturing in the city
has been in decline since the second world war. Even 10 years ago some
100,000 people were employed in manufacturing in Glasgow while now the
number is 55,000.
Yet some of the survivors of that industrial holocaust are doing well. There
are now only two shipyards on the Clyde but both have virtually full order
books. Kvaerner Govan, the Norwegian-owned merchant ship building yard, last
year won orders worth Pounds 300m for four chemical tankers and with other
ships under construction has a full order book until 1995.
Across the Clyde, Yarrow, part of GEC, earlier his year won a Pounds 400m
contract to build three frigates for the Ministry of Defence. At Cathcart,
Weir Group, which had to be rescued from impending collapse in 1981, is
virtually unaffected by recession as one of the world's leading pump
manufacturers and is making rising and substantial profits.
However other engineering companies are doing less well: Barr &amp; Stroud, an
offshoot of Pilkington which makes optical equipment for defence, has halved
its workforce to under 1,000 in the past two years. The Rolls-Royce
components plant at Hillington has shed 750 jobs in the past year.
Glasgow is also a centre of food and drink processing, with a large
biscuit-making plant of United Biscuits and several whisky operations,
including important parts of United Distillers and the headquarters of Whyte
&amp; Mackay, as well as textile makers including Coats Viyella.
Both the GDA and the district council are anxious to attract new
manufacturers to Glasgow. However, they accept that manufacturing companies
are primarily attracted to the nearby new towns of East Kilbride and
Cumbernauld rather than Glasgow.
Nevertheless, a joint effort is being made by the GDA and the district
council to create factories on appealing sites with private sector help and
lure medium-sized manufacturing operations to the city.
The prime objective, however, is on expanding the service industries of the
city. Glasgow firms provide professional services such as legal work,
accountancy, advertising and public relations.
Glasgow is a second tier financial centre. Its branch of the International
Stock Exchange has the only remaining trading floor in Britain and Glasgow
is the headquarters of Allied Provincial, a chain of provincial stockbrokers
which operate all over Britain. The fund management company Murray Johnstone
has more than Pounds 3.4bn under management. The Clydesdale Bank which has
its headquarters in the city has been reviving steadily since 1987 when
Midland Bank sold it to National Australia Bank. However it recently shed
700 jobs at its head office, bringing staff numbers there down to 2,400, as
part of an efficiency programme to take full advantage of automation.
Last year, Glasgow became home to one of the FT 100 companies when Scottish
Power, formerly the South of Scotland Electricity Board, was privatised. It
too has been shedding staff as efficiencies are made.
Another significant development on the corporate front was the recent buyout
by its management of George Outram, publishers of The Herald, the west of
Scotland's leading daily newspaper, and the Glasgow Evening Times. Outram
was sold for Pounds 74m by Lonrho and is now called Caledonian Newspaper
Publishing.
Glasgow is the centre of the Scottish media industry and the home of
Scottish Television, a quoted company, which pulled off a coup by
successfully bidding only Pounds 2,000 to retain its franchise.
For several years the Scottish Development Agency and its successor, the
GDA, have worked with the private sector to improve office accommodation in
the centre of the city and attract companies needing a Scottish
headquarters, or even fully fledged head offices. Some 18 organisations
established offices in Glasgow between 1986 and 1991, promising a total of
7,300 jobs.
These included BP Exploration's headquarters for northern Europe (600 jobs
moving from southeast England), a British Airways tele-sales office
(creating 350 posts) and two offices of the Department of Social Security
(creating a total of 900 jobs).
However, 2,000 of the 7,300 promised jobs were in the Census Office for the
processing of the 1991 census of Britain; the luring of this office to
Glasgow was a considerable coup for the city, but the jobs are naturally
temporary, and numbers employed are now falling.
Worse, BP Exploration said this month that it was moving its Glasgow
operation to Aberdeen over the next year or so, at a cost to Glasgow of 350
jobs. The process of attracting incoming companies to Glasgow is now
virtually stalled by the recession and many of the jobs that have been
created are for women, so the policy has little direct effect on the high
male unemployment.
Glasgow has shown its customary energy in promoting itself as a tourist
destination based largely on the attractions of its cultural resources and
events. In 1990, 3m visitors came to Glasgow, the year it was European City
of Culture, a venture which created a positive net economic return to the
regional economy of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 14m.
Progress is thus being made but the high level of male unemployment is
shorthand for misery and frustration on the periphery of the city which the
enriching of the centre can only partially cure.
Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University has a sober conclusion on
Glasgow's economic progress in the past few years. 'There has not been a
recovery in Glasgow's position, but the city has created a positive image
that is a base for recovery,' he says. 'What you can say is that we're in
better shape than we were before to move forward if the economy improves.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (1): Alive and kicking - After stemming the decline
of the 1960s and 1970s, Glasgow is fighting to avoid the worst of the
present recession. At the same time, it is trying to create and consolidate
a new basis for its future prosperity
</HEADLINE>

GLASGOW last winter formally sent into retirement its famous slogan
Glasgow's Miles Better, which, enlivened with the cheery face of Mr Happy,
had for a decade been pasted to the side of buses in both Glasgow and
London, and, translated into foreign languages, taped proudly to the luggage
of Glaswegians travelling abroad.
The decision to drop the slogan was a symbolic moment of transition. It
showed that Glasgow thinks the world has now accepted that it has pulled
itself out of the decline to which it seemed to be condemned in the 1960s
and 1970s, and that it is time for the next stage in the city's recovery.
Yet there seems to be a widespread realisation in the city that the next
stage is not likely to be particularly easy, nor are its outlines very
clear. The greater sobriety of the new slogan, Glasgow's Alive, (said to be
more convenient than its predecessor for putting on to almost any document
originating in Glasgow) has a durability that may be required during the
long haul ahead.
The revival of Glasgow has so far been one of the success stories of urban
regeneration in Britain. In the 1970s the economic base of this once great
shipbuilding and manufacturing city was declining at an alarming rate; its
population fell by 33 per cent between 1961 and 1981, not just through
organised dispersal to new towns but by emigration motivated by despair. The
city had an intimidating reputation for grime and crime.
A turning point came in 1975 when the new Strathclyde regional council
persuaded the government to abandon the creation of another Scottish new
town and divert the money to the regeneration of the decayed east end of the
city. Gradually a coalition of forces - the Scottish Development Agency, the
Labour controlled regional and district councils and the private sector -
developed a strategy for recovery, which involved pouring in very large
quantities of public money. Much of this came from a Pounds 350m EC
integrated development grant negotiated by Strathclyde regional council.
Glasgow was perforce to become a largely post-industrial city, concentrating
on developing its service activities. The initial aim was to improve the
centre of the city, not least by property development, new retail complexes
and extensive stone-cleaning, making the centre one of the main generators
of wealth.
Glasgow would also exploit its already strong cultural assets to become a
tourist destination and develop its distinguished university base to become
an exporter of graduates and knowledge.
What made the policy work was the existence of a form of collective
leadership that was lacking in Liverpool, a city with comparable problems,
which took such a different path to Glasgow in the 1980s. Glasgow's Labour
politicians became almost Conservative in their fiscal rectitude and grasp
of commercial reality; the city's business leaders are committed people who
for the most part live in the city rather than escaping to the countryside
in the evening.
The landmarks of revival are the Glasgow's Miles Better slogan which struck
a happy note with Glaswegians when it was launched in 1983 ('people just
flooded into the City Chambers to pick up the stickers,' says Mrs Jean
McFadden, leader of the district council); the Glasgow Garden Festival of
1988; and the city's year as European City of Culture in 1990, which
culminated in the opening of the Pounds 28.5m Royal Concert hall.
Yet despite all the achievements, unemployment in Glasgow never dropped
below 14 per cent in the recent upturn and has lately risen to 15.5 per
cent, with no less than 21.6 per cent of the male workforce out of work.
Manufacturing is still declining despite the fact that Glasgow has some good
engineering and shipbuilding companies: it now occupies only 16 per cent of
the work force.
The population is still falling, although the drop from 765,000 in 1981 to
654,000 in the 1991 census may have been exaggerated by as much as 35,000 by
poll tax non-payers not registering in the census.
Above all, while the centre and the west end of Glasgow are now rather
smart, and surrounding areas like the east end, Govan and even the Gorbals
are improving, there are still great areas of wretched accommodation,
poverty and misery in the peripheral areas of Easterhouse, Drumchapel,
Castlemilk and Pollok.
Last year, the Scottish Development Agency was wound up and replaced with a
network of local enterprise companies under the umbrella of the new Scottish
Enterprise. Glasgow gained the Glasgow Development Agency, which has a
budget this year of Pounds 67m to spend on training, property and
environmental improvement and assistance to business.
Mr Stuart Gulliver, its thoughtful, chain-smoking chief executive, exudes
what the agency calls the 'new mature realism' about Glasgow. 'Any
turnaround of a city like Glasgow takes about 25 years, a full generation.
So far we've done 10 years and transformed the urban landscape, laying a
patina of improvement across the city. There's far more to be done.'
He is frustrated that the recession, which came late to Glasgow, is putting
a brake on development and forcing businesses to concentrate on survival
rather than long-term improvement. He admits that the agency's prime target
group among the city's 50,000 unemployed has to be the top 30 per cent -
'the walking wounded who have their work ethic intact'.
He fears that the bottom 30 per cent - 'second or third generation
unemployed, living in a world of drugs and crime' - are beyond reach of an
organisation like the GDA.
About these people Mr Robin Boyle, formerly at Strathclyde university's
centre of planning, wrote recently: 'Glasgow's poor are simply no longer
part of the city. In economic, political or social terms, their alienation
from urban life is almost complete.
'Years of isolation bred hopelessness; the reponse of the very poorest has
been to withdraw into a personal world of survival, far removed from city
centre renewal, waterfront housing and new shopping centres.'
Mrs McFadden, who recently replaced the powerful Mr Pat Lally as Labour
leader on the council, voices a similar anxiety. 'I've always said Glasgow's
Miles Better only referred to the centre of the city. It was a sick joke for
people living in damp houses in Easterhouse.'
Like many leading people in the city she expresses a longing for a revival
of manufacturing in Glasgow. The great expansion of jobs in services, she
says, is 'very worrying because these jobs do not pay as well as those in
manufacturing, tend to involve women rather than men and, especially in
tourism, are vulnerable to recession'.
Where does Glasgow go now? The city council and the GDA have formed a strong
partnership which will continue the strategy of developing service
industries such as tourism, and attracting more companies to set up branch
or head offices in the city, and, it is hoped, factories.
Mr Gulliver says a long term policy of upgrading skills and performance
throughout the businesses of the city is essential.
Michael Kelly, who as Lord Provost launched the Glasgow's Miles Better
campaign and now runs a public relations agency while also advising other
British cities on how to stage recovery, believes a big new initiative is
needed to succeed the garden festival and the city of culture ventures.
'I've suggested we celebrate the ending of World War two, possibly in
conjunction with other European cities'.
He rejects the idea that this approach to reviving a city is purely cosmetic
and does not produce lasting effects. 'Why do women use cosmetics? Because
they are effective.'
But the calm Mrs McFadden says Glasgow no longer needs spectacular new
events to follow up the garden festival and the city of culture year. 'We
don't need a big event every so often any more. A lot of the groundwork of
recovery has been done. What Glasgow needs now is constant marketing to
proclaim our advantages and attract both visitors and companies.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (21): Two litres is quite enough - Unless
status means more than a combination of performance and reasonable economy,
there is every incentive to go for a modern, high-efficiency 2-litre engine.
Stuart Marshall assesses the latest range of vehicles and finds an
embarrassment of choice / How They Go

WHEN the price-only instead of price-plus-cubic capacity tax banding comes
in later this year, business motorists will no longer have to choose between
an under 2-litre car and a hefty financial penalty.
Even so, there will still be every incentive to settle for an under 2-litre
unless the car is a diesel. These need a larger engine to give performance
on a par with that of a petrol-powered car.
The fact of the matter is that unless status means more than a combination
of performance and reasonable economy, a modern, high-efficiency 2-litre
engine is quite big enough.
In the under-Pounds 19,250 category, there are some excellent four-and
five-seat, 2-litre business class cars about.
They have the acceleration and the unusable maximum speed of 3-litre cars of
a few years ago. When motorway cruising they are so refined it is hard to
hear any engine noise over the swish of tyres and rustle of air.
Cars of this class are so good that choosing between makes and models has
more to do with looks, equipment levels, service back-up, warranty terms and
key-in-hand price than actual performance.
Two factors have been concentrating the car makers' and importers' minds.
These were the 2-litre tax break - soon to be swept away - and the effects
of the recession on sales. The makers' and importers' answer was to say
never mind the engine size, get a load of the goodies  - and the price.
There is an embarrassment of choice. Alfa-Romeo's new front-wheel driven 155
has just come to Britain with 1.8-litre and 2-litre engines as well as a
2.5-litre V6 after making an encouraging start in Italy. It is an agreeably
sporty car of individual appearance.
Citroen's XM, with it semi-active, self-levelling gas-hydraulic suspension,
rides like no other car. While not in the least quirky, it could never be
mistaken for anything else. The new XM Premiere 2.Oi has ABS brakes, alloy
wheels, ultrasonic alarm and a stereo system with steering wheel controls
yet it costs only Pounds 16,995.
Another Pounds 2,250 buys the 2.Oi Prestige (Pounds 19,245) which also has
automatic transmission, climate control and leather upholstery.
A similarly equipped, leather-trimmed, automatic version of the Fiat Croma
2.Oie SX - the only model now sold in Britain - is priced at less than
Pounds 18,250.
Its two-pedal Lancia counterpart, powered by the same silken 16-valve engine
with counter-rotating balance shafts, is Pounds 18,575.
These cars have essentially the same chassis platform and are of similar
body size to the Saab 9000 CS and CD saloons which are among the best buys
in class at less than Pounds 19,250. These solidly built, spacious cars have
light-pressure turbocharging which, exploited discreetly, gives them the
flexibility and pick-up of a 3-litre six with the fuel economy of a 2-litre
four.
The Audi 80, recently re-launched with a boot as generous in size as the old
model's was meagre, and the Audi 100 are available in seven versions under
the Pounds 19,250 tax break although, sadly, none of the Quattros with
four-wheel drive squeezes under the barrier. Like the Saabs, they combine
Audi Pro-Con Ten steering column-shortening and seat belt-tightening crash
protection system is unique - with the kind of handling and roadholding to
please the keenest driver.
BMW's super-smooth six-cylinder 2-litre engine can be had in both 3-Series
and 5-Series four-door saloons for less than Pounds 19,250. There is a joie
de vivre about these cars that few other makes can duplicate.
The comfort of the Ford Granada 2.0 LX's ride always impresses. This large
hatchback or saloon is offered with automatic transmission for less than
Pounds 19,250. Until the new Swindon-built 2-litre Honda, currently
code-named Synchro, appears, the only Honda saloon in the under-Pounds
19,250 executive class is the Japan-sourced Accord.
Japanese named cars will have to be taken with increasing seriousness by
user-chooser and fleet manager alike. At the moment, the only British-built,
and thus generally fleet-acceptable, Nissan is the Primera. For mechanical
refinement and build quality it has few if any class rivals and it is an
extraordinarily well-balanced and pleasant car to drive.
Toyota's answer to the Primera is the new Carina E, launched in Britain with
1.6-litre and 2-litre engines in May. For the time being, the cars are being
imported from Japan but in December production starts at Burnaston,
Derbyshire. The Carina E will then be another genuinely British car even
though it has a Japanese name.
Primera and Carina E both look and go remarkably like their Vauxhall
Cavalier (Opel Vectra) equivalents, which still set a European standard
among medium-sized, medium-priced, front wheel-driven cars. The latest
Vauxhall Cavalier Diplomat, leather-trimmed, with heated seats and standard
air conditioning, is a mini-Senator available for less than Pounds 19,250
with manual transmission.
Renault's admirable 25 replacement, the Safrane, is expected to sell in
Britain for a similar figure with a 2-litre engine and automatic
transmission when it arrives in early autumn.
Safrane majors on ride quality and silence.
The Mercedes-Benz 190E with 1.8-litre or 2-litre engines, now nearly 10
years old and due soon for replacement, is unmatched in its price class for
status and sheer merit.
Its bank-vault build quality and conservative styling pay off in high
retained values. The pleasure of driving one is to be equated with the
feeling one gets when upgraded to first from business class.
The Peugeot 605 SLi 2.0, steel sprung but otherwise similar mechanically to
a Citroen XM, is a roomy, quiet and undemanding drive. Rover's 820, restyled
and improved within the past year, has build quality to match that of any
European rival and is a driver's car which passengers enjoy equally.
Volvo's five-cylinder, front wheel-driven 850GLT is an outstanding newcomer.
It may look rather like a mid-1980s rear drive Volvo, but everything about
it is original - except, that is, the styling. Performance is lively, the
ride is good, the handling supremely safe and, should the worst happen, its
crash survivability is probably unmatched.
A feature of the past year has been the appearance on the market of some new
estate cars that are viable and attractive alternatives to the company
saloon for business use. Among them - all available for under Pounds 19,250
 -are the Audi 100, BMW 5-Series Touring, Citroen XM and Ford Granada.
The old days when estate cars were noisier than saloons have long gone. In
none of these would one know there was a massive load space instead of a
boot unless one turned around in the driving seat.
Some business drivers reckon that if the company is going to give them the
choice of any car costing less than Pounds 19,250 it might as well be
exactly what they want and choose a recreational four-wheel drive.
The three contenders are the Land Rover Discovery (from Pounds 18,021 for a
2.5-litre diesel) and the Japanese-made Mitsubishi Shogun (from Pounds
18,809) and Isuzu New Trooper (Pounds 15,149 upwards). Although designed and
built to cope with off-road driving, most spend the majority - and many the
whole - of their lives on tarmac.
They cannot match an executive car of similar price for fuel consumption or
ride comfort and there is a certain lack of finesse about their handling.
Having said that, there is something rather attractive about their high
driving position which gives a commanding view of the road.
Any of them will cruise reasonably quietly at the sort of speeds which
business drivers use. And, of course, at weekends they will tow two-horse
(or one boat) trailers better than any other kind of car. Should the need
arise to tackle mud, snow or flooded roads, they are in a class of their
own.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (18): Cars reflect austerity and recession -
User Profiles / The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF extravagance and ostentation were the catchwords of the booming 1980s,
the 1990s have been heralded in by recession and austerity which is
reflected in the cars many executives now drive.
With companies shoring up their balance sheets by cutting back on many
perks, the days when almost every US executive had a company car already
seem like a distant age. Indeed, many US executives are loathe to admit that
they even drive luxury cars, even when they have purchased their cars
themselves.
According to a partner at a global investment bank who did not wish to be
named, 'Executives are as interested in being comfortable as ever, but they
want to be less obtrusive about it. This is an age of subtlety; there are
fewer turbo-charged cars and fewer Bentleys.'
His sentiments were echoed by Mr Mark Spiegel, a principal at Major
Development, a commercial real estate brokerage company. 'In the 1990s,
ostentation is allegedly out and people are buying cars like the Lexus
because they don't want to be seen driving a Mercedes.'
The bank executive, a self-described car buff, owns several collectors' cars
and high performance cars but drives a 1991 Lexus LS400 as his basic
transportation car.
'When I bought it, I comparison shopped between BMWs, Mercedes, Lexus and
Infiniti. The Lexus was far and away, in my judgment, the best combination
of aesthetics, performance and value for the money.'
In spite of the recent resurgence of more nationalistic sentiments in the US
and a concerted push by unions and the auto industry to get more Americans
to buy American products, most executives tend to pay more attention to the
car itself than to the maker's nationality when spending money on a luxury
car.
American cars have improved immensely in the past few years and cars such as
the Taurus have become competitive on the world scene. 'But the quality of
Japanese cars is up even more,' according to Mr Spiegel.
The value associated with the relatively new Japanese cars has made them
increasingly appealing to US executives looking for a new luxury car. 'The
Lexus and Infiniti offer 90 per cent of what Mercedes offers for about 60
per cent of the money,' says Mr Spiegel.
The after-purchase maintenance programme is another attractive feature of
the Lexus. 'I have almost 30,000 miles on my Lexus and it has cost me
nothing in terms of maintenance,' the bank executive said. 'And when it has
a scheduled maintenance, they pick it up, service it, wash it and return it
to my garage. And in the interim they leave me a loan car while mine is
being serviced.'
'It's been free, it's been 100 per cent reliable and 100 per cent
convenient; and it was probably 50 per cent cheaper than the comparable
Mercedes. It's extraordinarily good and has no down-side as a basic form of
transportation.'
Mr Spiegel, who drives a Porsche 911 and a Taurus SHO, the high performance
version of the Ford Taurus, was less willing to give up performance for
comfort.
'I look at performance, totally,' he said. 'Acceleration, steering feel,
handling and braking ability are all important. But I'd say 90 per cent of
the people who get in my Porsche would choose a more comfortable car for the
money.'
The average 55mph speed limit in the US makes high speeds less of a factor
when choosing a performance car than it would be in many European countries.
'Top speed is pretty impractical, at least in the US,' says Mr Spiegel. 'You
can get short bursts on some stretches of open highway, but that's about
all, otherwise you can say goodbye to your licence.'
According to Mr Spiegel, who races his Porsche, one the car's main
advantages is that it is one of the very few cars in the world you can drive
to work every day but can also drive on the race track. 'The brakes don't
fade and the steering is phenomenal on the track.'
One of Mr Spiegel's main concerns is that his car should not look too
expensive.
'Anti-theft systems have become so good in cars that the only way for
someone to steal some of these cars is at gunpoint.
'There is nothing about the Porsche I'd avoid, but if I could change
anything I would try to make it less conspicuous so I could park it in the
street instead of a garage.'
On his 1989 Taurus, Mr Spiegel would make the brakes larger. 'But when you
look at the money, it's a phenomenal car in terms of what it does.'
Later models of the car are even more attractive, with better transmissions,
anti-lock brakes and air-bags.
Indeed, executives looking at buying new luxury cars now demand a number of
high-tech features which were unheard of only a few years ago including
air-bags, anti-lock braking, emission control with acceptable fuel economy
and up-to-date tyre technology.
The Lexus driver also appreciates the less essential features - namely a
16-speaker stereo, leather seats and the telephone - which come with the
car. 'It has all the toys built in,' he said.
Mileage still seems to be one of the less important concerns when choosing a
car in the US, in part because drivers are still comparing the
miles-per-gallon in modern cars to the leviathans of only a few years ago
which averaged about 10mpg.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (20): Mobile office still awaited - In-car
communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFECTIVE management is all about marshalling facts quickly, easily and
accurately and about using them to make strong and reasoned decisions.
Over the past few years, most large organisations have constructed
computer-based information systems which ensure that managers get these
facts delivered to their desks. But what happens when they are away from the
office?
The answer for the most part today is that they do not receive the same
level of support. And for managers who spend a lot of time out and about
this can be a severe handicap.
Comet, the electrical retailing group, is one of the first companies to
address the issue.
It recently signed a deal with computer maker Zenith for high-performance
386 notebook personal computers each equipped with an internal modem. The
object of the exercise is to equip the company's field managers with the
means to find out key performance information about the branches for which
they are responsible from wherever they may be.
'We never had any problems with the management information available to us
in the office, but that information was not getting to managers in the
field,' explains Mr Tim Walker, manager of Comet's information centre.
'The laptops give our managers direct access to our mainframe computer. They
can check stocking levels, sales performance, budget targets, credit
turnover, etc. They can then use the information to either tell a store they
are visiting that day to buck up and do better or to congratulate them on
their success.'
The first phase of the project still uses ordinary fixed telephones as the
communications medium.
'Our managers can usually find a handy telephone socket,' says Mr Walker.
'We wanted to get something in as quickly as possible and we decided that
the ordinary telephone network was more stable.'
The cost premium of mobile telephones was also considered too much. 'What we
have now does 90 per cent of what we are looking for, and at quite a
reasonable cost. If we wanted to add mobile communications it would have
multiplied the costs,' says Mr Walker.
Despite the undoubted success of the cellular telephone, one area of mobile
communications which has consistently been a disappointment has been that of
data transmission. The mobile office, where the car is equipped not only
with a mobile telephone but also a fax machine and a networked personal
computer, despite many promises, has never materialised.
Not long after the launch of cellular telephones in the UK, representatives
from both network operators, Cellnet and Vodafone, were predicting that data
would soon account for a significant part of their traffic.
It was suggested that as many as 5 per cent of cellular users would use
their mobile telephones to send and receive data. In the US, too,
expectations of cellular as a medium for data communications were high.
But in both countries the actual results have been disappointing. In the US,
fewer than 100,000 of the country's 8m mobile telephone users transmit data
via their cellular lines.
In Britain, the number of cellular telephone owners using the mobile
telephone systems for data is even lower.
'The problem with today's data communications via cellular networks is the
time it takes to set up a link,' explains Mr David Proctor, British
Telecom's general manager responsible for cellular radio.
Cellular radio networks are organised for voice communications, where a
conversation can last minutes or even tens of minutes. In many common data
communications applications, all the communicating is done in seconds,
sometimes just fractions of a second, says Mr Proctor.
'It can take 15 seconds to set up a link and just a few thousandths of a
second to transmit and receive the information: that just doesn't make
sense,' he says.
Few doubt, however, that there is a demand for mobile data solutions. For
field service people, it could provide a valuable link into the office's
extensive technical resources, improving productivity. For sales, it could
provide a significant boost to competitiveness. And for many managers and
professionals, it could allow them to work where before they would have been
forced to be idle.
In recognition of this as-yet largely unsatisfied demand, and conventional
cellular's shortcomings, a number of dedicated radio networks are being
planned or built which will be capable of supporting data communications. In
Britain, Dowty and Hutchison have launched mobile data services and Ram is
planning to do so.
Dowty's Cognito service was launched last August and now claims some 1,000
users. Ram also has a similar number of users including British Airways on a
trial basis but is not expecting to launch its system officially until the
end of this year. Hutchison officially launched its system last month.
Even cellular looks like it may be given a new lease of life as a wireless
data communications medium.
In May, computer giant IBM joined nine of the leading US cellular network
operators to develop a data communications service which exploits the idle
moments of airtime between voice conversations.
The group believes data rates of up to 19,200 bits of information a second
can be achieved; on a par with the best fixed network dial-up modems.
The new pan-European mobile telephone system, GSM, also promises to improve
significantly mobile data facilities via cellular because of its shorter
call set-up times, high data transmission rates and digital format.
Terminals especially designed to take advantage of mobile data
communications are now becoming available. Last year, US computer
manufacturers IBM and NCR and Japanese electronics giant Canon all
introduced laptop computers with built-in radio data communications
facilities, for example.
With so many of the previous promises of the mobile office coming to
nothing, however, it is understandable if users have become more sceptical
about any new claims made by the industry. It may even be in the industry's
interest to allow users to sort out their applications first, then start
looking for technologies which will allow them to best implement those
applications.
'Mobile data has always been treated as a product sale when it should be
seen as an applications-driven sale,' says Mr Proctor. 'There are lots of
opportunities (for industry) but I think we've got to start with the
application and work backwards.'
Mr Walker agrees. 'Right now we want to concentrate on things like the
breadth of information available and the variety of people using it. Then we
may start to look at making the system fully mobile. But that won't be for
some time yet,' he says.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (19): Luxury sector has gained importance
rapidly - User Profiles / Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATION that leads the world in providing innovative, high-quality cars
for the common man is beginning to nurture the sort of executive luxury car
market at home that for decades has been the mainstay of companies such as
Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz in Europe, and Cadillac in north America.
Rather than big business, it is the the movers and shakers of small and
mid-sized companies situated in the nation's leading metropolitan areas who
increasingly are expressing themselves through luxury cars, industry
executives say.
'This market is beginning to take off,' says Mr Hiroo Watanabe, managing
director of Honda's Wako research and development centre, but he admits that
Japanese luxury cars still have to develop a distinct identity.
So far, relatively small luxury models have witnessed the strongest sales
growth, with the typical executive buyer owning his own business and
interested in a self-driven car for work and play, Mr Watanabe says.
Such customers are enticed into the luxury market by the significant tax
advantages of owning a car through a company, he adds. A tax change
implemented two years ago under heavy pressure from foreign car makers
dramatically lowered levies on so-called three-number vehicles (those with
2,000cc and larger engines) and is also propelling sales.
Sales of cars with 2,000cc and larger engines increased each month in 1991
for a total annual gain of 42 per cent to 724,406 vehicles, marking the
sector's sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That contrasted with
overall declines of 4.6 per cent in total domestic passenger car sales and
1.8 per cent in production.
Indeed, the luxury sector has gained importance rapidly over the past few
years and in 1991 accounted for 9.8 per cent of the domestic passenger car
market, compared with 2.3 per cent three years earlier, according to the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA).
Toyota was the 1991 luxury market leader with a 44.8 per cent share, while
Nissan came in a distant second at 21.6 per cent.
Honda's line-up of relatively small luxury cars put in a strong showing with
a 230 per cent sales gain to 52,166 units, or 7.2 per cent of the luxury
market.
The combination of pizzazz and practicality displayed by many of these cars
contrasts sharply with the top end of the executive car market, where little
has changed in decades, and style still takes a back seat to status.
Despite US President George Bush's hard-sell for American car makers earlier
this year and the high-profile delivery of a General Motors Cadillac (with
the steering wheel on the wrong side) to Chief Cabinet Secretary Mr Koichi
Kato this month, the boxy Toyota Century and Nissan President still
overwhelmingly line the traffic corridors of power, where chauffeurs work
away with feather dusters on their already gleaming black exteriors.
'Most executives don't have a say in the car. 'This is the company car and
you get to ride in the back of it,'' is how Baring Securities (Japan) auto
analyst, Mr Neal Doying, describes the Japanese attitude toward company
fleets.
'If you look at what are considered corporate cars in Japan, the old Toyota
Century and Nissan President, you would not consider them attractive,' he
adds. 'But if you ride around in the back of one that means you have
arrived. In the US it (the company car) is more of personal statement.'
Imported luxury cars have been among the most favoured forms of auto
expression in recent years, with Mercedes-Benz and BMW leading the way and
foreign makers together accounting for the third largest share of the luxury
market.
However, deflation of Japan's so-called bubble economy sparked a 2 per cent
decline in 1991 import sales and a more worrisome plunge in luxury market
share to 14.7 per cent from 21.3 per cent the previous year, when there were
roughly 1m imported passenger cars plying Japanese roads.
The Japan Automobile Importers Association is still counting on the
popularity of these high value added vehicles eventually to help it win away
10 per cent of the Japanese car market, compared with 4.9 per cent last year
but it expects sales to pick up only modestly in 1992.
The sole bright spot in the import market involved America's 5.3 per cent
increase in exports to Japan to 30,128 units - roughly what Japan exported
to the US every 5.2 days.
While individual car companies are understandably reluctant to detail their
luxury car customers, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association released a
study last year outlining trends consistent with industry executives'
comments about the luxury car market as a whole.
The study shows the average age and income of imported car buyers has been
declining as such vehicles become more affordable. The largest group
comprised buyers 25-39 years old, while 57 per cent were salaried workers in
the 1988-1990 period studied.
Meanwhile, the ratio of independent enterprise owners and freelances fell
sharply to less than one quarter since the previous study of buyers in the
1983-87 period, the association said.
Another notable feature of the import market was an increase in average car
size to the 2,000cc class. Cost-performance considerations also increased,
while buyers cited external appearance, and safety as leading priorities in
selecting a vehicle.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (16): Environmental issues may apply the
brakes - The Supercars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deliveries are to start within the next few days of by far the fastest and
most expensive roadgoing Jaguar cars ever built.
Buyers from around the world are each paying Pounds 350,000 - enough to
acquire 12 'ordinary' Jaguar saloons - for a limited production run of 350
examples of the XJ220, a mid-engined two-seater sports car capable of
212mph.
But environmental considerations mean that the big, 542 brake horsepower
'supercars' are likely to be the last of their type - at least from Jaguar,
according to JaguarSport, a 50-50 joint venture company set up in 1988
between Jaguar and Mr Tom Walkinshaw's racing organisation, which has
developed and is making the cars.
The XJ220 is one of several 200mph-plus supercars, each costing up to Pounds
530,000, currently making their debuts.
Most were conceived towards the end of the economic boom of the late 1980s.
But their appearance coincides with widespread recession and almost exactly
with the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, with its concerns about the adverse
impact on the environment of the motor vehicle.
'We all recognise that a long-term shift is taking place in what will appeal
to buyers. No-one can afford to ignore the environmental issues',
acknowledges Mr Bill Donnelly, sales and marketing director of JaguarSport.
For that reason, he suggests, the XJ220 will probably turn out to be the
ultimate roadgoing Jaguar.
'We'll take a different slant in the future; something smaller and lighter,
with the emphasis very much on weight-saving'.
A further irony is that the new wave of supercars is rolling towards the
market at a time when it is becoming increasingly likely that the last
country in which their performance could be used to the full, Germany, will
have its autobahns speed-restricted not by its own, but common EC
legislation.
At Monte Carlo, McLaren Cars - a subsidiary of the grand prix racing group -
has just given the motoring press its first glimpse of the F1, McLaren's own
roadgoing, Pounds 530,000 'supercar'.
Based on grand prix technology, it will go on sale next year.
Yamaha of Japan last month unveiled the OX99-11, a street-legal machine
which uses a de-tuned version of its Formula One grand prix engine and which
has room for only the driver.
Reflecting the unique status of the UK as the world centre for motor
sport-based technology, the 'Ox' will be produced not in Japan but Yamaha
Motor's UK subsidiary, Ypsilon Technology, at Milton Keynes.
It is is also expected to cost more than Pounds 500,000.
The Bugatti name has been resurrected for a 200mph-plus supercar due to
enter production later this year in Italy, rather than Bugatti's native
France.
These cars eclipse in price and performance even vehicles such as Ferrari's
F40, the Lamborghini Diablo and Porsche 959.
The question is, who will buy them? The answer from all their makers is that
they are being snapped up by discreet, exceptionally wealthy entrepreneurial
types scattered in small numbers around the world.
And unfortunate though the timing of the XJ220's launch is in many ways, Mr
Donnelly insists that all 350 cars are pre-sold.
According to JaguarSport, 1,500 would-be owners have applied to buy the
cars, backing their orders with the requisite Pounds 50,000, non-returnable
deposit.
However, the market for used Ferrari and other classic sports car markets
has suffered the most spectacular collapse in its history over the past two
years. And there is increasing speculation within the investment car market
about whether JaguarSport's confidence and that of other supercar makers may
prove misplaced.
The order terms for the XJ220 allow holders to sell their options to another
party.
Originally, this was seen as offering the potential for a premium. But the
recession has meant that some would-be owners have needed to make a distress
sale in an attempt to recoup the Pounds 50,000 - and to avoid payment of a
second Pounds 50,000 tranche due under each contract six months before a car
is delivered.
Worse, according to stories doing the rounds of the international
'investment car' market, some would-be sellers have had difficulty disposing
of their options.
Fearing that they might have to fulfil their contractual obligation to buy
the car, at least some are said to have formed so-called shell companies
into which to sell their options - and which it would be pointless for
Jaguar to pursue for payment.
Jaguar and JaguarSport profess themselves to be relatively unperturbed.
The part payment system means that JaguarSport should get warning of
potential problems at least six months before construction of that
particular car is due to start.
'If there are problems, it simply won't get built - at least not until
another firm buyer is found', said a Jaguar spokesman.
With an expected total world market for new cars this year of just under
40m, in percentage terms the XJ220 and its cohorts represent an almost
infinitesimal proportion of the market.
McLaren Cars plans to make only 300 of its extraordinary F1, a three-seater
with the driver's seat in the middle and an array of mind-stretching
technology including fan-assisted suction to stick it more firmly to the
road.
Yamaha's production plans have yet to be disclosed, but total envisaged
production also does not exceed a few hundred.
About 200 units a year are envisaged for the Bugatti EB110, a 200mph-plus
supercar from an Italian-based reincarnation of Bugatti, perhaps France's
most famous pre-war make.
By comparison, Ferrari is a common volume producer: it builds 4,000 cars a
year - and even the most expensive Testarossa sells in the UK for a mere
Pounds 130,000.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (17): People-carriers could even reshape the
markets - Minivans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FEAST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vehicle makers are betting that European buyers will like the
people-carriers that are being planned for the next few years. Between them,
they are laying down an extra 400,000 units a year to serve a market which,
in the mid-1980s, amounted to only 35,000 units.
There will probably be customers for them. But it seems very bold to risk
large sums on a niche which still accounts for less than 1 per cent of the
overall market. Indeed, the phenomenon is so recent that the category does
not yet have a universally accepted name. The Americans call them minivans.
Most Europeans refer to them as people-carriers or multi-purpose vehicles
(MPVs). In France, the Academie francaise pronounced that the correct title
is monospace.
Whatever the vehicles are called, they are distinctive enough. They are the
tall vans with three rows of seats and accommodation for seven. Their
attraction for large families is obvious. But their appeal in the future may
be so wide that it reshapes the company and executive car markets.
Europe's best known example is the Espace, built by Matra and sold by
Renault. It captured almost half of all minivan sales last year. This
amounted to about 46,000 units out of a western European total of 98,000,
according to Ms Carol Thomas, manager of DRI/McGraw Hill's European light
truck service.
More importantly, it is a highly profitable niche for Renault. Europe
remains loose change compared with the performance of last year's minivan
market in the US. More than 877,000 units were sold there, with Chrysler's
contenders taking 45 per cent of the market.
Neither did the popularity of minivans in America go un- noticed by Japanese
companies, which developed strong contenders for the business. It was a
little too strong for Detroit's Big Three, which asked the US Commerce
Department to investigate Japanese pricing policies. The result was the
recent Commerce Department ruling that Toyota and Mazda are dumping minivans
in the US.
The experiences could give Japan's car makers a flying start as Europe's
minivan market starts take off.
Chrysler introduced America to the minivan a decade ago as part of its
crucial restructuring. It is such a success that the company and the
category are almost synonymous.
Now Chrysler is hoping to repeat the trick in Europe. Its Eurostar joint
venture in Graz with Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the diversified Austrian
engineering group, started assembling Voyager minivans last October.
Production is slowly being built up. It will move to an annualised rate of
27,000 units in August, and double that by 1994-95.
'This plant can do 50,000, and 100,000 with ease,' said Mr Lee Iacocca,
Chrysler's chairman, at the plant's formal dedication in April.
It may have to if Chrysler wants to repeat its American market share in
Europe. DRI/Mccraw-Hill's growth predictions for the European segment over
the next five years see it moving from last year's total of just under
100,000 units to about 400,000. That would represent an 11-fold increase in
little more than a decade - growth unmatched by any other significant sector
of the car market.
Minivan sales are unlikely to reach the volumes they have in America, even
though Europe's car market is larger. The reason, according to professor
Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School, is lack of space. 'Often these
products (in America) are the replacement of the fifth car,' he says. 'You
can't even park one car in Fulham. Where do you put two or three?'
Prof Rhys, a motor industry economist, adds: 'In Europe, we have a much
higher population density. That's going to put a top on buying vehicles much
sooner than you'll see in places like New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and
the rest.'
Ms Thomas believes many European minivans will increasingly be bought at the
expense of large cars and estates. She thinks they have distinct image
advantages over more utilitarian estate cars, such as lofty, Range
Rover-style visibility and more futuristic styling.
Unquestionably, the size of the segment will be dictated by the arrival of
all the new models planned for the next few years. Car makers will be in
trouble if they don't find homes for all the vehicles they will then be
capable of making.
The development will also spell the end of the Espace's current market
domination, which leaves the Chrysler Voyager, Toyota Previa, Nissan Prairie
and a few others mopping up the oddments.
As the Austrian Voyager factory gathers speed, Nissan's Motor Iberica unit
in Barcelona will start making a model to be known as the Serena. Production
begins this September, and will eventually reach 50,000 a year. With 80 per
cent local content - including petrol engines from Nissan in Britain - it
will not be subject to all the sales curbs imposed on cars imported from
Japan.
There will then be a slight lull in European activity before two substantial
joint ventures reach fruition in 1994, those between Peugeot and Fiat and
Volkswagen and Ford. The intention in each case is to share design and
development costs, but to market the products in competition.
Peugeot and Fiat are investing FFr5bn to bring their shared vehicle to
market. It will be made at a rate of up to 120,000 a year in a new facility
near Valenciennes, northern France.
The Dollars 2.8bn VW/Ford collaboration is at a new factory being built in
Setabul, Portugal. It will come on stream at the end of 1994, and will have
an eventual annual capacity of 180,000.
All this activity would leave General Motors as the only main European maker
without a competitor in the class.
However, reports from Detroit suggest the corporation will plug the gap in
its model line-up by having its European Opel and Vauxhall dealers sell a
new, US-made minivan from 1995.
So far, none of the lower volume, upmarket companies has announced any
production plans for minivans, though Mercedes-Benz exhibited a concept
vehicle early last year. Volvo is in a good position to join the segment
thanks to its steadily increasing ties with Renault, the category's market
leader. Each company has stressed that all future models will start with
shared chassis and drivelines.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (14): Promising British market emerges - Age
Of The Diesel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTED changes in company car taxation in the UK coupled generally with
significant improvements in technology can open the way for diesel-powered
cars to gain significantly in popularity in the executive car market.
The level of diesel car sales in different European countries is determined
to a significant degree by government policy, particularly in the areas of
fuel taxation, exhaust emissions policy and company car taxation.
In Britain, the government review of the company car taxation system should
mean that the present system, which is based importantly on engine size - in
particular with a break point at 2 litres - will be abandoned in favour of a
system based on value.
Because diesel engines have a larger cubic capacity than equivalent petrol
engines, the existing company car taxation system has discriminated in
particular against diesel-powered executive cars with engines above 2
litres.
The review of company car taxation announced in the last UK budget was in
line with the report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the
car industry published in February.
The commission suggested that the system of banding the tax scale charges by
original market value and engine capacity had caused a clustering of highly
specific cars at particular tax band thresholds, in particular 2-litre cars
at just under the Pounds 19,250 band.
It recommended that banding should be replaced in favour of expressing the
scale charge as a percentage of the car list price or cost. This would
remove discrimination against those buying cheaper cars within the band.
Britain is already emerging as one of the most promising markets for diesel
cars in Europe, although it has a long way to go to catch up the leading
diesel countries such as France and Belgium. Demand for diesel cars has
continued to rise in sharp contrast to the steep fall in overall UK new car
sales, while the share captured by diesel engined cars has doubled in the
past two years.
According to leading car producers, demand has been boosted by the
introduction of a series of new diesel cars which can match the performance
and refinement of equivalent petrol-engined models.
Significant progress has been achieved in both diesel engine and fuel
technology, and these advances have been added to the traditional
attractions of diesel cars, such as greater fuel economy - diesel cars use
about 20 per cent less fuel than petrol-engined cars - higher second-hand
values, and greater durability and reliability.
Diesel cars have also begun to make a significant break-through in the
company car sector. Changes in fuel duty in the UK budget widened the
favourable differential between diesel and leaded petrol prices.
In the two years since 1989, sales of new diesel cars in Britain have risen
by 13.3 per cent from 123,345 in 1989 to 139,810 last year. In the same
period, overall new car sales plunged by 30.8 per cent from a record 2.3m in
1989 to only 1.59m last year.
Peugeot, the French car maker which includes Citroen, has made the biggest
gains. With its combined Peugeot and Citroen marques, the French car maker
accounted for 43.5 per cent of all diesel cars sold in Britain last year. It
also supplies diesel engines to Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, for
its Rover 200-400 series.
The Peugeot brand alone boosted its share of the diesel new car market to
31.2 per cent last year from 25.2 per cent in 1990 and accounted for three
of the five best-selling diesel cars in the UK with its 405, 205 and 309
ranges.
The European market is dominated by France, where diesel cars accounted for
38.2 per cent of new car sales last year. But in Germany the diesel share
was 12.1 per cent, while diesel cars accounted for 12.8 per cent of Spanish
new car sales and for 10.9 per cent of the Dutch new car market. In contrast
to other markets, diesel car sales in Italy have plunged in response to
unfavourable tax changes. The diesel share of the Italian new car market
fell to only 5.4 per cent from a peak of 26.1 per cent seven years ago.
Diesel prices vary greatly in Europe ranging from 27.5p per litre in
Luxembourg - at May 1992 exchange rates - to 51.6p per litre in Italy. In
France, diesel costs about 35.9p per litre, in Germany 36.4p, and in Britain
45.3p. Most importantly, however, the UK still has one of the smallest
differentials between diesel and unleaded petrol prices at 0.9p per litre,
compared with 16.2p in France and 11.8p in Germany.
As diesel technology improves, Toyota, the leading Japanese car maker, is
presently testing a prototype V6 diesel engine with a difference; it is both
a two-stroke and supercharged.
The advent of relatively high-speed production car diesels from
manufacturers such as Peugeot and Volkswagen since the late 1970s has
already helped to change the notion that diesels are necessarily slow, noisy
and smelly in relation to their petrol counterparts.
Toyota's S-2 diesel engine, and similar units under development by rival
manufacturers, takes the process a stage further. The combination of a
relatively low compression ratio - about 16:1 - with supercharging
eliminates the audible 'knock' associated with 'ordinary' diesels. The fact
that there are twice as many firing strokes per engine revolution compared
with an ordinary four-stroke car unit makes the engine at least as smooth as
a petrol unit while at the same time bringing power up close to petrol
levels.
The reason that Toyota is not rushing the engine into commercial production
is largely a function of its inability, as yet, to coax exhaust emissions
down to compliance with the tighter pollutions controls being introduced in
the US and elsewhere from 1994 onwards.
Toyota is confident, however, that the problem will be overcome. The S-2
diesel produces about the same amount of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and
particulates as a conventional diesel, but only about one third the oxides
of nitrogen which are linked with acid rain.
The Peugeot group with its large executive-sector cars such as the Citroen
XM has developed a 2.1-litre unit incorporating the world's first
multi-valve aluminium cylinder head for a diesel, complemented by a
turbocharger.
According to Peugeot, the XM so equipped is nearly 40 per cent more
economical than the 2-litre petrol version. But both top speed and
acceleration figures are virtually identical.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (15): Sir Leon cracks the whip - Prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission have
now both combed through the vexed issue of pan-European car prices. But the
results of their endeavours appear to have done little to dispel the
damaging confusion that still confronts car buyers throughout the Community.
When the MMC report was published in February, the UK motor industry
breathed a sigh of relief. The Commission concluded that British new car
prices were not unacceptably out of line with prices in other comparable EC
markets.
Last month, the European Commission published its own report, however, and
sent a new shock wave though the industry. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
competition commissioner, has adopted an altogether tougher and more
rigorous stance than the MMC. Car makers are still trying to make up their
minds as to how they should react to the trenchant demands from Brussels for
greater price transparency.
They were much less troubled by the MMC report. After 18 months of
deliberation and sifting through a mountain of evidence, the MMC concluded:
'British consumers, particularly private motorists, do pay more for their
cars than they should.'
It also said: 'A complex monopoly does exist in the case of 24 car
suppliers;' and that 'some of the restrictions applied by manufacturers to
their exclusively franchised dealers do reduce competition and act against
the public interest.'
Yet the report concluded that neither car makers nor dealers had engaged in
systematic profiteering and it recommended no significant structural changes
in the way the industry operates. It also appeared to accept in their
entirety the industry's arguments that Britain's franchised dealer system,
with its dedicated service and repair facilities and after-sales support,
was necessary because of the complexity of the products sold and their
safety implications.
Several surveys in recent years by the Consumers Association and the
Federation of European Consumer Associations (BEUC) have claimed that UK
prices are substantially higher than those for comparable cars in some other
EC countries.
The Commission concluded, however, that 'a comparison of the price ranges in
the United Kingdom with those in France and Germany, the two markets studied
most similar to the UK in size and both with substantial indigenous
manufacturing capacity, does not indicate a significant difference in
general price levels.'
This did not apply so closely to prices for smaller cars, however, where the
MMC said that there were a number of model variants in France and Germany
'whose adjusted prices appear on any of our assumptions to be considerably
lower than those in the United Kingdom.'
The MMC said that list price differences between Britain and other EC
markets were, indeed, wide, but these narrowed considerably when they were
adjusted for factors such as different levels of equipment specification,
exchange rate fluctuations and availability of cheap finance.
Sir Leon Brittan, in sharp contrast to the MMC, has warned car makers that
action is needed to reduce price differentials between different European
markets. In a key letter last month to individual car manufacturers, he
warned that the Commission had decided that 'action is needed at once' both
to monitor car prices more closely and to reduce differentials.
The controversial study prepared for the European Commission and published
last month showed that there have been substantial price differences for
some car models throughout the Community of more than 40 per cent in the
most extreme cases.
According to the EC report, five car makers - Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda
and Audi - had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per
cent in one of the five time periods selected for study between January 1988
and January 1991.
The study's findings have come under heavy attack from the motor industry,
but in his letter Sir Leon has made clear that car makers must take steps to
make their European pricing policies more transparent if they wish to retain
the present selective car dealer distribution system in Europe.
Behind all the claims and counter-claims this is the real bone of
contention. In 1985 the motor industry was granted a 10-year so-called block
exemption from EC competition rules, which allowed it to maintain the
present franchised dealer system - selective distribution. This system
restricts sales of new cars exclusively to dealers chosen by the
manufacturers.
Consumer groups, already critical of dealers and their service and repair
performance, have called for the system to be replaced by a market
'free-for-all', with manufacturers being obliged to supply cars to virtually
any outlet which wishes to sell them.
In his letter to car makers last month, Sir Leon accepts that the EC car
price study has not established 'beyond doubt' the linkage between large car
price differences across the Community and the selective distribution
system.
Ominously for the car makers, he pointed out, however, that the study had
made adjustments for the other most significant potential causes of the
price differentials perceived by consumers.
He left little doubt in his letter that the pricing issue would play a vital
role in the decision-making process, at least for the competition officials.
Sir Leon is calling on car makers:
To publish every three months one price list on an EC-wide basis for their
entire product range. Prices should be quoted both in Ecus and in local
currency, and should be set out in a way that 'will enable consumers to make
clear comparisons;'
To make freely available every three months the prices recommended to
authorised dealers for the manufacturer's five top-selling models in each
market along with comparable prices for every other EC market (again in ECUs
and local currency);
To complete every six months an analysis of the prices recommended to
dealers in each EC member state of 'one standard, low-equipment model' in
each market segment. The manufacturers are to ensure in this way that they
are operating within the price bands allowed by the block exemption
regulation.
In addition, Sir Leon has asked the car makers to write to their dealers in
each market to assure them that they will supply cars ordered with
specifications for another market (for example a right hand-drive car with
UK specifications ordered in Belgium) 'within a reasonable time period' and
'at the same basic price' as for normal supplies of the comparable local
model.
The industry is still to respond to these requests, but it has some way to
go if it is to repair the credibility gap with Sir Leon and protect
selective distribution.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (8): Domestic luxury car sales accelerate -
Toyota and Honda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Japanese domestic vehicle registrations went into reverse last year for
the first time since 1984, luxury cars were the only market segment to buck
the trend, with sales up an impressive 42 per cent.
It therefore comes as no surprise that the nation's naturally competitive
car industry executives are stepping on the gas to overtake one another in
this lucrative and fast-growing market.
To do so, vehicle designers and marketing officials must steer towards
luxury car buyers whose profiles are in some respects significantly
different from those in Europe and North America.
'The content of the Japanese market is very different,' says Mr Junzo
Shimizu, deputy general manager of overseas planning for Toyota.
'In the American luxury auto market you're talking mostly about private
cars. In particular, lately there have been a lot of baby boomers and what
are called yuppies or dinkies (double income, no kids). These are often
relatively wealthy people in their mid-40s.
'In contrast, the Japanese luxury car market is a strange one, like no other
in the world. The main group of buyers are individualistic corporate
presidents, or private business owners. There is also no system in which
large company employees are provided with (self-driven) cars.'
Mr Shimizu estimates that owners of small companies comprise 50-60 per cent
of the Japanese luxury car market, individuals 30-40 per cent and large
companies less than 10 per cent. This contrasts sharply both with
corporations' small portion of luxury car sales in the US and their roughly
80 per cent share in Europe, he says.
Meanwhile, the emergence of a well-heeled class of owner-managers has been
the critical fuel for the recent acceleration of domestic luxury car sales,
says Mr Hiroo Watanabe, managing director of Honda's research and
development centre in Wako, where the number three Japanese auto maker
conducts product planning, styling and other design work.
'The corporate market has changed a great deal in the past five or 10 years.
In the past, company cars were chauffeur-driven with priority given to the
rear seat. But lately, with owners driving themselves around, the front seat
is equally emphasised,' he says.
The importance of this market is not missed by foreign competitors. For
example, General Motors of the US has recently run advertisements in local
newspapers showing its Buick Park Avenue and headlined simply: 'Company
image.'
Increasingly affluent salaried employees also have been buying up a
significant share of Honda's range of relatively small luxury cars, Mr
Watanabe adds.
'The average buyers are fairly young. Many are in their thirties and some in
their late twenties. There is also quite a number of salarymen (salaried
workers), which wasn't the case in the past.'
Just how rapidly the market will grow over the next few years is open to
question. Economic difficulties are leaving many target customer groups
feeling far less affluent than in recent years.
'During the bubble economy era, people invested in stocks and land, got a
lot of money and bought expensive cars. But now the reverse reaction is
rather severe and I'd say growth is likely to slow,' says Mr Shimizu.
'We'll be pleased if sales increase, but in the near future I don't think
there will be a large rise.'
He also describes the rapid sales gains for cars with engines of 2,000cc or
over - called three-number vehicles in Japan due to their license plate
designation - as a one-time response to a dramatic tax cut two years ago.
Over the longer term, both officials said they expected the market for
three-number cars to increase steadily. That is not to say the ratio to
total car sales will necessarily match North American standards. For one
thing, the post-war American baby boom involved a decade of high birth
rates, which are now translating into showrooms filled with affluent
middle-aged car buyers, notes Mr Shimizu. In Japan, birth rates jumped for a
far shorter period, he says.
Another impediment to dramatic increases is the high dependence of luxury
car sales on drivers in leading urban areas. They are especially plagued by
clogged roads, expensive parking and market saturation. Nationally, the
mid-range Corolla leads Toyota sales, while in Tokyo the luxury Mark II and
Crown models top the list, Mr Shimizu notes.
Fortunately for car makers, the luxury vehicles that do roll out of domestic
showrooms are money machines, thanks to the willingness of Japan's
gadget-loving drivers to pay up for lucrative options.
'Americans look for value while Japanese customers have more of an attitude
that anything is okay,' says Mr Shimizu.
How far does Japanese drivers' willingness to pay for the latest high-tech
gadgets go? According to Mr Shimizu, one indication is the 20 per cent of
Toyota's top-of-the-line Celsior models, known as the Lexus abroad, that
leave showrooms with satellite sensor navigation systems costing the
equivalent of Dollars 5,000 - an option not even available in the US.
Overseas, luxury cars are also highly profitable for car manufacturers,
which has prompted the three Japanese leaders to set up separate
subsidiaries with distinct brand images in North America: Toyota owns Lexus,
Nissan the Infiniti line and Honda markets its high-end vehicles as Accura.
The Toyota and Honda officials said their companies were not seeking under
export quotas to the EC to replace large shares of lower priced cars with
luxury models or set up independent sales arms as they have in the US.
'Toyota is a volume manufacturer, unlike Mercedes Benz and BMW, so we are
not looking to increase luxury car sales while those for regular cars
decrease,' says Mr Shimizu.
In fact, Toyota sold just 2,100 Lexus cars in the EC last year, compared to
38,000 in the US and 32,900 at home, which helps explain why it is still
operating like an upstart in the luxury market.
'We offer many options in the US. But in Europe we sell so few (luxury) cars
that we equip them with what would be considered close to the full range of
options in America,' the Toyota executive says.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (7): Skirmishes in Europe; pitched battles in
the US - The Japanese Challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT was only days after Peugeot and Rover, the European car makers, decided
to pull out of the US car market last year that Mazda, Japan's
fourth-largest car manufacturer, announced it was creating a separate luxury
car franchise in the US.
Mazda is following in the tracks of Honda, Toyota and Nissan. The contrast
between European retrenchment and Japanese expansion in the US underlines
the startling progress Japanese carmakers have made in the higher reaches of
the American car market since Toyota and Nissan launched their luxury
franchises in autumn 1989.
In some months last year, Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti franchises
both outsold BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the US.
Infiniti and Lexus came first and second in the latest Initial Quality Study
published this month by J. D. Power, one of the most authoritative US
analysts of quality and customer satisfaction in the world car industry.
The Japanese car makers are yet to enter with force into the luxury and
executive car market in Europe, but there are already strong signs that the
Japanese challenge will move to Europe during the 1990s. The European car
makers know the scale of the problems they are facing because the
luxury-executive car battle with the Japanese makers has already been joined
in earnest for at least two years in the US.
As the Japanese car makers develop their local production presence in Europe
 -as they have done in the US in the past decade - they will be able to make
some of their main volume cars in Europe and begin importing more executive
and luxury cars under their import quotas. By the end of this year Nissan,
Toyota and Honda will all be producing cars at their own plants in the UK,
while Mitsubishi will follow by 1994-95 at its joint venture plant in the
Netherlands.
To date, their presence in the European executive-luxury market has amounted
to only preliminary skirmishes. Toyota has shied away as yet from direct
confrontation with BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar in Europe and is only
selling limited volumes of its flagship Lexus LS400 luxury saloon. Nissan is
not yet bringing its current generation Infiniti cars to Europe.
Mazda is already testing the water, however, with the launch of its Xedos 6
sports saloon, a car which it is pitching squarely against BMW. It is clear
that Mazda has ambitions to establish a much broader range of sporty
executive and luxury cars in the European market during the 1990s.
The pitched battle is in the US, however.
BMW's overall sales in the US last year fell by 16.2 per cent to 53,343,
while Mercedes-Benz sales plunged by 24.9 per cent to 58,868. In particular
segments, the damage was far greater - sales of BMW's top-of-the-range
7-Series fell by 47.3 per cent to 5,508. Porsche sales fell by 52.0 per
cent. Jaguar suffered a drop in sales in the US last year of 49.9 per cent,
while Audi sales plunged by 41.8 per cent.
The local American competitors in the US luxury car market fared little
better last year with General Motors' Cadillac sales dropping by 17.4 per
cent, and Ford's Lincoln marque suffering a drop of 22.9 per cent.
While their rivals were losing sales volume, the Japanese were winning
additional market share. Sales volumes of Toyota's Lexus franchise rose by
12.1 per cent to 71,206, outselling its prestigious German rivals, while
Honda's longer-established Acura franchise also increased sales by 3.8 per
cent.
Nissan's Infiniti franchise was the star performer, however. It started much
more slowly than Lexus after the autumn 1989 launch but last year it began
to close the gap, increasing its sales by 45.6 per cent to 34,890.
Lexus and Infiniti have both been helped by the launch of new models, and
Infiniti has now expanded to a four-model range with the G20, the
recently-introduced J30, the M30 and the flagship Q45 luxury saloon. In the
first four months of 1992 alone, Lexus has sold 8,132 units of its
recently-launched SC400-300 coupe.
This year, the US luxury car market has brightened for several of the
players as the US struggles out of recession. Mercedes-Benz has increased
its US sales by 18 per cent in the first five months of 1992 while BMW has
achieved a 23.8 per cent increase and Jaguar a rise of 12.6 per cent.
Cadillac sales are 5.5 per cent higher than a year ago, although Lincoln's
fortunes continue to decline sharply with a drop of 18.4 per cent.
The Japanese luxury car players are not infallible in the US and Acura has
begun to lose ground this year with a drop of 11 per cent.
Lexus and Infiniti are both still gaining on their rivals, however, with
Lexus boosting its sales in the first five months by 72.4 per cent and
Infiniti achieving an increase of 38.9 per cent.
Mazda is planning to enter the US luxury car market with a separate sales
channel, to be called Amati, in spring 1994. Amati's initial product line-up
will be two luxury saloons and the Japanese carmaker aims to sell about
20,000 cars under the new marque in its first year. It is likely that a
sporting coupe will be added later.
Mazda has been studying an entry into the US luxury car market for two years
with its Pegasus task-force and has concluded that the prospects are too
mouth-watering to be ignored. It says the number of affluent households in
the US with an income of at least Dollars 75,000 a year is increasing from
2m in 1988 to 2.5m in 1995.
The Amati cars are to be built at a newly-constructed manufacturing plant in
Hofu, Japan, dedicated to producing luxury vehicles.
The Amati operation is to be a separate division of the Japanese
manufacturer's US subsidiary, Mazda Motor of America, with its headquarters
in Irvine, California. A number of regional offices are also to be set up.
'Mazda intends to become a significant competitor in the luxury car market,'
says Mr Keijo Asano, senior managing director of the parent Mazda Motor
Corporation and chairman of Mazda Motor of America.
While Mazda is enthusiastic about the challenge and the potential rewards
offered by the US luxury car market, some of its weaker European rivals have
decided that the strain of competing as marginal players in the world's most
fiercely contested arena can no longer be supported.
Rover's decision to stop exporting its Rover 800 Sterling range to the US
came after continuing heavy losses and dwindling US sales. Ever since the
company re-entered the US market under the Sterling brand-name in 1987, it
was dogged by quality problems and was increasingly burdened by excessive
stocks of old models.
Rover has maintained its separate Range Rover of North America operation to
market luxury four-wheel drive leisure vehicles.
Like Peugeot, Rover faces a mighty challenge from the Japanese in the UK and
in continental Europe during the 1990s, and it could no longer afford
prestigious but very costly battles in the US.
The withdrawals of Peugeot and Rover from the US mean they will no longer be
exposed to the rigours and disciplines imposed by the US market, however.
According to Mr Carl Hahn, management board chairman of Volkswagen, the
biggest European car maker which has struggled in America in recent years -
with both its VW and Audi brands - 'The US market is important in particular
because its sets the benchmark for competition in the world market, and also
because it shapes social demands on the car, in exhaust emissions for
example.
'We simply cannot afford to give up either the opportunities offered by the
US market or the learning processes and experience it imposes.'
The Japanese challenge in America is still growing and the lessons learned
there can be brought to bear at any time in Europe.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (5): New car plant will be test-bed for 'lean
production' - Mercedes-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE label 'Made in Germany' which has served for so long as the prime
marketing tool of the federal republic's quality car makers, is no longer
enough. Recession everywhere, luxury taxes in the US, and the opposition
using every sales stunt in the book have hit them hard.
Mr Arno Bohn, head of hard-pressed Porsche, goggles as he tells of a US
Rolls-Royce dealer giving away a mid-range Mercedes with every Silver Cloud.
Mr Werner Niefer, Mercedes-Benz chief, mutters darkly about dumping and
'strategic pricing' capers which lead to Toyota's selling its Lexus in the
US for less than Dollars 40,000 and for more than Dollars 55,000 in Germany.
Meanwhile, German makers are getting their act together. Mercedes
acknowledges that Japanese manufacturers on average have a 35 per cent
production cost advantage over their German competitors. About 10 per cent
of that is accounted for by relatively low capital costs in Japan and the
extraordinarily long working hours the competition squeezes out of its
workforce.
While social evolution and globalisation of capital markets work at eroding
these advantages, Mercedes-Benz has set about improving its competitive
condition through its own efforts.
The most obvious signs of emergent determination to cut the fat have
appeared in the past few months in announcements of huge job cuts among all
German motor manufacturers. The half-way mark in Mercedes' plan to slash its
workforce by 20,000 will be reached by the end of this year.
The aim is clear. As Mr Niefer and his colleagues have stated: additional
wage costs, which exceed improvements in productivity, will not be passed on
to customers. They will be paid for indirectly by the German workforce.
While forced redundancies are almost unknown in Germany, job cuts will be
achieved by non-replacement of people moving on and 'social measures'
including early retirement and training for other jobs.
Accordingly, this year's 5.8 per cent pay rise - adding an extra DM600m to
Mercedes' costs - will lead to cuts of between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs by the
turn of the year.
There are already rising expectations in industry and government that the
narrow squeak in this year's engineering pay round - a damaging national
strike was averted at the last minute - and the 23-month duration of the
deal, may mark a turning point and a return to the traditional German
pattern of 'rational' pay settlements.
The implementation of recommendations from leading management consultancies
that the auto, engineering and electronics industries should shed almost
400,000 jobs in the next few years, already widely underway, should
underline the message to the powerful IG Metall union.
Meanwhile, Mercedes is adding capacity. Its new car plant at Rastatt, close
to the border between Baden-Wurttemberg and Alsace, will steadily increase
output to 90,000 cars a year by 1996, raising group capacity from 580,000
today.
The works, only the company's third in the country, appears to be a
demonstration of faith in the old 'Made in Germany' principle.
It might also be considered a remarkable development in the light of
constant claims from Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Mercedes parent,
Daimler-Benz, that domestic production costs are killing off Germany's
attractions as a manufacturing base. But it is much more than a factory: it
is a test bed for the company's future manufacturing strategy.
Especially in its early days, Rastatt will function as a proving site for
new techniques in 'lean production', logistics and manpower management which
will subsequently be introduced into the group's other established works at
nearby Sindelfingen and Bremen in the north.
The lessons will also be passed back to component suppliers, which will in
future work far more closely with the Mercedes research and development
teams. One initial short-term aim is to reduce the number of parts which
have to be handled and fitted at the works. Suppliers will be required to
supply complete pre-assemblies built and tested precisely to Mercedes
standards.
The clearest clues to what is afoot in Rastatt are provided by the absence
of anything resembling a conventional production line and the presence of
teams of 10 to 15 workers clustered around custom-built cradles swinging
body shells to and fro giving them easy access to bolt holes and fixing
points.
This is 'group working' German-style. Not, Mr Niefer stressed, copied from
Japan or Scandinavia, but developed specially to suit domestic conditions.
Teams of eight to 10 are given responsibility for each stage of assembly.
Members elect their own spokesperson, organise their own work as they
choose, manage their own logistics, swap jobs when they like, mend their own
tools and equipment, fix holiday rotas and resolve problems as they go
along.
A quality card, marked with each worker's individual stamp and signed off
with a group stamp, travels through all stages with the car. At the end of
processing, the vehicle will typically roll directly into a loading bay or
storage park.
Each day only one or two will be given an overall quality check. Just as
Rastatt has no conventional assembly line, it also has no bottleneck bay at
the end of the line - typical of most German plants where cars are checked
over and defects corrected.
Quality, Mr Niefer said, is built in. So, too, is economy. While 10 per cent
of the 45,000 Sindelfingen workforce is occupied solely with quality control
and end-of-line repairs, at Rastatt the line worker and quality controller
are one and the same person.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (6): Big reshuffle is designed to improve
company efficiency - Cadillac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Grettenberger, the head of General Motors' Cadillac luxury car
division, has a hit on his hands.
The new 1922 Cadillac Seville, GM's answer to the threat posed by cars such
as Germany's Mercedes and Japan's Lexus in the luxury market, has won over
not only enthusiastic praise in the US motoring press, but also customers in
the showrooms.
The Seville, and the new Cadillac Eldorado, introduced at the same time last
autumn, have given a significant boost to the division's US car sales, which
were up some 7 per cent over 1991 in the first five months of this year in
an admittedly growing market.
The company's market share rose by a modest one tenth of a point.
Perhaps more important, the company has begun attracting back younger
buyers, whom it needs to take the place of its generally elderly customers.
Mr Grettenberger says the Seville has also attracted attention in Europe
where Cadillac's sales have risen from just 291 vehicles in the 1991 model
year to almost 1,500 in 1992.
This is a much-needed morale booster for GM which has been losing billions
of dollars on its North American operations, prompting a revolt by
non-executive directors on its board last April.
The company is now in the throes of a huge upheaval designed to slim it down
and make it more efficient.
Cadillac's success with the Seville demonstrates what GM is capable of in
good design and engineering when it pulls all the stops out - although the
group's problems are also underlined by the fact that the Seville was a year
late in hitting the market.
'We decided that we were not going to bring it to market until it was
absolutely correct and that required adjustments to our ideas,' says Mr
Grettenberger.
The name Cadillac used to define the American luxury car. But in the 1980s,
along with the rest of GM, the division gained a reputation for poor quality
and tired design.
The past few years, however, have seen a sharp reversal of those trends: the
Seville has picked up numerous design awards while Cadillac's reputation for
quality has steadily improved.
J. D. Powers and Associates, the car market research group, now ranks
Cadillac among the leading US vehicle vendors for customer satisfaction.
Much of this is due to the division's adoption of the Total Quality
Management (TQM) practices pioneered by Japanese companies, which began to
become popular in the US during the 1980s.
TQM stresses the need to ensure top quality in all an organisation's
operations, with particularly emphasis on customer satisfaction and worker
participation.
Cadillac's efforts resulted in it winning the prestigious Baldrige award, a
national competition for TQM, although it only did so at the second attempt.
The group's attention to customer satisfaction played a role in the
extensive market research that went into the design and styling of the
Seville and Eldorado.
The proposed Cadillac vehicles, together with domestic and foreign rivals,
were shown to some 8,000 people across the US who intended to buy luxury
cars.
'We made a special effort to insure we had imported luxury cars there as
well,' says Mr Grettenberger.
One of the main messages was that Cadillac needed to improve the interior
design of its cars. Younger buyers, in particular, disliked a lot of the
ornamentation traditional on its models.
At the same time, Mr Grettenberger needed to maintain the distinctively
American feel of its cars:
'Cadillac is clearly a North American vehicle and anything we do that is not
true to that would be suspect.'
In the hope of attracting European buyers, the company has now begun product
clinics there for vehicles it intends to introduce in 1995 and 1996. 'I
think we're starting to get grass-root voices and customer input from the
Continent and this has good applications for the Far East as well,' says Mr
Grettenberger.
Cadillac is sufficiently encouraged by its progress in Europe to have
started reactivativing its largely dormant network of dealers.
The message from them, says Mr Grettenberger is: 'Address the performance,
handling and efficiency demands of the European market but remain American.
Don't try to be a BMW, a Mercedes, in terms of overall style.'
With Cadillac offering no rebates (other than a little bit of leasing
support) on the Dollars 38,000 Sevilles, Mr Grettenberger says the division
is making 'very good profits.'
That said, Cadillac's Hamtramck, Michigan plant is operating far below its
potential output, reflecting the huge overcapacity that afflicts GM
throughout the group.
Nevertheless, Mr Grettenberger believes Cadillac will remain largely immune
from the rationalisation now shaking up the rest of the group.
He also believes that the luxury car market is set to grow, but the
competition will become even more ferocious because 'its still an area of
the industry where you can get a good return for your investment,' he says.
'The demands of the customer are going to continually increase,' says Mr
Grettenberger.
He believes the ability to get repeat business will depend crucially on
'maintaining high levels of satisfaction throughout the ownership
experience.'
'If you want to be a success,' says the Cadillac chief, 'you had better be
sure that you're not just meeting customers' expectations, but exceeding
them.'

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (4): Even prestige marques feel the pinch -
Specialist Manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAST year has exposed with increasingly severe difficulties facing the
smaller, specialist car makers.
In the UK, where new car sales are suffering from one of their steepest
post-war recessions, the result has been receivership for some of the
smallest names.
These have included sports car makers Reliant and Evante; although, such is
the optimism which seems to infect those who come into contact with
specialist car-making, that each has subsequently found a buyer and is
sputtering back to life.
Even the most prestigious marques, however, are taking a severe battering,
with Porsche and Rolls-Royce among the most notable victims.
At the beginning of this month, the Stuttgart manufacturer whose luxury
sports cars came to symbolise yuppy aspiration and entrepreneurial
achievement in the 1980s, announced that it was making 850 of its workforce
redundant. This was on top of 950 announced a few months earlier, bringing
the workforce down to around 7,000.
The reason lies in slumping sales figures - to near-catastrophic levels in
the US, which was once Porsche's largest single market.
In its current financial year ending next month, Porsche expects to have
delivered 22,000 cars worldwide. That may not sound too severe a drop from
the 26,000 of 1990-91, but it compares with sales of more than 50,000 in the
mid-1980s. The US, where Porsche was finding 30,000 buyers a year in the
mid-1980s, last year absorbed fewer than 5,000.
The job-cuts and other economies should lead to DM100m (Pounds 34.3m) in
operating-cost savings next year, and Porsche should still just make a
profit in the current year, according to its chairman, Mr Arno Bohn.
But the first-half profit was a wafer-thin DM2m and, measured by sales,
Porsche is getting perilously close to the danger level in terms of
viability. Break-even lies only 1,000 units below last year's delivery
level.
What has gone wrong?
Mr Bohn's explanation is that, in the US in particular, 'the desire to buy
luxury goods is not there' and that 'there are problems with the social
acceptability of cars costing DM100,000 or more.'
The explanation is valid as far as it goes. Honda, for example, has seen US
sales of its Dollars 63,000 NSX mid-engined 'supercar' fall by 38 per cent
so far this year, and other high-performance sports car sales have also
weakened.
Underlying Porsche's problems, however, is competition, intensifying at
extraordinary speed, from Japanese rivals for which, only a few years ago,
previous Porsche managers regarded with barely-disguised contempt.
Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Honda all have significant rivals to Porsche's
models, are introducing new ones at a daunting rate and, backed by their
volume car businesses, possess the advantage of being able to charge mostly
cheaper prices. In contrast, and despite the 944's facelift, an aura of
ageing familiarity hangs over all three of Porsche's current model range.
US buyers have so far have shown relatively muted enthusiasm for Porsche's
latest offering, a heavily-revised 944 model, which Porsche regards to be
considers sufficiently 'different' from the 944 to be redesignated the 968,
and which went on sale in the US at the end of last year for Dollars 40,000.
The company needs a heavy investment programme in new product and, its
critics say, has been too slow and too cautious in coming up with one.
Although it still has substantial cash assets, its size leaves it at a
financial disadvantage relative to its larger competitors in terms of
long-term investment funding.
In the opening months of this year, there were faint signs that the worst of
Porsche's problems in the US might be coming to an end. Sales to the end of
April were down 'only' another 5 per cent, at 1,482, according to Automotive
News statistics. And the company has been jolted into action on the product
front. Plans for a new, up-market four-seater have been shelved. By 1996, a
new sports car pitched squarely at Japanese rivals such as the Mazda RX-7
should be on the road.
Strains have been felt throughout the group, not least in management. Mr
Bohn himself earlier this year threatened to resign when Porsche's
supervisory board initially failed to approve renewal of his contract after
it expires at the end of this year - he has since had it renewed for three
years. And the long-serving chief executives of Porsche's subsidiaries in
both the US and the UK have decided to leave the company in the past year.
Inevitably, speculation has arisen about whether Porsche can retain its
independence. Despite offers from Mercedes-Benz and others, Mr Bohn insists
that the Porsche and Piech families-controlled company remains not for sale.
At the Crewe headquarters of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the strain has been no
less intense.
The chairman and chief executive, Mr Peter Ward, and his management team at
the UK's most prestigious car company have spent much of the past six months
uncertain as to whether Rolls-Royce will remain part of Vickers, the UK
engineering group which has owned it for more than a decade, or whether the
company will, in the end, be sold.
Certainly, Vickers has tried hard to sell it - to the consternation of
die-hard Anglophiles, who feel that Rolls is quintessentially English and
that its sale to a probably foreign buyer should not be contemplated. To
their relief, Vickers has yet to receive an offer which it regards as high
enough, despite discussions with a number of companies including BMW.
The problems at Rolls are similar in type, but not scale or detail, to those
at Porsche: a company whose physical size is a lot smaller than its
reputation (in a good year, Rolls builds around 3,000 cars), and recession
in all its major markets. So in the space of three years Rolls has gone from
being the profits flagship of the Vickers groups to a significant
loss-maker.
Sales in 1991 plunged 48.3 per cent to 1,723 - the lowest level since 1968 -
from the record 3,333 achieved in 1990, dragging Rolls down to a Pounds 30m
trading loss last year.
Sales this year are expected to be at around the same level, although losses
should be cut to Pounds 15m or less as a result of extensive job cuts and
other savings. Again, though, the worst may just be over. Rolls is
cautiously predicting that, by the end of the year, it may be trading at
breakeven.
For some of the best-known specialists, at least, survival in a harsh
climate is no longer an issue - but only because they have become
acclimatised to life under the ownership of volume producers. Thus, while
Jaguar is still struggling to reverse sales which, worldwide, fell sharply
last year and plunged production from nearly 42,000 in 1991 to fewer than
23,000 last year, it is developing major new product plans, including a
smaller luxury saloon, under the wing of its owner, Ford.
Aston Martin is able to plan a new 'cheaper' sports car - likely still to
cost close to Pounds 100,000, however - for 1994, thanks to the financial
underpinning of 75 per cent ownership by Ford. The car is to be built at a
rate of 625 a year, and with its own unique Aston Martin engine; but not at
Aston Martin's traditional 'home' at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire.
Instead, the company is creating a new subsidiary, Aston Martin Oxford, to
oversee the car's birth. It will be developed at Kidlington, Oxford, in
premises owned by JaguarSport, a 50-50 joint venture company between Jaguar
and Mr Tom Walkinshaw's TWR Group, which also operates Jaguar's racing
activities.
The NPX will actually be built at JaguarSport's manufacturing plant at
Bloxham, Oxfordshire, where a new Jaguar 'supercar', the Pounds 350,000
XJ220, has just entered production.
JaguarSport is making only 350 XJ220s, and the premises are expected to be
devoted entirely to Aston Martin after the last XJ220 comes off the line in
two years' time.
Meanwhile, Group Lotus, the UK specialist sports car-maker has cut its
workforce by 40 per cent. This followed poor sales of its Elan sports car,
output of which was down 58 per cent in this year's first quarter, to 338,
after having reached 2,240 for all of 1991. Nevertheless, it can be fairly
sure of a long-term future under the ownership of General Motors.
The swallowing up of the industry's 'minnows', however, is not an
irresistible trend.
TVR, at Blackpool on the UK's north-west coast, has survived since 1954 by
making hairy-chested tubular steel and fibreglass sports cars, which require
relatively low tooling costs and give a considerable degree of design
flexibility. TVR has soldiered on, never making more than a few hundred
units a year, mainly because its cars' styling, design and sometimes
eccentric standards of finish have proved attractive to only a small coterie
of enthusiasts.
Its recent launch of a new model, the Griffith, caused a minor sensation,
however. The car was compared favourably, at least in styling terms, with
much more prestigious marques. Consequently, TVR is for the first time
contemplating production of more than 1,000 cars a year.
It has been left to AC Cars, however, to buck the takeover trend completely.
In 1987, with all the volume manufacturers buying up minor nameplates as
fast as they could go, Ford bought a 50.96 per cent stake in AC, a
Surrey-based specialist sports car company, for Pounds 1.3m.
Ford bought the stake mainly because of AC's production of the Cobra, a
major image builder for Ford in the 1960s, when it sold the Cobra through
its North American dealer network. Now Ford is selling its holding, for an
undisclosed sum, back to Mr Brian Angliss, AC Cars' managing director, who
also controls Autokraft, a private company which holds the minority stake in
AC Cars.
Both sides say the sale was amicable, and Ford will continue to help AC to
produce a new, low-volume sports car while retaining the right to the Cobra
name in North America. Behind the scenes, however, lies the old culture
clash between corporate and individualist.
Mr Angliss now intends to find a new partner to put the car into production
at volumes of 500-600 a year. Resurrecting another old AC name, it is to be
called the Ace. Whether Mr Angliss has played one, only time will tell.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (3): Catching up fast - The European Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR British executives tempted to move to a continental Europe-based
company in the EC's single market next year, but concerned about possible
loss of the company car which is among the most hallowed of UK 'perks', have
rapidly decreasing cause to worry.
Studies by management remuneration groups such as the Monks Partnership and
Brussels-based Wyatt Company provide firm evidence that most continental
European countries are moving towards British levels of provision, even
while UK Chancellors have shown a desire to squeeze such perks out of the
remuneration system.
Indeed, at managing director level, the UK now ranks only sixth in the
European league for automatic car provision.
Admittedly, that is splitting hairs since 96 per cent of managing directors
in Britain get one, according to Monks survey figures. But Britain is
nevertheless behind France (97 per cent), Spain (98 per cent) and, most of
all Austria and Germany, where Monks found 100 per cent allocation. Even
four out of five Swiss managing directors - better able than most to buy
their own Mercedes - received either a car or an allowance with which to buy
one.
British managing directors contemplating 'opting out' of their own company
cars as a result of increasing personal taxation on its benefit might not,
however, be too impressed at the average size of allowance - Dollars 10,238
a year according to Wyatt's statistics, which currently would not cover one
year's depreciation on some quite modest executive cars in the depressed UK
market.
At director level, Germany and Ireland have moved up to share equal ranking
with the UK on 97 per cent provision but, according to Monks' statistics,
the gap is narrowing swiftly with countries which, even until fairly
recently, expected most directors to buy their own. Even Belgium, once
notably miserly towards its directors, now provides cars for two-thirds of
directors.
The further down the managerial tree such surveys descend, however, the more
the 'old' picture of the UK as a particularly benevolent country for car
provision does re-establish itself.
At middle manager level, one half of Spanish employees, for example, are
offered cars while 96 per cent of their British counterparts - almost the
same percentage as managing directors - receive them as a matter of course.
On present trends, however, the gap will close significantly over the next
two or three years - only just over one third of Spanish managers were
receiving cars in the late 1980s.
French middle managers have reason to smile as well. Last year, according to
the Monks survey, 54 per cent of middle managers received cars, compared
with only 30 per cent two years previously.
The surveys shed some interesting light on some of the cultural differences
between countries in terms of the cost and type of cars provided. In Spain,
for example, Monks found that the managing director's car is likely to cost
at least three times more than that of the sales rep. In egalitarian Sweden,
however, the chief executive's car often costs only about one-third more
than the salesman's.
The UK is not notably more egalitarian than Spain. Indeed, the Monks study
found that the average of Pounds 28,000 which British managing directors
spent on their cars was the highest of all the countries in the study,
although this is explained in part by high purchase taxes - since reduced as
a result of the cut in Special Car Tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
Of particular interest to UK businessmen, as they await the conclusions of a
government-ordered review of the current structure of company car taxation,
might be the extent to which other European countries offer their executives
a choice between a car or a cash allowance.
In Britain, according to Wyatt's statistics, only between 3.4 per cent and
4.3 per cent are offered such a choice, irrespective of whether the employee
is a rep or the chief executive. At the other extreme, between 57 and 90 per
cent of Norwegians, depending on job category, get the choice, as do between
15 and 20 per cent of Germans.
Self-evidently, the choice of car made by Europe's executives is a matter of
profound importance to their manufacturers. So what exactly is most popular?
According to a compilation made by the FT's Jobs Column from the vehicles
most mentioned within the Wyatt research, for all management levels averaged
over 17 countries, the league table runs:
1, Audi 100; 2, Ford Scorpio-Granada; 3, BMW 5 Series; 4, Renault 25; 5,
Opel Omega (Vauxhall Carlton); 6, Volvo 700 Series; 7, Mercedes 200 Series;
8, Peugeot 405; 9, Renault 21; 10, Ford Sierra.
For chief executives only, the 'top five' list reads 1, BMW 5 Series; 2,
Audi 100; 3, Volvo 700 Series; 4, Mercedes 200 Series; 5, Saab 9000.
The overall hierarchy is a source of particular satisfaction to Audi, the
Volkswagen group's executive car arm. The Audi 100 has been 'top of the
pops' since the late 1980s.
What has yet to show up in any of the charts is an executive car with a
Japanese badge attached to it. But with what started out as a trickle of
Japanese executive cars starting to become a flood, it is a moot point for
how long such a situation will prevail.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (2): Review is eagerly awaited - The British
Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN the next few weeks, HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue are
to publish a consultative document on changes to the car pricing, engine
capacity and possibly business mileage bands which currently determine how
much tax executives must pay on the private benefit of their company cars.
Unless there has been a big change of heart since the review was first
announced in Chancellor Norman Lamont's budget in March, it is expected that
both engine capacity bands and the Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000
thresholds above which individual tax charges rise sharply will be abandoned
in favour of a simplified scale related merely to vehicle price.
The review is awaited eagerly by manufacturers and dealers for it is likely
to have considerable effect on the type of specification of the executive
cars they make and sell. And for business car users, it should lead to
considerably greater freedom of choice.
At the upper end of the market such a revised system should greatly benefit
companies such as Jaguar, which has only two models below the Pounds 29,000
threshold and which has therefore traditionally been severely disadvantaged
by the tax scale system.
Abolition of the much more important - at least for the larger manufacturers
 -Pounds 19,250 threshold would free the car companies from having to
produce 'threshold specials' aimed at just creeping into the lower tax band.
It would allow them to create a more coherent range of products, with
resultant greater choice for the company car buyers who - at this level of
the market - accounts for at least three-quarters of all such cars sold.
Significant as the review is, it represents only one of a number of changes
which this year are transforming the landscape of the business car market.
For a start, there is the cut in special car tax, also announced in the
budget, to 5 per cent from 10 per cent.
The cut does not mean a straightforward 5 per cent reduction on pre-budget
prices, because it is computed on the pre-tax price less the discount
allowed to the dealer and nets out at just over 4 per cent. But it still
amounts to a worthwhile Pounds 1,100 off a Pounds 27,000 executive car or
more than Pounds 3,000 off a Rolls-Royce.
Potentially just as significant, at least for businesses and car-using
executives, was a clarification of VAT rules by the Chancellor, who gave an
assurance that companies which want to offer employees a cash alternative to
a car, and there are signs that a growing number do, will not have to pay
VAT on any salary foregone by employees who choose to keep their cars.
Until the clarification, that is exactly what Customs and Excise had been
insisting. And the issue is no minor one because, for example, a company
running 500 cars but offering employees Pounds 3,000 a year cash instead
risked landing itself with a VAT bill for nearly Pounds 250,000, even if
only one employee opted for the cash.
It is the main reason why companies have been frightened away from pursuing
cars-for-cash schemes, even though many have begun investigating them
because of last year's introduction of National Insurance charges on company
cars and higher VAT which, uniquely among business goods, cannot be
reclaimed on car purchases.
For car manufacturers already suffering from the steepest UK new car market
recession since the Second World War, this is a matter of considerable
anxiety. In Britain, executive cars, bought or leased with corporate cash,
traditionally have been specified with lots of 'extras' and have provided
their makers with high profit per unit.
Executives, depending on their status, have tended to be allocated a choice
of car within a given price band and, not unnaturally, have sought to have
their cars specified as close to their price 'ceiling' as possible.
The worry of the car makers is that, given a cash alternative, uncomfortably
large numbers of executives might decide that a smaller, cheaper car is
adequate for their needs.
The manufacturers already have enough to worry about
No sooner did they feel mostly exonerated by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission early this year from consumer group charges that UK cars were
over-priced than, last month, another report ordered by EC competition
commissioner Sir Leon Brittan reached another conclusion:
In extreme cases, it said, UK car prices could be 40 per cent or more above
those in continental Europe.
It has suggested that, if the industry wants to keep its system of
exclusively franchised dealers, it is time to put its house in order.
The prices controversy had already been rumbling on throughout the recession
which has seen UK new car sales plunge from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 1.6m
last year and, some industry leaders such as Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of
Britain's chairman, fear, a 'worst case' 1.5m this year.
Against this highly charged background, there were inevitable pressures for
a discounting war. At the executive level, Ford began offering big discounts
on its Granada range, and the other big producers hit back in similar vein.
The trouble is, very little has worked.
UK business, almost irrespective of sector, has become rather more
interested in the problems of survival than in what cars to buy for its
executives. With the old argument in favour of executive 'perk' cars - that
they are a necessary weapon to attract high calibre staff - now just a
mocking memory, for many companies the issue has become for how long they
can put off buying any replacement cars at all. Suspicions about the whole
car pricing debate have simply added to the propensity to 'wait and see'.
While there is little to relieve the gloom at the moment, by the end of this
year the long hiatus could be coming to the rescue of the manufacturers, for
the simple reason that tens of thousands of cars normally replaced at two-
or three-year intervals are still soldiering on after four years or even
longer.
Repair bills have been climbing rapidly - and embarrassing incidents
proliferating. As just one example, one executive of a nationally-known UK
concern had to cancel a business meeting when, a few hours before, his car
failed its MOT test.
Evidence that a wave of replacements cannot be long delayed is also starting
to mount. Auctions houses are starting to report a glut of high-mileage
executive cars coming through their compounds. According to Mr John Bailey,
managing director of Independent Car Auctions: 'The market is starting to
become swamped with high-mileage executive cars'.
Until now, he suggests, the glut has had only a slight impact on their
resale values.
But there are now so many, he warns, that they are likely to become
difficult to sell.

Correction (Published 25th June 1992) appended to this article.
INDIAN police arrested two leading Bombay brokers, Mr Bhupen Dalal and Mr A
D Narottam, last night and brought criminal charges against Standard
Chartered and two state-owned Indian merchant banks for alleged fraud.
In a joint operation, police and internal revenue officials raided the
offices and homes of Mr Dalal, his uncle, Mr J P Gandhi, Mr Narottam and
several others.
Signalling the second phase in India's worst securities market scandal, the
first information report (charge sheet) says that the exposure of the three
banks is Rs13.68bn (Pounds 263m), including Rs8.9bn which relates to
Standard Chartered.
The police have named in the second phase 19 persons, of whom nine are
Standard Chartered officers, indicating far greater involvement of the
UK-based bank than expected. Standard Chartered dismissed two of its
securities dealers at its Bombay office last week after an internal inquiry.
The charges against the 19 are criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and
bribery.
The first phase of the Rs30.8bn scandal related to Rs17.13bn transactions
between State Bank of India and several Indian banks brokered by Mr Harshad
Mehta, who is already in custody.
The Bombay bourse has been closed since June 15.
K K Sharma adds:  The contest for the post of president of India - normally
a straightforward election for a ceremonial position - seems to have caused
a bitter battle between the ruling Congress party and its opponents.
The Congress party last week nominated Mr Shankar Dayal Sharma, the
country's vice-president, for the election in July to replace Mr R.
Venkataraman.
In doing so, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, did not consult the
opposition parties, abandoning his proclaimed stand of being a consensus
seeker. The opposition retaliated by seeking a candidate to oppose Mr Sharma
but their actions only exposed deep divisions.
Correction (Published 25th June 1992)
Owing to a transmission error, the Financial Times yesterday incorrectly
reported that the Indian authorities had brought criminal charges against
Standard Chartered Bank in India in connection with a securities market
scandal. The report should have said that criminal charges had been brought
against two former employees of Standard Chartered Bank.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold gets cold shoulder from
new generation of investors - Analysts believe the metal has lost its appeal
as a long term store of value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD HAD given up its role as a long term store of value and was now a
commodity, suggested Mr David Pryde, managing director of JP Morgan, at the
Financial Times World Gold Conference in Montreux yesterday. This would
continue to shape general perceptions about the precious metal, its price
potential and associated trading ranges and volatility.
He said oil and other energy-related products were now being used by
investors wanting to hedge against inflation or to counter negative market
developments. Whereas 10 years ago gold would have represented 80 to 100 per
cent of a counterhedge against inflation, today it accounted for only 5 to
30 per cent.
However, the sums of money under management today were greater than ever
before, so the quantities of gold required were still substantial. 'Even as
a commodity gold remains a large and diverse market with many significantly
differentiated participants and this diversity of interest and need will
continue to create opportunity as long as we recognise and accept changing
realities,' he said.
Reasons for gold's relative loss of appeal in the Middle East were supplied
by Mr Marwan Shakarchi, president of MKS Finance. He said that some
investors discovered during the Gulf war gold holdings proved useless for
protecting wealth. One Saudi jeweller told him that it took weeks to get out
his gold but only one day to take all his precious stones with him.
After the war Saudi people dishorded most of their gold and bought instead
US dollar notes or travellers' cheques.
Mr Barclay Leib, a vice president of J. Aron-Goldman Sachs, said gold as an
'asset class' was 'clearly in disrepute'. The price performance had been
poor in the past 10 years mainly because investors had given it up in favour
of the high interest rates offered by federal governments and financial
institutions that 'in essence are guaranteed by these governments against
default'.
Mr Ralf Kreikenbaum, a director of Commerzbank International SA Luxembourg,
said that in Europe a new generation of investors had never learned to look
on gold as a crisis and inflation-proof store of value and means of payment.
'Those inheriting fortunes built up according to conservative principles are
looking for higher yields for their portfolios. They are also more prepared
to run risks,' he pointed out.
When heirs to a family inheritance opened up the safe deposit box and saw
the pile of gold 'their first reaction is to ask: What shall we invest in
once we have got rid of the gold?'
Mr Richard Scott-Ram, chief economist and strategist for the World Gold
Council, said that small investors in the US were bearish about gold's price
prospects so demand for gold coins and investment in gold-oriented mutual
funds was low.
Investment by US institutions in gold bullion was probably non-existent last
year. However, some US institutions had sizeable investments in gold company
shares and 'financial claims' on gold (such as purchases of call options on
gold) had picked up considerably in recent weeks. This pick up in demand for
derivatives should feed back into increased demand for physical gold.
In Japan investors and speculators disappointed by the gold price
performance were 'fading from the market,' said Mr Kentaro Ojima, general
manager of Sumitomo Corporation's precious metals dealing department.
However, a new type of relatively young investor was emerging in Japan who
was not as rich as the traditional investor but was supporting the growth of
gold accumulation plans. These involve a regular monthly payment going to
buy gold at the present market price.
About 300,000 people bought 30 tonnes of gold - about half of Japan's total
investment demand for the metal - last year. Mr Ojima suggested that in five
years this might grow to 1m people buying an annual 100 tonnes.
Most of the speakers pointed out that China held the key to future gold
demand. Mr Robert Sitt, managing director of Mase Westpac Hong Kong, said
that the Chinese government projected GNP growth of 8 per cent annually and
on a compound basis, gold consumption in China could double to reach 800
tonnes by the year 2000. 'This would be a conservative estimate if we take
into account the high growth rate of consumption of 448 per cent recorded in
Taiwan in the last decade,' he pointed out.
Although gold bar hoarding was weaker in the South-east Asian markets
outside Japan (sophisticated investors were put off by the negative return
on the precious metal, he said) gold jewellery demand remained strong. The
region, which took about 120 tonnes of gold in 1986, could therefore this
year absorb more than 800 tonnes - a record.
'With the potential growth of offtake, particularly in China, the entire
western world mine production could easily be absorbed,' Mr Sitt pointed
out.
Mr Tim Green, chief consultant at Gold Fields Minerals Services, said that
future gold jewellery demand 'depends considerably on new mega-markets like
China'. At present the Malaysian jewellery industry simply could not cope
with demands for chuk kam jewellery for China.
Demand for gold jewellery elsewhere in the world remained patchy, said Mr
Green, but Chinese purchases had helped to push the total last year to a
record 2,250 tonnes. Pointing out that this was more than all the newly
mined gold last year, Mr Green added: 'Jewellery is not just the cornerstone
of the gold market it is now virtually the whole building'.
Fortunately for the gold producers jewellery demand was spread over a wide
number of markets, unlike, for example, diamonds which relied on two or
three key markets. 'To coin a phrase, diamonds are forever but carat gold
jewellery is for everywhere,' said Mr Green.
There was a confusing message from the conference about the prospects for
the gold price. Mr Shakarchi suggested that Middle Eastern investors were
holding back from buying gold because 'they do not view present levels as
the bottom and are standing aside awaiting lower prices'. He added: 'I
believe that in the short term the gold price will stay stable to a bit
lower and for the medium term, barring any other major incident, we shall
gradually move even lower'.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, said, however, that the
market should overcome its fear that higher prices would generate more sales
by gold producers and test Dollars 350 a troy ounce and possibly Dollars 365
over the next few months.
She pointed out that gold retained its attraction as 'a wholly anonymous
form of legal tender and there is a high proportion of the world's
population that prefers to hold gold rather than paper money'. This
philosophy formed part of the rationale behind central bank holdings 'and is
one of the reasons which puts some doubt behind the likelihood of a
wholesale disposal of gold holdings from the official sector - any crisis of
confidence in a country's currency means that gold reserves are vital as a
perceived, if not actual, asset of last resort'.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: French farmers in unequal
struggle for survival - A look at despairing attempts to turn back the tide
of agricultural policy reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S FARMERS are embarking on the final round of a fight for survival.
Thousands of them unsuccessfully attempted to blockade Paris yesterday, as
France's great and good converged on Louis XIV's chateau in Versailles to
vote on the country's European future.
Some of the angrier members of Coordination Rurale, a minority splinter
group that wants the government to overturn last month's European Community
farm policy reforms and raise farm prices, had promised a re-run of the
French revolution. Yet the end result was tame, a sign of the diminishing
power of the once mighty farm lobby.
It caused less disruption than the average bank holiday traffic jam. Instead
of blocking access to the capital, the demonstrators chatted amiably with
motorists and police, meekly allowing themselves to be rounded up by the
latter.
The government had in any case forbidden them to hold up the traffic and
given the police special powers to shift vehicles. Conscious that it would
lose in any confrontation with the police, the CR had ordered its members to
avoid violence. The CR represents only 7,000 out of France's 1m farmers and
managed to set up a mere 15 road blocks, according to the interior ministry.
Even so, the Socialist government is worried by the wave of demonstrations
by the CR and some members of the main unions, the right wing FNSEA and CNJA
over the past fortnight. The protests have been worst in south-west France,
dominated by the small farmers who are likely to be worst hit by the
reforms, where vegetables have been dumped on the streets, tyres burned and
traffic has been held up by tractors performing 'operations escargots'.
For President Francois Mitterrand such a resurgence of anti-EC feeling is
most unwelcome at time when he is trying to nurse volatile public opinion
towards a firm 'yes' vote in the autumn referendum on the Maastricht
agreement.
Accordingly, the government has handled its farmers with kid gloves. Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, has promised tax benefits, debt
assistance and other aid, to be unveiled by the end of July, and has
discreetly shelved a series of farming conferences. The police have steered
clear of confrontation.
A worried Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has
joined in, warning on French television that refusal to accept the reforms -
steep price cuts over the next three years, with compensation in the form of
direct income support - 'would be a catastrophe for our farm system'. The
number of French farms could fall to 300,000, less than a third of the
present level, if the reforms were not applied. 'With the new system, we can
keep 600,000 to 700,000,' he said.
These latest demonstrations are different from the ones that have broken out
across the French countryside in recent years, and contrasts with last
autumn's peaceful and united demonstration by 200,000 farmers in the streets
of Paris. Today, the farmers are more divided, less powerful and therefore
more tetchy.
Only a year ago, they were united against the basic principle of the
compensation for price cuts in the form of direct income support. The main
farming unions, have always argued that they wanted incomes to depend on
prices rather than aid, which they see simply as a way to bring about the
slow death of thousands of small farms.
The government could not afford to be isolated in opposition to EC farm
policy reform, and correctly guessed that FNSEA would have no option but to
negotiate. The reforms are 'a series of impostures', says Mr Raymond
Lacombe, its president, but he pledges that the union will 'try to use to
the best the margin of manoeuvre available in this faulty accord'. The CR,
by contrast, will accept nothing less than the complete abandonment of the
reforms - a stance that the main unions know is unrealistic.
Economically, farmers' power has been in steady decline for the past 20
years, as a result of the ageing of their population, the fall in prices and
the growth in their debts. France had 4m farms in 1970, four times today's
level, contributing 7 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, as
against a mere 4 per cent in 1990. Of today's farms, 18 per cent grow
cereals, 17 per cent are dairy and 20 per cent sheep or beef rearing.
In line with the intensification of farming across Europe, French farms have
also got bigger, from an average of 19 hectares in 1970, to 30 hectares now,
according to the agriculture ministry. This suggests that France should do
well out of the EC reforms, which favour the most efficient farms. Yet the
average hides big disparities.
Properties of 100 hectares or more account for a quarter of French farmland,
such as the huge wheat farms of plains of the Brie and Beauce in the Paris
basin. Not surprisingly, these are the farmers that tend to be most ready to
negotiate on CAP reform. The small properties fall into two categories:
market gardens, vineyards and orchards, which are profitable on small
amounts of land; and the genuinely depressed farmers of the poorest rural
areas.
This last category is the one that has born the brunt of a decline in
earnings, down 2.2 per cent last year despite EC subsidies and a rise in
debts, now on average FFr400,000 (Pounds 40,000) per farm. Debts of this
magnitude constitute a real burden for a population whose incomes last year
ranged from a low of FFr20,000 in Corsica to FFr300,000 in the Paris basin.
Against this background few young people are prepared to continue operating
their parents' farms, the main reason for the ageing of France's farmers. Of
the total, 60 per cent are more than 50 years old and 40 per cent of the
total profess to having no successor.

THE LONDON Metal Exchange ZINC market's cash premium shrank again yesterday
as the three months position built on Monday's rally and the cash price
edged down further. Dealers said a comparatively small rise in LME warehouse
stocks encouraged the three months position's Dollars 7 rise to Dollars
1,210.50 a tonne. That left the cash premium at Dollars 82 a tonne. Before
last week's LME move to impose a descending ceiling on the daily cash
premium a technical squeeze had widened the cash/three months premium to
Dollars 189 a tonne. In the LME TIN market the recent sustained price rise,
which had added Dollars 287.50 a tonne to the three months price in seven
trading days, was halted. But buying support appeared as the Dollars 6,700 a
tonne level was approached and the price closed off the low at Dollars
6,735.50 a tonne, down Dollars 32 on the day. A decline in warehouse stocks
helped to steady the market, traders said. In the London bullion market GOLD
resumed its recent uptrend with a Dollars 2.05 gain to Dollars 344.65 an
ounce. Dealers attributed the rise to light professional activity encouraged
by concern over the political situation in South Africa, the largest gold
producing country.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa futures prices hit fresh
16 1/2 -year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON COCOA prices fell to fresh 16 1/2 -year lows yesterday as the
inexorable decline continued. Some traders now see the second position
contract falling to Pounds 500 a tonne before long.
The September contract touched a low of Pounds 520 a tonne in early trading
before recovering to close at Pounds 523 a tonne, down Pounds 7 on the day.
Two main factors are keeping prices permanently under pressure, according to
Mr Tony Chadwick of Prudential Bache. First, West African crops -
particularly in the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer - have been better
than had been expected, and second, demand from the former Soviet Union has
fallen dramatically.
The combination of better production performances and lower consumption than
expected has forced analysts to revise sharply downwards their original
projections for the first deficit in the world cocoa supply-demand balance
for eight years. The International Cocoa Organisation has cut its forecast
to 115,000 tonnes from an earlier 140,000 tonnes and Gill &amp; Duffus, the
London trader owned by ED &amp; F Man, last month reduced its estimate to
107,000 tonnes from 177,000 tonnes. The Economist Intelligence Unit is
predicting a deficit of only 83,000 tonnes.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said
yesterday's decline followed light trade selling in a market 'devoid of any
speculative interest'. The only factor on the horizon that could provide any
bullish news was the talks in Geneva from July 6 on a new international
cocoa agreement. 'This has been largely ignored and there is a possibility
of a surprise,' he said.
Cocoa producing countries last week issued a statement, after a meeting in
the Ivory Coast, urging consumers to join in working towards an agreement
with price-supporting clauses by the end of the current cocoa year in
September. 'Producer countries feel it is vital to envisage interim
provisions to face up to the grave crisis in the cocoa economy before a new
accord takes effect.'
The EIU in its latest World Commodity Forecasts predicts a 'sluggish upturn'
in prices next year to an average price of 60 cents a lb compared with an
average of 51 cents this year. But it points out that the market has 'a
disconcerting habit of confounding the pundits. Every new low is seen as the
bottom and yet prices go on falling'.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: BMW has target of 70,000 cars a
year at US plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BMW, the German luxury car manufacturer, will invest an initial Dollars 400m
at its planned US plant until production starts up in about three years'
time, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, the chief executive, said yesterday.
At first, output will be small, consisting of cars built mainly from parts
imported from Germany. But he said BMW aimed at annual production of up to
70,000 cars a year by the year 2000.
He was speaking at a press conference to announce the plant, the first to be
set up abroad by a German luxury carmaker. He confirmed that it would be in
the Greenville/Spartanburg area of South Carolina, as reported this week.
Noting that the US was the world's biggest car market, he said: 'We have to
maintain, secure, and build up the position we have achieved in the American
market. This is becoming increasingly difficult to do from Germany.'
Production costs in the US were about 30 per cent less than in Germany, he
said. 'We are too expensive in Germany.' By the end of the century, the
plant should employ some 2,000 people, with a similar number working for
supplier companies in the area.
BMW's decision, which will also make it the only German car company with a
US plant after Volkswagen's plant closure there in 1988, comes after a
series of setbacks in the US for German manufacturers.
Sales of German models have been hit by US recession, fluctuations in the
dollar, and the luxury goods tax. Mr von Kuenheim said 84 per cent of the
money raised by the US tax was borne by purchasers of German cars.
This year, however, with the upturn in the market and new models, German car
sales have picked up in the US. BMW reported a 24 per cent rise in the first
five months to nearly 25,000 vehicles. Mr Robert Buchelhofer, marketing
director, said BMW wanted to add 10,000 cars in the US this year to the
53,300 sold there in 1991 - 16 per cent down on 1990. In 1986, its best year
in the US, it sold 97,000 cars.
Mr von Kuenheim would not say which models would be built in the South
Carolina plant, which will make cars for worldwide export as well as sale in
North America. He stressed that the product would be 'a real BMW' and not a
pale copy. The new US plant will also be inside the new North American Free
Trade Area and thus avoid any possible trade restrictions there.

BALTICA, Denmark's biggest insurance group, plans to change its structure to
focus more on core activities which will enable it to reduce staff by 10 per
cent over the next two to three years and cut its costs, Reuter reports from
Copenhagen.
The company will merge the staff, computer and finance departments of the
holding company with those of the banking, finance and insurance divisions.
It will also cut back on its involvement in the construction sector where it
has backed a number of large projects.
The changes, from September 1, will leave general and life insurance as the
group's core areas. Finance will be a secondary activity but Baltica Bank
will remain a separate business.
Baltica reported a first-quarter net profit of DKr27m (Dollars 4.48m)
against DKr558m a year earlier and said higher loss provisions for building
projects and property purchases could affect the full-year result.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: White goods war washes over
Europe - The link between Electrolux and AEG's household appliance unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Europe's status as the decisive battleground in the global white goods
war has become increasingly apparent over the past five years, yesterday's
deal between Electrolux of Sweden and Germany's AEG Hausgerate simply rubbed
the message home.
By taking a 10 per cent stake in the household appliances unit of AEG, part
of Daimler-Benz, the Swedish multinational is signalling its intention to
defend its leading position in a European white goods market whose
competitive balance is being transformed by takeovers and co-operation
deals.
The structural change is gradually breaking down national boundaries in the
white goods industry, even if producers still have to allow for big
variations in customer preferences. For medium-sized companies such as AEG,
competing long-term will not be easy against larger producers which have
organised production on a European or global basis, leading to lower costs
and increased efficiency.
The two companies plan to co-operate in a restructuring of their respective
production facilities for washing machines, tumble driers and dishwashers -
and are limiting the deal to production and product development. Even so,
both are keen to stress the deal's strategic rationale - to meet the
increasing competition from the US and Japan in the European domestic
appliances market.
This challenge is being spearheaded by Whirlpool of the US, the world's
largest white goods producer, which last year completed the Dollars 1.1bn
takeover of Philips' white goods business. Maytag, another US white goods
producer, bought Hoover in 1989 when it took over Chicago Pacific, while the
Anglo-American joint venture General Domestic Appliances, owned by General
Electric of the US and the UK's General Electric Company, is a leading
participant in the UK market and is looking for expansion opportunities in
continental Europe.
The aim of the US producers, and especially Whirlpool, has been to transfer
the production efficiencies learned in the heavily concentrated US market to
a European market where profitability has been hampered by the industry's
fragmented structure.
This, in turn, has encouraged some of the rationalisation among smaller
European producers, which are realising that it is easier for larger
producers to survive in tough market conditions. Electrolux itself, however,
has been the other main force behind the industry's rationalisation and
adoption of pan-European manufacturing and marketing, starting with the
acquisition of Zanussi of Italy in 1984.
In the background are the Japanese producers, notably Matsushita and
Toshiba, which have avoided splashy acquisitions in the European market but
are being closely watched by European competitors.
So far, Japanese producers have made less impact in the European market for
appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers than in microwave ovens,
which accounted for 13 per cent of European white goods sales last year and
were almost entirely responsible for an increase in the total market to 56m
units, according to Electrolux.
But the Japanese producers' manufacturing efficiency, and the financial
strength that comes from a stranglehold on their home market, makes them
potentially powerful competitors in the European market, and increases the
pressure on indigenous suppliers to produce white goods more quickly and
efficiently.
All these issues underly yesterday's announcement, prompting Mr Ruggero
Bodo, vice-president for planning at Whirlpool International, to comment
that the deal 'confirms that our reading of the dynamics of the business is
the correct one'.
Inevitably, however, there are also some special factors behind the deal,
giving it a strongly German flavour. Electrolux has been keen to expand its
market share in Germany, Europe's largest single market, and last year's
relaunch of its Electrolux brand as an 'upper mass-middle market' product
range was partly aimed at reasonably affluent middle class Germans who might
think twice about buying a premium product such as a Miele or an AEG.
There have been rumours that Electrolux would try to buy AEG, but in
settling for a production and product development deal it is sharing, albeit
only partly, in what Mr Bill Coleman, an analyst at James Capel, calls 'a
good profitable business in Germany, highly-priced and very much a premium
brand . . . AEG is an attractive company in white goods, less so in
electronics.'
Last year the German market in white goods showed continued strength,
although Electrolux says growth dropped considerably in the second half of
the year. Even so, the market is much healthier than its counterparts in the
UK or the Nordic countries. 'Germany is still holding up pretty well,
although we don't see any increases,' said Mr Lennart Ribohn, senior
executive vice-president, this month.
At the European level, Electrolux believes co-operation with AEG will
succeed because the companies have complementary rather than the same
European markets. AEG is strong in Germany and Poland while Electrolux has a
larger presence in Italy, Britain, Spain and the Nordic region.
For AEG, the deal brings economies of scale in white goods manufacturing
without jeopardising the Hausgerate unit's independence.
Foreign white goods producers have been involved in sporadic discussions
with AEG ever since its parent company sought court protection from its
creditors in 1982.
A domestic solution to AEG's need for critical mass seemed to be developing
last autumn when Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, the German market leader, said it
was negotiating a link-up. But that would almost certainly have provoked
objections from Germany's Cartel Office.
There is no chance that the deal will have the same effect. Electrolux has
only 5 per cent of the German market, against AEG's 13 per cent.
The deal will not, as initially structured, change the rankings in the
western European market - Electrolux has about 18 per cent, followed by
Bosch-Siemens with 13 per cent and Whirlpool with 9 per cent.
Observers were wondering yesterday whether the deal was the prelude to a
closer financial link-up or even a full takeover. Electrolux has the option
to raise its stake in AEG Hausgerate to 20 per cent, and Mr Anders Scharp,
the Swedish company's chairman, said the proposed co-operation was the
'first step in a larger co-operative investment especially when it came to
research and development in washing machines and tumble dryers'.
Given AEG's long search to maintain independence for its white goods
business while addressing the wider changes in the industry, a full takeover
looks unlikely.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: BfG Bank returns to the black
for 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BfG Bank, the former German trades union bank which has been through a
painful restructuring process in recent years, yesterday reported a group
partial operating profit - before trading profits - of DM120.5m (Dollars
76.2m) for 1991.
This represents a turnround of DM302.8m over 1990 when the bank reported a
loss of DM182.3m. If own-account trading results were included, the
turnround was more dramatic: the bank reported profits of DM221.1m last year
compared with a loss of DM389.9m.
The better performance at this level reflected interest income up DM267m to
DM976.5m and administrative and staff costs down by DM47.9m to DM1.13bn.
However, at the parent bank, losses at the partial operating level amounted
to DM277m last year, compared with a profit of DM338m in 1990, reflecting
extraordinary costs associated with the bank's restructuring. Stripping out
the one-off items, the partial operating profit was DM60m, compared with a
loss of DM259m a year earlier.
Speaking in Frankfurt yesterday, Mr Paul Wieandt, chief executive since
early 1990 and architect of the bank's subsequent restructuring, said that
in the first five months of the year the parent bank's profits were DM48m,
DM23m up on the comparable period last year.
Mr Wieandt reiterated that a capital increase was likely next year or in
1994 and that the bank was considering raising a total of DM450m, partly to
meet tougher capital adequacy rules in Germany. It was likely also that the
bank's majority shareholders would have to contribute further capital to the
bank this year.
Provisions against doubtful sovereign debt rose by DM3.2bn at the end of
last year. Mr Wieandt did not say what the total provision was, but
indicated that some 20 out of a total of 32 countries accounted for the
total.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Cassoni: manager who made it on the world business stage -
Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vittorio Cassoni, former chief executive of Italy's Olivetti computers
and office equipment group and one of the most highly respected figures in
the world computer industry, died in Milan on Sunday of a brain tumour.
Although only 51, Mr Cassoni, who began his career at IBM in Italy,
progressed quickly through the industry, becoming in 1986 the head of the
computers division at AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant.
Mr Cassoni subsequently moved back to Olivetti, where he had formerly been
head of US operations, to become chief executive in 1988.
His ambitions for the company coincided with one of the most turbulent
periods in the information technology industry, when the problems of greater
competition and technological progress were soon felt on Olivetti's
earnings, and contributed indirectly to his departure from the group earlier
this year.
There followed a radical restructuring which meant the virtual disappearance
of the partly-overlapping divisions for product groups set up in 1989 by Mr
Cassoni when he became managing director. Mr Cassoni, who had undergone
surgery for cancer in 1991, moved to a new post heading the office equipment
activities of Xerox, the US computers and office equipment group, earlier
this year. However an unexpected bout of ill health obliged him to leave his
new position within a matter of days of arriving.
A tough but always fair boss, Mr Cassoni was one of only a handful of top
Italian managers to make an impact on the world business stage, a position
reinforced by his forthcoming manner and open attitude to the media.

FT  24 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo pricing worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SETBACK in Lasmo shares continued and the stock was the worst performer
in the Footsie list yesterday as rumours anticipated a change in the pricing
of the proposed International Public Offer of shares in the Ultramar
downstream interests.
The concern followed last week's unexpected withdrawal of the planned GPA
flotation.
Last week, dealers were expecting the Ultramar interests to be priced at
Dollars 19 to Dollars 22 a share, but by Monday, forecasts had been shaved
to Dollars 17 to Dollars 19. By yesterday afternoon, forecasts had been
reduced yet further, to around Dollars 15 a share. Last night, Goldman Sachs
in New York put the range at Dollars 15 to Dollars 17.
Lasmo plummeted 15 to 172p, its lowest level since December 1987. Turnover
was a heavy 5.6m shares. Since last Wednesday the stock has fallen 37p.
Abbey Nat'l shift
The recent slide in the Abbey National share price, triggered by broker
profits downgrades, was reversed yesterday after broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
was said to have shifted its position on the shares from 'hold' to 'buy'.
The stock rallied 7 to 274p on good turnover of 3.6m.
Dealers said UBS, whose research in the housing/building society areas is
highly respected by fund managers, had told its clients that Abbey's rating
now fully reflected the scale of bad debts but not the expected recovery of
inherently reliable earnings in 1993.
James Capel, the leading agency broker, last week chopped its current year
profits forecast for Abbey from Pounds 635m to Pounds 580m. UBS is said to
be predicting profits of Pounds 600m.
Bass upset
Bass slipped 4 to 598p on suggestions that there is growing overcapacity in
the UK beer market and on doubts about the benefit to the parent company
from Holiday Inns, its US hotels subsidiary. Lehman Brothers was negative
about Bass on both counts, saying that, as the largest brewer, Bass is
easily the most exposed to the UK market.
The US securities house said that after a recent visit to Foster's UK
brewing arm it believed Courage is capable of producing much more beer at
relatively little cost to itself.
Lehman is also concerned that Holiday Inns will not produce the benefits
hoped for, because only 13 per cent of its North American operation is owned
or managed, with the other 87 per cent franchised, and as such is likely to
be a much smaller beneficiary from any US economic upturn.
Threats of overcapacity in the UK brewing industry hurt several shares,
including Whitbread 'A', down 3 at 419p. Other drinks companies, with a
greater exposure to the international spirits trade, had a firmer tone.
Allied-Lyons gained 4 to 649p and Guinness 2 to 569p. Regional brewer
Mansfield Brewery remained in demand, rising 10 to 720p.
In a generally ragged oil and gas sector, British Petroleum came under fire
early in the session, apparently weakened by bearish forecasts issued by at
least two of the market's leading analysts of the sector, Kleinwort Benson
and BZW, although this was not confirmed.
BP retreated to 238p before stabilising and closing only a fraction off at
244p; turnover was 7.7m shares. Dealers expect more big downgrades of BP to
follow.
After receiving a battering on Monday, pharmaceutical shares bounced on a
mixture of technical factors and specific features.
Wellcome jumped 18 to 931p after stating that the US Food and Drug
Administration had approved the use of a Roche product to be used in
combination with Wellcome's Retrovir in the treatment of Aids.
Recovering all of the previous day's loss, Glaxo leaped 23 to 712p as the
market felt the threat from Sandoz's rival migraine treatment had been
overdone. SmithKline Beecham benefited from the positive sentiment,
advancing 24 to 884p.
A downgrading by Kleinwort Benson knocked Pearson, the publisher's shares
dipping 6 to 403p. The house lopped Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m respectively
off this and next year's profits forecasts, now at Pounds 165m and Pounds
185m.
Merchant banks were given a rough ride after a block of 420,000 shares in SG
Warburg were crossed some 20p below the then ruling market price. At the
close Warburg shares were 14 cheaper at 530p on turnover of 1.1m. Kleinwort
Benson was also under pressure, finishing 13 weaker at 291p.
Kingfisher, the Woolworth to B &amp; Q holding company, gave up 10 to 513p as
analysts took a cautious view of the stock. Smith New Court lowered its
profits forecast for 1992/93 by Pounds 10m to Pounds 230m, on the view that
second-half recovery might not meet expectations.
It was also suggested that SG Warburg Securities had cut its forecast by
Pounds 5m to Pounds 240m on falling margins at B &amp; Q.
High street retailer Burton was steady at 48 1/2 p after subsidiary
Redcastle made a Pounds 100m zero coupon issue, aimed at raising Pounds 60m
after expenses. The slide in Ratners continued with a penny decline to 8p,
nearly halving the company's stock market valuation since the beginning of
the month.
The recovery in Ladbroke shares continued as County NatWest reiterated its
positive stance, first made last week, and Kleinwort Benson marked it out as
a long-term buy. Ladbroke gained 7 to 219p.
The Kleinwort recommendation came in a comprehensive analysis of the gaming
and gambling market, which it reports as making an unexpectedly fast
recovery from the recession. The house also tips Rank Organisation, 6 to the
good at 669p.
Worries over a potential price war kept holiday group Airtours under a
cloud, in spite of reporting good interim figures. The shares slipped 3 to
266p, while rival Owners Abroad lost 2 to 75 1/2 p.
British Airways was in demand on hopes that the airline will benefit from
European deregulation. The stock moved ahead 7 to 274p in brisk trade of
5.3m.
Victaulic shares lost almost 10 per cent of their value after Hoare Govett
weighed in with a profits downgrading. They ended 37 down at 344p, the
second worst performing stock yesterday.
Nerves ahead of next Monday's results continued in British Steel, which
eased a penny to 69p.
The announcement of the departure of the company's chief executive sent ML
Holdings down 7 to 37p. Fenner firmed a penny to 81p as it was reported that
Wassall, steady at 175p, now holds a 1.6 per cent stake in the company.

FT  24 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Good recovery but volume still thin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER performances from both Tokyo and Wall Street found a warm response in
London yesterday, although the recovery in share prices was checked briefly
when the disclosure of continued high money supply in Germany undermined
prospects for interest rate cuts.
Trading volume in UK equities was disappointing, however, and a 10-point
rally in the FT-SE Index leaned heavily on strong performances among the
pharmaceutical stocks.
London was clearly pleased by the closing tone to the previous session on
Wall Street, where an initial loss of 30 on the Dow Average was reduced to
4.55, and also by the 185-point rally in the Nikkei Average. However, the
opening gain in London proved to be little more than a marking-up operation
by marketmakers, buttressed by a small trading programme. The advance in
share prices was soon trimmed.
There was some disappointment at the absence of follow-through support from
the institutions, and at the further selling of Lasmo on nervousness
regarding the impending sale of shares in the Ultramar interests in the US.
The news on German money supply unsettled London early in the session and
shares soon turned downwards. An initial rally of 13.7 on the Footsie had
been converted into a net decline of 10.7 by mid-morning.
The more heartening tone on Wall Street then began to show through in London
in the shape of gains in the blue chip international stocks. Pharmaceuticals
were to the fore, both Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham recovering some of their
recent losses.
ICI also came in for support as some investors took the view that the
setback which followed last week's meeting with analysts had been somewhat
overdone.
The strength of the blue chips helped market indices to move forward, and
sentiment was further encouraged by a firm opening to the new session on
Wall Street, where the Dow showed a gain of 12 1/2 points in UK trading
hours.
Although buyers were said to be cautious and willing to take only small
packets of stocks, the market extended its second upturn through most of the
afternoon. At its final reading of 2,560.6, the FT-SE Index was 10.3 ahead
on the day.
The nervousness provoked by withdrawal of the GPA share issue appeared to
settle. There were favourable reports on the underwriting of the planned
Telegraph share issue. Wellcome, also preparing to sell shares in the
market, gained ground.
Those market strategists who have maintained that the UK stock market is
attractive on valuation grounds at a Footsie level of around 2,550 expressed
further confidence following yesterday's performance. Mr Robin Aspinall at
Panmure Gordon commented that the Footsie might reach new highs, 'but not
until Wall Street can lend a hand'.
The weak factor in the market remained the lack of genuine investment
business. Seaq-reported volume was an unexciting 368.7m shares, compared
with 371.8m on Monday. Retail, or customer, business in equities has stayed
below the Pounds 1bn mark in recent sessions.

FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages mild rally on the
back of Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
AIDED BY a moderate recovery in Tokyo overnight, US prices managed a slight
improvement yesterday following their recent weak performance, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.82 at 3,285.62, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged ahead 0.64 to 404.04. The
American SE composite gained 1.12 to 376.74 and the Nasdaq composite put on
3.63 to 553.36.
Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 190.8m shares, with rises
outnumbering declines by 990 to 730.
Two factors were behind a positive opening: the upturn in Japanese share
prices which helped assuage fears of a sustained decline in worldwide equity
markets; and the resilience displayed by US stocks on Monday afternoon, when
late buying cut the Dow's initial loss of 30 points to just under five
points by the close.
The underlying tone of the market, however, remained weak due to concern
about how long it will take for corporate earnings to show signs of
significant improvement amid a worryingly slow economic recovery.
Merck fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 in turnover of 3.2m shares on
reports that some analysts believe the company could face problems in
marketing its new prostate drug, which only received approval from the US
Food and Drug Administration last Friday.
Goodyear advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 67 after shareholders of Goodyear
Canada voted against approving the merger of their company with a Goodyear
subsidiary, GCI Amalgamation. The offer, worth CDollars 48 a share, was
withdrawn following the vote.
Nacco Industries dropped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 after the company
warned that its net income for the second quarter would be 'well below' the
53 cents a share earned at the same stage a year ago.
Another company telling the market that its forthcoming quarterly earnings
would be down sharply from last year's level was the oil recycling and waste
management group International Recovery, which plunged Dollars 6 5/8 , or 35
per cent, to Dollars 12 3/8 in the wake of the management's warning.
Keithley Instruments, traded on the American Stock Exchange, weakened
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 11 1/2 following an announcement that it will
report a loss in the fiscal third quarter, and that the company was
'cautious' about the outlook for the rest of the year.
Pet Inc gained Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 15 3/8 after broker Wertheim Schroder
put the stock on its recommended list and advised that the specialist food
and confectionery company could be an attractive takeover target.
On the Nasdaq market, Vestar shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 11 1/4 in busy
trading after Liposome filed a lawsuit against Vestar alleging its Ambisome
product violated a Liposome patent. Liposome firmed Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 8
3/4 .

TORONTO stocks drifted off from midday gains to end flat after a dull
session. Traders said there was little corporate news or economic data to
sway the market. A heavy number of small-capitalisation 'cheap' shares
crowded the active list.
The TSE 300 index closed just 2.4 better at 3,343.0, while declines held a
small advantage over advances by 294 to 276 after volume of 24.3m shares
valued at CDollars 234.8m.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Sterling futures dip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LETHARGY dominated the UK money markets for the second day running, although
high German money growth figures injected a little life into sterling
futures.
Dealers said an increased realisation that there would be no swift cut in UK
interest rates was prompted by sterling's low position on the EMS grid and
hardened by the unexpectedly high figure for German money supply.
As a result, volumes on the sterling futures market returned to more
acceptable levels following Monday's dismal turnover of only 7,698 lots. The
September short sterling contract opened slightly lower at 90.24 and was
sold down to 90.16. It then rallied slightly to close 7 ticks down from
Monday's close at 90.18 on respectable turnover of 21,623 lots.
A trader commented: 'The German money supply figures were higher than
expected and knocked the futures market back, but it was a sign of the
market's bullishness that it was able to hold at the 90.17 level.'
Interbank rates were mainly steady throughout the day, with only the very
short-term rates showing any signs of life. The overnight interbank rate
touched 8 per cent at one point and the one-week rate slipped briefly below
10 per cent as shortage in the market was quickly taken out by the Bank of
England.
However, the more representative one to three-month rates remained within a
very tight range and closed virtually unchanged at around 10 1/16 per cent.
The Bank of England's initial forecast liquidity shortage was around Pounds
850m, down on recent days and less than half Monday's figure. It shifted
down to Pounds 700m later, the bulk of it representing exchequer
transactions. The Bank rolled over the shortage into next week by taking
Pounds 637m of short-term band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. It later
bought a further Pounds 50m of the same paper at the same rate.
In the French money markets, call money continued to be under upward
pressure from an income tax payment deadline that has drained bank balances,
and rose  1/16 to straddle 10 per cent, the level the Bank of France has set
as an informal ceiling in recent months. Three-month funds were unaltered at
10 1/16 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: DM steady on M3 growth news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS of higher than expected German monetary growth led to early strength in
the D-Mark and a slightly weaker dollar yesterday, writes Peter John.
However, currencies were trading within a very narrow range and were
principally controlled by technical factors.
The market had been hoping that Germany's M3, the measure of money that
includes cash savings and long-term deposits of up to four years, would show
an annualised growth of around 8.5 per cent.
Yesterday's strong May figure of 9 per cent, compared with April's 8.9 per
cent, meant growth remained well above the Bundesbank's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent
1992 target and dashed hopes of an imminent interest rate cut.
Nevertheless, Mr Mark Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank, remained
broadly optimistic. 'Money supply is not the only thing the Bundesbank looks
at,' he said. 'They are also keeping an eye on the level of unemployment and
the relatively slow industrial production growth and it seems likely that
there will be a cut, just later than anticipated.'
The D-Mark rose against most key currencies in early trading on a flurry of
buying. Then, a number of dealers found themselves unnecessarily long by the
afternoon and began to adjust their books. The German unit closed unchanged
against the dollar at DM1.566 and marginally softer against the pound at
DM2.917. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.5662.
The US currency was propped up by what one dealer called 'the increasingly
discounted drip feed of optimism from the Federal Reserve'. It closed steady
against the pound at Dollars 1.863
The market also concentrated on stronger signs from Japan's governing
Liberal Democratic Party of an impending boost in fiscal expansion, either
through increased spending on public works or via tax cuts. As a result the
yen was steady against the pound at Y237 and practically unchanged against
the dollar.
Dealers said sterling moved very much in line with the dollar and was likely
to edge lower in line with the US currency in the absence of fresh domestic
factors.
The lira, which had regained ground after a week-long battering on
international markets, gave the Bank of Italy enough room to let short-term
rates ease, but further falls depended on the political outlook, analysts
said.
At yesterday morning's repurchase tender, the minimum accepted rate fell to
14.15 per cent, down 65 basis points from the highs it touched last week as
fears of a devaluation swept the market. However, an Italian economist
commented: 'Do not expect repurchase rates to go far under 14 per cent for
the moment.'

FT  24 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: German issues fall on disappointing money
supply data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds fell steeply following the release of
worse-than-expected German money supply figures which dashed hopes of an
easing in German interest rates by the end of the year.
The M3 money supply rose 9 per cent in May on an annualised basis, up on
April's figure of 8.9 per cent and well above the market's expected range of
8.5 to 8.8 per cent.
The latest figures were seen as very disappointing, killing hopes of a
slowdown in German money supply growth. The Bundesbank's stated target range
for M3 growth is 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 88.01, plunged to a low of
87.63 on the news, before picking up to trade at around 87.67 by late
afternoon.
The German money supply figures also took their toll on some of the other
European bond markets, pushing down Dutch and French government debt prices.
Dealers said the fall in French government bonds was accentuated by reports
that the French referendum on ratifying the Maastricht Treaty could be
brought forward from September to July. On the Matif futures exchange in
Paris, the September bond futures contract closed at 107.06, down 0.16 from
Monday's close. The futures contract fell from its high of 107.34 to reach a
low of 106.82 after the release of the German money supply data.
UK government bond prices fell as the release of worse-than-expected German
money supply figures led to concern that German interest rates were likely
to remain high for some time and thereby reduce the chances of an easing of
UK interest rates.
Supply concerns also continued to trouble the gilt market before today's
auction, when the Bank of England plans to sell Pounds 2.75bn of the 9 per
cent Treasury stock due 2012.
Trading in the futures market was reasonably active, with a volume of 35,000
contracts. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.21 and slipped to
97.14 by late afternoon. In the cash market, long-dated issues fell more
than a quarter of a point with the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due
2003/07 falling from 115 15/16 to 115 19/32 , yielding 9.39 per cent.
US Treasury prices were little changed yesterday after the big afternoon
auction of two-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 101
25/32 , yielding 7.838 per cent. There was a similar slight negative bias at
the short end of the market, where the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100
7/32 , to carry a yield of 4.986 per cent.
Trading in the morning session was dominated by the manoeuvrings of dealers
before the sale of Dollars 15bn in two-year notes. Demand for the new paper
was not expected to be strong, which depressed prices at the short end.
Some traders had noted that two-year prices had been artificially buoyed in
recent days by expectations that stock markets worldwide were heading for a
substantial correction and the subsequent modest recovery in Tokyo and New
York equity markets meant the two-year auction might be beset by weak
demand. The sale of the two-year notes, however, passed with little fuss,
averaging a yield of 5.11 per cent amid solid retail demand.
JAPANESE government bonds drifted lower ahead of today's auction of 10-year
government debt, but traders said the market was well-supported by hopes of
an easing in interest rates. The benchmark No 129 issue opened with a yield
of 5.37 per cent and ended the day at 5.385 per cent, while the September
futures contract fell from its opening of 102.46 to close at 102.38.
Dealers expect the finance ministry will auction about Y800bn of 10-year
bonds today. The bonds issued at last month's auction carried a coupon of
5.6 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: SEC plans rules on proxy battles
and executive pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW rules making it easier for shareholders in US companies to challenge
management during proxy battles and forcing corporations to disclose more
information about executive pay, were proposed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission yesterday.
The proposals, unanimously approved by the SEC's four commissioners at a
meeting in Washington, are part of a campaign by the US watchdog to give
shareholders more say in the management of companies.
The new rules will not come into effect, however, until the SEC has received
comments from the public and corporations on its proposals.
On the proxy issue, the SEC's plan is to simplify the disclosure
requirements imposed on shareholders when they discuss in writing how they
might vote in an annual meeting. At present, a shareholder needs prior
approval from the SEC when communicating in writing with more than 10 other
shareholders.
Oral discussions between shareholders would be exempt from any type of
filing. The SEC also proposed that big shareholders should be allowed to
include a criticism of a company's performance in their proxy statements.
In the past, US corporations have been against the easing of proxy rules,
arguing that it would allow big institutions to organise opposition to
management in secret. The SEC first proposed altering its proxy rules in
June 1991, but was forced to tone down the substance of some of the changes
after receiving more than 900 comment letters, many of them hostile to the
proposals.
Mr Richard Breeden, the Commission's chairman, said yesterday that he would
like to see the changes take effect in time for the 1993 proxy season.
Under the new rules on executive pay, companies would be required to provide
shareholders with clear information on what executives are earning, laid out
in chart form rather than in pages of dense text.
Management would also be forced to show how pay relates to company
performance.
The United Shareholders Association, a Washington-based pressure group,
welcomed the new rules.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hewlett buys minicomputer unit
from Texas Instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-PACKARD is to acquire Texas Instruments' minicomputer business in a
bid to expand its customer base in the commercial Unix minicomputer market.
The companies said they have signed a letter of intent and expect to
complete the transaction this autumn.
Terms of the deal were not revealed. However, the annual revenues of the TI
business unit are said to be about Dollars 200m, according to industry
estimates. TI said the unit had operated profitably for the past two
quarters.
'This is the latest step in our strategy to aggressively expand our position
in the commercial Unix market,' said Mr Lewis Platt, H-P executive
vice-president.
H-P is the leader in the Unix minicomputer market. The acquisition will
enable H-P to accelerate sales in a slow growth market by tapping into TI's
base of 125,000 customers worldwide and gaining access to market segments
such as retail and wholesale distribution in which it has not previously
participated.
Also attractive to H-P is TI's network of value added resellers (VARs). TI
has traditionally sold its computer systems almost exclusively through VARs
that include leaders in vertical markets such as car dealerships, services,
and health care.
H-P said that there is very little overlap between its own customer base and
that of TI, so it expects the acquisition to provide incremental business.
The planned sale give Texas Instruments an opportunity to focus more sharply
on its key businesses.
The electronics and semiconductor manufacturer will, however, retain other
parts of its information technology group.
H-P said it will continue to support TI's minicomputer products and will
offer the products for as long as there is market demand. The company's
goal, however, is to gradually transfer TI's customers to H-P minicomputers.
The acquisition will lead to layoffs. H-P plans to employ approximately 450
of the 1,600 employees currently working for the TI computer systems and
services business unit.
Mr John White, TI vice-president and president of TI's information
technology group, said: 'The planned sales is consistent with TI's strategy
in information technology to concentrate our investment and emphasis on
software productivity tools, as well as on hardware where we have a
sustainable competitive advantage.'
Mr Bert Roberts, 49, was yesterday named chairman of MCI Communications, the
US long-distance carrier. Mr Roberts, who was named chief executive of the
company in December, succeeds Mr William McGowan, who died on June 8.

AMERICAN Airlines, the US carrier, said it will restore domestic fare levels
to its original 'value plan' pricing levels which were set on April 9 and
add another 4.4 per cent on to that figure to compensate for rising fuel
costs, Reuter reports from Dallas.
The new prices effective on all tickets, begin on July 7.
But American will not match 10 per cent fare rises announced by Northwest
Airlines and other carriers last week.

INVESTORS yesterday paid nearly HKDollars 30bn (USDollars 3.8bn) in their
rush to buy a slice of Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, a Taiwanese-controlled
manufacturer of sports shoes in southern China, writes Simon Holberton in
Hong Kong.
The Yue Yuen issue was for 550m shares of HKDollars 1.18 to raise HKDollars
649m. The company's advisers, Standard Chartered Asia, said the issue, for
25 per cent of the company, was 45.39 times oversubscribed.

BUOYANT advertising revenues in the second half helped Argus Holdings, South
Africa's largest media and publishing group, to record a 20 per cent
increase in earnings in the year to March.
Depressed economic conditions and continuing political uncertainty were
reflected in the modest turnover increase to R2.01bn from R1.81bn. A strong
emphasis on cost containment and maintaining margins, however, helped boost
trading income by 16.3 per cent to R194.5m.
Net income after tax was 18.5 per cent higher at R102m (Dollars 36m), while
equity accounted earnings were 18 per cent higher at R143.6m. Attributable
income rose by 23 per cent to R89.7m. Earnings per share were 20.3 per cent
higher at 213 cents.
CNA Gallo was hard hit by the increased pressure on consumer spending.
Earnings dropped by 4 per cent. Times Media did well to lift earnings by 32
per cent, while M-Net's earnings fell by 14 per cent.
The dividend was only 10 per cent higher at 55 cents per share.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Saudis to pay Dollars 3.95m for
UPI
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Press International (UPI), the embattled US news agency, will be sold
to the London-based Middle East Broadcasting Centre for Dollars 3.95m in
cash, a federal bankruptcy court judge ruled yesterday.
The Saudi-owned news network, which uses satellites to broadcast news to the
Middle East, said it was willing to inject up to Dollars 12m over the next
two years to make UPI viable and profitable.
Judge Francis Conrad said: 'Lord knows, in this economy, we need to keep as
many reporters alive and eating as we can.'
In accepting the Middle East Broadcasting offer, Judge Conrad rejected a
competing bid of Dollars 3.75m from Mr Leon Charney, a US property lawyer.
Mr Charney said he had been forced into a last-minute bidding war and said
he might appeal the decision, agency reports suggested.
During yesterday's bankruptcy court hearing to determine the fate of the
85-year-old news agency, all three potential rescuers increased their
offers.
The Rev Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who earlier this month
withdrew his Dollars 6m bid for UPI, raised his offer for some of the wire
service's assets, its name and access to its photo library to Dollars
900,000 from Dollars 500,000.
Middle East Broadcasting, which raised its bid from Dollars 3.5m, was the
early favourite of UPI creditors, who are owed about Dollars 60m. After the
decision Mr Dennis O'Dea, lead attorney for the creditors, said: 'The
proposal is the highest and best offer for the assets of UPI.'
Mr Charney, who initially offered to pay Dollars 3.6m in cash and equity for
UPI, increased his offer to Dollars 3.75m in cash and said he was willing to
match Middle East Broadcasting's infusion of funds to revive UPI.
