FT  01 MAY 92 / Management: When fine words will butter no parsnips - Lucy
Kellaway has some advice about talking in English to foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They can be spotted in expense account restaurants all over the world:
British businessmen shouting in English, while their dining companions sit
smiling and nodding in polite confusion. The British have never been good at
foreign languages; it seems they are not much better at speaking their own
to foreigners.
Complacent in the belief that anyone worth talking to can communicate in
English, and ignorant of what it is to struggle in a foreign language,
British managers make few concessions.
When faced with a floundering foreigner, they tend either to shout or to
speak very slowly. Both approaches can be downright insulting: foreigners
are not deaf and if they do not understand something, they will still fail
to grasp it delivered at a snail's pace. In extremis, the British adopt a
foreign accent, hoping that talking like Inspector Clouseau will make it
easier for a Frenchman to get the point.
It need not be like this. Companies know that poor communication can mean
lost business; many are realising that it is can be cheaper and quicker to
train staff to use their own language than to start teaching them new ones.
Cert*, a London-based training consultant, has been teaching executives
'foreigner-friendly English' for the last four years. Marianne Aston, the
architect of the course, says the main difficulty facing foreigners is not
that the British mumble or speak too quickly. It is more that the words they
use are too complicated and the grammar too convoluted. She argues that if
executives follow a few simple rules, communication will go a little more
smoothly.
VOCABULARY
This is the biggest stumbling block. Most British executives have no idea
how limited the vocabulary of a foreigner is likely to be. To pass the
equivalent of A-level exams in a language, you need about 2,000 words, while
a native speaker will use 10 times as many.
The secret is not to avoid the most complicated words but to make a point of
going for the very simplest. If you want to say that someone has a lot of
money, say they are rich. Don't say they are well-off, wealthy, loaded,
well-heeled, affluent or opulent.
Colloquial words should be treated with care: even people who speak no
English understand 'OK'; fewer are likely to be familiar with 'gobsmacked'.
IDIOMS
Some idioms will be comprehensible, and others not so. You need to pick and
choose carefully. For instance, a foreigner can probably understand 'We'll
cross that bridge when we come to it', but will almost certainly be
perplexed by 'a piece of cake'. If you tell them to 'pull their socks up',
they will probably reach under the table.
There are a few idioms that sound all right but are not: 'At the end of the
day', can cause an upset, as your audience will almost certainly take it to
mean you want something by 6pm.
GRAMMAR
Try to think in sentences that do not need punctuation. There should be one
idea expressed in each sentence and no sub-clauses.
Avoid all meaningless little filler noises, as these may convince the
foreigner that you are about to say something.
If you start saying 'Um', they may expect you to say umbrella. Many
languages do not have any such noises.
For example, in Scandinavia, if people have nothing to say, they are quiet.
Indeed, silence is helpful to foreigners as it gives them time to collect
their thoughts.
CULTURAL REFERENCES
Any reference specific to one culture should be avoided altogether. Don't
say to someone in Budapest: 'Doesn't he look like Terry Wogan'. Also, do not
talk about British qualifications, standards or brand names without
explanation.
FALSE-FRIENDS
Be careful with words which may mean something quite different in a foreign
language. If you tell a Spaniard that you are 'embarrassed', he is likely
conclude that you are pregnant.
UNDERSTANDING THE
FOREIGNER
The problem is not just making sure that the foreigner understands you.
There may be difficulties in the other direction.
Here, there are fewer short cuts because understanding someone with very
poor English is going to involve unpicking their particular accent. This
obviously varies according to where they are from.
For instance, when a Frenchman says 'ease', he may actually mean 'his'
'he's' or 'is'.
But if you do not understand, do not be critical. Make it seem that it is
you, not the foreigner, who is being slow.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Investment rules are being rewritten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK property industry is still firmly in the grip of one of the worst
recessions it has ever experienced. Yet, paradoxically, many experts think
that the case for buying property has rarely been better.
'Our forecasts suggest that 1992-93 may represent a classic purchasing
opportunity, with the benefit of hindsight,' says Jones Lang Wootton, the
chartered surveyor.
'Our expectation is that the worst is over,' says Mr Rupert Nabarro of
Investment Property Databank, a research group. 'There may be strong
arguments to support returning to the market.'
The nub of his argument is that yields for commercial property have never
stood so high, returns in other types of investment, such as gilts, are not
promising, and there is little competition from property companies or
foreign investors to bid up the prices for property.
However, institutions should beware of smugness, says Mr Nabarro. Most of
the good quality buildings that flooded the market during the boom period in
the mid-1980s are not in institutional hands. 'To maintain the quality of
your estates you will need these buildings,' he says.
A strong case for renewed property investment is also being made at a time
when the discipline of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System is provoking some hard thinking about the merits of gilts and
equities.
If high real interest rates are here to stay, profits may come under
pressure and fund managers could regret their heavy emphasis on equities.
But investors have to consider the possibility of a return to inflation (if,
say, the prospects for European monetary union collapsed and sterling was
devalued), in which case gilts would have difficulty in holding their own.
In such a scenario, property could be an attractive way of hedging
investors' bets. If inflation falls, the real value of income from property
will appreciate in value. If inflation rises, the impact will be mitigated
by higher growth in rents.
The problem with assessing these arguments is that it is extremely difficult
to generalise about the state of the market. The pain of the property
recession is still very unevenly spread.
The portfolios of institutional investors have 'extraordinary strength' says
IPD's Mr Nabarro: these portfolios boast secure leases, low vacancies and
include few developments in hand. By contrast, most of the quoted property
companies are over-borrowed and too focused on London. The state of many
private property developers - and the banks which lent to them - is even
worse.
At the same time, the property market has splintered into separate tiers
governed by location, quality of tenant and length of lease. The returns
measured by IPD for 1991 show the greatest contrasts since it began records,
ranging from -10.1 per cent for offices to +8 per cent for industrial
property.
The problem for the property industry is that new demand is concentrated on
top quality property which accounts for just 15 per cent of the total
market. Institutions are playing it safe and pursuing properties with long
leases and good covenants. The demand for this select group of property
outstrips supply; competition has already significantly driven up prices.
Outside this narrow band of property, enthusiasm is still weak. The mood of
property agents is very depressed. The prospects for the office market in
London and the south-east, which accounts for a high proportion of the total
market's value, are too poor to allow talk of any broadly-based recovery in
the property market.
Savills, the chartered surveyor, said this week that rents across the market
would not begin to rise until the end of 1994. That sent property shares
into a spin, even though Savills thinks that values have stabilised as a
result of some hardening in yields.
Total returns will reach 5 per cent this year, it believes. If rents have
stopped increasing, investors will get little comfort from the rise in
property yields to a level where they have converged with gilt yields.
Investors demand a premium of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent for property
to compensate for the disadvantages of management costs, illiquidity,
obsolescence and risk of default. Where rents are still falling and there is
no reason to expect yields to harden, the case for property is an
unconvincing one.
Another reminder of the fundamental problems of the sector was provided by
County NatWest, the merchant bank, this week in a report which raised doubts
about the willingness of overseas lenders to continue to support the market
in the face of severe domestic problems, particularly in the Japanese
market.
'At best, the negative effect may be restricted to an unwillingness to
refinance loans in the UK market; at worst, it may prompt the calling in of
existing loans and the liquidation of property assets, with dire
consequences for the UK (and global) property markets,' it said.
Leaving aside the huge variations in different parts of the market,
predictions about its future behaviour are a complicated matter. Not only
have changed expectations about inflation reduced the value of the market's
past behaviour as a guide to the future, but the market's past behaviour
often defied conventional wisdom.
The relationship of property yields to gilt yields and rental movements is
one example of this. Contrary to common belief in the business, there is
little correlation between property yields and rental movements, on the one
hand, or property yields and gilt movements, on the other, when the figures
for the past 20 years are examined.
'One of the greatest myths in the property sector is that property share
prices respond positively to changes in interest rates,' says Mr John Atkins
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house.
Similarly, there is no evidence that yields move in anticipation of changes
in rental values, he says.
'Indeed, property yields have often moved in exactly the opposite direction.
Increases in investment usually occur, for example, in response to, rather
than in anticipation of, periods of above average rental growth,' says UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
As yet, it is unclear what impact the growth of property research over the
past decade will have on investors' ability to anticipate periods of rental
growth.
The uncertainties facing the market do not end with the behaviour of
investors or expectations about inflation and growth. For example, the
question of whether tenants should continue to be responsible for leases
they have assigned is under review and could have profound implications for
the investment market.
Investors plunging into the market can also comfort themselves in the belief
that counter-cyclical investors win through in the long run. According to
research by Jones Lang Wootton, 'the best long-term returns have been
achieved by concentrating purchasing activity in periods when real estate
returns are declining and avoiding purchasing in periods when they are
peaking.'
But the real rewards of property investment undoubtably depend on an
examination of tenant, lease and sector. Extrapolating last year's results
may be hazardous. For instance, Savills believes that the recession has
caught up with industrial property, which will give way to retail property
as the industry's best performing sector.
Nonetheless, IPD believes that the lessons of 1991 may give an indication of
the running order as the sector pulls out of recession. Prime buildings,
strong tenants, the provinces, industrials and out-of-town property were all
'in' in 1991 while London was clearly 'out', it says. Anything that was old,
secondary, high yielding, facing a lease expiry or concerned with offices
should have carried a warning to tread carefully.
The rules of property investment are being rewritten, according to IPD.
'1991 may mark a new turning point in property investment,' it says.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Women's lack of independence linked to low pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of women achieving full economic independence has not increased
significantly in recent years even though more women now go out to work,
according to a report published today.
Much of the growth in women's paid work has been in part-time, low-paid jobs
often chosen to fit in with women's caring responsibilities, the research by
the Equal Opportunities Commission finds.
'In addition to this, women are finding that many of the part-time jobs
available offer fewer hours than they require and less employment
protection,' the commission says.
Overall, the percentage of women in employment rose from 58 per cent in 1973
to 68 per cent in 1990. The most marked increase in employment has been
among women with pre-school-age children: in 1973 27 per cent went out to
work, compared with 45 per cent in 1990.
The percentage of women with full-time jobs rose from 34 per cent to 38 per
cent over the period, while the percentage working part-time rose from 23
per cent to 29 per cent. Parallel with the increase in part-time working,
there has been a trend towards shorter part-time hours and increased
casualisation of part-time jobs, the commission reports.
Relatively low pay is still the norm for women, the study finds, although
there has been some narrowing of the gender pay gap in recent years.
Full-time women workers still earn, on average, 78 per cent of the hourly
rate earned by male full-timers.
Pay is particularly low among part-timers, with the gap between average
hourly pay of full-time and part-time workers widening over the past decade.
The study says the social security system reinforces inequalities by
favouring male employment patterns uninterrupted by breaks for
child-rearing. Social security payments often assume the man of the house is
the main breadwinner and he will share out the family income.
However, says the commission, 'in many households this sharing does not take
place and many women who are separated from their husbands actually feel
better off because at least they are in control of their own finances'.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Ford calls for more productive working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HAROLD POLING, chair-man of Ford Motor, said yesterday that the company's
British subsidiary had to narrow its productivity gap with continental
Europe. He implied that Ford might otherwise consider moving production out
of the UK.
Mr Poling, speaking at a press lunch in New York, added that Jaguar, the
loss-making British car manufacturer Ford bought for Pounds 1.5bn in 1989,
was expected to remain in the red this year but had ' a chance' of an
operating profit in 1993 if the UK economy made a sustained recovery.
Mr Poling was speaking the day after Ford reported that its European vehicle
operations made a net profit of Dollars 84m in the first quarter, compared
with a loss of Dollars 129m a year before.
Mr Poling said the UK results were 'very encouraging' given the general
decline in car sales. Nevertheless all Ford's UK factories suffered from
historic inefficiencies, including productivity rates and amount of time
worked.
'The productivity differences between the UK and the Continent must be
addressed,' Mr Poling added.
Ford was very pleased with the product qaulity, cost structure and
productivity at its much newer Spanish operations, he said. The company
hoped to be able to make the progress necessary to maintain its operations
in the UK. 'As long as we continue to make progress on a reasonable schedule
I think we'll continue to be patient.'
Mr Poling said British unions were 'starting to recognise that the
competition is intense, not only from other countries in industrial Europe
but also from the Japan transplants located there'.
He said Ford expected to see the required benefits of its Jaguar acquisition
in the later half of the decade.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Eggar hopeful over oil reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK oil reserves will last 'well into the next decade', Mr Tim Eggar, the new
energy minister, said yesterday, David Lascelles writes.
He also predicted that UK oil production would rise during the 1990s,
possibly achieving a record level of 130m tonnes in 1995. A peak of 127m
tonnes was reached in 1986, but last year it was only 91m tonnes.
In his first press conference since his appointment, Mr Eggar gave an upbeat
assessment of the outlook for UK oil and gas. Exploration was continuing at
a high level, and large discoveries continued.
The annual Brown Book of statistics on the oil and gas industry, published
yesterday, says the number of fields in production on the UK continental
shelf reached 100 last year and continued to rise during the early months of
this year.
Brown Book forecasts for petroleum production (m tonnes) are 1992, 85-105;
1993, 85-115; 1994, 95-130; 1995, 95-130; 1996, 90-130. Gas production is
also rising steadily, reaching 55.2bn cubic metres last year.
Mr Eggar hinted at further relaxation of restrictions on overseas trade in
gas.
He indicated that plans to privatise British Coal were likely to be unveiled
in the Queen's Speech next week.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Costing of work directive 'arbitrary'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S asser-tion that the European Community working-time
directive would initially cost industry Pounds 5bn is based on 'a fairly
arbitrary measure', according to a senior statistician at the Department of
Employment.
An internal memo produced at the department on the costing of the directive
admits that no allowance has been made for industries exempted from the
directive, such as transport.
It also predicts that employees currently working more than 48 hours a week,
the limit required by the directive, will successfully resist a
proportionate cut in earnings as their hours are reduced to comply.
'The overall offsetting cut in earnings (from phasing out working more than
48 hours a week) will not be more than half the cost of restricting working
hours,' says the memo.
The present cost to employers of staff working more than 48 hours a week is
Pounds 7bn a year. The Department of Employment seems to assume that the
costs of hiring new staff or paying for more overtime to accommodate the
reduction in the working week will be about the same.
But it then assumes a total cost of Pounds 3.5bn for this part of the
directive, based on the prediction that employees whose hours are being cut
will resist cuts in pay.
'There is not much evidence behind the assumption but we have had quite a
lot of discussion about it,' said Mr Bill Wells, a statistician at the
Department of Employment.
The only other significant cost to employers is given as Pounds 1.4bn from
introducing four weeks' annual paid leave, although that does not take
account of the three-year period of grace for introducing that measure.
Mr Wells points out that, cost arguments aside, UK employees register a high
level of satisfaction with their working-time arrangements.
He also says that the directive goes against the grain of annual
working-time agreements which allow employers to use their assets for longer
periods and allow employees large variations in the working week. About 6
per cent of UK employees currently have annual-hours agreements, and the
idea is also being taken up in some other EC countries, especially Italy and
Belgium.
Supporters of the directive argue that it could improve productivity if
employees are flexible enough. In the baking industry where hours average 54
a week, employers have said they would be happy to cut overtime if they
could open the main baking plants seven days a week.

THE UK subsidiary of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group, has been granted a

drug has previously been available in the UK only in an injectable form.
Glaxo did not say how much the oral form of the drug, which will be launched
in June, would cost. Imigran is one of three new Glaxo products described by
analysts as potential blockbusters, but its high price has caused
controversy. In other markets, it costs about Pounds 10 for each pill and
about Pounds 20 for every injection. Most migraine attacks require two pills
or injections.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Whitehall faces strike vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the NUCPS Civil Service union are to ballot their 110,000 members
on industrial action, including strikes, over a proposed radical shake-up of
Whitehall pay.
The government has offered a 4.45 per cent cost-of-living award, plus
performance-related pay and regrading said to be worth 0.3 per cent. Rules
governing Civil Service pay involve a minimum settlement of 4.5 per cent
this year.
The Treasury yesterday improved its offer from 4.1 per cent after the NUCPS
indicated it would reject it. Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary,
said: 'My national executive council is not prepared to sign an agreement
which signals the end of national bargaining and removes the expectation of
annual pay increments as of right.'
The CPSA union, which represents 125,000 civil servants in clerical grades,
is understood to be expecting a cost-of-living award of less than 4 per
cent, plus performance pay.
Earlier this year the two unions indicated that they would seek compensation
for changes in pay bargaining structures that are demanded by the Treasury.
The changes are aimed at extending performance-related pay and increasing
the scope for government departments to opt out of centralised pay
bargaining.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Vauxhall aims to raise output 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL, the UK sub-sidiary of General Motors of the US, is aiming to
increase its car production by about 18 per cent this year to a record
310,000 vehicles.
Mr William Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman and managing director, said that the
company's Luton, Bedfordshire, assembly plant had improved its productivity
by more than 60 per cent in the past four years.
Mr Ebbert said Vauxhall had closed the earlier competitive gap with GM's
continental European plants.
'We are competitive with the Continent,' he said. 'It is not an issue any
more. We are competitive on all measures of quality, productivity and cost.'
Vauxhall said it had become 'more optimistic' about the outlook for UK new
car sales for the remainder of 1992 and forecast that new registrations in
April - to be reported officially next week - would show the first
year-on-year rise for 30 months with an increase of between 3 and 5 per
cent.
New car sales for the full year were expected to rise by 6 per cent to 1.69m
from 1.59m last year, implying an accelerating rate of recovery in the
second half of the year following the 11.1 per cent year-on-year decline in
the first quarter.
Vauxhall said that its pre-tax profit last year fell by 44.5 per cent to
Pounds 132.6m from a record Pounds 239.1m in 1990 on a turnover which
declined marginally to Pounds 2.57bn from Pounds 2.62bn. In spite of the
decline it still achieved its fourth-best profit, however, in a year when
the UK new car market suffered its steepest year-on-year decline since 1974.
Vauxhall was easily the most profitable carmaker in the UK last year. Ford
of Britain, the UK market leader, plunged to a record loss last year of
Pounds 470m (on ordinary activities and excluding Jaguar), while Rover
suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 83m.
GM's Vauxhall operations have been transformed in recent years and have
played a significant role in the emergence of GM Europe (Opel in Continental
markets) as the most profitable volume carmaker in Europe.
In contrast to much of the UK motor industry Vauxhall avoided lay-offs and
short-time working last year, most importantly because of a big rise in
exports. Vauxhall embarked in 1990 on its first significant export programme
for more than 15 years, and last year its exports rose to 104,390 cars and
car-derived vans from 29,523 in 1990.
Exports this year are forecast to fall to 84,000, but this would be
compensated by higher UK sales. Vauxhall forecast an increase in its UK
new-car market share to close to 17 per cent from 15.6 per cent last year.
The company expects to begin volume production at its new Pounds 190m V6
engine plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, late this year with pilot
production due to begin this month.
Including the engine plant, Vauxhall will have invested Pounds 375m at
Ellesmere Port since the end of 1989. It has invested Pounds 650m in the
past decade in improving and re-equipping its plants.
Vauxhall paid a dividend of Pounds 116m to its loss-making GM parent company
last year, bringing the total dividends paid to Detroit to Pounds 495m in
the past three years. Before 1989 Vauxhall had not paid a dividend to the US
for more than 20 years after decades of losses.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Contact lens industry probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the cost of contact
lens solutions following complaints, Jane Fuller writes.
The Office of Fair Trading referred the matter to the MMC yesterday on price
and competition issues after a preliminary investigation of the Pounds 40m
UK market for contact lens solutions was triggered by complaints from the
public.
The OFT said suppliers of contact lens solutions 'may be enjoying high rates
of return, suggesting that price competition in this market is not as
effective as it might be'.
It said the leading suppliers - Allergan UK, part of a US group, and Ciba
Vision UK, a subsidiary of Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland - might each have 25
per cent of the market.
A report published last September in Which?, the Consumers' Association
magazine, suggested that while a pair of contact lenses might cost about
Pounds 110, the annual bill for lens-care products could be Pounds 123 to
Pounds 197 for soft lenses and Pounds 89 to Pounds 147 for the gas-permeable
type.
According to the Association of Contact Lens Manufacturers, more than 1.5m
people in the UK wear contact lenses, representing about 5 per cent of those
who need some form of correction to their eyesight.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Lloyd's Names may win help to ease losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday announced that it is considering measures to
help Names hit by recent losses and said that the first moves to introduce
reforms recommended earlier this year by the Rowland task force had been
taken.
Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, said the Council, the insurance market's
governing body, had 'discussed in broad outline' the possibility of
providing a measure of financial assistance to Names facing severe
underwriting losses.
Several hundred Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at
Lloyd's - face acute financial problems as a result of losses run up by
catastrophe reinsurance syndicates in 1989 and 1990.
Mr Lord said: 'Much further work is required on this complex matter before
we can establish the feasibility of any scheme in detail. The whole question
is being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.' He added, however, that a
'successful outcome' could not be guaranteed.
Names would be consulted 'in the normal way', added Mr Lord, who said a
ballot or referendum of the membership of Lloyd's was possible.
Mr Lord also said Lloyd's was making 'considerable progress' on implementing
recommendations relating to Mapas - the unit-trust-type arrangements which
allow Names to spread their participation in syndicates more widely across
the market and reduce risk - as suggested by the Rowland task force when it
reported in January.
Lloyd's is understood to be negotiating with regulatory and tax authorities
about the impact of these changes.
The council has agreed to implement a change to the agency agreement, which
governs the relationship between Names and their agents.
The modified agency agreement includes a new 'deficit clause' which allows
Names to offset the profit commission paid to agents against losses made in
the previous two years, rather than one year as at present.
Another aspect of the scheme would eventually allow for compulsory
arbitration of all disputes between Names and their agents.

FT  01 MAY 92 / ASB will not include revenue investment activities in
financial reporting standard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSED requirement for companies to list their spending on items such as
advertising and training has been dropped from the forthcoming accounting
standard on the profit and loss account, it emerged yesterday.
The Accounting Standards Board said it would not include so-called revenue
investment activities in its second financial reporting standard, due in the
autumn.
Revenue investment is designed to show expenditure charged to the profit and
loss account incurred to enhance profits. It includes spending on research
and development, and big maintenance and refurbishment projects.
The withdrawal comes after widespread condemnation of the proposal from
companies which claimed that spending on these items was difficult to
identify and that disclosure would threaten their competitive position.
But there was also a noticeable absence of support for the idea from users
of accounts during the consultation period on the standard. 'We flew a kite,
but no one seemed to want revenue investment,' said Mr David Tweedie, board
chairman.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Touche attacks ICAEW audit role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS, the account-ancy firm, launched an outspoken attack on its
professional body yesterday by calling for regulation of auditors to be
shifted to an independent organisation.
Mr Roger Stafford, the new chairman of the board of partners at the firm,
said supervision of auditors should be wrested from the control of Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
'We take a strong line that audit regulation should be independent,' he
said. 'I don't think it can be done any other way. It ought to be divorced
from the institute and separated for the sake of public confidence.'
His comments represent a rare public attack on the institute, in which a
number of Touche partners hold senior positions. But they are consistent
with the firm's statements over the past few years.
In an article published last week in the firm's annual review, Mr John
Roques, managing partner, calls for a single independent body to supervise
accounting and auditing to be established rapidly.
He says he supports audit regulation by the institute only 'as an interim
measure', and argues that greater independence is required to increase
public confidence and improve efficiency.
The views echo recent growing criticism from accountants and politicians
that there is tension between the institute's roles as a trade association
and a body required to uphold professional standards in the public interest.
The institute is responsible for the regulation of auditors under a
framework of self-regulation established late last year under Mr John
Redwood, then minister for corporate affairs. All accountants wanting to
perform mandatory audits on British companies must now be registered with
the institute, and are subject to inspection by a network of staff around
the country.
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, chief executive of the institute, said last night: 'We
believe we have a mandate from parliament and our members to regulate
auditing. Regulation is a natural extension of the role we have always
fulfilled.'
He said any assessment of the effectiveness of the institute's audit
regulation processes should await a full evaluation to be submitted to the
DTI in 1993.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Cabinet sets emissions timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday set a new timetable for reducing the UK's emissions
of greenhouse gases. It declared its aim of reducing emissions of carbon
dioxide to 1990 levels by the year 2000, rather 2005, the previous target.
The cabinet said the new target was demanding and it would press ahead with
reducing emissions on condition that other countries take similar action.
'It is hoped that all industrialised countries can make a similar commitment
at the final session of the Climate Change Convention negotiations currently
taking place in New York.' the statement said.
However environmental groups were quick to point out that, without specific
policies, targets to reduce emissions are meaningless.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said: 'In 1990 the government said it would take 15 years to
stabilise emissions. But since then, carbon dioxide emissions in the UK have
risen by 2 per cent even while GDP has fallen. Investment in energy
conservation has dropped by 28 per cent.'
Meanwhile, the cross-party House of Lords European Communities committee has
urged the government to oppose the carbon/energy tax proposed by the
European Commission.
In a report published today, the committee argues that the proposed tax  -
initially Dollars 3 per barrel of oil equivalent in 1993 and rising by
Dollars 1 a year to a maximum of Dollars 10 by 2000 - would encourage
switching to natural gas and nuclear energy at the expense of coal and oil.
While it did not rule out the use of fiscal instruments to limit emissions
of carbon dioxide, the committee stressed the proposed tax was 'a unilateral
response to a global problem'.
Compliance with a government proposal to speed up reduction of carbon
dioxide emissions is likely to increase costs for both the motor industry
and motorists, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said
yesterday.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Labour warns local authorities facing budget disruptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities face having their budgets disrupted by new
government-imposed curbs on spending in the current financial year, Mr Bryan
Gould, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
Liberal Democrat leaders also sought to make the financial straitjacket
imposed on councils a central issue in next Thursday's elections.
Mr Gould stressed that Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was
more committed to 'capping' the expenditure of local authorities than any of
his predecessors.
He said some councils would be subjected to 50 per cent cuts if they had to
rein back their expenditure to the standard spending assessment invented by
Mr Howard in his earlier period of office at the department of environment.
Underlining the disruptive effect of cuts imposed at the current stage of
the financial year, Mr Gould said some councils would have to resort to
'drastic surgery'.
He suggested that Basildon, where Labour's failure to win the parliamentary
seat signalled its general election defeat, would have to cut expenditure by
a half.
Mr Simon Hughes, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, called on
the government to include a clear commitment to the principle of independent
local democracy 'able to raise taxation' in the Queen's Speech opening the
first session of the new parliament on Wednesday.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Major to act on 'open government'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major has signalled his intention to push ahead quickly with
measures to open the Whitehall machine to greater scrutiny following his
general election promise to promote more open government.
As the cabinet yesterday approved its legislative programme for the Queen's
Speech next week, colleagues said the prime minister was determined to
remove some of the secrecy which surrounds ministerial decision-making.
Among the measures will be publication for the first time of the
responsibilities and membership of cabinet committees which make many
important government decisions.
Civil servants have also been asked to update and publish the 'guidance for
ministers' which sets out rules to prevent conflicts between ministers'
private interests and public responsibilities.
Mr Major remains opposed to any formal legislation on freedom of
information, but has indicated that much unnecessary secrecy can be
dispensed with without complicated legislation.
In spite of opposition from the cabinet office, the prime minister is
expected to press ahead with a relaxation of the procedures under which many
government papers remain secret well beyond the traditional 30-year rule.
He has also called for the abolition of many of the 80 or so statutory
restrictions which apply to the disclosure of information to the public or
press.
The cabinet's deliberations on the Queen's Speech ended with the endorsement
of a programme which Downing Street said would emphasise the new
government's commitment to 'choice, opportunity and freedom'.
As well as the legislation to implement the Maastricht treaty - which Mr
Major wants to get through the Commons by July - and a new finance bill to
put the remainder of the Budget into law, it will foreshadow about a dozen
other bills.
Prominent among them will be measures to pave the way for the privatisation
of British Coal and British Rail, to impose further restrictions on trade
unions, to implement plans for a national lottery, and to tighten the rules
on asylum-seekers.
There will also be a leasehold reform bill, legislation to set up a
nationwide rents-into-mortgages scheme and a measure to establish the Urban
Regeneration Agency to oversee the government's inner cities programme.
Among other possible measures in a parliamentary session due to last until
October 1993 are a bill to reduce the threshold for the Post Office's letter
monopoly and a significant criminal justice bill to respond to the
recommendations of the Royal Commission on miscarriages of justice.
Ministers will also consider legislation to privatise the Northern Ireland
electricity industry and to strengthen the protection available to consumers
who are misled by the descriptions of goods offered for sale.
Sir Terence Higgins, a senior Conservative backbench MP, has called on the
government to use its influence to ensure that the main parliamentary select
committees are re-established quickly.
There have been reports at Westminster that bargaining between the
Conservatives and Labour over the composition of the committees could delay
their formation until the autumn.
Sir Terence is pressing for a commitment that they will be set up within 30
working days of the Queen's Speech.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Borrie urges end to CPS restriction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bar's attempts to defend its 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher
courts suffered a setback yesterday when Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general
of fair trading, said that a restriction on barristers employed by the Crown
Prosecution Service appearing as advocates in the Crown Court was
anti-competitive and should be removed.
In his advice to the lord chancellor on wider rights of audience for
barristers in the employed sector, Sir Gordon says a rule in the Bar's Code
of Conduct 'has the effect of significantly restricting competition for
supplying the Crown with prosecution advocacy services in the higher
courts.'
There was no case on competition grounds for retaining the restriction on
CPS barristers, 'even on the extreme assumption of all prosecution work
being undertaken in the employed sector,' he said.
The rule also had an anti-competitive effect on advocacy in the civil courts
by preventing barristers who work in central and local government and in
commerce, finance and industry from representing their employers in the
higher courts, but the effect was not significant, he said.
Sir Gordon's view is only one of those which must be considered by the lord
chancellor before he makes his mind up about who should be able to present
cases in the higher courts, but his advice is bound to carry some weight
with a government committed to competition and to stamping out restrictive
practices.
The Bar played down the significance of Sir Gordon's advice. Mr Gareth
Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, said Sir Gordon had been 'judging the
restriction strictly against competition criteria which is a very small part
of the argument and by no means the most important'.
The CPS said yesterday it was delighted by Sir Gordon's recommendation.
'This adds further weight to our argument that the continued denial of
rights of audience in the higher courts for Crown Prosecutors is
unacceptable,' it said. The Law Society also welcomed the advice. 'The same
arguments must clearly apply to employed solicitors,' Mr Philip Ely, society
president, said.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Five deny insider dealing charges: Biggest British
prosecution sees 'network of friends' accused of knowingly misusing
information on bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'NETWORK of friends' employed by financial institutions used
price-sensitive inside information about imminent takeover bids to make
profits for themselves or clients, it was alleged at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
In the case, the biggest UK insider dealing prosecution, five people deny
charges under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act.
Mr David Gray, a former broker with Morgan Grenfell Securities, faces two
charges of unlawfully communicating unpublished price-sensitive information
to another person, two of dealing on the basis of such information and one
of counselling or procuring another person to deal.
Mr William Liggins, a former Lazards fund manager, is accused of two
offences of dealing and one of communicating.
Miss Catherine Rowlands, who was employed in the corporate finance
department at Samuel Montagu, is charged with three offences of
communicating information. Mr Mark Riding, former fund manager with the
Co-operative Insurance Society in Manchester, faces three dealing charges.
Mr Keith Tondeur, formerly UK head of principal trading and sales with
Banque Paribas, faces one dealing charge.
The alleged offences relate to three takeover bids in 1988. Hawthorn Leslie
Group, the USM-quoted cellular phone company, acquired ECT Cellular and
London Car Telephones; Australian company Goodman Fielder Wattie made a bid,
which lapsed, for UK foods group Ranks Hovis McDougall; and Mecca Leisure
acquired Pleasurama, the leisure group.
Mr Peter Clarke, prosecuting for the Department of Trade and Industry, said
some of the defendants had passed information to others, who had acted on it
by dealing in shares or by passing it on and advising other people to deal.
Profits had ranged from just Pounds 1,200 to Pounds 20,000, but the case
concerned a principle about the use of inside information.
Mr Clarke said the jury would hear several hours of recorded telephone
conversations between Mr Gray and other defendants peppered with references
to being unable to talk freely, or arrangements to see or speak to each
other out of office hours.
Mr Clarke said the five's motives had included personal greed, winning the
respect of others, repaying favours and enhancing their own reputations. But
whatever their motives, 'the fact is that it was illegal and they all knew
it'.
That was shown by the telephone conversations. The speed with which some
defendants acted after receiving information showed their knowledge of the
impropriety of what they were doing.
Mr Clarke said Mr Gray and Mr Liggins would be heard on the tapes discussing
what they had heard from an account director with Binns Cornwall, a
financial public relations company retained by Hawthorn Leslie for its bids.
Miss Rowlands had been the source of the inside information about RHM and
Pleasurama, Mr Clarke alleged. Samuel Montagu had been GFW's main adviser
and Mr Gray would be heard on the tapes referring to 'Wickets', Samuel
Montagu's codename for GFW, in a conversation with Miss Rowlands. Samuel
Montagu had also acted for Mecca. Miss Rowlands had not been part of that
team but had learned of the pending deal from a colleague who had warned her
not to buy Pleasurama shares, Mr Clarke said.
The trial continues today.

FT  01 MAY 92 / How green is my valley (now): A garden festival will open
today on a former steelworks site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL be 'the major holiday attraction in Britain this year'. So says Mr
Philip Weekes of the Ebbw Vale garden festival, which starts today.
Mr Weekes, a former regional director of the National Coal Board, is
chairman of the festival in the former steel town where Gwent edges into the
Brecon Beacons. He says the event will help to show that what was once a
coal and steel centre can now sustain a quite different sort of life.
Ebbw Vale will be the last in the series of five big garden festivals held
after an experiment launched a decade ago in Liverpool's docklands by Mr
Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary.
About a third of the Pounds 60m cost of mounting the festival on land which
was once the home of a steelworks has been met by the Welsh Development
Agency for reclaiming wasteland. While British Steel still has a rolling
mill nearby the days of industrialisation have long gone.
However, Ebbw Vale's location is likely to work against it. By the time it
closes on October 4, the number of visitors is likely to be far short of the
3m-plus that visited each of the previous festivals in Liverpool,
Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, Glasgow and Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear. It may
be lucky to attract even 2m visitors because access is extremely poor. There
is no passenger railway link, and Ebbw Vale lies some 20 miles north of the
M4 along a narrow road. On days when more than 30,000 visitors are expected,
long traffic delays are likely.
The festival is likely to encounter the same difficulties in covering its
costs as the previous four festivals. Mr Weekes admits that raising
sponsorship has been 'difficult'. Local corporations such as Hoover, Welsh
Water, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and the development agency as
well as national groups such as British Steel and British Coal all have
pavilions or have contributed in other ways. But the festival management
would have liked more. This will also be the festival in which the
horticulture industry has played the smallest part. The organisers boast of
300,000 trees and 450,000 shrubs, but this is essentially a garden festival
without any significant contribution from the gardening industry.
Garden festivals originated in Germany after the Second World War and were
adopted by Mr Michael Heseltine after the 1981 riots in Liverpool as a way
of helping run-down industrial areas.
The success of garden festivals is measured by the long-term impact on the
area in terms of investment, image building and job creation as well as
numbers of visitors.
The Stoke-on-Trent festival, held on the site of the former Shelton
steelworks, attracted 3.5m visitors and managed to win a record Pounds 130m
of investment after the festival. Of the four festivals held so far, Glasgow
has been the most successful in terms of numbers, with more than 4m
visitors. But the long-term benefits there totalled only Pounds 85m.
Considering the after-use value of the Liverpool festival, the Department of
the Environment says: 'In net additional terms, (the) benefits are very
small'. Gateshead has yet to be evaluated.
Wales has been remarkably successful in attracting inward investment and it
is hoped big companies will come to the area as a result of the festival.
More than Pounds 50m of investment in offices, houses, shops, leisure
facilities and small industrial plants is expected, with up to 1,100 jobs
eventually being created. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, who has
enthusiastically backed the festival, says confidently: 'This will be the
best of the five. The Welsh Development Agency has already built 20,000 sq
ft of space and these will be available immediately after the last visitor
has left.'
Neither Liverpool nor Stoke-on-Trent covered the costs of staging their
garden festivals, but Mr Weekes and his team are convinced they can do
better.
'This will be the most exciting of the festivals,' he says. 'And when it is
all over we shall leave behind not just something of benefit to the
community but also a new view of Wales in the minds of those who have
visited us.'

FT  01 MAY 92 / Ex-Lotus chief helped steal Dollars 17m: De Lorean project
fraud admitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Group Lotus chairman Mr Fred Bushell yesterday admitted taking part
in a Dollars 17.65m conspiracy to defraud De Lorean Motor Cars, the Belfast
sports car venture which collapsed spectacularly 10 years ago after nearly
Pounds 78m of UK government funding had been invested in it.
The guilty plea at Belfast Crown Court came as the government and Cork
Gully, receivers for what was possibly the most humiliating project ever
funded by UK taxpayers, intensified their efforts to recover some of the
government's investment in the abortive development of the stainless steel
sports car.
So far, just under Pounds 14m has been recovered. However, Mr Christopher
Hughes, the principal receiver, said yesterday that he expected further
'substantial' sums to be recovered.
This is apart from legal action being taken by the UK government in the US
against Arthur Andersen, the De Lorean auditors.
The government is suing for Pounds 240m, claiming that the accountancy firm
should have been aware of mismanagement, misinformation and misappropriation
of funds.
In another twist Arthur Andersen has called Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the
former prime minister, as a witness in its efforts to prove government
incompetence in assessing and monitoring the project.
The decision to invest Pounds 53m in the project was made by the Labour
government in 1978. Top-up funds continued to be provided after the Tory
election victory of 1979, mainly because of the 2,000 jobs at stake in one
of the UK's most depressed regions.
Mr Bushell, 64, yesterday admitted conspiring with the late Colin Chapman,
founder of Lotus, and Mr John De Lorean to defraud the venture in west
Belfast of funds originally intended to pay Group Lotus, now owned by
General Motors, for developing the car.
The money was never received by Lotus. Instead, according to evidence given
by Sir Kenneth Cork, the first De Lorean receiver, the money 'went
walkabout'.
Mr Bushell will be sentenced in six weeks and was freed on continuing bail
of Pounds 50,000. He has been on bail since July 1989, when he was first
accused of the conspiracy.
Mr De Lorean was not in the dock with Mr Bushell because he is in the US and
cannot be extradited. The offences took place between 1978 and 1982 and the
time in which Mr De Lorean could have been extradited expired in 1988,
shortly before the Serious Fraud Office was set up. However Mr De Lorean,
the founder and chairman of De Lorean Motor, is still wanted by the SFO.
Yesterday Mr Desmond Boal QC, defending, said Mr Bushell realised the
consequences of his plea but needed time to put in order certain matters
which could be in the public interest.
Mr Bushell spoke only twice during the hearing - first when he was asked if
the court clerk could repeat his name, and then to admit his guilt. A second
charge against him of obtaining Dollars 5.15m by deception was not proceeded
with.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Oracle outbid for teletext licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORACLE, the teletext company owned by the ITV franchise holders, has been
ousted by an outsider, Teletext UK, in the bidding for a new licence.
The Independent Television Commission announced yesterday that Teletext UK -
whose shareholders are Associated Newspapers, Philips Electronics and Media
Ventures International, a media investment fund - won with a bid of Pounds
8.206m a year in 1993 prices for the 10-year licence.
As well as a national and regional service the company plans to provide
local news, business and sports information for 15 cities on teletext -
information broadcast in spare lines of the television picture. The service
will be called Teleview.
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, and Philips
Electronics, a pioneer of teletext technology, each hold 45 per cent of the
ven-ture, with Media Ventures owning the final 10 per cent.
The consortium also plans to offer a wide range of feature material. The
Press Association, the national news agency, will provide the news for the
service.
The competitive tenders were a small-scale replay of last year's bids for
ITV licences, with the franchise going to the highest bidder after a quality
threshold had been met. In addition to the cash bid, the winning consortium
has to pay 2 per cent of qualifying revenue for the first three years and 8
per cent for the remaining seven years.
Oracle Teletext came second with a bid of Pounds 6.676m. Other bidders were
TV-am Cable Television, Carlton Communications, and a consortium put
together by Independent Television News.
The ITC awarded an additional commercial licence for business users to Data
Broadcasting International. The company was the only applicant and bid
Pounds 25,000 a year.

FT  01 MAY 92 / MPs query Skillcentre disposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DEPARTMENT of Employment officials had warned ministers that the sale of
four Skillcentres to an organisation which subsequently went into
liquidation would be risky, according to a report published yesterday by the
Commons Public Accounts Committee.
The committee said the ministers had decided to go ahead 'in the light of
their objectives for the privatisation'.
The committee investigated the department's management of the sell-off of 60
Skillcentres. In May 1990 it completed the sale of 51 Skillcentres on terms
which required them to pay the purchasers Pounds 13.6m.
Sales to three organisations were controversial, particularly the sale of
four centres to TICC, a private company, for Pounds 2.1m. Employees made
redundant were told that their employer could not finance their redundancy
provisions.
The MPs said Deloitte Corporate Finance had made careful enquiries for the
department before the sale to TICC. Officials had warned ministers that the
sale would be the most risky because the company 'had no track record'.

<TEXT>
HOPES that the economy might be recovering from recession were raised
yesterday by an indication that manufacturing output grew for the third
successive month in April.
The purchasing managers index, which measures demand trends among big
corporate and public-sector buyers, rose to 55.1 per cent last month, from
54.1 per cent in March. It was the highest level since the survey began in
July.
'This latest rise suggests strongly that significant growth is under way in
the manufacturing sector of British industry,' said the Institute of
Purchasing and Supply, which carries out the survey.
Earlier this month, the Central Statistical Office released figures showing
that manufacturing output increased by 1.1 per cent in February.
The survey, which covers 250 purchasing managers responsible for Pounds
250bn of corporate money each year, found that the new-orders index fell
slightly last month, although it remained above the 50 per cent level. The
prices index rose on the month.

<TEXT>
BRITISH businesses are ignoring great opportunities in the 'golden triangle'
of Hong Kong, Taiwan and south China, according to a British MPs' report.
Taiwan offered even more opportunities for foreign contractors than Hong
Kong's second airport project which had aroused considerable interest among
UK contractors.
Taiwan's six-year plan to improve its infrastructure was worth 25 times as
much as the airport project, the report said. The report is by the UK
parliamentary select committee on trade and industry, chaired by Mr Kenneth
Warren, former MP for Hastings and Rye.
Mr Warren described the region as the 'largest building site in the world'.
The report is optimistic about the future of Hong Kong after it reverts to
Chinese control in 1997. Britain tended to see 1997 as the end of an era,
whereas other Europeans saw it as the start of an era in which Hong Kong
would be the best place in China to do business, said Lord Young, chairman
of Cable &amp; Wireless and subsidiary Hong Kong Telecom, who gave evidence.
The Hong Kong authority responsible for building and operating the colony's
new airport has been given provisional authority to borrow HKDollars 23.3bn
(Pounds 1.67bn) to help finance the construction of the airport, though it
will take months before it is ready to approach the world's capital markets,
writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The authority said it would be seeking
the longest-term financing that was available from the market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commerce Department yesterday reported a smaller rise than expected in
its index of leading indicators in March, a further sign that the pace of
economic recovery is likely to be modest.
The index - used to forecast turning points in the economy - rose only 0.2
per cent following more robust increases of 0.8 per cent and 1.0 per cent in
February and January respectively. Only four out of 11 indicators
contributed to the increase in the leading index in March.
The department's index of coincident indicators, which measures the current
state of the economy, was unchanged in March following a 0.5 per cent
increase in February.
A rise in consumer confidence was the most important of the four indicators
contributing to the rise in the leading index. Declines in the real money
supply and building permits were the most important of six negative
indicators.
One indicator, the average work week, was unchanged.
The unbroken run of three consecutive monthly increases in the leading index
was the first since last summer. However, this provides no guarantee of a
sustained recovery. Last year the index rose steadily from February to July,
offering little warning of the economy's slowdown in the autumn.

The Airbus supervisory board is holding an extraordinary meeting in
Frankfurt today to consider giving the four-nation European aircraft
consortium the go-ahead to start marketing to potential airline customers a
new narrow-body 124-seat airliner, the A319, writes Paul Betts.
The new aircraft would be a shorter derivative of the 150-seat twin-engine
A320 and would cost around Dollars 300m (Pounds 169.4m) to develop,
according to Airbus. It would complement the consortium's range of
narrow-body aircraft by introducing a third model in the A320 family which
already includes a larger stretched derivative, the A321.

FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: EC-US near accord on cutting jet subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE and the US appear close to ratifying the tentative agreement reached
last month to reduce government support for new commercial airliner
programmes.
Mr Ray Waldman, director of government affairs at Boeing, said all the
remaining issues which have held up ratification were expected to be
resolved during 'the next few days'.
The accord, which limits direct government development support for new
aircraft programmes to 33 per cent of their total development costs, had
been held up by disagreement over limits on indirect government support for
commercial airliner projects from military programmes and other sources.
However, the US and the four European government partners in the Airbus
consortium (France, Germany, Britain and Spain), appear to have reached a
compromise to fix a limit on indirect supports.
Airbus said yesterday the agreement envisaged a ceiling of 4 per cent of a
company's total annual turnover.
Boeing described the EC-US aircraft subsidy agreement as a 'good trade-off',
although the company, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets,
would have preferred a complete ban on government development subsidies. Mr
Frank Shrontz, Boeing chairman, said the agreement 'will go a significant
way to putting discipline in the market place'. But he added Boeing's
long-term aim was 'zero subsidies and zero government involvement' in
commercial programmes.
Boeing is now increasingly concerned by Taiwan Aerospace's proposal to
acquire a substantial equity stake in the commercial aircraft operations of
McDonnell Douglas, its main US competitor. Taiwan Aerospace is considering
buying up to 40 per cent of the Douglas commercial aircraft subsidiary for
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) and co-operating with Douglas in the development
of the MD12, a four-engine 400-600 seater jumbo which will challenge
Boeing's dominance of the large airliner market.
'If the Taiwan deal happens, I hope the next Douglas product will not be
another subsidised programme,' Mr Shrontz said.
Boeing has already formally expressed its concern to the US government about
the potential emergence of a what it calls an 'Asian Airbus'.
Mr Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice-president for planning, told a US
Congressional committee that the proposed Taiwan-Douglas deal raised serious
questions because Taiwan was not presently bound by the Gatt and OECD
agreements. Mr Waldman said it was clear the Taiwan government had an
aerospace programme to encourage Taiwan Aerospace and other parts of the
Taiwan industrial community to enter the business through government funds,
soft loans, tax breaks, the construction of a government sponsored
industrial park, and 'all sorts of gimmicks which kept Airbus afloat'.
Boeing said it wanted to see the new EC-US agreement on Airbus subsidies
extended to other countries, including Taiwan, eventually to form the basis
of a multilateral agreement on commercial aircraft trade.
This process, however, was likely to take time. Boeing is therefore pressing
the US government to undertake bilateral negotiations with Taiwan to agree
on aircraft trade rules.

FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Riots sharpen Clinton Bush rivalry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, each conscious that the
other's campaign was watching closely, walked a fine, and moveable, line
yesterday in reacting to the riots in Los Angeles.
Mr Bush began the day urging calm and expressing his own deep anguish. A
noontime televised statement touched all bases, but it led off with what he
called 'frustration over a verdict' and emphasised that the Justice
Department would continue a criminal investigation of the police violence
case in Los Angeles.
By mid-afternoon, the president was in Columbus, Ohio, and there had been a
discernible shift in emphasis. He spoke of his 'revulsion and pain' at the
street violence, of 'mob brutality' that was 'sickeningly sad'.
He did not mention federal action against the acquitted police offers, but
said: 'I will keep telling the country that we must stand up against
lawlessness and crime wherever it happens .. and what happened last night
was purely criminal.'
At the same time his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, was telling the travelling
press that Mr Clinton's reactions throughout the day had been politically
conditioned and were worthy of 'slippery Willie.' He added that the
president of the United States would never second guess the verdict of an
American jury.
The Democrat's first reaction on Tuesday night had been to condemn the trial
verdict. Yesterday morning he said the riots had been a reflection of
society's failure, a lack of faith in a system that was no longer
responsive. But he, too, urged an end to the violence.
When Mr Bush announced possible federal prosecution, Mr Clinton said that
was the right way to go. With Mr Bush emphasising his involvement in solving
the problem, and with a previously arranged trip to California on the
presidential schedule next week, Mr Clinton said he was contemplating going
to California to see if he could help.
At the end of the day, it almost seemed that both had reverted to political
type, the president talking up law and order, always a strong Republican
issue, Mr Clinton arguing the case for social healing, which he has tried to
make his issue this year, and for programmes to assist inner city
revitalisation.
Bill Schneider, the political expert, pointed out on TV that urban violence
tends to polarise American opinion, generally towards the right, where Mr
Bush sits. The US public seems to expect a strong response, which a centrist
like Mr Clinton may find hard to express.
On the other hand, shock at the acquittal of the police officers seems to
have been universal, cutting across racial divides. Failure to bring the
weight of federal prosecution against the four policemen following their
acquittal in the state courts would be widely, and unkindly, noticed.
Rev Jesse Jackson, the black activist, attacked the Los Angeles police
force, recalling its past history of violence before the Rodney King affair,
and recalling that its police chief, Daryl Gates, was close to the
president.
Mr Jackson himself, never shy of publicity but sensing the need for some
leadership, was as active as any yesterday. He conferred with William Barr,
the attorney general, and with Mr Clinton. He promised to go to Los Angeles.
He was constantly on television.

THE SMELL of smoke and distant shouting was the signal that a violent
demonstration was in progress outside the headquarters of the Los Angeles
police department.
The court acquittal of four white policemen filmed on video brutally beating
a black motorist was only the latest spark to set an American city burning.
When the protesters came into view, people with their shirts off were
dancing up to the flames of a burning kiosk. The front doors of the police
station were smashed. The crowded chanted : 'No justice, no peace.' A black
cyclist stood watching the fire. 'I came for a demonstration, not a fight,'
said Robert Collins. His wife had resigned from the police force after
seeing too many beatings, he said.
Mr Collins was sympathetic with the demonstrators' rage, saying he had been
arrested repeatedly based on his skin colour.
Night workers stood watching at City Hall nearby as the crowd began to move.
When rocks and bottles were thrown, a policewoman shouted to her colleagues:
'Everybody inside.' She locked the main doors to City Hall and all garage
doors were quickly closed.
A short time later she let in two women reporters who had run from the
criminal court across the street. In a press room on the 14th floor of the
criminal court, they had smelt smoke and ran, in a panic, down 14 flights of
stairs.
In the lobby of the criminal court they found police officers who escorted
them out of the building. All the lobby windows had been smashed, and smoke
from burning shrubs filled the first few floors of the court house.
Safely inside City Hall, they watched as the turbulent crowd led by five
young men went down the street, smashed windows, overturned cars and set
them on fire. In driving to a hospital a mile south, the crowds's wake was
evident. Huge panes of windows had been broken out of banks and the Los
Angeles Times building, leaving venetian blinds and chairs askew.
Firefighters were spraying water on an overturned car, filling the canyon
between buildings with white smoke. A news kiosk had been overturned and
burnt to a cinder.
In the hospital waiting room a large black man in shorts waited patiently
with a bloody bandage around his calf. He had been shot. Another woman was
wheeled in, and she weakly handed her insurance papers up to the
receptionist. She said she had been shot in the foot.
A local resident, Mrs Delores Hill, said a liquor store where her husband
bought cigarettes had been looted and burned. The shopkeeper had become a
friend, she said. 'It's like a family,' said Mrs Hill. 'The neighbourhood
family has been wiped out.'
As looting went on unchecked in some areas, outnumbered police stood
helplessly. 'They're taking advantage of the situation to come and have a
shopping spree,' said a police sergeant who refused to give his name.
Many of the establishments looted belonged to Koreans, who have increasingly
come to dominate business in black neighbourhoods, fuelling resentment among
residents.
But blacks also suffered heavily. 'They've looted and burned my store,' said
Michael Stennis, owner of a fried chicken outlet. 'My family's been in this
area for 35 years. We're black. It's senseless.'

<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas yesterday unveiled a radical new design for the MD-12
jumbo airliner it wants to develop with Asian financial backing to challenge
Boeing's 747-400, which dominates the top end of the market.
In a bold move to seize the commercial initiative, McDonnell has scrapped
earlier plans for a three-engined aircraft in favour of a four-engined one,
with two passenger levels.
This means the 511-seat aircraft could be expanded into a stretched version
accommodating more than 600 passengers - the largest on the market.
Both Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie have been considering 'super
jumbos' of this kind, but neither is committed to the aircraft.
The MD-12 is considered crucial to McDonnell Douglas' future in airliners,
as its current range consists of only two models. Analysts say that if the
company, smallest of the three leading manufacturers, fails to get the new
jet off the ground it will be doomed to inexorable decline.
The company said the number of engines had been changed after consultations
with airlines and to meet their needs for higher passenger capacity and more
efficient operating economies.
However, McDonnell insisted that the Dollars 5bn price tag which it had put
earlier on development of the MD-12 had not been increased by the changes.
The cash-strapped company cannot afford to finance the aircraft alone and is
trying to persuade Asian nations to take a stake of up to 49 per cent.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Congress moves to ban deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESS is preparing to curb its most important power, to decide on
taxation and expenditure, by seeking to amend the US constitution to ban
budget deficits.
The House of Representatives budget committee has begun hearings on a
balanced budget constitutional amendment, and Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker
of the House, says he believes an amendment is likely to pass this year.
Support for a balanced budget amendment - which if passed by Congress would
then need to be ratified by three quarters of the states - comes mainly from
Republicans and conservative Democrats.
But left wing Democrats like Senator Paul Simon of Illinois or Congressman
Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts are also backing slightly different
proposals with the same aim.
Congress has made several attempts to tie its own budgetary hands since the
US federal deficit began to spiral out of control in the 1980s, but with the
deficit expected to top Dollars 400bn this year, they have clearly failed.
The Gramm Rudman Hollings law of 1985 set a target of balancing the budget
by 1991, and inflicted mandatory spending cuts if Congress and the president
could not agree on a budget that met the law's targets for the deficit in
intermediate years.
The law had some effect, but was largely circumvented, and in 1990 it was
replaced by a budget compromise between President George Bush and Congress.
This agreement, which President Bush now regards as a mistake, raised some
taxes but in return imposed caps on discretionary spending.
Perhaps most importantly, it introduced a 'pay as you go' rule, whereby any
measures that would increase mandatory spending such as unemployment
benefits or social security payments would have to be offset by higher
taxes.
Even this apparently stringent discipline, however, has not held back the
deficit from its giddy upwards spiral.

THE Bank of China will not become the colony's central bank after Hong Kong
reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 but will remain a commercial bank,
according to a senior Chinese government official.
He also questioned whether the Bank of China could, or would want to,
replace Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as the colony's leading
bank. Bank of China, a collection of 13 mainland banks, is the colony's
second largest bank with assets in excess of HKDollars 500bn (Pounds 36bn).
Chen Ziying, the deputy director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office, was quoted by the semi-official China News Service as saying: 'How
would Bank of China replace Hongkong Bank? Bank of China will not have such
a plan, will it?'
Hong Kong currently has no formal central bank or monetary authority,
although the colony's Exchange Fund performs many central banking functions.
It is responsible for the management of foreign reserves and for conducting
operations in the money markets to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar remains
fixed to the US dollar at a rate of HKDollars 7.8 to the US unit.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM about future sales and profits growth in Europe and North America
has driven worldwide business hopes sharply higher, according to a survey
published yesterday.
A survey of more than 11,000 busines executives in 15 countries by Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, the business information group, found that expectations for
higher sales and profits in the second quarter in Canada, the US, Germany,
the UK and New Zealand, boosted worldwide optimism in spite of a sharp
decline in Japanese expectations.
In Japan, expectations for higher sales fell for the seventh consecutive
quarter with more businesses expecting their sales to decrease than to rise.
However, optimism about higher sales increased sharply in New Zealand and
remained flat in Australia pushing overall expectations in the Pacific basin
slightly higher.
'Japan is almost certainly entering a period of virtually no economic
growth,' said Mr Joseph Duncan, vice president of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
In Europe, business optimism for higher sales and profits rose or stayed
flat in all of the eight countries surveyed, except for Italy.
The survey, which was carried out in February and March, also showed that
optimism rebounded sharply in the UK, before the general election on April
9.
Mr Duncan said increased sales and profits optimism in Germany reflected
recent signs of economic growth in eastern Germany.

THE INDIAN assets of Union Carbide, the US multinational, have been ordered
to be seized by a magistrate in Bhopal following the failure of its
employees to appear in court in connection with the gas leak tragedy in 1984
which has killed more than 4,000.
Mr Gulab Sharma, the magistrate, yesterday ordered that the company's 50.9
per cent holding in its Indian subsidiary should be seized immediately. The
company yesterday put the value of the shares and property at Rs420m (Pounds
30.5m).
The order came after an application by the government to seize the company's
property and shares following reports that Union Carbide was attempting to
transfer shares in its Indian subsidiary to a trust for building a hospital
for victims of the disaster.
The magistrate has already ordered that arrest warrants be issued for Mr
Warren Anderson, former chairman of Union Carbide, for failing to appear in
court and extradition proceedings are now in progress.
Union Carbide is thought to want to transfer the shares in its Indian
subsidiary to forestall seizure by the court. The company's move came after
its employees had ignored a summons to stand trial on charges of negligence
in connection with the Bhopal tragedy.
Mr Rajendra Singh, a lawyer for Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary, told the
court the US company had 'lost faith' in the Indian government and there was
little possibility of the company or its lawyers appearing before Indian
courts.
In a settlement with the Indian government in February 1989, Union Carbide
had paid Dollars 470m in return for quashing all criminal proceedings
against its employees. The settlement was later challenged on the grounds
that it was inadequate, but was upheld by the Supreme Court.

CHINA was last night reported to be preparing to release and expel seven
Europeans after detaining them for staging a human rights protest in
Tiananmen Square, site of the pro-democracy demonstrations two years ago
which were crushed by the army.
The seven included Mr Bob Parry, a British Labour MP, as well as two French

to the European Labour Group which supports trade union rights.
The group was detained after unfurling a banner in Tiananmen Square which
read in Chinese, 'Long live free labour unions'. They had previously been
refused a meeting by the Ministry of Justice after reportedly telling
foreign journalists that China's only officially tolerated trade union was
not independent.
China has banned political protest of any kind since cracking down on
student protest in June 1989.
Ma Yuzhen, China's ambassador to London, was summoned to the Foreign Office
yesterday afternoon where he received a formal protest from Britain's
foreign office minister of state, Mr Alastair Goodlad.

OVERALL housing starts in Japan fell 19.4 per cent to 1.23m units in the

the intense financial pressure on property companies and their bankers.
But, for March, starts were down only 2.3 per cent on the same month last
year, adding to evidence that the residential property market is close to
touching bottom after 17 consecutive months of decline.
Leading developers report that their stock of unsold properties, which
expanded rapidly last year, has stabilised, while Tokyo condominium sales in
March rose 19.5 per cent on the same month last year.
Property prices are reckoned to have fallen by an average 30 per cent in the
past 18 months, though the drop has been uneven. Prime commercial space
stayed in demand, while some apartment prices in western Japan have fallen
by more than 50 per cent.
Starts in March of housing for sale fell 33.9 per cent to 20,462 units, the
seventh consecutive decline and a sign that property speculators are still
in severe pain.
The market in the Osaka region, a centre of speculative building, remains
hardest hit.
Owner-occupied housing starts in March rose 14.7 per cent to 39,536 units.

in the country's June referendum would be 'disastrous' for its economy,
writes Tim Coone in Dublin. Ireland could be sidelined in EC affairs,and at
some point might 'no longer be a real member of the Community'. Mr Albert

In the first clear sign that France may be starting to emerge from the
economic recession, figures released yesterday show a small but significant
decline in unemployment in March, the first such reduction since last
August, reports Ian Davidson from Paris.
The reduction of 0.6 per cent, or by 18,200 to 2,858,100 in seasonally
adjusted terms, was swelled statistically by a change in reporting dates.
But even on the old basis, there would still have been a fall of 0.2 per
cent in the unemployment level, and the Labour Ministry said the latest
figures 'clearly confirmed a relatively better trend'.

The final obstacle to the signature on Saturday of the European Economic
Area (EEA) treaty, creating a 19-country single market, was removed
yesterday when the EC reached agreement with Austria on truck traffic
crossing the latter's territory, David Buchan reports from Brussels. The
transit of EC trucks through the Alps was a problem for Switzerland and
Austria. The latter has now conceded that EC trucks can make 1.264m trips
across its territory a year.
The treaty will, after a transition period for certain sensitive sectors in
Efta states, permit a free flow of goods, capital, services, and labour
among the signatory countries. Negotiations for the EEA, which effectively
make Efta states economic but not political members of the EC, have been
plagued by institutional problems that may well be raised when the treaty
comes up for ratification in various legislatures.

Speaking in the town of Cherepovets at the end of a tour of northern Russia,

Supporters and opponents of Tajikistan's conservative leadership yesterday
poured into Dushanbe, the capital of the former Soviet republic, to swell
mass protests which have convulsed the city for three days, Reuter reports
from Moscow. Leaders of the Tajik parliament held an emergency meeting to
try to find ways of curbing the unrest and preventing an outbreak of
violence. The Tajik mission in Moscow said that up to 100,000 people were
taking part in three separate rallies: supporters and opponents of President
Rakhmon Nabiyev and a third group demanding tough measures to end all the
protests. It said government supporters, carrying Soviet flags and accusing
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin of destroying the former Soviet Union,
constituted the largest group. Government opponents, many wearing headbands
inscribed with the slogan 'freedom or death,' encircled key state buildings,
including Mr Nabiyev's residence. The republic is one of the most
conservative in the now-defunct Soviet Union.

LIEUTENANT General John Shalikashvili, the US army officer who last year
headed the operation to protect and supply Kurds in northern Iraq, has been
appointed Nato's supreme commander in Europe to replace General John Galvin,
writes David White in London. Born in Warsaw of a Polish mother and Georgian
father, the 55-year-old Gen Shalikashvili formerly commanded the US 7th Army
in Germany and is currently senior assistant to Gen Colin Powell, chairman
of the US joint chiefs of staff.
Nato allies have shelved the idea of appointing a European to the job, which
has gone to US generals ever since Gen Dwight Eisenhower first held it in
1950. Such a move would have reflected the greater role European allies are
to assume in their own defence, with US forces in Europe being cut by half
to 150,000 and possibly less. The allies have been anxious not to alienate
US opinion and maintain a strong US presence in Europe.

RIVAL leaders of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday remained locked in conflict in
European Community-sponsored talks in Lisbon as fighting again shook the
republic.
Up to 20 people were reported killed early in the day in bomb attacks which
destroyed the road and rail bridges across the river Sava separating Bosnia
and Croatia in the town of Brcko. Nobody claimed responsibility for the
bridge explosions, the worst in eight weeks of conflict in Bosnia.
Sarajevo, the capital, endured one of its worst bombardments of the war in
the early hours when at least two people were killed. Sarajevo radio also
reported fighting in several other towns and said three people had been
killed in shelling overnight in the southwestern city of Mostar.
In Lisbon, a Portuguese official said round-table talks between the Serb,
Croat and Moslem delegations appeared unlikely in the short term. Bilateral
talks between the EC and the three delegations were being hampered by
accusation and counter-accusation as well as events on the ground.
On the diplomatic front, Mr Marrack Goulding, United Nations under-secretary
general, is expected to arrive in Bosnia at the weekend to assess the
feasibility of deploying a peacekeeping force there.
In Helsinki, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe welcomed
Bosnia as its 52nd member, while allowing Yugoslavia to retain its seat for
the time being.
'Fifty states expressed their clear understanding that the presence of
Yugoslavia does not mean any solution as far as the question of succession
is concerned,' a spokesman said.
EC foreign ministers will discuss fresh action to force Serbia to put down
its guns and negotiate a peaceful division of Yugoslavia when they meet in
northern Portugal today.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister who will chair the
meeting, has proposed isolating Serbia diplomatically and freezing Yugoslav
assets abroad unless it pulls the Yugoslav federal army out of both Croatia
and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
He said that unless Belgrade withdrew the Serb-led army from these two
war-torn republics, the EC should not recognise the new smaller state of
Yugoslavia which Serbia declared with its ally Montenegro on Monday.
Such international recognition appears to be the main diplomatic weapon
against Serbia at the moment. 'It all boils down to whether Mr Milosevic
(Serbia's president) cares enough about recognition to bring peace to
Bosnia,' said a western diplomat.
The fighting has left at least 350 people dead and some 420,000 have fled
their homes.

<TEXT>
THE NEW defence ministers of Britain and Germany, Mr Malcolm Rifkind and Mr
Volker Ruhe, yesterday called for substantial cost savings in the European
Fighter Aircraft (EFA), to ensure that the multi-national project goes
ahead.
Speaking side-by-side after their first meeting, the two agreed that the
aircraft manufacturers in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain must identify
areas where significant savings can be made.
Mr Ruhe, who took over the office of German defence minister last month
after the sudden resignation of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, was much the more
outspoken in his statement, reflecting the widespread opposition in Germany
to the EFA project.
He said the price - DM135m (Pounds 45.9m) per aircraft in Germany - was 'far
too high, and there is an agreement between us that we should try to make
clear that these price projections must be brought right down'. Only thus
would it be possible to ensure 'there is an opportunity within a limited
budget to come to a positive decision' on the aircraft. 'It would be
difficult to make a clear decision on such prices."
A working group from the three parties in the German coalition government is
currently considering the EFA project, as well as other alternatives such as
the ex-Soviet MiG-29, the French Rafale, Swedish Gripen and the US F-15,
F-16 and F-22 aircraft. They are supposed to report back by mid-year.
Mr Rifkind made it clear he believed the EFA was both 'operationally
necessary' and appropriate to the changing defence challenges in Europe.
But, he added, 'I share the concern about the cost. We have a common desire
to see the cost reduced and we should jointly approach industry to impress
on them the necessity of identifying areas where costs can be reduced.' The
principal manufacturers are British Aerospace, Germany's Deutsche Aerospace,
Casa of Spain and Alenia of Italy.

THE LEADERS of Germany and Japan agreed in Bonn yesterday that their
countries should play a greater part in international politics, in keeping
with their economic importance. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime
minister, called for political questions - such as arms control and drug
trafficking - to be given greater prominence by the Group of Seven
industrialised states in their preparation for the July world economic
summit in Munich.
He sought the support of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as of President
Francois Mitterrand, whom he met in Paris on Wednesday, for closer Japanese
involvement in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.
The Japanese argument to step up the political content in the G7, a
suggestion regarded with some suspicion in Paris, is based on the grounds
that this is one of the very few world groupings in which Japan plays a full
role.
His plea was met with understanding by Chancellor Kohl, according to an
official spokesman. Mr Kohl spoke of the need to provide more assistance for
the economic and political stabilisation of the states of the former Soviet
Union, the one point on which the two sides are still divided.
Mr Miyazawa outlined the continuing Japanese problem with the Russian
federation over the Kurile islands, occupied by Soviet forces after the
second world war.
He made it clear that while Japan had agreed to support financially the
Dollars 24bn package of assistance for the current year put together by the
G7, the IMF and the World Bank, any further assistance would depend on
reaching agreement with Russia on the islands.
The issue seems likely to be raised by Japan at Munich, when G7 leaders are
expected to meet President Boris Yeltsin of Russia in a separate forum after
their summit meeting. Ian Davidson adds from Paris: President Mitterrand
promised moral support to Japan in its efforts to secure the return of the
northern territories. But he did not respond to Mr Miyazawa's request that
the issue be placed on the Munich agenda, telling the Japanese prime
minister this was essentially a bilateral problem between Japan and Russia,
which should be settled by negotiation.
France and Japan agreed to step up their political and economic dialogue, to
the gratification of the French authorities, following the chill provoked by
the anti-Japanese rhetoric of the previous French prime minister, Mrs Edith
Cresson.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Kohl makes public appeal for wage restraint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl, facing the twin threats of nationwide strikes and a
fractious coalition government, yesterday issued an urgent May Day appeal
for western German workers to restrain their wage demands in the interests
of German unity.
At the same time he read the riot act to his coalition partners, demanding
that they bury their public squabbling and get on with the task of
government. In a television interview last night, he flatly rejected
suggestions that his coalition government might fall, but also sharply
criticised the minority Free Democrats (FDP) for their indecisiveness over
the succession to Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as foreign minister.
He discounted any suggestion that he might form a new 'grand coalition' with
the opposition Social Democrats, and expressed confidence that the three
coalition partners would fight the next election side-by-side.
His intervention comes after days of apparent political drift in Bonn,
allowing his opponents to accuse him of inaction and weak leadership.
It coincided with a slight easing of the strike action by public sector
workers in a tactical move to prevent excessive disruption of the May Day
national holiday today. However, engineering workers stepped up their
campaign of strikes, calling out more than 220,000 workers in support of a
separate pay claim.
Mr Kohl's message amounted to a direct plea to workers in the public
services, the railways and the engineering industry to abandon their demands
for big pay rises in the interests of the unemployed in eastern Germany.
'Solidarity is not only demanded when it is a question of making demands and
fighting for them, as in wage negotiations and job conflicts,' he said.
'There is also a solidarity of workers with the jobless. . . . In the
present situation in Germany, solidarity of workers in the west with the
workers in the east is also required.'
Meanwhile, there was some good news for the government. On the economic
front, there was confirmation that west German inflation was easing. The
provisional rate in April was around 4.5 per cent, down from 4.8 per cent in
March, the Federal Statistics Office said.
On the political front, there was also a slight lifting of the storm clouds
over the coalition, although the fundamental differences within the
government have not been resolved.
A full-scale parliamentary debate on the question of controlling the flood
of asylum-seekers into the country suggested that the government and the
opposition Social Democrats may yet be able to agree on a common solution to
the problem, which has caused a defection of voters to extreme right-wing
parties.
Mr Kohl's appeal to the workers came after almost a week of escalating
strike action by the public service workers, which has caused widespread
havoc in public transport, left a huge backlog of letters and parcels, and
has left mounds of uncollected rubbish in shopping centres and private
homes.
The public sector unions are demanding a pay increase of 9.5 per cent, but
Mr Kohl and the government are adamant that anything more than 5 per cent is
out of the question, given the current budget deficit to finance
unification, and above all to subsidise jobs in the east German economy.

FT  01 MAY 92 / US probes Lonrho-Libya dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration is investigating Lonrho's dealings with Libya,
including an offer by Lonrho of a deal involving its north American hotels.
News of the probe came as it emerged that Mr Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi
Arabian arms dealer who played a central role in the Iran-Contra affair,
acted as middleman between Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, and
Libyan government officials in the Pounds 177m sale of a one-third stake in
the UK-based Metropole Hotels group. These contacts led to a series of
secret meetings between Mr Rowland and Col Muammer Gadaffi.
Investigators are examining reports that Mr Khashoggi visited Tripoli after
the United Nations sanctions against Libya over its alleged involvement in
the 1988 Lockerbie bombing came into force last month. The reports suggest
that Mr Khashoggi discussed other possible deals between Libya and Lonrho.
Documents obtained by the Financial Times show that Col Gadaffi's main
investment vehicle also discussed the possibility of acquiring part of
Lonrho's North American Princess hotel chain, which includes properties in
Arizona and California.
A senior official of the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset
Control (OFAC) said last night that Lonrho could be placed on the US
government's list of banned companies if Libya acquired a shareholding
giving it significant influence in the running of a Lonrho company. OFAC was
talking with Lonrho about the Libyan stake, the official added. Last year
OFAC handled the banning of US transactions with companies owned by or
having ties with Iraq.
Since 1986, the US has barred US companies and individuals from dealing with
Libyan-owned or controlled institutions.
A decision by the US to move against Lonrho could force Lonrho's
second-biggest shareholder, Fidelity Management Research, the US mutual
institutional investor, to disinvest.
The documents obtained by the FT show that Mr Khashoggi first approached Mr
Rowland last October. Mr Rowland wrote to Mr Mohamed Ali El Huwej, chairman
of Lafico (Libyan Arab Finance Company), saying how pleased he was to learn,
from Mr Khashoggi, of Lafico's interest. Ten days later, Mr Ali El Huwej
replied, suggesting a meeting with the aim of seeking Libya's 'highest
collaborations' in Lonrho's activities.
A series of meetings took place between Lonrho and Lafico, first at a
fashionable Paris restaurant last November and then at the Richmond and
President hotels in Geneva in February. A deal was announced in March
whereby the Libyans took a one-third stake in UK Metropole Hotels for Pounds
177m. A financier with close knowledge of the company confirmed that the
Paris and Geneva meetings had taken place and that Mr Rowland had discussed
possible further deals with Libyan officials.
Mr Rowland subsequently met Col Gadaffi in April to discuss further
investment and business ventures as the UN sanctions came into force.
Speaking for Lonrho last night, Mr Andrew Nitch-Smith, a partner in London
solicitors Denton Hall, said: 'Lonrho's only transaction with any Libyan
institution to date concerned the Metropole Hotels sale, which was announced
in March.
'Since that date there have been no other discussions on any other financial
transaction with any Libyan institution. In particular, Lonrho has never had
any discussions with any Libyan institution concerning any joint venture in
the US.'
In London, Mr Sam Evans, personal attorney to Mr Khashoggi, said he could
not comment on Mr Khashoggi's business affairs.
However, Mr Reda Alaywan, a Paris-based Lebanese businessman, confirmed Mr
Khashoggi's involvement. The two signed a joint venture last September to
broker such deals.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK hedges acceptance of 48-hour working week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK yesterday accepted in principle European Community plans for a
48-hour limit on the working week, but hedged its concession with conditions
that its partners seem unwilling to grant.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary, denied that she had
conceded the principle of a 48-hour working week. But she seemed to be the
only participant at the ministerial meeting who interpreted her stance in
that way.
'I said I could accept that 48 hours would appear in the directive subject
only to a resolution of the major problems the UK has,' Mrs Shephard said.
She added that the other member states - which with the exception of Ireland
back the working-time directive - had made concessions to Britain. A
majority of the 12 did concede that the weekly day of rest stipulated in the
directive did not have to be Sunday.
The main safeguard the UK wants is the right of people to work overtime
above the limit and to ensure that the 48 hours a week would be averaged
over 12 months, not three months as the Commission proposes. The UK also
wants the working week to be decided at plant rather than industry or
national level.
Ms Vasso Papandreou, EC social affairs commissioner, said: 'I think
(Britain) accepted the principle (of the 48-hour week), but of course with
conditions which now need to be decided.'
Officials from the current Portuguese presidency expect to be able to put
the directive, blocked by UK opposition for nearly two years, to a vote in
June. The UK cannot veto the measure because it was introduced under health
and safety provisions which require only a qualified majority.
Mrs Shephard said her main objective had been to avoid a vote on the measure
which would have isolated the UK. This was achieved thanks to Germany, which
though in favour of the directive, would prefer consensus and would not vote
yesterday, to grant the new UK minister a 'grace period'.
However, the UK is unlikely to win concessions which would in practice allow
it to circumvent the intention of the EC law.
The UK's earlier idea that proof of risk to health should be established
before the 48-hour limit could be imposed found no support. Ms Papandreou
pointed out that such 'risk assessment' already existed for all EC health
and safety standards, 'but not to lower standards'.
France and Belgium flatly opposed negotiating the working week at plant
level. But this UK condition could gather support, as could a more flexible
reference period over which to average the 48-hour week.
Mrs Shephard said: 'This directive is something we don't like and don't
need. If we were to accept it we would have to get very substantial
changes.'
If, as seems likely after yesterday, the UK is voted down in June, the
minister carefully reserved the option of a legal challenge, which would
argue that the directive was not concerned with health and safety and should
have required unanimity.

FT  01 MAY 92 / LA hit by further violent outbreaks

<TEXT>
SPORADIC shootings, looting and arson continued in Los Angeles last night,
as armoured cars and National Guard troops were out in force after overnight
violence had left at least 10 dead and 400 injured.
Blacks continued to react in disbelief to the acquittal of four white police
officers charged with assaulting a black motorist, Mr Rodney King. The
acquittal had come in spite of the evidence of widely-screened amateur
videotape of the beating.
Mayor Tom Bradley announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city, and curbed
the sale of guns, ammunition and petrol, in an effort to stem rioting. The
Insurance Information Institute said at least Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) of
damage had already been caused. It was the worst spate of violence to hit
Los Angeles since the Watts riots of 1965.
Yesterday police reported they had made more than 250 arrests as rioters
continued to ransack stores and set dozens of new fires. 'It is not under
control. There are looters, sporadic incidents of violence and a lot of
pushing and shoving going on,' said Mr Bill Frio, a police department
spokesman.
Captain Steve Ruda of the fire department said he did not have the manpower
to put out all the fires across the 30-square-mile area hit by rioting.
Anger over the verdict spread to black communities across the country
yesterday, sparking fears that the Los Angeles riots might be copied in
other cities.
'There is a danger that the crisis in Los Angeles will spread across the
country,' said Mr Jesse Jackson, the black political leader.
Demonstrations in cities such as Cleveland, Dallas and New York were
peaceful, for the most part. But in Atlanta, police made numerous arrests
when a rally got out of control. Looting was also reported in San Jose, near
San Francisco.
In Los Angeles, Mr Jeff Cramer, a freelance reporter for the Boston Globe,
was shot five times, but was in a stable condition last night.
He said a crowd had tried to take him out of his car but had failed to undo
his seat belt.
Gunshot victims were wheeled into a hospital about a mile south of the city
centre regularly through the night.
Seeing flames a block away, a black security guard said: 'Burn baby burn]'
President George Bush said the Justice Department would accelerate its
investigation of the King case. They would examine whether to bring federal
charges of violating Mr King's civil rights against the police officers
after their acquittal on assault charges under California state law.
Appealing for calm, he said the verdict had 'left us all with a deep sense
of personal frustration and anguish', but condemned the 'murder and violence
in the streets of Los Angeles'.
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr Bush's likely Democratic opponent in
this year's presidential election, said he was astonished by the verdict,
and hoped for a stronger statement from the president.
In the 1960s, federal prosecutors began to use charges of civil rights
violations because of the difficulty of persuading many all-white state
juries in the segregated Deep South to convict whites of crimes whose
victims were black.
In spite of improvements since then, many blacks still feel that the legal
system is heavily biased against them, a feeling reinforced by Wednesday's
verdict. 'It may be that 12 white jurors aren't going to convict four white
cops for beating a black man, and maybe that's as basic as it is,' said Mr
Steve Lerman, Mr King's lawyer.
Some black leaders criticised judges for transferring the trial to a
courtroom in predominantly white Ventura County, next to Los Angeles. The
videotape of the beating was thought to have prejudiced the chances of a
fair trial in the city itself.
Attorney-general William Barr said yesterday that 123 police officers had
been charged by the Justice Department in the last 3 1/2 years with civil
rights violations for brutality. Although these federal cases are also tried
by juries, the conviction rate was around 75 per cent.
A resident of the neighbourhood reacted in bitterness to the assault. 'It's
destroying the family. The neighbourhood family has been wiped out. It
breaks your heart,' said Mrs Delores Hill, a local resident.

<TEXT>
THE REDUCED premium of the June contract on the FT-SE was the only noteable
feature in an otherwise lacklustre session in stock index futures, writes
Joel Kibazo.
June opened at the 2,697 level, which proved to be the high point of the
day, the contract then going into reverse, with stock index futures tracking
the underlying cash market lower. Two-way business was seen at midsession
before the sellers once again took command, leading June lower. Wall Street
was said to have had no effect.
Dealers pointed to the reduced premium of the contract to the underlying
cash market, which at the day's worst fell to just 22 points, having started
the week at around 35.
June closed at 2,680, around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium
to cash of about 18. Turnover was a healthy 8,000 lots.
Volume in the traded options market reached 34,340 contracts, down from
43,773 lots the previous day. The Volume in FT-SE options, which yesterday
saw April expiry, was 12,752 lots. The Euro FT-SE traded 2,330 lots. British
Steel was the busiest stock option with 2,249 contracts. This was followed
by Hanson with 1,270.

FT  01 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP gains from UK buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS for BP, due to announce first-quarter results next Thursday,
led to divided opinions among UK institutional investors, who have recently
taken a very dim view of the stock.
Yesterday, one leading stockbroker bought 5m shares on behalf of a large
institution. Because of double counting the deal represents 10m of the 21m
shares traded. BP closed 2 firmer at 268p against a weak market and a
sluggish sector.
The shares have fallen steadily from the mid-350s since last autumn as the
market has become increasingly worried about the oil company's ability to
maintain its dividend. They have picked up recently because US investors
decided they were cheap, but UK buyers have tended to stay on the sidelines.
BAe slips
A cautious annual meeting at British Aerospace left the shares 6 lower at
345p after a volatile session. Turnover rose to 4.6m shares.
Sentiment was also affected by unconfirmed reports that BZW had downgraded
its 1992 profits forecasts for the company by about Pounds 35m to around
Pounds 185m. Further revisions from other brokers are expected.
There were also some fears that Delta Air Lines, of the US, which announced
on Wednesday plans to cut more than Dollars 5bn from its capital expenditure
programme by reducing aircraft deliveries, may abandon Airbus orders. BAe
has a 20 per cent stake in AirBus Industrie, and builds the wings of the
Airbus aircraft.
Wellcome bounces
Encouraging news at a presentation to financial analysts by Wellcome
prompted a bounce in the stock, which has fallen sharply since the general
election. It rallied 24 to 1060p.
Specialists were particularly cheered by the suggestion that earnings per
share growth for this year could be as high as 20 per cent, compared with
market estimates of around 15 per cent.
There was also reassurance that a number of products in the research stage
were going well, particularly the replacement for Wellcome's high earning
anti-viral drug Zovirax, which represents almost 30 per cent of drug sales
and is approaching the end of its patent lifespan.
First-quarter results from ICI were encouraging but the shares fell 19 to
1362p on profit-taking.
Troubled chemicals group MTM recovered 7 to 64p after appointing a new chief
executive.
Glaxo regained 6 to 744p on announcing that it had won UK approval for the
oral form of its migraine drug, Imigran.
An announcement that Fisons intends to sell its consumer health and
horticulture units to raise between Pounds 200m and Pounds 400m initially
helped the shares. They climbed 13 but fell back with the market to close
unchanged at 384p.
Granada Group rose as Smith New Court upgraded its figures. The securites
house is looking for Pounds 114m this year, up Pounds 4m, and a further rise
of Pounds 15m in 1993 to Pounds 139m, after being impressed by Granada's
rationalisation programme. The shares put on 4 to 266p.
There was hefty turnover in Queens Moat Houses, up 1 1/2 at 87 1/2 p, as one
investor switched convertible stock into 5.3m ordinary shares. A cash call
from Resort Hotels left the shares 7 down at 76p.
Transport Development Group shed 8 to 271p after Smith New Court
successfully placed the 19.6 per cent stake in TDG owned by Proventus, the
Swedish group, with institutions at 263p a share. British Airways rose 10 to
289p on reports that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had upgraded the stock.
Eurotunnel improved 10 to 381p as bargain hunters continued to favour the
stock following its recent decline.
The company said yesterday it would pay Pounds 50m to TML, the Channel
tunnel contractor, as ordered by a disputes panel. Sources close to TML were
optimistic over a final set-tlement being agreed with Eurotunnel shortly,
and said that no further provisions would have to be made by the
construction group this year over the costing dispute.
BICC was off 2 at 344p after graded its figures for the electricals group
and moved to a sell stance, citing worries about BICC's borrowings.
Utilities remained strong, ahead of the reporting season. Thames Water
climbed 5 to 442p and Severn Trent 6 1/2 to 390 1/2 p following recent
suggestions by analysts that the sector is undervalued.
Troubled property company Mountleigh said negotiations to sell a large
shopping mall had collapsed. The stock declined 1 1/4 to 5 3/4 p.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi saw heavy turnover of 40m shares and firmed 1 3/4 to 19
3/4 p. Overseas investors are said to be particularly keen on economic
recovery hopes, although one observer said the shares did not look cheap at
this level.
Kingfisher lost 12 to 542p as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew lowered its current year
profits forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 235m, on doubts about the
performance of B &amp; Q, its DIY subsidiary.
Dalepak Foods gained 8 to 363p on the appointment of a new chairman.
Discount food retailer Kwik Save strengthened 19 to 600p on encouraging
first-half profits, which were within market forecasts. Mr Graeme Seabrook,
group managing director, predicted faster profits growth in the second half.
Albert Fisher was very active following recent US presentations. It was one
of the most heavily traded stocks on the London market, with turnover of
17.1m shares. The price rose 1 to 72p as a large selling order was easily
absorbed.
Talk of a profits upgrading for Siebe by BZW failed to halt the stock's
decline, which ended 13 lower at 690p.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: World Stock Markets: Novelty
value helps give new value - Post-revolution, post-war, Tehran's exchange is
reinvigorated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN BARRACLOUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a moribund decade on the post-revolutionary shelf, Tehran's stock
exchange is enjoying a new lease of life as the government proceeds with its
privatisation programme.
Last week the government announced that it would sell off hundreds of
state-owned companies during the next two years, and domestic investors will
be allowed to buy up to 34 per cent of the equity in each. The share
offerings are also open to foreigners, who will be able to buy up to 25 per
cent of the share capital.
At present, 129 companies are listed on the exchange - mostly newly
privatised chemical, textile or other industrial companies. A further 200
companies have applied for a listing, and officials say 50 of these will be
accepted. In order to qualify for a listing, a company must be both Iranian
and profitable.
The government's privatisation drive, part of its five-year plan launched in
the 1989-90 year, has attracted more than 100,000 new investors a year to
the Tehran stock exchange.
In the year to March 31, 1992, turnover reached IR478bn (Dollars 333m),
seven times the previous year and 40 times the 1989-90 figure. The Tepix
index rose by 106 per cent during the year to March 31, 1992, with some
shares gaining more than 200 per cent.
This surge in interest is partly due to the novelty of share ownership in
post-revolutionary Iran. Trading on the stock market virtually stopped in
September 1980, at the outbreak of Iran's eight-year war with Iraq, when the
Iranian government put its economy on a war footing.
Traditionally, Iranians have sought to trade in tangible goods, rather than
financial paper, since Iran's Islamic banks pay no interest and distribute
only a small percentage of their overall profits.
One third of the government's sales will be offered to employees. Workers in
recently privatised companies make up a sizeable proportion of the stock
exchange's private investors. Those who need the money sell quickly, but
increasingly they are keeping their investments and hoping to see them
increase in value.
The stock market is open to all and, in a country where gambling and betting
are illegal, individuals see the stock exchange as their only chance for a
flutter. Women investors are quite prominent. 'Here, women are the same as
men,' says Mr Abdullahi Pervaiz, a trader on the exchange. 'Their money is
just as good.'
Indeed, the sexes mingle in the public gallery, where hardcore investors rub
shoulders with economics graduates, eager to see the mechanics of capitalism
at work.
The stock market has levelled off recently, but officials expect a renewed
rally, if President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's government abolishes the
remaining restrictions on stock market trading.
Last week, in an encouraging sign of flexibility, President Rafsanjani
allowed private brokerages on to the trading floor for the first time.
Previously, all trading was conducted by large banks and a few individual
brokers. The new regulations allow private firms to develop across the
country, giving more access to retail investors.
Mr Rajaie Salmassi, secretary general of the stock exchange, says that
foreigners, mainly from the Gulf countries, but increasingly from Europe,
are interested in returning. Some foreign companies still own stock bought
before the revolution.
The exchange still uses an 'open outcry' system and only trades for two
hours a day in a cramped old building in central Tehran. Most investors have
to come to the exchange in person, and since brokers have not yet got to
grips with the new financial transactions, the trading pit is ringed with
advisers. However, in May the exchange will move to new, computerised
offices nearby, which will provide room for expansion.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Asia Pacific: Nikkei falls on
light arbitrage unwinding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES finally closed lower on small-lot arbitrage unwinding after the
Nikkei average fluctuated amid low volume as most investors remained
inactive due to the Golden Week holidays, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 136.69 to 17,390.71 after a day's high of
17,581.79 and low of 17,363.81. The index was buoyed at the start of the
session by buying prompted by the overnight strength in New York. However,
index and arbitrage-related selling later depressed the Nikkei.
Volume decreased to 220m shares from Tuesday's 250m. Activity thinned out in
the middle of the holiday week: Tokyo's financial markets were closed on
Wednesday and will be shut next Monday and Tuesday for national holidays.
Declines led rises by 576 to 360, with 202 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks shed 1.54 to 1,317.46. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 2.49 to 1,072.63.
Blue chip high-technology issues were firm on light buying by foreign
investors. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, gained Y1 to Y850 and
Matsushita Electric Industrial added Y30 at Y1,440.
Leading large-capital stocks were sought by investment trust funds targeted
for large-lot investors. Nippon Steel put on Y4 to Y309 and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Y5 to Y585.
Ishihara Sangyo, a chemical manufacturer, closed Y22 higher at Y357. The
issue has been popular recently among short-term traders buying on margin.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y1,000 to Y635,000 on
profit-taking. The stock gained ground on Tuesday on reports that the
Ministry of Finance was considering a cut in the issue's minimum trading
unit.
Banks involved in the rescue plan for the ailing Toyo Shinkin Bank, a credit
co-operative at the centre of a loan fraud scandal last year, rose as
traders said the negative factors had already been discounted into share
prices.
Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y20 to Y1,850 and Fuji Bank Y10 to Y1,400.
Both will forfeit 70 per cent of claims held against Toyo, and IBJ will
provide Y50bn of low interest loans to Sanwa Bank, another leading

Trading was subdued ahead of the closure of many bourses today for the May
Day holiday. Amsterdam was closed yesterday for the Queen's Birthday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT failed to get a boost from better-than-expected inflation figures.
The DAX index lost 1.88 to 1,734.03 for a 0.6 per cent fall on the week. The
FAZ index, calculated at midsession, was down 2.1 at 700.99, a decline of
1.4 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to DM5.1bn from DM6bn.
PWA fell DM3 to DM243 after saying that its 1991 dividend would remain
unchanged at DM9.
Preussag closed down DM3.50 at DM405.50 after reporting little change in its
first half 1991/92 group net profit and saying that it was confident of
paying an unchanged dividend of DM10.
Hoesch, which also intends to pay an unchanged dividend of DM10 for 1991,
gained DM1.50 to DM252.
Basf rose DM3.70 to DM253 before going ex-dividend after the close. In
London it closed at DM237.50/DM239.
PARIS turned lower in the afternoon as traders squared their books ahead of
the long weekend. The CAC-40 index fell 5.58 to 2,031.14, up 2.3 per cent on
the week, in turnover of FFr2.7bn.
Hachette, Matra, MMB, and Publications Filipacchi were all suspended pending
an announcement next Tuesday. Analysts said this was likely to refer to
plans to restructure Hachette's capital after its heavy losses linked to La
Cinq, the bankrupt television station. Details of previously released plans
to merge Matra and Hachette were also expected.
Paribas rose FFr2.80 to FFr431.8 following Wednesday's announcement of a
reorganisation and the sale of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais.
Shares in Ciments Francais remained suspended.
MILAN saw a big drop in shares controlled by the Pesenti family after news
of Italcementi's planned capital increase to finance its purchase of a
controlling stake in Ciments Francais. The Comit index eased 0.78 to 502.88,
down 1.1 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's
L96bn.
Italcementi, Italmobiliare, and other shares in the group were briefly
suspended because of their excessive falls. Italmobiliare eventually closed
L4,800 or 8.9 per cent lower at L49,050 while Italcementi dropped L2,050 or
12.1 per cent to L14,850.
Stet was unchanged at L2,021. After the close the state holding company,
IRI, said it would offer 350m ordinary shares in Stet warrants for a further
175m ordinary and 350m savings shares in June.
ZURICH rose in active trading. The SMI index closed up 6.0 at 1,880.2 for a
0.3 per cent gain on the week.
Brown Boveri weakened as investors moved into Nestle. Brown Boveri bearers
lost SFr80 to SFr4,070 while Nestle bearers and registered shares advanced
SFr60 and SFr50 to SFr9,830 and SFr9,790 respectively.
STOCKHOLM closed marginally higher, in spite of Volvo and SKF going
ex-dividend. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 0.6 to 981.5, down 0.6 per
cent on the week.
Volvo B unrestricted shares closed ex-dividend at SKr420, down a net
SKr2.50, while SKF B unrestricted shares rose a net SKr2.25 to SKr107.
VIENNA was weighed down for a second day by the oil company OMV which ended
at a new 1992 low of Sch860, down Sch30, after news that the company lost
Sch300m in the first quarter and would not be able to match its 1991
results. The ATX index fell 7.96 to 960.13.
MADRID concentrated on Telefonica after reports that it would increase
tariff rates by 2.6 per cent, far below forecasts. Its shares fell Pta25 at
Pta1,050. The general index was down 1.06 at 248.73, a fall of 0.5 per cent
on the week.
BRUSSELS's Bel-20 fell 13.79 or 1.1 per cent to 1,192.79, down 2.4 per cent
on the week. Petrofina bucked the trend, climbing BFr50 to BFr10,900.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Differences remain on cocoa
price stabilisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRODUCING and consuming countries will today wrap up the first round
of negotiations on a new international cocoa accord without any formal
agreement on the main issue dividing the two sides, the nature of measures
needed to stabilise prices, which are at the lowest level for 16 1/2 years.
However, officials said the export quota system favoured by African
producers was not a runner because consumer countries had made clear at a
meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation in London that it was
unacceptable.
Though the Africans, led by the Ivory Coast, which produces one-third of the
world's cocoa, have yet to withdraw their proposals, officials said export
quotas had scarcely been discussed during the past two weeks of talks. Most
attention had been devoted to refining consumer country proposals for an
export withholding and production management scheme.
'Producers are anxious to have an agreement at almost any price,' one
official said, predicting that export quotas would not survive to the next
round of talks on the new pact scheduled for July 6-24, also in Geneva.
The present International Cocoa Agreement, which has a buffer stock
mechanism as its principal means of influencing prices, expires in September
next year.
The talks, involving 18 producing and 22 consuming nations accounting for
about three-quarters of world production and consumption, are taking place
against the gloomy background of plunging cocoa prices, chronic oversupply
and unprecedentedly high stock levels. Consuming countries argue that export
quotas would not impose sufficient restraints on total production, needed to
bring supply and demand into better balance.
Under the export withholding proposals, producers would be obliged to store
surplus cocoa when prices were falling and release it when they were rising.
But export withholding would be coupled with a 'production management
scheme', under which each producer would have an output quota.
Producers dislike output quotas on sovereignty grounds because they
constrain domestic production decisions. They are also worried by the
possible expense of withholding exports. While the detailed sums have yet to
be done, one major producer calculates that the cocoa price would have to
rise by Dollars 300-Dollars 400 a tonne to finance the scheme. Brazil, which
has taken considerable steps to increase domestic demand in recent years, is
also anxious not to be penalised on that account.
The other major issue, though barely touched on in this first round of
talks, is what to do with the present cocoa buffer stock of about 240,000
tonnes. Some countries, notably Brazil, are anxious to find ways of
gradually releasing the stock, which they believe depresses the market by
its mere existence. Others would prefer to sit tight, so as not to
exacerbate the existing glut.
Operation of the current cocoa agreement, which dates from 1986, has been
hampered by the US, the world's biggest consumer, deciding not to join, and
similar decisions by Malaysia and Indonesia, the fourth and eighth biggest
producers. There is now some prospect that the East Asians could agree to
involvement in a successor accord but the US has said it is not interested
in any pact with price stabilisation provisions.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Optimism on demand boosts oil
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES moved ahead again yesterday after edging upwards for most of the
week as traders began to take a more optimistic view of oil demand.
North Sea Brent crude oil for June delivery rose by 47 1/2 cents to Dollars
19.67 1/2 a barrel and traders said there were few signs of it weakening.
The market was strengthened earlier this week when two Norwegian shipping
unions went on strike. The industrial action was short-lived and had no
effect on oil deliveries, but nevertheless lent some strength to oil prices.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London said
there had been some strong buying from oil refiners in the US. 'The second
quarter is providing shopping opportunities for those who like to line up
barrels for later in the year: when the market started to run, they thought
they'd better buy or miss the boat.'
Some traders say they are expecting higher oil demand than forecast,
particularly in the US, amid signs that the world economy is tentatively
picking up.
Ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last Friday
agreed to stick to their production ceiling of some 23m barrels a day. They
stressed their intention of getting all members to cut output as agreed in
February.
The Opec agreement set a slightly firmer tone for the market but traders say
it was not a major factor in pushing up prices. In New York, June futures
prices edged up from Dollars 20.77 a barrel to Dollars 20.85 a barrel in
late trading.

London's robusta COFFEE futures plunged again to touch new 22-year lows.
'We've seen no origin selling, but the market's just drifted down in an
apathetic kind of way,' one dealer said. After being called to open about
Dollars 5 a tonne lower on New York's overnight performance, near July soon
fell through support at Dollars 750 a tonne to a low of Dollars 733, before
closing Dollars 20 down at Dollars 738. Near May touched support at Dollars
700. Some dealers said coffee was due for an upturn as origins would refuse
to sell at these levels. 'A lot of traders are short, so if origins don't
come to the market, then prices will have to come up,' one said. In New York
arabica prices were also down at midday. On the London Metal Exchange
three-month ZINC continued to retreat from the Dollars 1,300 a tonne level,
while prices for cash metal remain supported by technical tightness. The
ALUMINIUM market recovered in the afternoon from a five-week low struck
after talk of a labour contract deal at Alcoa and Reynolds. There was still
no definite news of damage halting output at Yugoslavia's Mostar smelter,
although there is heavy fighting in the region, traders noted.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PAPUA NEW Guinea's government has extended for another two years the
prospecting licence covering the Lihir Island project, one of the biggest
known gold deposits outside South Africa, as long as the joint venturers
'take all reasonable steps necessary' to start mine construction by the end
of this year.
The PNG government also wants negotiations about a mining development
contract completed by October 31, reported Niugini Mining, a subsidiary of
Battle Mountain Gold of the US, which owns 20 per cent of the Lihir project.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, which has the other 80 per cent,
said that discussions were continuing with the PNG government but might be
complicated by the June general election.
In March a Dollars 767m proposal was submitted for treatment of an annual
2.83m tonnes of ore for the production of 620,000 troy ounces of gold for
the first 12 years and an average of 370,000 ounces over the project's
31-year life.
Niugini's breakdown of the capital costs shows process facilities accounting
for USDollars 188m, mining equipment and facilities Dollars 98m and
infrastructure Dollars 99m. Full operating costs would be Dollars 248.75 an
ounce for the first five years and Dollars 274 over the mine's life.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reform puts body into Cape wine
industry - Trends towards quality and export marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNOUNCEMENT last month of the abolition of the notorious quota system
in the South African wine industry was only the latest symptom of an
industry, literally, in a state of ferment.
With South Africa's political isolation now over, local winemakers are
anxious to reclaim the Cape's status as one of the world's leading
wine-growing regions. During the 18th and 19th centuries Constantia desert
wines were favoured by the European nobility, being drunk by Napoleon,
Frederick the Great and Metternich, and written about by Dickens and Jane
Austen.
Mr John Platter, South Africa's best known wine writer, wrote recently of
the 'abandon and exuberance everywhere in the winelands', adding that 'not
since Constantia (a wine growing area just outside Cape Town) has the Cape
grown such magnificent wines'.
The present ferment in the industry has three main strands: reform of the
institutional framework, the opening of world markets and the entry into the
industry of a new class of professional winemaker. Considerable further
impetus is being provided by the political reform process under way in the
country since early 1990.
At the marketing end of the industry, the return of South African wines to
the world's shelves is a wonderful opportunity - literally, a relaunch of
the country's wines. Mr Platter notes: 'We're slightly sexy at the moment.
The world is quite curious about us'.
The initial reception has been good. Supermarkets, which account for the
bulk of wine sales in the UK, are restocking South African wines, and wine
merchants are scouring estates for good wines to add to their lists. For the
first time in many years major South African wine-tastings are being held on
both sides of the Atlantic.
On the quality front, experts agree there is no doubt that South Africa can
make good wines. Mr Simon Loftus of Adnams, the respected Suffolk wine
merchant, which for many years refused to stock South African wines, says
that although the wines are not universally up to international standards,
'the best South African wines are exceptional'.
The relaunch of South Africa's wines raises two issues: what sort of wines
should South Africa be trying to make, and what sort of image should it be
trying to project. Many international observers think South Africa should
concentrate on trying to make a good Pinotage, a red wine cultivar
distinctive to South Africa. South African producers, however, seem intent
on competing head on with classical-style French wines, like Chardonnay and
Pinot Noir.
As to image, the shining example of the successful export of an agricultural
product from South Africa is right on the wine industry's doorstep - the
deciduous fruit industry. The unrelenting focus on quality is something with
which the Cape brand name has become synonymous. Wine makers need to ensure
that they do not jeopardise the achievement of a premium reputation by
selling too much cheap wine.
The KWV, the big producer co-operative that supervises the running of the
wine industry has traditionally been by far South Africa's largest wine
exporter. Mr Jannie Retief, international marketing manager at the KWV, says
it has made tremendous progress since the easing of South Africa's
isolation. Branded natural wine exports rose by 46.2 per cent in 1991,
albeit from a low base. The KWV's target is to sell 1m cases a year into the
UK by 1995. Sales are currently about half that level.
Also boosting the export effort is a new initiative launched by Unifruco,
the export marketing arm of the deciduous fruit industry. Vinfruco is a
joint venture between Unifruco and a consortium of co-operative wineries and
independent estates in the Stellenbosch region. It has launched a range of
wines that will be aimed at the supermarket trade. Smaller independent
growers are also targeting the export markets. Mr Tim Hamilton Russell, one
of the country's leading producers, says he plans to export about 30 per
cent of his annual production of 17,000 bottles.
Insofar as South Africa does manage to produce quality wines, it is in spite
of the regulatory framework which controls the industry. Basically, the
industry has two tiers, with only about 2 per cent of the 5,000 producers
actually making wine. The rest are commodity grape growers, concerned
primarily with growing the highest yielding cultivars they can find. About
85 per cent of the crop is crushed at co-operative cellars. 'It is the total
antithesis of what you do if you want to make a quality wine,' says Mr
Hamilton Russell.
Against this background, the announcement last month by the KWV that it was
scrapping quota requirements was a very significant development that has
certainly enhanced the country's prospects of producing good wines. The KWV
has long functioned as a sort of trade union favouring the interests of
commodity growers. This latest decision, however, is likely to be of
advantage only to those at the top of the industry. Apart from lowering the
value of existing farms, new entrants are only likely at the quality end.
Previously anybody wanting to make and sell wine had to have a quota, which
attached to certain land. This presented a considerable - sometimes absolute
 -barrier to entry: buying quotas was very expensive, and if there were no
quotas available in the district where you wanted to farm, then the aspiring
grower simply had to look elsewhere.
Despite the latest initiative, the industry has some way to go before it is
free. The KWV still operates a minimum price mechanism that is little more
than a subsidy wine drinkers must pay to keep inefficient grape growers on
the land. And Mr Hamilton Russell, a leading critic of the KWV, was recently
prosecuted for unauthorised use of French terms - such as Burgundy and
Bordeaux - to describe his wines. The prosecution was in terms of an arcane
agreement between South Africa and France whereby the French would buy South
Africa's crayfish if South Africa refrained from using certain French names.
Allied to the slow trend towards liberalisation in the industry is the entry
of a new generation of winemaker - those, like Mr Hamilton Russell, who have
come to the industry through the glass rather than the soil, as he puts it.
He describes these people, who have featured prominently in the development
of the Californian and Australian wine industries, as wealthy individuals,
seeking 'second order' activities and committed to excellence. Mr Hamilton
Russell himself remains non-executive chairman of the J. Walter Thompson
advertising agency in South Africa.
These winemakers have also been trailblazers in opening up the new, cooler
viticultural areas, such as Elgin, Hermanus and Mossel Bay, which are
considered to have more favourable micro-climates for making quality wines.
They have also been at the forefront of new production developments, such as
the use of small barrels for wood maturation.
Access to international markets will improve the prospects of these
producers producing top quality wines.
Wiser heads in the industry recognise that South Africa's isolation caused
its producers to be left behind, particularly in terms of production
techniques. There is also recognition that the novelty factor from which
South African wine sales are benefitting at the moment will soon wear off if
quality is not delivered at affordable prices. These are the challenges the
local industry is now facing up to.

'SON of Drexel' was born yesterday, as a reorganisation plan filed by the
bankrupt US investment bank and already approved by the US courts, was
scheduled to take effect.
Under the plan, a successor organisation to Drexel Burnham Lambert, the once
high-flying investment bank which pioneered junk bonds in the 1980s is
created. But New Street Capital Corporation, the new company, is a pale
shadow of Drexel, which collapsed into bankruptcy two years ago. With assets
of Dollars 479m, it is essentially managing the former investment bank's
most illiquid investments.
It is owned by a liquidating trust, which is winding up Drexel's other
assets and distributing them to creditors, under the arrangements set out in
the plan. There are still about Dollars 3bn-worth of disputed claims against
Drexel, and certain transferable 'certificates of beneficial interest' will
be set aside until these are either resolved or cancelled.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Salomon included in IADB new
core banking group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers has been included in a new core group of banks picked by
the Inter-American Development Bank, another sign of its rehabilitation
following last summer's US Treasury bond market scandal.
The IADB, the largest supplier of long-term development capital to Latin
America, this year expects to raise up to Dollars 5bn in the capital
markets. It has told banks this week it is abandoning its method of
selecting lead managers for US dollar bond issues by rotation, and replacing
it with a system of competitive bidding.
Salomon has been chosen as one of only four banks which will be invited to
bid each time the IADB seeks to raise dollars. The others are Goldman Sachs,
Merrill Lynch and CSFB.
Mr Carlos Santistevan, IADB treasurer, said the choice of Salomon reflected
its efforts to improve its internal control to prevent a recurrence of last
year's Treasury auction rigging, as well as Salomon's leading presence in
the US dollar bond markets.
The IADB's switch to competitive bidding is part of the overhaul of its
financial functions, begun two years ago after the appointment of a new
management team.
It had previously rotated the lead management of dollar bond issues between
three banks in the international bond market and four in the domestic US
market. Now, a single group of seven banks will bid each time the IADB seeks
to raise dollars in the public markets for periods of more than five years,
with no distinction made between the domestic and Eurodollar markets.
'We believe that more competition and getting firms involved in both markets
will help us narrow the spreads we get for our funding,' Mr Santistevan
said. He added, though, that the bank would not necessarily always accept
the lowest bid it received.
Besides the four core banks, two others - Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan - will
be invited to bid on alternate transactions, while six others will bid on
one deal in every three.
Since its capital increase two years ago the IADB has become a more active
borrower, having raised only Dollars 1.8bn in 1990. It arranges roughly a
third of its borrowing in dollars, with a further third in yen and most of
the rest in low-yielding European currencies.
It is thought likely to undertake a similar reorganisation of the syndicate
of banks it uses to raise yen.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: International Bonds: Warm
reception for National &amp; Provincial five-year issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL &amp; Provincial, the UK building society, was the latest to cash in on
the appetite for sterling paper yesterday as conditions in the swap market
improved enough to draw in a floating-rate borrower.
Building societies are not flavour of the month in the bond market at the
moment, but the pricing of N&amp;P's five-year, Pounds 150m transaction was
sufficient to ensure a good reception. The bonds were priced to yield 65
basis points over five-year gilts, and with a steady gilt market tightened
in later trading to a yield spread of 62-63 basis points. Banks involved in
the issue reported strong demand from investors in the UK and from
continental Europe, particularly Germany.
N&amp;P's AA3 rating makes it one of the better credits in the building society
world, but ratings in the sector generally have been under pressure:
Woolwich was downgraded, following Alliance &amp; Leicester, and at least one
other major society is on credit watch.
The yield spread compared favourably with other similar building society
issues, for instance the 60 basis point spread on a five-year Nationwide
deal. However, most banks said the pricing was not over-generous, given the
possibility of more building society deals following soon.
The N&amp;P issue takes the total of Eurosterling bonds issued since the general
election to Pounds 2.2bn. The amount would be far greater, but many fixed
rate borrowers have stayed away in the hope of lower rates later in the
year, while floating rate borrowers have been kept away by a lack of swap
opportunities. The adverse conditions in the swap market eased slightly
yesterday, though not enough to attract other borrowers.
BNDES, Brazil's national development bank, returned to the international
bond markets yesterday for the first time since last autumn with a Dollars
100m three-year deal priced to yield 3.7 per cent over US Treasuries. At
below 4 per cent, the yield spread is lower than for other recent three-year
Brazilian issues. However, banks involved in the transaction said they had
little trouble in selling the bonds, given BNDES' good standing. The unrated
bank is wholly owned by the Brazilian state, though its borrowings do not
carry the state's guarantee.

Pta8bn

<TEXT>
MR JAVIER de la Rosa, the deputy chairman of Ebro, Spain's biggest foods
group, has acquired 9 per cent of the company for Pta8bn (Dollars 77.4m).
The stake has been purchased on the open market from Banco de Santander. A
spokesman said that the Kuwait Investment Office, which owns 39 per cent of
Ebro through Torras, its Spanish holding, planned to maintain its
shareholding.
It is understood that Mr de la Rosa, who is a close associate of Ebro's
chief executive Mr Manuel Guasch, would continue buying into Ebro with the
intention of acquiring 24.9 per cent, just short of the level that under
Spain's stock market rules would force a full takeover bid.
The development puts an end to speculation over the investment strategy
chosen by Mr de la Rosa, one of the most active businessmen in Spain, as
well as one of the wealthiest.
Ebro, which is the dominant sugar company in Spain and the fifth largest in
Europe, has moved aggressively to become Europe's leading rice producer
following a string of acquisitions outside Spain.
Its sales totalled Pta180bn last year.
The company is poised to expand further through the acquisition of Elosua,
the second largest domestic edible oils producer.
Negotiations which would gain Ebro a controlling position in Elosua through
a joint venture with Tabacalera, the state-controlled tobacco group, are due
to be finalised next week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, said first-quarter net profit
nearly halved to NKr800m (Dollars 124m) from NKr1.5bn last year due to lower
crude oil prices and pressure on operating margins.
Statoil warned that based on market trends so far, profit for the year as a
whole could be lower than in 1991 when it reached NKr2.75bn at the net
level.
Mr Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive, explained that last year's first
quarter was greatly enhanced by higher crude oil prices per barrel which
were pushed up on average by Dollars 3-Dollars 4 to Dollars 21-Dollars 22
mainly due to the effects of the Gulf war.
Mr Woldsdal pointed out that a high and steady level of oil and gas
production in this year's first quarter contributed to maintaining profits
at a relatively high level in spite of the oil price fall.
Group operating revenue dipped to NKr19bn from NKr19.8bn while operating
profit declined NKr1.4bn to NKr4.4bn.
ELKEM, the troubled light metals producer, plunged into a first-quarter
pre-tax loss of NKr116m from a NKr76m profit in the same period last year,
but forecast rising demand for its products in 1992.
However, last year's profit included a NKr179m gain on the sale of the
company's shareholding in Alcoa Nederland Holding.
Elkem's first-quarter performance nevertheless exceeded analysts predictions
and the A shares closed 10.3 per cent higher at NK96.50.
Group first-quarter net sales were lifted NKr106m to NKr1.988bn as operating
costs rose NKr82m to NKr1.893bn.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Securities firms to set repo
guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES firms are moving to establish guidelines governing short-term
lending between institutions collateralised on securities - known as 'repo'
trading by market participants and one of the fastest growing areas of the
international bond market.
The firms believe that the rapid growth of repo lending means that new
guidelines are required. If the industry does not move to formalise best
practice, outside authorities may intervene, bankers said.
On Tuesday, representatives of more than 20 firms active in the repo market
met with officials of the International Securities Market Association, the
self-regulatory body for the international bond market under UK law. The
firms want to establish a market practices committee within ISMA to set best
practice guidelines for the conduct of repo activity.
In addition, leading firms have been working with the US Public Securities
Agency (PSA) and Clifford Chance, the UK law firm, to draft standardised
documentation for repo transactions. Currently, firms use their own legal
documents and contracts.
Although repo activity has its roots in the late 1980s, the business has
mushroomed in Europe over the past two years. Banks and securities firms
including Deutsche Bank, Warburg Securities and Banque Paribas have become
active in a market formally dominated by the big US securities houses.
The result is that institutions in London increasingly fund themselves by
borrowing short-term using securities as collateral. Cheaper funding can be
achieved from such secured transactions than by borrowing unsecured in the
inter-bank loans market.
Repo activity carried out in London is regulated by the Securities and
Futures Authority. While the SFA has detailed capital adequacy rules for
repo transactions, the conduct of business is governed by the authorities'
general principles for all securities transactions.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Moody's puts IBJ debt rating
under review
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE debt rating of the Industrial Bank of Japan has been placed under review
by Moody's Investors Service, which is concerned about IBJ's internal
controls and its exposure to the property sector.
Moody's said that IBJ, once regarded as one of Japan's most prized financial
institutions, would face increased competition in its traditional areas of
business as financial reform proceeded, and that the erosion of its
traditional businesses may not be offset by new business areas.
Moody's said that the IBJ had a high exposure of lending to non-bank
financial institutions, many of which are in trouble because of heavy
lending to the commercial property sector in the late 1980s.
Moody's said it was concerned 'that weakness in IBJ's internal controls
could have a further impact on the bank's credit quality'.
The IBJ's difficulties were underscored earlier this week when it turned out
to be one of the biggest losers stemming from a rescue of the Toyo Shinkin
Bank, which is being split up among 22 local credit co-operatives and the
Sanwa Bank. Toyo Shinkin had bad debts of Y252bn (Dollars 1.9bn) following
the issue of fake deposit certificates which were allegedly used as loan
collateral by Mr Nui Onoue, an Osaka restaurant owner.
Some Y122bn of debt owed by the Toyo Shinkin is being forgiven. IBJ will
assume over Y40bn through IBJ Lease. The balance is to be borne by the Fuji
Bank (Y11bn) and non-bank financial institutions.
Sanwa Bank will acquire the majority of Toyo Shinkin assets for Y50bn,
although 25 of Toyo Shinkin's branches will be sold for Y18bn.
Sanwa will receive 10-year, low-interest loans worth Y80bn to help it
liquidate the balance of Toyo Shinkin's bad debt. This money will come from
the IBJ (Y50bn), the Federation of Credit Co-operatives (Y10bn) and the
Deposit Insurance Corporation (Y20bn).

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Wall Street's qualified
revolution: The impact of changes to the private placement market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years after its introduction, Rule 144a, which Wall Street hoped would
revolutionise the US private placement market, is seen to be only a
qualified success.
Rule 144a was a revision to US securities law that exempted big investment
institutions trading privately-issued corporate securities in the secondary
market from the onerous requirement of registering them with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
The SEC and the investment banking community hoped that by making it much
easier for institutions to re-sell private issues, foreign companies would
come to the US private placement market to tap a pool of investors that had
been widened by the exemption from registration requirements.
In improving the liquidity of the secondary private markets, proponents of
144a hoped that the yield premium usually demanded by institutional buyers
of 'unregistered' private securities would fall. With more US institutions
willing to buy the securities, and with investors likely to demand less
exacting yields for securities that were widely tradeable, foreign companies
would stampede towards the US private placement market. That was the theory.
The stampede never materialised, although foreign issuers have come to the
US in reasonable numbers, lured by access to a fresh pool of capital.
According to IDD Information Services in New York, almost half of the 419
deals completed under 144a (or about Dollars 10.7bn of the Dollars 26.6bn
raised) since its introduction in 1990 have been issued by foreign
companies. The UK has been the main source of business, followed by
continental Europe and Latin America, particularly Mexico.
Mr Vikram Pandit, head of equity syndicates at Morgan Stanley in New York,
says: 'Rule 144a has been a success because it has achieved what it set out
to do - open up the ability for anyone to come to the US (private placement)
market.' Yet the liquidity shortage continues to dog the private markets,
even with 144a. On the equity side, there are two reasons why.
First, the electronic trading systems that proponents of 144a hoped would
provide the foundation for a liquid secondary market have been a failure.
Investors found that the first trading system, Portal, which was set up by
the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), was user-unfriendly
and cumbersome. People quickly stopped using it, and for the past year it
has been undergoing an overhaul, and awaits relaunch.
The New York and American stock exchanges, which committed themselves to
building a trading system for 144a deals, are both awaiting SEC approval for
their systems.
Second, critics of 144a say the SEC was too restrictive in granting its
registration exemptions only to qualified institutions, those with at least
Dollars 100m invested in securities.
Mr Stephen Cooper, partner with New York law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges,
says the SEC limit 'circumscribed a universe of prospective buyers that was
too small to achieve true market liquidity'.
The drafters of 144a may have aimed the rule at the wrong target. A large
segment of the private market is made up of US insurance companies. Insurers
invest in private placement issues because, in exchange for illiquidity and
complexity, they receive premium rates, which can be locked in for the long
term.
Improving liquidity, simplifying the deals and lowering yields, therefore,
has no appeal for insurers which run 'buy and hold', not trading, accounts.
They have not bought 144a securities because they do not fit their
particular risk-reward profile.
As for the rest of the private market, it is made up primarily of mutual
funds, and they remain reluctant to get involved in 144a deals, especially
on the equity side, until secondary market liquidity has been firmly
established.
So if liquidity has been a problem, how has nearly Dollars 27bn been raised
under 144a since its introduction two years ago?
On the equity side, the bulk of the issues have originated abroad. Yet few
foreign issuers have come to the US to raise private capital in a
stand-alone issue. Those equity issues that have been completed by overseas
companies under 144a have generally been arranged alongside offerings in the
home market of the issuer. This is because US investors will only buy the
securities if they know a secondary market for the stock exists in the home
country of the issuer.
On the debt side, investment bankers have overcome the lack of liquidity
with some clever financial engineering.
To make private issues more attractive to a wider group of investors, an
increasing number of private deals have been designed so that they mimic the
qualities of public deals - the idea being to appeal to investors who
normally shun private issues because of the lack of a secondary market.
To overcome public investors' fear of illiquidity, deals have been put
together that are, in effect, underwritten private issues.
This is not the contradiction it might seem. Broadly defined, an
underwritten 144a deal is a private placement in which an investment bank
takes on an entire issue of unregistered securities from an issuer on a firm
commitment basis (such as in a public deal), and immediately resells the
paper to qualified institutional buyers.
Issuers like underwritten private deals because they appeal to a much wider
group of investors, the chances of an issue being sold at the right terms
are higher, they get their money quicker because the deals can be completed
rapidly, and the pricing is generally more favourable than on a traditional
private placement.
For their part, public investors go for underwritten private 144a securities
because the investment bank that 'underwrites' the deal guarantees a liquid
secondary market for the securities.
Ironically, these underwritten private deals end up virtually
indistinguishable from public deals. Investment bankers even make the
documentation in private issues, the 'offering circulars', look just like
the prospectuses used in public deals.
This may not be what the SEC had in mind when it drew up 144a, but
considering that the aim of the rule was to bring the chief quality of the
public market, liquidity, to the private market, who is complaining?

FIDELITY Investments, the big US mutual-fund manager, is losing Mr Morris
Smith, head of its flagship Dollars 20bn Magellan mutual fund only two years
after he replaced money manager Mr Peter Lynch.
Mr Smith, 34, said he was stepping down as head of the US's biggest mutual
fund to devote more time to his family and his religion. Mr Smith, a devout
Jew, plans to take his wife and children to live in Israel for at least a
year.
Mr Smith's resignation, from July 1, is likely to rattle Magellan's
investors. When Mr Smith replaced Mr Lynch in 1990, investors had been
concerned that he would not be able to match Mr Lynch's performance.
Mr Jeffrey Vinik, 33, will replace Mr Smith. Mr Vinik, who was once an
assistant to Mr Lynch, is currently portfolio manager of Fidelity Growth and
Income Fund with Dollars 3.7bn in assets.

results

<TEXT>
SHARES in General Reinsurance lost about 10 per cent of their value
yesterday morning, falling Dollars 8 1/2 to Dollars 79 7/8 , after the US
insurer reported a sharp deterioration in first quarter underwriting results
and warned that the rest of year would probably be 'unsatisfactory'.
The news came as American International Group, the large composite insurer,
also said it saw no pricing improvement in the domestic property-casualty
industry.
Its own shares slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 83 1/2 , and the two
announcements caused shares across the industry to weaken. Aetna lost
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 ; Cigna fell by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 51
7/8 ; and Travelers lost Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 20 7/8 .
General Re, the largest reinsurance company in the US, reported a fall in
operating profits, from Dollars 135.1m to Dollars 116.5m. The figure is
struck before realised investment gains, which increased from Dollars 15.3m
to Dollars 30.3m, and an accounting change item, which added Dollars 61m.
After-tax profits, therefore, were Dollars 207.8m, against Dollars 150.4m.
The company said underwriting results had been 'very disappointing' - the
combined underwriting ratio for the property-casualty companies worsening
from 99.7 per cent a year ago to 105.4 per cent - and warned more bad news
was to come.
'Based on the first quarter results, the lead time required for our
initiatives to take effect and several major insurance industry losses which
have already occured in the second quarter, underwriting results are likely
to be unsatisfactory for the balance of the year,' said Mr Ronald Ferguson,
chairman.
Meanwhile, AIG reported first-quarter profits of Dollars 413.9m after tax,
up from Dollars 375.4m a year earlier. Pre-tax realised capital gains
amounted to Dollars 28m compared with Dollars 23.6m.
On the general insurance side, there was a tiny underwriting loss, compared
with a Dollars 24.8m profit a year earlier. But net investment income
increased by 9.2 per cent to Dollars 308.8m, taking operating profits to
Dollars 308.2m compared with Dollars 307.9m last time.
Operating profits from the life side increased by 16.1 per cent to Dollars
141.5m, while financial services contributed Dollars 62.4m (Dollars 47m).
The insurer said it had not seen 'any material change in the pricing
environment in the domestic property-casualty industry since the last
quarter' but noted that several specialty classes of business continued to
do well.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN Airlines, the government-owned domestic airline, said yesterday
it might bid for a stake in Qantas Airways, the international carrier being
partly privatised by the federal government.
Mr John Schaap, chief executive, told staff the board had registered an
interest in Qantas, but would decide later whether to bid for all or part of
the 49 per cent stake to be sold by the government.
Qantas said this week it was considering bidding for a stake in Australian,
which will be 100 per cent privatised as part of the government's
deregulation of the aviation industry.
Mr Schaap said Australian planned to build on its strong position in the
domestic market, in which it competes with Ansett Australia, the
privately-run airline owned by TNT and News Corporation.
He said the airline was looking at capitalising on the government's aviation
policy and expanding into the international market. He indicated that
Australian was keen to begin services to New Zealand.
Mr Schaap had warned that Australia's airlines may not be able to afford to
expand quickly into the international sector. However, Qantas could provide
an opportunity for Australian to enter the Pacific market.
British Airways and Air New Zealand are believed to be interested in
acquiring stakes in Australian Airlines. Singapore Airlines is thought to be
interested in taking a stake in Qantas.
Northwest Airlines, the US international carrier, said it had formally
advised the Australian government it would not submit bids for Qantas or
Australian Airlines.
Northwest, taken private via a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989,
claimed that neither carrier met its criteria as an investment opportunity.
It said recent changes in Australian government policies increased the
uncertainty and risk associated with buying into Qantas. However, the US
airline is struggling under a huge debt burden, and some industry observers
had questioned whether it could even survive in its current form.

HARBOUR Centre Development, the listed hotel subsidiary of Hong Kong's Wharf
Group, announced a rights issue to raise HKDollars 593m (Dollars 76m) before
costs.
The proceeds will be used to finance the recent acquisition of two 5-star
hotels in the US and to build up a war chest for further hotel purchases.
Harbour Centre, part of the empire of the late shipping tycoon Sir Yue-kong
Pao, is to offer one new share for every two held, at HKDollars 5.65. This
represents a 36 per cent discount to last night's closing price of HKDollars
8.80.
The company said it believed the hotel market in the US offered excellent
value, with properties selling at discounts of up to 40 per cent to their
pre-recession valuations.
Within the past five months, Harbour Centre has invested USDollars 86m in
the purchase of the Omni Houston Hotel and the Marriott Mandalay hotel in
Dallas. The company is confident these offer significant capital
appreciation potential.
Wharf (Holdings), which owns 57 per cent of Harbour Centre, has agreed to
take up its share of the rights issue. Wharf owns the Omni hotel management
group, which will take over management of the newly-acquired hotel in
Dallas.

SENTRACHEM, one of South Africa's largest chemical companies, overcame
difficult trading conditions to record an increase in earnings for the six
months to the end of February.
Operating income was up 14.1 per cent, at R116.8m (Dollars 40.7m), while
turnover was 3 per cent higher at R1.17bn. Mr John Job, managing director,
said the improved margins reflected effective fixed cost control and
productivity improvements.
Pre-tax income improved by 38.9 per cent to R75.4m, but taxation was 53.1
per cent higher owing to the low base in 1991.
Income attributable to outside shareholders rose to R10.4m from R4.2m
because of the improved performance of the Safripol and Sena-chem joint
ventures.
Mr Job said demand from the automotive industry, an important market,
continued to decline, as did demand for plasticisers, solvents and resins.
The agricultural products division had, however, performed well, with higher
exports off-setting the impact of the severe drought at home. Exports, which
currently account for under 10 per cent of turnover, are expected to
increase in future.
Mr Job said although the economic climate remained difficult, he expected
earnings for the year to be higher than in 1991. The production base of the
group was in good shape following a R830m capital expenditure programme over
the past three years.
Earnings per share rose to 25.7 cents from 24.2 cents, and the dividend was
maintained at 6 cents per share.

board

<TEXT>
THE California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the largest
public pension fund investor in the US, said it had voted against all the
directors standing for re-election at Sears, Roebuck, the retail and
financial services group.
Sears, which has been the subject of shareholder agitation for several
years, is holding its annual general meeting on May 14. Three directors on
its reduced nine-man board are up for re-election.
Mr Dale Hanson, chief executive, said the fund's proxy guidelines normally
required a supportive vote. 'In this case, Sears' continual poor
performance, and the board's obvious reluctance to insist that Mr Brennan
(Sears chairman and chief executive) make the changes necessary to save this
company, compelled us to express our displeasure in some tangible way.'
Calpers threw its weight behind four motions put forward by dissident
shareholders at Sears, including one which requires a study of the
possibilities of splitting the group's different interests into separate
companies.
Much of the dissatisfaction with Sears centres on its large retail
operations. Some of its financial services interests, which include the Dean
Witter brokerage and the Allstate insurance company, are seen as more
attractive propositions.
The other three proposals backed by Calpers include a suggestion that the
jobs of chairman and chief executive be split between different people; a
strengthening of confidentiality of the proxy vote; and the elimination of
the staggered terms for board directors.
Calpers owns 2m Sears shares. This represents about 0.6 per cent of its
stock.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Chrysler held back in quarter by
launch costs

<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the financially stretched US motor manufacturer, yesterday
reported lower first-quarter losses, but its results were held back by the
cost of this year's crucial new product launches.
Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US motor manufacturers, reported
losses before accounting changes of Dollars 231m, down from Dollars 341m in
the same period of last year, on sales which rose from Dollars 5.85bn to
Dollars 8.19bn.
Earlier this week its Detroit rivals, General Motors and Ford, both reported
modest returns to profit.
However, both lost money in their North American motor operations and
Chrysler lacks the extensive, profitable international operations of the
other two.
Mr Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said: 'The industry is starting to show
some signs of recovery but it's not coming back as fast as we'd like. We
couldn't overcome the cost of several new product launches and other unusual
events during the quarter.'
Mr Iacocca cited the cost of launching the new Jeep Grand Cherokee sports
utility vehicle and the Dodge Viper sports car during the quarter, as well
as preparations for the launch of the company's new LH series of mid-range
saloon cars.
The LH vehicles, which have won enthusiastic reviews from the motoring
press, are the group's first new car model range in many years and are seen
as crucial to the fate of the business.
Mr Iacocca said results had also been held back by the start-up of
production at Eurostar, the company's new Austrian plant, which is making
mini-vans for the European market.
Mr Iacocca said that on the positive side the company's cash position had
been helped by an infusion from an Dollars 836m private equity offering and
the sale of part of its stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors, which produced a
net after-tax gain of Dollars 88m.
Chrysler also sold a more profitable mix of vehicles in the quarter; reduced
its heavily discounted sales to the bulk fleet market; retained its domestic
market share; and increased overseas retail sales by 17 per cent.
After a change in tax accounting rules, and a Dollars 63m loss on Canadian
property investments, the net loss worked through at Dollars 13m, or 7 cents
a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 598m, or Dollars 2.66, after
additional accounting changes a year ago.
Chrysler Financial, its financing arm, contributed Dollars 60m of profit, or
Dollars 111m after the tax accounting change, compared with Dollars 77m a
year ago.

merger possible

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Raymond Levy, chairman of Renault, the French state-owned car maker, said
yesterday he could not exclude the possibility of a merger with Volvo of
Sweden, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Levy told a financial analysts conference he has been continually
discussing with Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, ways of improving
co-operation between the two carmakers.
Their far-reaching alliance includes significant minority
cross-shareholdings. Renault holds an 8.2 per cent stake in the Volvo parent
company. Volvo in turn had a 20 per cent holding in the Renault parent
company which includes the Renault car operations. The two companies have 45
per cent cross-holdings in their respective commercial vehicle operations,
while Renault has a 25 per cent stake in the Volvo car business.
There has been speculation the two groups might merge, and Mr Levy said that
they were moving strongly in the direction of tightening their alliance.
'There may be a merger in future; I don't exclude that,' Mr Levy said.
However, 'there may be some other ways to organise us,' he added.
'Both companies are completely prepared for any move of that sort; both have
understood their real life is at stake,' he said.
Renault is 80 per cent owned by the French state, and Mr Levy repeated
earlier comments that a privatisation was possible. 'I'm not saying we're
going to be privatised in the near future, but that may come,' he said.
The two groups co-operate in purchasing and share some components. 'Little
by little that co-operation is being intensified. We are now building up
common product planning,' said Mr Levy.
He denied reports of differences between Renault and the French government
over its links with Volvo.

<TEXT>
HUNGARIAN Credit Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, announced that
pre-tax profits had fallen 50 per cent last year as bankruptcy among its
corporate borrowers spread.
Pre-tax profits slipped to Ft4.6bn (Dollars 58m) in 1991 as Hungarian Credit
Bank set aside a record Ft4.7bn in provisions against bad debts.
The bank, together with the other three large state-owned commercial
institutions, increased provisions in response to a new banking act allowing
such charges to be written off against tax.
They are also trying to clear their balance sheets in advance of the
privatisation of the sector, which was recently approved by the government.
However, bankers pointed out that Hungarian Credit Bank had not provisioned
as aggressively as the rest of the banking sector had.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Arnault lifted by Agache gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARNAULT &amp; Associes, one of the quoted companies through which Mr Bernard
Arnault, the chairman, controls the prestigious LVMH luxury goods group, saw
its net profits in 1991 rise sharply to FFr582m (Dollars 104.3m) from
FFr102m the previous year.
The company has property interests in Paris as well as its stake in LVMH, -
which markets such luxury brands as Louis Vuitton luggage and Moet et
Chandon champagne. Arnault also has a stake in Agache, which controls the Au
Bon Marche department stores and the Christian Lacroix fashion house.
Earlier this week Agache announced an increase in net profits to FFr1.82bn
from FFr230m the previous year. LVMH recently reported an 11 per cent rise
in net income to FFr3.74bn from FFr3.37bn.
The global luxury goods market had a difficult year in 1991 because of the
instability caused by the Gulf war to the important duty-free sector in the
first quarter and the deterioration in economic conditions during the rest
of the year.
Arnault's overall turnover slipped from FFr30.39bn to FFr29.28bn last year
partly because of the competitive trading climate and partly because Agache
had ceded control of the Conforama chain of furniture stores to the Pinault
industrial group half way through the year.
The Conforama deal contributed to an increase in exceptional profits to
FFr1.55bn against FFr118m.
Arnault has decided to double its dividend from FFr1.75 in 1990 to FFr3.5 a
share in 1991.

FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: ENI profits halved to L1,081bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENI, the Italian state energy and chemicals group, saw consolidated net
profits halved in 1991, falling to L1,081bn (Dollars 868.9m) from L2,072bn
the previous year.
Mr Gabriele Cagliari, ENI's chairman, blamed the lower profits on a sharp
rise in depreciation and amortisation costs resulting from increased
investment, plus extra expenses incurred in minerals exploration.
The group was also affected by slack demand in the main industrialised
countries, a 2.3 per cent drop in Italian industrial production and the
problems of the chemicals business, especially in fertilisers.
ENI is still in the process of digesting its 1990 purchase of Montedison's
stake in Enimont, the chemical group renamed Enichem. Political difficulties
in agreeing a restructuring of the chemicals industry have delayed the
introduction of rationalisation plans for Enichem. Last year Enichem's
losses were L700bn, but this excluded a further L300bn attributable to
fertilisers hived off to the subsidiary, Enichem Agricultura.
Total ENI sales rose only marginally from L50,033bn to L50,883bn, of which
L18,500bn was overseas. Cash flow was L9,513bn against L9,607bn the previous
year; net operating profits fell from L4,711bn to L3,765bn.
Mr Cagliari predicted another difficult year in 1992 given continued
uncertainties in both the domestic and main international economies. He said
ENI was concentrating on preparing for its transformation into a joint stock
company as part of government plans to privatise state holdings.
He expected Agip, the group's oil exploration and distribution subsidiary,
and Snam Progetti, its civil engineering subsidiary, would be ready for
floating up to 20 per cent of their stock in the autumn.
ENI intended to concentrate on its core energy business, he said, indicating
activities such as hotels and media ownership (the Naples daily Il Mattino)
might be sold off.
ENI's 1991 results showed it had been lessening its dependence on state
funding, with only 17 per cent of working capital coming from the Treasury.
In spite of a 36 per cent jump in investments to L9,327bn, net indebtedness
increased under 2 per cent to L23,298bn. This compared with a 20 per cent
jump in borrowing the previous year, essentially the result of financing the
purchase control of Enimont.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Making waves on the Spanish main: Peter
Bruce and Peggy Hollinger wonder whether Bibby is merely tilting at
windmills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural conglomerate which is
proposing to launch a hostile Pounds 75m bid for Finanzauto, Spain's only
Caterpillar dealer, said yesterday that it was satisfied with progress on
the offer.
The statement was issued following confusion on Wednesday night surrounding
the request by the Spanish stock exchange for official evidence of Bibby
shareholder approval of the deal.
'We always knew the stock exchange would not be approving the offer until we
delivered shareholder support,' says Mr Alan Gresty, finance director. A
shareholders' meeting will be held in London on May 14 to get formal
approval - although Bibby's 79 per cent shareholder, the South African group
Barlow Rand, has already indicated it supports the deal. Following the EGM,
the bid will become official.
Finanzauto's board rejected the bid on Tuesday, saying it undervalued the
company.
Mr Gresty remains optimistic about Bibby's chances: 'We are still very
confident as far as the way we have proceeded and the price we have
offered.'
Bibby's proposed bid is a brave adventure into unknown territory. One can
count the number of successful hostile takeover bids in Spain on the fingers
of one hand and they have all been mounted by Spaniards.
The difficulty lies in the Catch 22 situation of cross-border bids for
Spanish public companies. The Spanish takeover code - as implemented last
summer - declares that cash offers for public companies must be virtually
unconditional - ie, complete with shareholder approval. To gain that
approval, however, a UK company must publish details of the bid, and allow
at least 21 days for an EGM.
That relatively untested conflict put pressure on Bibby's proposed bid, by
forcing its hand rather earlier than it would have liked. The Spanish stock
market commission (CNMV) said on Wednesday night that it would not consider
the documentation - which it had asked for, following rumours of an offer -
as complete until it had evidence that Bibby shareholders approved of the
Dollars 133m offer. Bibby might have hoped for some flexibility on that
particular clause given Barlow Rand's support.
Still, Bibby denies that the CNMV decision alters its plans in any way, or
that it represents a setback to the proposed offer.
Finanzauto stock, meanwhile, will begin trading again on May 4 and investors
will have almost two totally free weeks to drive up the price and, perhaps,
make Bibby pay more than it had bargained for. Not surprisingly, Bibby says
it has no intentions of making a higher offer and dismisses rumours of a
white knight.
'If there is another player, it should make an offer as we have, through the
proper procedures,' Mr Gresty says.
The next two weeks will be uncomfortable for Bibby and Barlow Rand, which
badly needs Finanzauto to break its machinery business out of the crippled
South African market.
Barlow is already Caterpillar's sole distributor in South Africa, where
off-highway equipment sales have shrunk 80 per cent since 1983, and it has
also just been appointed Caterpillar's distributor in Bulgaria. But
Finanzauto operates in a market 10 times bigger than South Africa's in
earth-moving products.
While they wait, Barlow/Bibby will take succour from two things.
First, Caterpillar is supporting the bid. The US group and Barlow Rand have
developed close ties and Caterpillar stuck by Barlow Rand when many US
companies were disinvesting from South Africa in the 1980s. Even if
Finanzauto manages to find a white knight, any buyer would require
Caterpillar's approval. Perhaps conscious of this, Finanzauto is believed to
have approached a Caterpillar distributor in France.
Second, analysts in Madrid are recommending the Pta1,300 (706p) being
offered for Finanzauto's shares. 'Finanzauto may be worth more than Dollars
133m,' says one Madrid broker, 'but not with its current management.' The
shares were trading at Pta1,075 when they were suspended last Thursday.
But that criticism is not shared by analysts who track the world's cyclical
off-highway equipment markets. 'Finanzauto is far and away the strongest and
healthiest company in the equipment market in Spain,' says Mr Chris
Barrow-Williams, a sector specialist with the Corporate Intelligence Group
in London.
This is where Bibby might find itself doing battle for market and
shareholder sentiment as it waits to resubmit its offer.
Mr Barrow-Williams says Finanzauto has substantially strengthened
Caterpillar's position in Spain by widening its supply base and taking
control of Stet, Portugal's main supplier. Also, he says the 30 per cent of
Finanzauto turnover in spare parts is significantly higher than the industry
average for equipment distributors.
The sharp fall in Finanzauto profits - from Pta2.1bn in 1989 to Pta894m last
year - may have irritated the markets, says Mr Barrow-Williams, but it is
due solely to a dramatic collapse in construction activity in Spain as
government efforts to slow down its booming economy have begun to bite.
Caterpillar's overall market share in Spain has fallen from about 23 to 20
per cent in the process, mainly because of poor sales of crawler excavators.
This could be recovered as Caterpillar brings new models to the market.
Caterpillar's main rivals in Spain, notably JCB, have been hit even harder
as sales of second-hand machines have plummeted. This is because
sub-contractors, the main buyers of used equipment, have suffered worst of
all from delayed payments in big state-financed projects.
With Madrid showing little sign of easing the tight monetary policies which
have slowed down construction activity, Bibby clearly believes it is the
right moment to try to buy Finanzauto. Baring Brothers, the Barlow/Bibby
adviser in Madrid, was confident yesterday that it would have little trouble
completing the takeover.
That is in spite of the fact that, even at Pta1,300, only Finanzauto
shareholders who bought their stock after the middle of last year will make
any money selling to Bibby. 'You would have to look at what their chances
would be of getting Pta1,300 in the future,' said one Baring official in
Madrid.
Therein may lie Bibby's biggest risk in Spanish takeover practices.
Finanzauto's stockholders, are, in effect, being asked to cut and run. That
may underestimate the capacity of Spaniards to hold on grimly to their
investments until they make even the tiniest of profits.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson plans to get back on firm
financial footing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN &amp; JACKSON, which operates the Poundstretcher chain of discount stores,
yesterday announced a series of proposals which are designed to put it back
on a firm financial basis.
It hopes to be able to pay a nominal dividend for the current year.
The shares rose from 7 3/4 p to 9p.
A revolt by institutional shareholders last year led to the departure of Mr
Bryan Duffy, the group's chairman and chief executive. A new management team
was installed and Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank, was appointed to
undertake a review of the company's condition.
The group now plans to raise Pounds 15.6m through an open offer and placing,
on a 1-for-1 basis at 7 1/2 p. It is to ask the Court for permission to
reorganise the capital, which will cut the issued capital by Pounds 68m.
It is selling two subsidiaries, Advanced Technology Industries and A&amp;G
Imports, and concentrating on the core business. The sale of ATI will result
in the cancellation of Pounds 10.6m worth of convertible preference shares.
Brown &amp; Jackson also announced the appointment of Mr John Jackson as
chairman. Mr Jackson is vice-chairman of Ladbroke Group, the leisure
company, and holds a number of other non-executive posts.
The group also reported audited results for the nine months to September 30
1991, showing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.9m and a retained loss of Pounds
28.1m.
The estimated loss before tax for the full year was Pounds 7.3m and the
retained loss Pounds 21.6m.
Adjusting for the effect of the proposals, the group's debt at September 30
would have been Pounds 15.8m and its net assets Pounds 19.5m.
The group also said it had agreed to pay Pounds 3m in settlement of a claim
by the administrative receivers of Lowndes Queensway, the carpet and
furniture retailer from which the Poundstretcher business was acquired.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dollars 75m investment trust floated to
specialise in Brazilian shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST investment trust to specialise in Brazilian shares is being
floated on the London main market via a placing. The appropriately named
Brazilian Investment Trust is trying to raise Dollars 75m (Pounds 42.3m)
from institutional investors.
Up to 75m shares are on offer in the form of 15m units of five shares with
one warrant attached. Each unit is priced at Dollars 5.
The trust is being managed by Latin American Securities, which also manages
Latin American Investment Trust, the top performing trust of 1991.
Latin American Securities is a subsidiary of Foreign &amp; Colonial and it is
hoped that the Brazilian trust will be available via F&amp;C's regular savings
plan in six to nine months' time.
Shares in Latin America surged in 1991 as economic reforms and
democratisation swept the continent. Brazil has lagged slightly behind in
this process and the economy is expected to show negligible growth in 1992.
Nevertheless, its market rose 151 per cent, in dollar terms, last year.
Thew trust intends to invest in small and medium sized Brazilian companies,
which are expected to benefit as the economy recovers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cronite Group returned to profits in the six months to March 31 with Pounds
311,000 pre-tax against losses of Pounds 2.21m.
The Birmingham-based engineer has received a Pounds 7.3m offer from AFE, a
quoted French engineering company.
Trading profits of continuing activities advanced from Pounds 71,000 to
Pounds 456,000, aided by the release of Pounds 110,000 from provisions.
The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 285,000
(Pounds 663,000). The sale of Cronite Steels at the end of January lowered
borrowings significantly and gearing had been cut further by positive cash
flow, the company said.
Turnover was Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 22.6m) of which Pounds 8m (Pounds 8.38m)
related to continuing activities.
There is no interim dividend.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: MFI confirms reflotation in light of better
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI FURNITURE Group, the kitchen and bedroom furniture manufacturer and
retailer, said yesterday that it was going ahead with a reflotation this
summer.
The group was the subject of a Pounds 718m management buy-out in 1987 and
aimed to return to the stock market within three years.
However, the float was delayed by the recession which put pressure on its
trading.
Yesterday, MFI said it was planning the flotation 'in the light of much
improved trading in the first few months of 1992 and the stock market's
encouraging reaction to the general election result'.
The joint stockbrokers to the issue - Rowe &amp; Pitman and Smith New Court -
both published research on the group yesterday. They estimate that the group
will have made a trading profit of Pounds 70m in the financial year which
ended last Saturday.
They point out that, despite the recession, the group continued to trade
profitably before interest charges, with the lowest year producing a trading
profit of more than Pounds 50m. They say that MFI is the leading UK
furniture retailer with 13 per cent of the market. About 60 per cent of
sales are accounted for by products it manufactures itself.
The value of the group will depend on the amount of debt which will be
repaid from the proceeds of the float, but a figure in excess of Pounds 750m
is expected.
The group has about Pounds 500m of debt at present. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman,
said yesterday that the group would be comfortable with up to Pounds 100m of
borrowings.
It has yet to decide how much to raise in the float and shareholders who
backed the buy-out may use it to sell their shares. Asda, the food retail
group which previously owned MFI, and which has 25 per cent of the shares,
has said it is not a long-term holder of MFI.
Mr Hunt said the group, which has 174 stores in the UK, aimed to roll out
its new trading format in the UK over the next three years and has targeted
40 towns where it would like to open stores. It also aims to expand its
profitable 30 store chain in France and possibly to expand into Spain and
Portugal later.
It is also considering expanding its manufacturing business to cover
electrical kitchen appliances such as ovens, fridges and dishwashers.

<TEXT>
A JUMP in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 4.46m was announced by
Asda Property Holdings for the year to December 31.
Mr Emanuel Davidson, chairman, said the improvement was achieved through a
combination of increased trading activity, growth in rental income and
reductions in interest payable and overheads.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 31m) with net rental income of
Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 10.2m).
Earnings improved to 5.6p (2p) and, as already announced, the dividend is
raised to a total of 2p (1.85p) with a second interim, in lieu of a final,
having been paid on April 3.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs behind decline to
Pounds 3.33m at CI Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CI GROUP, which is rational-ising and reappraising strategy after growing
rapidly in the 1980s, yesterday announced a decline in profits because of
the recession.
Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 fell from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds
3.33m. This followed profits of Pounds 1.69m at the interim stage.
Mr Patrick McTighe, who became chairman last October, said CI had disposed
of its loss-making capital goods businesses, leading to an extraordinary
charge of Pounds 1.67m. Labour had been cut 9 per cent and a review of
activities was continuing, with attention focused on the core steel and
engineering divisions.
Turnover fell to Pounds 75.5m (Pounds 93.7m), reflecting disposals and
recession.
Sales within the steel reinforcement and re-rolling divisions were worst
affected, falling 22 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, but the flooring
side limited the fall in turnover to 6 per cent, reflecting resilient
industrial sales.
Earnings fell to 2.65p (2.83p). The final dividend is 1.225p to hold the
total at 2.05p.
A net cash inflow of Pounds 1.5m reduced borrowings to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds
6.4m) and led to a lower debt/equity ratio of 34 per cent (40 per cent).
Interest costs dropped to Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 1.81m).
COMMENT
CI's declining borrowings, new management and rationalisations highlight its
attractions as a recovery play. But yesterday's 21 per cent rise to 28p in
the share price was due to relief about the dividend rather than confidence
that the company is well set for upturn. This year should see the benefits
of cost cuttings and a lower interest charge. But exposure to the depressed
construction industry via its steel reinforcement and commercial flooring
operations suggest CI may lag, even if its early cycle businesses exceed
expectations. Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.5m put
the shares on about 10 times earnings with a 9 per cent yield. With the
company's strategy review yet to be completed, and more disposals possible,
uncertainty may keep a lid on the share price a little longer.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Second half puts Filofax in black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FILOFAX wiped out its first half loss to record a pre-tax profit of Pounds
493,000 for 1991, compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.55m.
Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said the improved performance - the second
half produced Pounds 1.1m - was the result of the international market for
ring binder organisers remaining strong, success of new products introduced
in the second half of 1990 and in 1991, and the fruits coming through of
work done on the international distribution network.
The outcome reflected an improvement in gross margins - turnover came to
Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 11.1m) - as well as the strict control of overheads.
Earnings per share worked through at 2.5p (losses 9.5p).
Reorganisation and restructuring costs of Pounds 602,000 (Pounds 1.3m) were
provided. Those were the last exceptional charges directly resulting from
the new strategy.
US sales for 1991 were 14 per cent ahead in dollar terms despite an overall
decline in the stationery market.

DESPITE the recession, Le Creuset, the USM-quoted French company famous for
its cast-iron cookware, produced a 5.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 3.32m in the year to December 31 1991.
Turnover improved by 5 per cent, from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 33.9m.
Mr Paul Van Zuydam, chairman, said that first quarter sales were encouraging
with volumes up in most parts of the world.
He said that this should have a positive effect on factory overhead recovery
and operating profit.
Earnings per share rose from 13.1p to 13.7p.
A dividend of FFr0.42 is proposed for the year, compared with a total of
FFr0.39 for 1990.

Bletchley Motor Group increased pre-tax profit by 21 per cent, from Pounds
623,000 to Pounds 753,000, in 1991.
This USM-quoted Vauxhall, Ford and Rover dealer, limited its fall in new
vehicle sales volume to 8 per cent, increased sales in the second hand
market, and had another good year in contract hire.
Sales and servicing accounted for Pounds 238,000 of the profit and contract
hire almost doubled its contribution to Pounds 485,000. Overall turnover
rose to Pounds 60.2m (Pounds 55.9m).
Growth in turnover had already been seen and the group was ahead of budget
in the first quarter of 1992.
Earnings per share were 15.8p (12.9p) and the final dividend is 4.1p for a
total of 8.2p (7.85p).

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Worcester opposition group appoints
Cazenove to advise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Worcester Group who are opposed to a Pounds 71.8m bid from
Robert Bosch, the German conglomerate, which the company has agreed,
yesterday appointed Cazenove, the brokers, to act for them.
Also yesterday, Bosch's adviser posted the offer document to Worcester
shareholders. It disclosed that Bosch already has undertakings to accept
from 51.4 per cent of holders, or 50.6 per cent on a fully diluted basis,
and so could go unconditional as to acceptances.
In the document Mr Michael Davies, Worcester's independent director, advises
Worcester shareholders to accept or 'it is likely that you will become a
minority investor in a company effectively controlled by Bosch'.
The document also outlines the industrial logic in combining Bosch's Junkers
boiler division with Worcester, the leading maker of combination boilers in
the UK.
Shareholders who met yesterday to discuss action are believed to account for
about 25 per cent of Worcester's capital. They think that the 225p price
being offered is too low. Some are also concerned that an arrangement giving
Worcester's management shares in the new Bosch subsidiary, rather than cash,
means that not all shareholders are being treated similarly, a requirement
of the Takeover Code.
Worcester's management will be bought out in 1996 at a price depending on
average earnings in 1993, 1994 and 1995.
The document says the management deal was 'discussed extensively' with and
approved by the executive of the Takeover Panel before the offer was
announced. The dissenting shareholders have already lodged a complaint with
the Panel and are considering an appeal to the full Panel.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: M and S near to sale of Canadian chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and JOHN THORNHILL

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS AND Spencer, the international clothing and food retailer, is at an
advanced stage of negotiations to sell its Peoples chain of Canadian
department stores to Wise Stores of Montreal.
The deal comes six months after M and S hired Burns Fry, a Toronto
investment bank, to investigate ways of retreating from its perennially
loss-making Canadian operations.
Mr Alex Wise, president of Wise Stores, said yesterday that he expected the
talks to be completed in the 'very near future.' There was an 'exact
synergy' between Peoples' 81 department stores and his own group's 49
outlets.
Both chains sell mainly clothing, houseware and appliances in Quebec and
Canada's four Atlantic provinces. But Mr Wise said their outlets overlapped
in only five cities.
Terms of the proposed transaction have not been disclosed. But analysts in
London speculated that M and S might receive anything between Pounds 10m to
Pounds 50m, depending on the terms of the deal and strength of recent
trading.
In the year ending March 31 1991, Peoples made profit of Pounds 500,000 on
sales of Pounds 81.4m, but slipped back into a small loss at the interim
stage.
M and S also operates 74 own name stores in Canada and 119 D'Allaird's
women's fashion stores. In total, its three Canadian businesses lost Pounds
3.6m on sales of Pounds 191.2m last year.
On Wednesday, the M and S board held its last meeting before announcing
annual results on May 12. The subject of how to tackle the Canadian
operations was believed to have been high on the agenda and further
announcements are expected.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Newspaper Publishing in the black but warns
on outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER Publishing, the owner of The Independent and Independent on
Sunday, has moved into profit in the first half after more than a year of
significant losses.
The company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 465,000 in the six months to
March 29, which compared with a loss of Pounds 6.46m in the same period last
year.
The 1991 loss did, however, include exceptional items of Pounds 1.9m.
However, Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the newly appointed chairman, warned yesterday
that 'in the absence of the long-expected economic recovery it will be
difficult to sustain this positive result in the second half of the year.'
Sir Ralf said The Independent held its own in the face of considerable
promotional activity by its competitors and that sales of the Independent on
Sunday had risen, in spite a cover price increase in December.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 40.8m).
Earnings per share of 2.2p compared with losses of 45p last time and 64.2p
in the full year to end-September 1991.
Sir Ralf said the company had started to reap the benefits of the efforts
taken last year to reduce costs.
Repayment of substantial bank loans out of last year's rights issue had also
helped the profit and loss account.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Aggressive Kwik Save rewarded with 6% rise:
'Shrinkage' equates to about 1% of turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE CUTTING, higher advertising costs and increased theft depressed
operating margins at Kwik Save, but the discount food retailer still managed
to increase interim pre-tax profits by 6 per cent.
They came to Pounds 51.2m in the 28 weeks to March 14, against Pounds 48.1m.
The shares closed 19p higher at 600p.
Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive, said Kwik Save had made a conscious
decision to respond aggressively to the intensified competition from Sunday
opening and the launch of new discounting fascias.
The group had increased promotional activity and cut prices - even to the
point of selling some lines below cost - to win additional sales and
increase the pressure on rivals, such as Aldi, Netto, Food Giant and the
Co-operative discount stores.
'Our policy for the past 25 years has been that attack is the best form of
defence,' Mr Seabrook said, pointing out that the group was continuing to
open stores at a rate of one a week addding to its existing portfolio of 760
Sales, excluding VAT, swept ahead by 41 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds
865.9m). The figure was swollen by the inclusion of sales from Liquorsave,
an off-licence concession bought last June.
However, grocery sales (including VAT) still advanced by 26 per cent with
sales volumes (including liquor) ahead by almost 15 per cent. Price
inflation fell from 5.5 per cent in the second half of last year to 2.1 per
cent as the group sharpened prices.
Operating margins fell from 5.3 per cent to 4.3 per cent - although this
partly reflected the inclusion of lower-margin liquor sales. Increased theft
also had an impact; 'shrinkage' equated to about 1 per cent of turnover.
The group expected cost pressures to ease in the second half and new store
acquisitions to contribute more positively. 'But we are not seeing any signs
of the end of the recession. I suspect it is still a little way away,' Mr
Seabrook said.
Earnings per share climbed to 22.29p (20.72p). The interim dividend is
lifted to 4.7p (4.3p).
Mr Seabrook deflected questions concerning his much-rumoured return to Dairy
Farm International, the Hong Kong-based group which is Kwik Save's biggest
shareholder. 'I plan on being here for at least another 12 months and the
board is very relaxed about our succession plans,' he said.
Mr Peter Hughes, who is responsible for stores operations and distribution,
has been elevated to the board. The company is still searching for a
replacement for the finance director, Mr Simon Moffat, who is leaving to
join Hillsdown Holdings.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel pays TML to ensure funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL, the Channel tunnel company, said last night that it had made a
Pounds 50m payment to Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of construction
companies building the Pounds 8bn project.
Eurotunnel, which is pursuing arbitration over an independent disputes panel
ruling that it should step up monthly progress payments to TML from Pounds
25m to Pounds 75m, said it had to make the payment in order to ensure that
funding for the tunnel was continued beyond the end of May.
Eurotunnel emphasised that the Pounds 50m payment was a necessary condition
set down by the agent banks in return for their recommendation to the
syndicate of leading lenders of a waiver permitting the project to be funded
beyond May.
The company said that the payment had been made without prejudice to
Eurotunnel's rights under the construction contract. It intended to pursue
arbitration over an increase in contractors' payments through the Industrial
Chambers of Commerce in Brussels.
Eurotunnel is continuing talks with its bankers.

FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone losses deepen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCCARTHY &amp; STONE, the loss-making builder of sheltered housing for the
elderly, was optimistic about prospects in the property market in spite of
revealing deeper losses of Pounds 6.9m for the six months to February 29.
Mr Kevin Holland, sales director, said all the elements of recovery were in
place, following the end of political uncertainty in the UK and the demise
of many competitors during the recession. Sales for March, normally a slow
month, were double those of last year, he said.
'The marketplace is still difficult, but we have certainly seen a
turnround,' he said. 'It is slightly more alive than dead.'
The stock market was less optimistic about the future, and marked McCarthy's
shares down 14 per cent from 73p to 63p.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.6m - taken above the line - dealt a heavy
blow to the interim results, which compared with pre-tax losses of Pounds
6.4m last time.
The exceptional costs, due to closing a regional office and rationalising
operations, offset the benefits of lower interest charges which fell from
Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 5m.
Bank debt was down from Pounds 87.4m to Pounds 69.2m, following the Pounds
13.3m rights issue last May and tighter control of costs. Gearing stood at
75 per cent.
Turnover for the period was 21 per cent down at Pounds 26.2m. This was the
main reason for the decline in profitability of the UK retirement homes
division, which fell from trading profits of Pounds 700,000 to break-even.
However, a lower average selling price of Pounds 68,500 - compared with
Pounds 68,900 - also contributed to the decline.
Mr Holland said the price fall had been due to a larger proportion of older
stock. He added, however, that new stock was coming on stream at a higher
rate than last year, and would improve margins in the second half.
The French subsidiary incurred losses of Pounds 300,000 during the first
half. Mr Holland said all further investment overseas had been halted.
Losses per share improved from 14.1p to 11.1p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 0.5p.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Hachette shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE shares of Hachette, the French publishing empire, and Matra, the
electronics and defence group, were yesterday suspended on the French stock
market pending the announcement next Tuesday of their proposed merger.
Hachette also announced yesterday a higher than expected loss of FFr1.93bn
(Pounds 195.2m) for 1991, compared with net profits of FFr492m in 1990.
Hachette, which owns the worldwide rights to Elle magazine, is trying to
recapitalise after making heavy losses on its ill-fated investment in La
Cinq, the bankrupt French television station.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, who controls Hachette and Matra through MMB, his
family holding company, stunned the Paris stock market in January by
announcing that he planned to merge the two groups. The news was received
with scepticism by French analysts as Hachette and Matra are in very
different areas of activity and both businesses are performing poorly.
The shares of Matra, Hachette and Publications Filipacchi, another company
associated with MMB, will remain suspended until the merger terms are
disclosed on Tuesday morning.
Mr Jean-Jacques Limage, an analyst at James Capel in Paris, said it was
'crazy to talk about the merger until Hachette's refinancing is over'.
The merger would probably require the consent of Matra's shareholders, as
MMB does not have a majority interest. There has been speculation that Mr
Lagardere might agree to cede some of Matra's peripheral businesses to its
industrial investors to finance the deal.
Matra announced on Wednesday that it was cutting its dividend after a sharp
fall in profits from FFr606m to FFr252m last year.
Hachette's position is more precarious. It lost FFr1.79bn on La Cinq in
1991, bringing the total losses on its 18-month-long investment to FFr3.5bn.
This brought Hachette into a net loss, after operating profits fell from
FFr779m to FFr636m in 1991 on static sales of FFr30.41bn.
The company is still in talks with its banks over its financing which could
involve a recapitalisation of FFr2.8bn. The refinancing may force MMB to
reduce its 52 per cent holding, thus leading Mr Lagardere to lose control of
Hachette.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Fisons disposals may raise Pounds 300m: Group acts to
concentrate on core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS yesterday announced it was offering its horticultural and consumer
health businesses for sale as part of a fundamental restructuring of the
group.
The move follows a four-month review of the company's operations and
represents a strategic decision by Mr Cedric Scroggs, the newly appointed
chief executive, to concentrate on the group's core pharmaceuticals and
scientific instruments businesses.
The sale of the horticultural business will be a final break from Fisons'
roots.
Analysts believe the disposals could raise between Pounds 250m and Pounds
300m. The consumer health operations, which made profits of Pounds 10m last
year on turnover of Pounds 84m, are likely to be easiest to sell. The
horticultural division, with units in the UK, North America and on the
Continent, made profits last year of Pounds 11.5m on turnover of Pounds
96.7m.
Mr Scroggs said the decision to sell was not because the operations were
poorly managed or unprofitable. 'We want to have global businesses, and that
goal was not achievable either in horticulture or consumer health without
significant investments.
'That investment would be better spent on the pharmaceuticals business,'
said Mr Scroggs.
He said the consumer health group, which employs about 1,000 people, was
only 10th in the UK market and 25th in the US, with turnover about 5 per
cent of the leading North American competitor. Both businesses needed
important expenditure on advertising, he said, and Fisons had no proprietary
technology to give it a competitive edge in either field.
Mr Scroggs expected more than one buyer for the operations and declined to
say when he hoped to conclude the disposals. The company was under no
financial pressure to conclude the sales and the businesses were not
bleeding cash, he said.
Within the pharmaceuticals division, Fisons would concentrate on
anti-inflammatory products and drugs for the central nervous system. The
company had some potentially interesting cardio-vascular medicines, but
wanted to package them and sell them to other companies for development and
marketing, said Mr Scroggs.
N M Rothschild, the merchant bank, will handle the horticultural division
sale, and S G Warburg and J P Morgan, the consumer health disposal.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Buxton seeks to reassure Barclays shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Buxton, Barclays' new chief executive officer and
chairman-designate, yesterday contacted institutional shareholders to
reassure them about plans for him to hold both offices.
Following Barclays' annual meeting yesterday, Mr Buxton acknowledged that
some shareholders were concerned about the concentration of authority in a
single individual and said he contacted shareholders to allay their
concerns.
'What they want is proper checks and balances,' he said, adding that steps
have been taken to insure that. Much operational authority will be devolved
to four divisional chiefs within Barclays as well as to Mr Peter Wood,
finance director. Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman, will have input into
corporate decision making, and 'he's no shrinking violet', Mr Buxton said.
The decision by Barclays' board to continue combining the roles of chairman
and chief executive flies in the face of pressure from institutional
shareholders for UK companies to improve corporate governance. Since Mr
Buxton's dual role was announced earlier this week, following the retirement
of Sir John Quinton, institutional investors have expressed disquiet.
'At the point where other companies are splitting the roles, I do not
understand why Barclays is consolidating them,' said the investment director
at one UK life insurance company. Barclays is the only UK bank to combine
the roles of chairman and chief executive.
Separately, Mr Buxton said Barclays would face stiff competition from a
merger of its two smaller competitors, Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank.
'Eventually it will be a more formidable competitor but it will take their
eye off the ball for a while,' Mr Buxton said. Full integration of the two
could take three to four years, he added. In the meantime, Barclays will
seek to cut costs, largely in its retail operations, and there will be
further branch closures, he said.
At the company's AGM yesterday, Sir John was the target of a bucket of white
paint spilt on him by 'an elderly gentleman'. Knives in the boardroom, Page

FT  01 MAY 92 / Smith manifesto seeks to set 'radical' agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, odds-on favourite in the Labour leadership contest, yesterday
unveiled a personal manifesto aimed at broadening the party's support by
promoting a fairer society with 'an economic strategy from which everyone
gains'.
To quash criticisms that a Smith leadership would represent 'more of the
same', the shadow chancellor said no policy must be seen as 'out of bounds'.
The party needed to make a 'radical response' to its fourth successive
election defeat.
Central to his agenda is the creation of a wide-ranging Commission on Social
Justice, to review wealth distribution, welfare policy and taxation in an
effort to forge a national consensus on reform.
In a key passage in the 11-page document, Mr Smith said the chief challenge
to European parties of the left was how to address societies in which
two-thirds lived in relative security while a third did not.
The task of government was not to prescribe and direct but to create an
'infrastructure of opportunity' with policies that 'bring fairness to the
minority who are in poverty while commanding the support among the majority
who are not'.
Presenting the document, entitled New Paths to Victory, at a Westminster
news conference, Mr Smith underlined his continued belief in a minimum wage
and a redistributionist tax policy.
Hinting at the need for a sharp reduction in the role of the unions, he
added that the party's first task was to ensure that all major policy
decisions are taken on the basis of one member one vote. 'We cannot approach
the next five years on the basis of business as before,' he said.
Beyond internal reforms and a fresh debate on tax and social policy, Mr
Smith's manifesto also argued that Labour must position itself as the party
of the consumer not the producer.
He stressed closer integration in Europe and pledged himself to
constitutional reform. This included a renaissance of local government,
devolved power to the regions, a Freedom of Information Bill and a Bill of
Rights based on the European Convention, fully incorporated in law, he said.
Mr Smith rejected political pacts with other parties but insisted Labour
would, under his leadership, attempt to represent the 58 per cent of voters
who rejected the Conservatives at the last election.
Reacting to the manifesto, Mr David Blunkett, campaign manager for Mr Bryan
Gould, the rival leadership contender, said the challenger's policy
positions had clearly forced Mr Smith to adopt a 'slight change in style and
approach'.
However, Mr Blunkett insisted that people should not be asked to 'line up
behind documents in an uncritical fashion' promising that Mr Gould would
launch his own manifesto after the May 7 local elections.
The leadership contest ends at a special meeting of Labour's electoral
college, including unions, MPs and constituencies, in London on July 18.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The striking aspect of Kwik Save's interim results was the reminder that
while it is opening a store a week, it has almost no debt. It uses internal
cash flow to finance expansion and does not capitalise interest. Granted,
Kwik Save's branded discount formula is a much cheaper proposition than
Tesco's or Sainsbury's. Its avoidance of rights issues, sale and leaseback
deals and borrowings is thought-provoking just the same.
It is perhaps equally significant that Kwik Save had a tough first half.
Despite a 44 per cent increase in sales, its pre-tax profits rose a mere 6
per cent, mainly because it defended its market share against rivals moving
into discounting. That meant attacking Gateway and Asda as well as Aldi and
Netto, whatever the consequences for margins. The strategy worked in that
Kwik Save actually strengthened its position, and should make enough in the
second half for its shares to be on a current year multiple of around 12. As
it happens, during the same period Sainsbury and Tesco also increased market
share. But they may have Kwik Save to thank for denying the likes of Gateway
and Asda the chance to move down market out of their way.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 7 per cent rise in ICI's first quarter profits looks in healthy contrast
to most of its Continental rivals. March and early April have seen the
beginnings of a consumer-led recovery in the US, the UK and parts of
Continental Europe, in paints, textiles and the housing market. The caveat
is that a similar improvement was seen a year ago, only to die away a couple
of months later.
The other proviso is that the 39 per cent rise in profits from
pharmaceuticals was mostly due to a slump in last year's first quarter.
Pharmaceutical profits still make up nearly half of the total. Industrial
chemicals contribute a quarter as much on double the turnover. On this
basis, it is slightly early for investors to plunge into ICI as a cyclical
recovery stock. The same message could apply to the UK equity market as a
whole.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's news that unit trust sales in March reached a healthy Pounds 1bn
might suggest that the individual punter is getting his timing right at
last. But while there was obviously a rush to beat the Personal Equity Plan
deadline at the financial year end, the word is that the bulk of money last
month came from institutions rightly convinced that the pre-election panic
had been overdone. It looks as though the poor old private investor has been
trumped again.
All the same, unit trust salesmen may have something to look forward to
after the relatively lean years of 1990 and 1991. PEPs are not only secured
under a Conservative government; also, the doubling of the unit trust limit
to Pounds 6,000 came into effect from April 5. The FT-A All Share hit a new
peak yesterday, and the stock market looks reasonably underpinned provided
the latest stirrings of recovery do not once again prove illusory.
That said, unit trust management groups are still deservedly paying the
price for greedily pulling in business ahead of the October 1987 crash on
the strength of absurdly short-term performance statistics. Building
societies, National Savings Certificates and inflation, for example, have
comfortably beaten the median UK equity fund over the last five years. Do
not therefore expect a surge of unit trust sales till the late autumn, when
the crash finally drops out of the comparisons.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: German economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Western Germany's inflation rate of 4.5 per cent in April may well prove
higher again than the UK's. But on an underlying basis the picture looks
rather different. Exclude mortgage payments, which distort the UK headline
figure, and the British rate for March is 5.7 per cent. Exclude fuel, which
has distorted the German figure since last July's temporary tax increases,
and the underlying rate for that country becomes 3.6 per cent. That would
seem a clear reason why the UK still needs an interest rate differential -
unless, of course, the underlying rates were expected to converge in the
foreseeable future.
Germany's headline rate will fall sharply in July when the oil taxes drop
out of the equation, but the underlying rate looks sticky, not least because
wage pressures have pushed service sector inflation up to 5.6 per cent. Not
all the 9.7 per cent growth in German money supply reflects distortions
arising from unification and D-Mark use by former east bloc countries.
German unit labour costs rose at an annual rate of 7.7 per cent in the final
quarter of last year: those in the UK were up 4.5 per cent in the three
months to February. That largely reflects the UK's lead position in the
cycle, however. It is hard to see the underlying rates actually crossing
over this year. If they did, there would scarcely be scope for lower UK
interest rates, since Germany's would doubtless be higher than they are
today.

FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons' slimming pill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Fisons to sell some 10 per cent of its business is welcome
evidence of the new management's ability to break with tradition. Its
consumer medicines may find a ready sale among larger drug companies anxious
to spread the risk of ethical drug research. Getting rid of the peat
business will solve an irritating environmental problem, as well as
disabusing those consumers who think Fisons is a gardening company. With
luck, the proceeds could reach Pounds 300m, which would leave the group with
over Pounds 100m of net cash.
The question is how Fisons will spend the money. The obvious answer is to
buy in drugs and delivery systems too small to attract its larger rivals, or
to engage in co-marketing of a kind unpopular with previous management.
Fisons has yet to prove that there is room for a drug company of its size to
flourish in a world of giants. But as the market has come to realise, there
is not much chance of it being subject to a hostile bid either. Since the
previous chairman left in mid-January, the shares have moved with the
market. On the basis of yesterday's deal, they perhaps deserve to do better
than that.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER BULL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Whatever happened to Wandsworth Borough Council's espousal of free
markets?
'In a Nutshell' (Management, April 28) described the locum personnel
service, Q-Tab, funded jointly by the council and Aztec. I first heard of
this venture in March and wrote to the then leader of the council, Sir Paul
Beresford, asking him to explain the rationale behind the use of public
money to subsidise a service already provided in the private sector.
I am an independent personnel consultant offering a broad range of services
to small and medium-sized organisations not having their own personnel
functions. Not only do I and other entrepreneurs like me have to face this
grossly unfair, publicly-subsidised competition, but that competition
receives free advertising in the Financial Times.
Your article makes it clear that Q-Tel is seen as a pilot which may be
expanded and replicated by other Tecs and councils. I should like to think
that these bodies will pause to think very carefully about the possible
unintended consequences of their doubtless well intentioned actions. I do
not relish the prospect of seeing the taxes I pay used to deprive me of my
livelihood.
No, I did not receive an explanation, or an acknowledgement, from Sir Paul.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL OSTROM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Some 20 years ago, when directors were less well remunerated, Lord
Kearton, in support of more enlightened treatment, was reported to be
advising British industry that 'if we pay peanuts we shall breed monkeys'. I
wonder what suggestions Lord Kearton might offer today for dealing with a
less acceptable species which has taken over.
Roger Young of the British Institute of Management ('Executive pay rises
attacked', April 27), quite properly draws attention to the inequity of a
consenting system which apparently allows certain individuals to vote
themselves extravagant rewards on the basis that they could do better abroad
and the country would be worse off if they defected.
At a recent annual general meeting it was noticeable that shareholders were
already prepared to react strongly against this form of thinly veiled
executive blackmail and I am delighted to see support for their views from
Christopher Lorenz (Management: 'Lies, damn lies and directors' salaries',
April 29) in the FT. The writing is on the wall.

Sir, Professor Rigas Doganis ('No freedom in the skies', April 30) states
that, with fare deregulation pending, Europe has already lost most of its
independent scheduled airlines; that the smaller national carriers will go
the same way; and that, in practice, fare cuts will probably be small. Would
it not be better if fares were to remain regulated, so that we could have
competition not on price but on quality of service? Does not the same
argument apply to banking?

<TEXT>
Here is an unhappy little scene, played out in Washington on Tuesday. It was
the 43rd meeting of the joint development committee of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund. Several delegations, including the Dutch,
asked whether something about population growth might perhaps be mentioned,
just as an environmental matter. The counter-attack, led by the Saudis, was
decisive. No reference to possibly the most pressing issue facing the world
was allowed.
A farce with the same script has been enacted during the preparations for
the Earth Summit in Rio. The rich countries want to register the link
between population growth and the destruction of the environment; the poor
do not.
This is absurd. According to yesterday's report from the UN Population Fund
(UNFPA) the planet is about to be overrun by mankind. We are headed for 40
years of the fastest growth in human numbers in history. Never mind the UN's
high or medium projections. On its low curve the world's population will
increase by at least 2 1/2 bn within the lifetimes of present-day university
students. That is the most optimistic forecast. It assumes that fertility
rates will fall to replacement level everywhere tomorrow morning. It is more
sensible to accept the medium expectation, that today's 5.4bn population
will double, to 10bn, by 2050.
Some idea of what this means was stated by Prince Charles last week. 'I
don't, in all logic, see how any society can hope to improve its lot when
population growth exceeds economic growth,' he said. For hundreds of
millions of Indians, Africans and Latin Americans the consequence will be
short lives of poverty and near-starvation. But the rest of us will not get
off lightly. A recent joint report from Britain's Royal Society and
America's National Academy of Sciences, quoted by the prince, described
'unrestrained resource consumption for energy production and other uses' as
likely to lead to 'catastrophic outcomes for the global environment'.
That is what to expect with 5.4bn people trying for higher living standards.
Double the number, and you double the threat. Nor is the global effect - the
one that hits us all - on the environment alone. The social and economic
consequences can already be seen in increased migration: there were 2.8m
refugees in 1976, 17.3m in 1990. Over the next 35 years, western Europe's
indigenous labour force will fall by 14.5m; North Africa's will rise by
56.6m. North America's workforce will not increase, other than by
immigration; Central America's will shoot up, by 50.5m.
That's enough demographic nightmares. The question is, will we see solutions
in the morning? One's first instinct is to get tough. Tell recipient
countries what's what. No family planning plan, no economic assistance. If
aid can be tied - as it increasingly is - to the practice of democracy, why
not tie it to the lessons of demography?
The answer given by contemporary best practitioners is subtle. The strategy
of Britain's Overseas Development Administration is 'children by choice not
chance'; its brochure of that title speaks of enabling women to take greater
control over their lives. The ODA will contribute Pounds 9m to UNFPA
projects this year; the US Agency for International Development shells out
not a cent, owing to a tight reading of a 1985 Congressional amendment to an
aid bill and a misplaced connection between UNFPA and enforced
sterilisations and abortions in China. That ancient quarrel should be
patched up. The AID administration can do it. Meanwhile, the US remains the
world's largest donor of bilateral aid for population programmes, at Dollars
250m this year. It, too, focuses on the status of women.
This is understandable. Women who are educated choose to have fewer
children. Better health and ante-natal services also reduce the voluntary
birth rate. A hard-faced demand from rich countries to poor ones to restrain
population growth would be counter-productive; a willingness to help release
women from constant childbearing and hard labour is broadly acceptable.
Some, however, reject even that. Catholic countries, as in Latin America,
are under the sway of Rome's doctrine on birth control. Can this be right?
Only the Devil could want to destroy the world by overpopulating it. Others,
like Malawi, will not see that there is a problem to be faced. The two
giants have followed different paths. China, with its uniquely harsh
measures, has cut its fertility rate to 2.3 per woman; India, which is
making good progress for a democracy, has only managed to get it down to
4.1.
The focus on womens' rights works well, but a little nudge from big lenders
might also help. In the World Bank's 1991 economic report on India there is
a table devoted to family planning methods and estimates of 'births
averted'. The cumulative total of the latter since 1956 is 136m. That is at
least a start. The Bank could do more, if its members would let it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MAJOR'S new brand of conservatism is beginning to make its mark in
Brussels. Mrs Gillian Shephard, Mr Major's new employment secretary,
yesterday did battle with the European Community's working time directive,
which lays down EC-wide minimum standards on working time, rest breaks and
holidays. She conceded little, if anything, more than her Thatcherite
predecessor, Mr Michael Howard. But she appears to have won some goodwill -
and possibly even a directive that the UK could sign up to at the next
meeting in June, thanks to more positive presentation.
The UK government has rightly opposed the prescriptive and inflexible nature
of many of the directive's proposals, for example the 48-hour limit on
weekly working. But, hitherto, the UK government has conveyed the impression
that any minimum standards in the field of employment are an affront to the
voluntarism of British industrial relations. This aggressive stance has
created an equal and opposite response from the Commission and from some
other EC countries that might have been sympathetic to the UK's stance. It
has also led to the Commission's absurd introduction of the working time
directive as health and safety legislation, requiring only a qualified
majority to pass, so side-stepping the UK veto.
Most EC countries, especially Germany, do not want to let the UK slip
further away in the employment field than the Maastricht 'opt-out' already
allows. They are ready to compromise on the working time directive, rather
than face a UK challenge to its legal basis. Indeed many of them have big
objections of their own.
Armed with a fresh electoral mandate and an attitude of 'yes, but' as
opposed to 'no meddling' the UK government might be able to coax an
acceptable agreement in June. That should concentrate on making the
proposals more permissive, by allowing the limits to be broken if there is
no health risk, if employees volunteer, or if unions and managers agree.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Railway finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL appears to have launched an early bid in this year's public
expenditure round, with a claim for an extra Pounds 7bn over the next five
years. Projects needing finance include the high-speed rail link between
London and the channel tunnel. A five-year moratorium on new rolling stock
orders is threatened unless additional cash is provided.
If the Treasury is reluctant to sanction increased government funding in an
already tight year, BR argues that it should be allowed to borrow from the
private sector. Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, has proposed that new rolling
stock be acquired by leasing, with a consortium of banks providing the
finance.
Restrictions on public sector borrowing cannot be so easily sidestepped.
Because no market exists for second-hand trains, the only kind of lease that
anybody would write for BR is one which made it liable for the full value of
the assets. The Treasury argues - correctly - that if BR buys now and pays
later, it is borrowing by another name and must be treated as such. The cost
of 700 channel tunnel freight wagons, recently acquired under a leasing deal
at advantageous terms, still counted towards BR's borrowing limit.
Critics of such rigour argue that other European rail operators such as
France's SNCF routinely raise finance on the capital markets and lease
rolling stock. But most continental railways are prone to indebtedness and
need recurrent write-offs at the taxpayers' expense. If private capital is
needed to modernise the UK's railway rolling stock, it would be best
admitted by opening up the railways to private rail operators - as the
government intends.
Rail infrastructure is a different matter. High-speed rail links between the
channel tunnel, London and the regions are essential to overcome the UK's
geographical disadvantage in the EC. They are unlikely to be built by the
private sector, and indeed the government appears to accept a role for a
publicly-owned track authority in its plans for the railways. Government
funds must therefore be found to build such links without further delay - if
necessary, by switching cash from roads.

Glancing through the television schedules, it looks like an excellent night
for going to the cinema or theatre. If you are in London you could try for
'The Pocket Dream', a funnyish disaster drama with Mike McShane and Sandi
Toksvig failing to present 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. If elsewhere you
could look for a cinema showing 'Basic Instinct' with Michael Douglas
playing the police detective infatuated with a bisexual suspect played by
Sharon Stone. The first two minutes are horrifically violent, but the rest
is like good latterday Hitchcock, though sexier than he would have dared.
If you are forced to stay at home, radio is your best bet. A relay of
tonight's concert at the Barbican begins at 7.45 on Radio 3. The Chamber
Orchestra Of Europe plays a Mozart overture and Schubert's fifth symphony,
with Schumann's piano concerto in A minor between, soloist Andras Schiff.
The panellists on Any Questions? (8.05 R4) include Peter Riddell, formerly
political correspondent on the FT, now columnist for The Times. In the Radio
2 Arts Programme John Timpson looks at what is happening in East Anglia
(10.00).

FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: Britain pays homage to emigre craftsmen - The Crafts
Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is all so familiar. The City of London street sign with its typeface
designed by Berthold Wolpe; Marianne Straub's blue/green chequered moquette
that covers the seats of the Piccadilly Line and the London buses; Alvar
Aalto's utilitarian birchwood schoolroom stool; the distinctive dustjackets
of 1940s and '50s Faber &amp; Faber.
The Crafts Council's current show reminds us how easy it is for the British
to overlook the fact that so much of what has come to be considered
quintessentially English is rooted firmly in wider European traditions. Even
the title of the exhibition illustrates the point: 'Influential Europeans in
British craft and design'. I thought we were European; obviously the Crafts
Council disagrees. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this richly varied and not
uninteresting show is muddled and, for an exhibition about things European,
depressingly parochial.
Too much is taken aboard. There is a passing nod to the craftsmen who
settled in Britain before the 20th century, and a fragmented selection of
disparate contemporary work. The show begins with a 17th century Mortlake
tapestry panel woven by Flemish weavers, 18th century Huguenot silver and
mid 19th century crystal made in Stourbridge by Bohemian refugees. It closes
with Elisabeth Holder's minimalist jewellery, Andre Dubreuil's steel
neo-Rococo 'Ram' chair and Jan Zalud's chilling wooden automata.
There is a central coherent group, albeit unhelpfully dispersed. Its
furniture, ceramics, textiles and typography are witness to the impact of
Bauhaus Modernism on design throughout Europe, and to the exodus of
well-trained professional craftsmen and designers from Central Europe during
the 1930s. To Britain came ceramicists Lucie Rie, Hans Coper and Ruth
Duckworth, for instance, and jeweller Gerda Flockinger. A ream of textile
designers and weavers, including Zika Ascher, Jacqueline Groag, Margaret
Leischner Marianne Mahler, Tadek Beutlich and Hans Tisdall, rapidly made
their mark on textile design and production. Typographic and graphic design
was transformed by Wolpe, at Faber's 1941-75, Hans Schmoller at Penguin -
responsible for our Pevsners - Hans Schleger and FHK Henrion.
Entry into Britain up until 1938 was restricted to those with proof of
adequate financial resources, and sponsors were crucial. Ralph Beyer, whose
serene and beautifully judged inscriptions for Coventry Cathedral are a
highlight of the show, arrived through the good offices of his art historian
father's friend, Erich Mendelssohn. Margaret Marks came through the
assistance of Heal's, which had been the principal outlet for her ceramics.
Most of the men were interned in 1940, and so too was the weaver Margaret
Leischner, a gentile. There is a dignity and courage about these sombre
works of the 1930s and '40s.
What is more difficult to convey (and no attempt is made) is the shock of
the starkly functional Modernist aesthetic. The British Arts and Crafts
movement in particular had become increasingly insular and isolated. How
did, say, the clean lines and controlled decoration, and urbanity, of a
Lucie Rie cup and saucer look to those used to Leach's traditional
fat-bellied brown jugs? The response can be gauged in part by the success in
Britain of what became known as Scandinavian Modern, which represented a
more human face of Modern Movement mass-production with its respect for
natural materials.
It is revealing, too, that it was the emigre craftsmen rather than the
architects and designers who tended to remain in Britain. Marcel Breuer, for
instance, whose plywood 'Long Chair' stretches out across the show's central
space, came to Britain in 1935 to join the architectural practice of FRS
Yorke, but left for America two years later. Britain seemed to prove more
congenial to Rie (DBE), Coper and Flockinger (CBE) who established
international reputations from a British base.
The quirky individualism and integrity that continues to characterise the
applied arts in Britain have attracted later generations of students from
all over Europe. That brings us back to the scrolls of Andre Dubreuil, a
pioneer of the new metal furniture who has now returned to France, and the
Post Modern desk of Floris van den Broecke, currently the head of the Royal
College of Art's furniture department. The dialogue between Europeans
continues much as before.
'Influential Europeans' continues at the Crafts Council Gallery, 44A
Pentonville Road, Islington, until June 14, and travels to Truro, Cardiff,
Hull and Wakefield.

especially if the requirement is for thousands and not just a handful.
Nijal, a French company, has produced the first automated system for
producing kebabs, capable of producing a mould of compressed meat every 40
seconds and up to 7,500 kebabs weighing 100 grams each an hour.
Food such as beef, pork, chicken or fish is placed in a mould and
compressed. It then enters the machine where the meat is skewered, centred
and cut into kebabs. The production process is controlled by a programmable
logic controller with the number of kebabs produced displayed on screen. In
addition, the process produces no waste. Nijal: France, 31 4297 0625.

<TEXT>
Retailers can cut shoplifting losses by using a new device developed by
Knogo, the Marlow-based subsidiary of the the world's biggest electronic
article surveillance producer, writes Richard Lapper.
The device, dubbed KnoGlo, is a tag filled with indelible crimson or yellow
stain which ruins articles if unauthorised removal is attempted.
One version, the mini KnoGlo, is designed for use with a Knogo's electronic
anti-theft system, while the Universal KnoGlo can be attached to most brands
of tags.
On a three-month test marketing trial the mini-tag was fixed to designer
jeans in stores where losses of 5 per cent had been recorded. No thefts took
place during the period. Knogo: UK, 0628 483040.

Water contamination in diesel fuel can cause breakdowns, particularly in
cold weather when the water freezes.
Unlike other diesel additives Aquasolve, a new product marketed by Shurflo,
of Reigate, Surrey, and based on research by the Thermo-Fluids Engineering
Research centre at City University in London, bonds the water to the fuel to
form a solution that burns cleanly with no adverse effects or power loss.
Shurflo also claims the blending helps improve combustion, cleans engines
and reduces emissions. Aquasolve is equally effective treating fuel
contaminated with sea water and prevents bacteriological growth caused when
diesel fuel is stored in tanks. Shurflo: UK, 0737 242282.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Voice mail comes to the rescue - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the aftermath of the devastating explosions that killed 200 people in
Guadalajara, Mexico, last week, thousands of people desperate to hear from
friends and relatives found telephone lines jammed, writes Louise Kehoe.
In response Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) transformed its new corporate
'voice mail' service into an emergency message system. By making a free
telephone call victims of the disaster were able to leave messages, as could
callers from outside the area.
Telmex staff, making use of lines not available to the public, passed on
these messages. In the two days following the disaster, Telmex received some
13,000 messages to the emergency service and delivered word from victims to
at least 4,000 anxious relatives and friends.
What made Telmex's rapid response to this tragic event possible was a
recently purchased Centigram Communications' programmable voice processing
system. Designed to provide 'voice mail' services to large corporations, the
system was remotely reconfigured from the manufacturer's California
headquarters in a matter of minutes. Centigram Communications: US, 408 428

FT  01 MAY 92 / The argument against dumping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Ward, appointed to Cranfield School of Management's newly created chair
in strategic information systems, sees his principal task as finding ways
for business people to appreciate the problems and potential of computers -
without their having to get involved in the technology.
He is particularly concerned by the current trend towards 'outsourcing',
where managements hand over their information requirements to a contractor
from outside the company.
Some organisations, he agrees, have clear objectives in farming out their
data processing; others, perhaps the majority, are simply dumping a function
which they find hard to understand or manage.
'If a company finds it difficult to control information technology in
house,' he says, 'it will find it even more difficult to manage it out of
house.' And if the computer systems are of strategic importance to the
company - which most are, these days - reversing the situation will prove
expensive, he predicts.
Ward, now 45, spent 15 years in industry as an information systems manager,
most recently with International Business Machines and Kodak.
He joined Cranfield in 1984, fascinated by the links between business and
information systems strategy.
Christopher Edwards, who holds the chair in management information systems
at Cranfield, and Ward are planning a research centre; Asda, Procter &amp;
Gamble and BP Chemicals, for example, are involved in a research project on
the efficiency of inter-company electronic messaging.

<TEXT>
ENSIGN TANKERS (LEASING) LTD v STOKES (FT, March 17) Ensign and four other
British companies participated in a scheme whereby they contributed Dollars
3.25m to the cost of the making of a film in return for 25 per cent of the
exploitation receipts. The scheme was a single composite transaction
embodied in 17 documents. Under the scheme, a partnership agreement was made
between Victory Film Productions Ltd as general partner and the five British
companies as limited partners. Victory was a wholly-owned subsidiary of LPI,
the Californian production company. The partnership was granted worldwide
exploitation rights by LPI. In the tax year 1980 to 1981, the partnership
incurred capital expenditure of Dollars 3.25m in the provision of 'plant',
namely the film. The negative belonged to the partnership, subject to the
distributors' exclusive exploitation rights. It also owned 25 per cent of
the exploitation receipts. The partnership therefore fulfilled the
conditions necessary to generate a first year allowance of Dollars 3.25m
under section 41 of the Finance Act 1971, provided the expenditure was
incurred 'for the purposes of the trade'. Allowing Ensign's appeal that the
transaction was a trading activity, the House of Lords stated that the
Ramsay principles did not apply to the Dollars 3.25m, because that was a
real - and not a magical - expenditure, so that a trading transaction could
plainly be identified.
DAVY OFFSHORE LTD v EMERALD FIELD CONTRACTING LTD (FT, March 18) By a
contract dated November 30 1992 between Emerald and Davy, Davy was to supply
a platform called a floating production facility (FPF) and other works. Davy
was concerned that title to the goods and works might pass to Emerald before
it had been paid the greater part of the contract price, and without its
receiving some of the documents necessary to operate a letter of credit
opened in its favour. In determining when and in what circumstances title
would pass, Mr Justice Hobhouse concluded that the property was to pass upon
acceptance by the bank of the documents, that is, at the time when the bank
decided that they complied with the requirements of the credit. Dismissing
Emerald's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated business sense supported that
construction. One would not expect the parties to provide that passing of
title should be deferred until trivial amounts were paid, but not until Davy
was in a position to draw the largest proportion under a letter of credit.
THE LAW DEBENTURE TRUST CORPORATION v THE URAL CASPIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD
AND OTHERS (FT, March 20) By agreements in 1986, each of the four Russian
companies, who were the first four defendants in the present action, entered
into covenants with Law Debenture Trust as trustee for the shareholders.
Each company covenanted to pursue its compensation claim for loss of
business since the Russian revolution and confiscation of their assets by
the Soviets and to pay any compensation it received to the trustee. In each
agreement, Leisure which had made an offer for the entire share capitals of
the Russian companies, covenanted to procure that the company could perform
its covenants and not part with control unless the transferee entered into
similar covenants. Leisure then agreed to sell its entire shareholding to
another company H, (the fifth defendant) and imposed no requirement that H
should covenant with the trustee. H transferred its shares to C, the sixth
defendant. In striking out parts of the statement of claim and in giving
leave to amend, Mr Justice Hoffmann stated that the question was whether
there was an authority to impose a positive duty to perform the covenants of
a predecessor and whether interference with contractual relations could be
extended to interference with the remedies arising out of a broken contract.
The case would be argued at the trial when the relevant facts could be
established.
THE REPUBLIC OF SOMALIA v WOODHOUSE DRAKE &amp; CAREY (SUISSE) SA &amp; OTHERS (FT,
March 24)
When a cargo of rice, bought and paid for by the Republic of Somalia,
arrived off Mogadishu, the master refused to enter port because of the
fighting. In the shipowners' summons against the charterers as to what was
to be done with the cargo, Mr Justice Hirst ordered that it be sold and the
proceeds paid into court. The 'interim government' of Somalia now sought the
funds in a payment out of court. Refusing, Mr Justice Hobhouse stated that
whether a government existed depended on: (a) whether it was the
constitutional government; (b) the degree, nature and stability of
administrative control it exercised over the territory; (c) whether the UK
government had any dealings with it; and (d) (in marginal cases) the extent
of international recognition. On the evidence of the instant case, the
'interim government' did not qualify as an existing government under those
criteria.
ISC TECHNOLOGIES LTD AND ANOTHER v GUERIN AND OTHERS (FT, March 25)
The plaintiffs, who were English companies, were the subsidiaries of
International Signal and Control Group plc (ISC) which merged with Ferranti
plc in 1987. The plaintiffs claimed that between 1983 and 1989, Mr Guerin,
executive chairman of ISC and other persons, conspired to commit fraud
falsely to inflate ISC's profits and deceive Ferranti. After final judgment
had been entered against all but two of the nine defendants, leave was
granted to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction on an ISC director, Mr
Pindell, on the allegation that he had knowingly participated in the fraud.
Refusing Mr Pindell's application that leave should be set aside, Mr Justice
Hoffmann stated that in Cordoba Shipping (1984) 2 Lloyds Rep 91, it was held
that where the substance of an alleged tort was committed within a certain
jurisdiction, it was not easy to imagine what other facts would displace the
conclusion that the natural forum was the courts of that jurisdiction. In
the instant case, that prima facie conclusion had not been displaced.
POLLY PECK INTERNATIONAL LTD v NADIR &amp; OTHERS (FT, March 27)
The administrators of Polly Peck International had been granted a Mareva
injunction inter partes against Central Bank, a North Cyprus bank, within
the UK and limited to Pounds 38.9m. The administrators contended in a
pleaded case of constructive trust, that Central Bank either had actual
knowledge that the funds were being improperly diverted away from PPI, or
that circumstances should have put the bank on inquiry that that was so.
Discharging the injunction, the Court of Appeal stated that first, PPI's
case against Central Bank was no more than speculative. Second, it was wrong
in principle to grant a Mareva injunction so as to interfere with the normal
course of the defendant's business. To impose a Mareva injunction that would
have that effect in order to protect a cause of action that was no more than
speculative was not simply wrong in principle, but positively unfair.
REGINA v SPENS (FT, March 31)
The fraud proceedings against Lord Spens were discontinued when the health
of his co-defendant, Roger Seelig, broke down and it was decided not to
proceed against Lord Spens alone. In refusing an application that a verdict
of not guilty should be entered, Mr Justice Henry stated that Section 17 of
the Criminal Justice Act 1967 provided that where the prosecution proposed
to offer no evidence, the court 'may if it thinks fit, order that a verdict
of not guilty shall be recorded'. In exercising that discretion, the court
would grant a permanent stay by ordering the indictment to lie on the file
so that Lord Spens would be treated in the same way as Mr Seelig. Further,
the defendant's costs under section 16(2)(a) of the Prosecution of Offences
Act 1986 would be refused because, by his conduct, he had brought
prosecution on himself. However, with regard to his legal aid contribution,
on the figures before it, the court was satisfied that Lord Spens' financial
position was not such as would enable him to pay legal aid contribution and,
having regard to his overall liabilities, the entire contribution would be
remitted.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Hammond, sales director of The Post Office, is taking time off from
selling parcels to promote the 'unsung' merits of the East Midlands.
Hammond, 54, is taking two years' secondment to become the chief executive
of East Midlands Enterprise and of its governing body, the East Midlands
Investment Campaign.
East Midlands Enterprise (EME) has been launched by the East Midlands
Confederation of British Industry and local authorities in the area to
encourage inward investment.
Hammond, who will leave behind his chauffeur-driven car, has a sound track
record in selling; 25 years in sales and marketing with Unilever and
SmithKline Beecham before joining The Post Office as sales director in 1984.
He says the technique for selling soap powder, toothpaste and the Post
Office are the same; 'You have to communicate with people.'
He admits he was frustrated in the public sector for a number of reasons,
including the slowness of decision-making. Keen to demonstrate his
entrepreneurial skills, he says he already has a clear business plan for the
region and a 'unique and creative promotional plan'. Recent inward investors
to the region include Toyota, the Japanese car manufacturer.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Greed alleged in insider deal case: 'Network of friends'
employed by financial institutions deny charges in biggest British
prosecution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'NETWORK of friends' employed by financial institutions used
price-sensitive inside information about imminent takeover bids to make
profits for themselves or clients, it was alleged at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
In the case, the biggest UK insider dealing prosecution, five people deny
charges under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act.
Mr David Gray, formerly a stockbroker with Morgan Grenfell Securities, faces
two charges of unlawfully communicating unpublished price-sensitive
information to another person, two of dealing on the basis of such
information and one of counselling or procuring another person to deal.
Mr William Liggins, a former Lazards fund manager, is accused of two
offences of dealing and one of communicating.
Miss Catherine Rowlands, who was employed in the corporate finance
department at Samuel Montagu, is charged with three offences of
communicating information. Mr Mark Riding, former fund manager with the
Co-operative Insurance Society in Manchester, faces three dealing charges.
Mr Keith Tondeur, formerly UK head of principal trading and sales with
Banque Paribas, faces one dealing charge.
The alleged offences relate to three takeover bids in 1988. Hawthorn Leslie
Group, the USM-quoted cellular phone company, acquired ECT Cellular and
London Car Telephones; Australian company Goodman Fielder Wattie made a bid,
which lapsed, for UK foods group Ranks Hovis McDougall; and Mecca Leisure
acquired Pleasurama, the leisure group.
Mr Peter Clarke, prosecuting for the Department of Trade and Industry, said
some of the defendants had passed information to others, who had acted on it
by dealing in shares or by passing it on and advising other people to deal.
Profits had ranged from just Pounds 1,200 to Pounds 20,000, but the case
concerned an important principle about the misuse of inside information.
Mr Clarke said the jury would hear several hours of recorded telephone
conversations between Mr Gray and other defendants peppered with references
to being unable to talk freely, or arrangements to see or speak to each
other out of office hours or away from colleagues.
Mr Clarke said the five's motives had included personal greed, winning the
respect of others, repaying favours and enhancing their own reputations. But
whatever their motives, 'the fact is that it was illegal and they all knew
it'.
Miss Rowlands had been the source of the inside information about RHM and
Pleasurama, Mr Clarke alleged. Samuel Montagu had been GFW's main adviser
and Mr Gray would be heard on the tapes referring to 'Wickets', Samuel
Montagu's codename for GFW, in a conversation with Miss Rowlands. Samuel
Montagu had also acted for Mecca. Miss Rowlands had not been part of that
team but had learned of the pending deal from a colleague who had warned her
not to buy Pleasurama shares, Mr Clarke said.
The trial continues today.

FT  01 MAY 92 / More doorsteps bring parties down to earth: How weary
politicians are preparing to fight next week's council elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE parties at Westminster, next Thursday's local elections are less
than a month and yet more than a world away from the general election.
The national election required politicians to make predictions of victory
that were derided as hopelessly bullish by all but hardened supporters. The
local polls, in contrast, have produced a chorus of modesty.
The profile of this second contest is much lower. There are no poster
campaigns, no national newspaper advertisements, and - apart from Mr Paddy
Ashdown of the Liberal Democrats - there is not a party leader in sight.
There is the faint impression that the parties might even have forgone the
election broadcast to which each is entitled if such a course could have
been arranged.
Labour is on the defensive in the aftermath of a general election defeat
many voters did not expect. 'We wouldn't regard April 9 as the best
preparation,' said one party official with masterly understatement. The
party is also contesting seats it won at a peak of local success in 1988.
A veil is drawn over Labour morale in some areas, though it is said to be
adequate in areas where the party captured parliamentary seats.
There are still attempts to look on the bright side. The record of
Labour-led authorities such as York in developing ideas for good-quality
services is mentioned with pride as a justification for trust in Labour
local government.
For the Liberal Democrats, the main fear is that their failure to win some
of their main parliamentary targets may have created a bandwagon stuck in
reverse gear.
Against this is Mr Ashdown's vision of a nation anxious to purge itself of
the shame of voting Tory last month, and the fact that the party does not,
this time, have to spend weeks just trying to imprint its identity on
voters' minds.
The Tory campaign seems the most relaxed. The strategy of Central Office's
local-government unit strategy appears to be to rely on the momentum created
at the general election.
Ministerial campaigning seems confined to the environment team. The campaign
has been reinforced by successful Tory candidates for the Commons repaying
canvassing done on their behalf by councillors. Former MPs who lost their
seats, including at least one ex-minister, are also taking part.
The Tories, at least, need not worry about the message they are seeking to
convey. It is simply a variation on the theme in the general election of
better management providing good yet affordable public services, with a dash
of reform.
The other parties face the dilemma of how far to play up the government's
policies for local government. They know that these may well be unpopular,
but also that they cannot offer much hope of change on fundamental issues.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said that it was 'the counsel
of despair' to point out that no matter what the results next Thursday, the
council tax devised by the Tories would still replace poll tax. That does
not make its replacement any less likely.
Labour has sought to broaden its message to appeal to voters worried about
the future of local services under the 'arch-privatisation' ministers now at
the Department of the Environment, and to offer local government as a
constitutional check on an untrammelled fourth Tory term.
The Liberal Democrats have argued the constitutional line and promised to
deliver services more efficiently within the current system.
Such claims may seem more grandiose than their forecast of the result.
Though starting from a base year - 1988 - which marked the nadir of their
fortunes, when they lost about 70 seats, the Liberal Democrats talk merely
about gaining only 'more than 50'.
Similarly, fresh from the election triumph, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party
chairman, spoke of perhaps gaining control of a few councils rather than
concentrating on the total number of seats gained.
This has led Labour to suspect that the Tories may seek to produce the
'Westminster and Wandsworth' effect of 1990, so that highlighting one or two
gains allows losses elsewhere across the country to slip into obscurity.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Sizewell replica to aid nuclear training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FULL-SCALE replica of the future control room at Sizewell B, the
pressurised water reactor nuclear power station due to start up on the
Suffolk coast in 1994, opens today. It will be used to train Sizewell's
operators.
The replica is housed in Cliff Quay, a futuristic building next to a disused
power station on the River Orwell at Ipswich. It has been built by Nuclear
Electric, the state-owned operator of the nuclear power stations in England
and Wales.
The control room mimics Sizewell down to the carpet tiles. Its sophisticated
Marconi-designed software 'thinks it is a power station', according to
Nuclear Electric.
For the operators, the control room 'feels exactly like the real thing',
explained Cliff Quay's principal, Mr Brian Malloy. It can simulate
everything from escaping steam to a mouse chewing through cables.
The system, Nuclear Electric said, is infinitely more sophisticated than a
flight simulator. It is based on one of a few existing models of a nuclear
reactor core, designed by Combined Engineering of the US. It may also be
used to train nuclear industry staff from what was the Soviet Union and
eastern Europe.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Plea over closure of creamery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY CREST, the Milk Marketing Board subsidiary, is coming under pressure
to justify its decision to close its creamery at Hawes, North Yorkshire, the
only Wensleydale cheese-making plant left in Wensleydale.
The closure, costing 59 jobs, has been described by local businesspeople and
councillors as a catastrophe for the area.
Richmondshire District Council is calling for an urgent meeting with Mr John
Houliston, Dairy Crest chief executive, to find out the reasons behind the
closure, which was announced last Friday.
However, the company said yesterday that the decision to cease production at
the end of this month and transfer Wensleydale cheese-making to Longridge,
Lancashire, was necessary for economic reasons. The company said the Hawes
creamery needed investment running into six figures to comply with the 1990
Food Safety Act, whereas Longridge had modern facilities and spare capacity.
It appears unlikely that Mr Houliston will agree to meet the council.

THE COMMITMENT by British Gas to halve its share of the industrial gas
market by 1995 could cut the company's profits by Pounds 100m a year, Mr
Robert Evans, chairman, said yesterday. That would mean a reduction of 10
per cent in its overall income, he added.
He said the company had developed strategies - agreed with the Office of
Fair Trading - to compensate for the drop in its UK business. Mr Evans added
that British Gas was on target to earn 40 per cent of its profit from
international exploration and production with 20 per cent coming from its
Global Gas unit by the end of the decade.
Other development projects include opportunities in power generation and
exploration of the market for gas-powered vehicles, Mr Evans said.
He stressed that the price formula imposed by the OFT was a tough one. It is
to last five years and limits price increases to five percentage points
below the rate of inflation. Mr Evans added that changes in the company
after its deal with the OFT meant it had a strong case for a mid-term review
of the formula.

THE Hong Kong authority responsible for building and operating the colony's
new airport has been given provisional authority to borrow HKDollars 23.3bn
(Pounds 1.67bn) to finance the construction of the airport, though it will
take months before it is ready to approach the world's capital markets,
writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
Mrs Anson Chan, a senior Hong Kong official, said the Provisional Airport
Authority's (PAA) capital funding requirement - including interest payments
and fees associated with the borrowings - was HKDollars 38.2bn, in March
1991 prices.
The PAA's finance director said the authority would be seeking the
longest-term financing that was available from the market.

path

THE decision by South Africa to liberalise its aviation policy, with the aim
of bringing the country into line with international norms, has been given
added urgency by the normalisation of political and economic relations with
the rest of the world, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
Mr Piet Welgemoed, transport minister, said recently that 25 airlines, from
Europe, the Middle and Far East, South America, Africa and Russia had
applied to fly to the country. The South African government announced a
series of measures on Wednesday, including tariff deregulation, and said it
would allow more than one national airline to fly routes to South Africa.
The policy will have a considerable impact on South African Airways (SAA),
the national carrier, which has been protected from competition as all fares
for flights to and from South Africa have been set at levels determined by
SAA's operating costs. SAA also enjoyed protection as the only national
carrier flying the main international routes.
The most important changes concerning scheduled air services are the
deregulation of tariff control and allowing each country to designate more
than one airline to serve on a specific route between two countries. A
likely beneficiary of these changes will be Virgin Atlantic which is hoping
to start a five-flight per week service to South Africa in October. During a
visit to South Africa in March, Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's owner, said he
thought fares could be reduced by 35-40 per cent.
The policy will also allow designated airlines on a certain route to expand
or cut services by virtue of demand and supply, while Cape Town and Durban
will also be promoted as gateways to South Africa.
From a domestic point of view, existing or future airlines will now be free
to compete with SAA on its established routes. Mr Jan Blake, managing
director of the recently formed Flitestar airline, has already given notice
that the company hopes to pioneer scheduled services to India and the United
Arab Emirates and to become the second designated carrier on routes to the
UK and Germany.
The new policy also encourages charter flights and will involve the
ratification of various conventions which should make it easier and more
beneficial for South African airlines to obtain foreign financing.

FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: AT&amp;T criticises Brussels rules on telecom
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community was criticised yesterday for protecting its
telecommunications companies from foreign competition by a senior executive
of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US telecommunications group.
Mr Randy Tobias, AT&amp;T's vice-chairman, said that the market to provide
telecommunications services throughout the Community was largely controlled
by state-owned monopolies and that these monopolies favoured 'national
champions' to supply them with equipment.
'There are large numbers of both formal and informal constraints that keep
markets closed,' Mr Tobias said. 'We will all be better off when we get to a
fully open, competitive environment.' Mr Tobias focused his attack on the EC
directive on public procurement, which he said could require
telecommunications operators to buy only equipment with more than half its
content made in Europe.
This directive has been a bone of contention between the US and the
Commission, with the former threatening sanctions if it is not altered by
the end of the year. The Commission has countered by arguing that the US
market is closed.
Mr Tobias, however, said the US market was much more open to competition
than Europe. He said AT&amp;T only had 41 per cent of the US market for
telecommunications exchanges, while foreign companies had 52 per cent. By
contrast, Alcatel of France had 92 per cent of the French market and
Germany's Siemens had 85 per cent of its home market.

INDIA and Taiwan reacted angrily yesterday to the US decision to act against
the two countries over their alleged failure to protect intellectual
property rights.
The Indian government said the US decision to reduce trade benefits to India
was 'unjustified'. Members of parliament from all parties accused the
administration of trying to bully India into falling in line with its
thinking on world affairs, especially international trade issues.
The US cut Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.8m) worth of Indian goods from the US duty
free preference scheme, directed at Indian exports of pharmaceuticals,
chemicals and related products. The US said it was in retaliation for
India's inadequate protection of patents in the pharmaceuticals industry.
Mr P Chidambaram, the Indian minister of commerce, said the government had
neither yielded nor would it ever yield to pressure from the US on trade or
any other matter.
The Taiwanese government yesterday condemned as unfair the US decision to
add Taiwan to its 'priority watch list' for infringement of US intellectual
property rights.
Mr Sheu Ke-sheng, director general of the board of foreign trade, said the
action would only hinder the development of trade relations between the two
countries. Taiwan, the world's 14th largest trading nation, was recently
warned by the US that it would join India and Thailand on the list of
nations found to engage in unfair trade practices if it failed to curb
copyright violations, which consist largely of software, video and US
brand-name piracy.
Although Taiwan submitted its action plan to the US in mid-April, it appears
not to have satisfied US demands for self-inspection of goods for export,
and heavier penalties for violators. The island could face retaliatory
tariffs of up to 100 per cent, or even restriction on some exports. Hardest
hit by any retaliatory action would be Taiwan's fast-growing personal
computer industry, which is making inroads into the US market.

<TEXT>
A FORMER Buenos Aires banker has been sentenced to five years in jail and
fined Dollars 8bn for 'aggravated economic subversion' and fraudulent
administration of a bank that failed in 1980.
Mr Raul Pinero Pacheco was accused of ruining Banco de Intercambio Regional
by diverting loans to companies he owned. He was a director of the bank when
it collapsed owing Dollars 1.3bn to clients. Fines and interest on that
amount compounded over the years are calculated at Dollars 8bn. However,
when bailiffs attempted to seize Mr Pacheco's assets, they found that he had
no personal wealth. He remains free while he appeals against sentence.
Mr Pacheco was only one of a number of businessmen and bankers who set up a
constellation of banks and finance houses during a period of financial
deregulation during the late 1970s. Lax supervision and a climate of
speculation led to massive fraud calculated at Dollars 15.8bn at the time as
banks collapsed under the weight of bad loans made to their owners and
directors.
Mr Roque Fernandez, central bank president, has said bank crashes were one
of the causes of Argentina's heavy inflation and collapsing public finances
during the 1980s as the central bank was forced to take on private
liabilities, through its unlimited deposit guarantee scheme. It repaid
depositors by printing money.
The wheels of Argentina's judicial system grind slowly and only a few
bankers have been tried for offences that took place over 10 years ago. Mr
Pacheco has suffered the heaviest punishment yet.
Many prominent bankers, businessmen and politicians are also accused of
similar financial scandals, but have yet to come to trial. Among them are
former members of President Carlos Menem's entourage.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Fujimori makes most of breather: Peru's president
consolidates his hold on power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE hiatus between the Organisation of American States' fact-finding
mission to Lima last week and its crucial verdict on those findings, Peru's
President Alberto Fujimori is consolidating the power he grabbed on April 5.
Internal direction of the International Monetary Fund-approved economic
adjustment programme seems assured by the ratification of Mr Carlos Bolona
at the helm of the economy - after a nail-biting five days when all
involved, including fellow cabinet ministers, had confirmed his resignation.
The three long-standing pillars of Mr Fujimori's regime remain firm: rumours
that a sector of the military might defect to support 'alternative
president' Maximo San Roman seem to have been scotched - both the armed
forces and the police have reiterated their loyalty to Mr Fujimori.
Second, the business community is little short of euphoric since Mr Bolona's
ratification and the appointment of their own Mr Jorge Camet, twice
president of the private businessmen's lobby Confiep, as the minister for
industry and commerce.
And four out of five people, according to the polls, back Mr Fujimori and
his unchecked onslaught on legislature and judiciary.
'April 5 did for Mr Fujimori what the Gulf War did for President (George)
Bush,' says Mr Manuel Torrado, chief political analyst at Datum, a leading
Lima market research company. Datum polls immediately before and after the
autogolpe (self-generated coup) show a 15-point leap in Mr Fujimori's
personal standing.
Surveys of opinion show that the people on the streets of Lima, home to more
than a third of Peru's 22m population, are primarily concerned with crushing
poverty and unemployment, terrorism and 'delinquency'.
'In the face of all this,' according to Mr Torrado, 'the constitution,
freedom and democracy just aren't the issues.'
Mr Fujimori has long gained political mileage from his attacks on lazy,
overpaid parliamentarians (he once dubbed them 'pachydermic') and venal
judges ('jackals'). He has so successfully undermined the legislature and
judiciary that the general public has now joined him in declaring open war
on the other branches of government.
Deposed parliamentarians led by Mr San Roman meet, discuss constitutional
reform and publish timetables for a return a democracy, but most Peruvians
scoff at their efforts as irrelevant.
Meanwhile, Mr Fujimori and his closest, unelected, advisers handpick Supreme
Court judges, the Comptroller General of the Republic and the directorate of
the central bank. While Senate ratification - by no means automatic - was
previously required for high-level posts, now the presidential will is
sufficient.
'The danger of all this,' one foreign diplomat observed, 'is that the few
checks and balances on the traditionally powerful Peruvian executive have
vanished like springtime snow.'
The only possible rein on Mr Fujimori is international opinion. Peru's image
with creditor nations has been boosted by Mr Bolona's survival but he will
have a lot of explaining to do when he visits Washington, probably next
week, with a letter of political intent.
Like many other Lima-based economists, Mr Augusto Alvarez considers that
poor advice from his closest advisers - who tend to be men from military
intelligence - led the President seriously to underestimate the impact on
Peru's still shaky economy of a suspension of international financial
support.
'They calculated economic damage in accounting terms and thought they could
survive the suspension of US aid,' says Mr Alvarez. 'They forgot that the US
is the foundation of Peru's support group, which allowed international
financial relations to be normalised. And all other arrangements with the
IMF, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the Paris Club
(of official creditors) hang on that.'
So far, the government shows no sign of defaulting on debt payments - if
they continue until the end of 1992, Peru will be eligible for fresh funds
from the IMF and World Bank. But continuing to pay without the covering
support group funds will tax monthly cash flows to the limits. Meanwhile, to
maintain the high levels of popularity on which his legitimacy rests, Mr
Fujimori will have to spend.
'Business, the armed forces and the population at large have given Fujimori
a blank cheque,' says Mr Alvarez. 'But it's a cheque with a time limit. They
will want to see something in return.'
Already international reaction and suspension of aid have given Peru's
financial sector a fit of the jitters. Dollar withdrawals from the
commercial banking system in the three weeks after the coup totalled about
Dollars 240m, a tenth of total deposits. This caused still further
contraction in tight liquidity, making loans harder to find and pushing
interest rates higher. While exporters and local manufacturers benefited
from an initial 10 per cent devaluation of the sol, the exchange rate
appears to have stagnated again.
On the two fronts used by President Fujimori to justify his April 5
dissolution of Congress - more effective action against drugs trafficking
and terrorism - there has been more activity in the latter than the former.
The Sendero Luminoso guerrilla group's propaganda newspaper El Diario has
been dismantled and its editorial staff arrested; Peter Cardenas, allegedly
number two in the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) command has been
captured; and the military on Tuesday hit Raucana, a Sendero-controlled
shanty-town on Lima's outskirts, arresting two leaders in a bloody battle
which left at least one dead and several injured.
While there are growing calls for 'dialogue' from many sectors of the
population - the overwhelming majority of whom support a swift return to
constitutionality in an as-yet unspecified manner - President Fujimori shows
little sign of responding.
Unless and until opposition leader Mr San Roman can catch the popular
imagination and mount an effective challenge to Mr Fujimori, it appears that
only pressure from abroad will ensure an early return to democracy.

JAPAN is to halt all production and consumption of harmful ozone-depleting

reports from Tokyo.
The move will bring Japan in line with the US and the European Community, an
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said.
Japan decided to announce the new target now so that Japan, the US and
Europe would speak with one voice at the United Nations-organised Earth
Summit in Brazil in June.
The Montreal Protocol calls for a total ban of CFCs and the other main
ozone-destroying culprits - halons, carbon tetrachloride and
111-trichloroethane - by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S recovery from 18 months of recession will be significantly
slower than forecast by the government, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development says in a report published today.
The Paris-based organisation says gross domestic product will grow by 0.1
per cent in the current financial year, followed by 3 per cent growth in the
year to June 1993.
It also says unemployment, now 10.5 per cent, will remain above 10 per cent
for the next two years, and that inflation will rise from 1.7 per cent to 4
per cent by 1993.
The OECD forecasts paint a more pessimistic picture of Australia's
short-term economic prospects than the federal Labor government, which says
GDP will grow by 4.25 per cent in 1992-93.
The government forecasts inflation will rise no higher than 2.5 per cent by
1992-93, with unemployment falling to 9.25 per cent by June 1993, the last
possible date for the next federal election.
The OECD's economists appear not to have considered the impact of an
economic statement in February by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, in an
attempt to boost economic growth.
Mr Keating announced the injection of ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 980m) into the
economy as the first part of a four-year recovery programme intended to
create 800,000 jobs and stimulate annual GDP growth of around 4 per cent
until the mid-1990s.
The report gives support to the government's attempts to open the economy to
international pressures through industrial deregulation and reductions in
tariff protection.
The OECD criticises the government's handling of monetary policy, which it
says contributed to the severity of the recession.

FT  01 MAY 92 / China chips reluctantly away at its 'iron rice bowl': Why
the policy of 'smashing' the system of safe state jobs is pursued
half-heartedly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A worker in the city of Hefei, made redundant from his job in a chemical
factory, killed the factory manager by running him over twice with a truck.
He was sentenced to death last month.
Like most workers in Chinese state factories, Mu Huining, had grown
accustomed to a world where no one could be sacked, unless caught gambling
or fighting on the job or failing to turn up at work with no good reason.
In China this is the state sector system of the 'iron rice-bowl',
guaranteeing workers not only a job for life, but free medicine and
schooling, subsidised food and subsidised housing. The system also has a
secure 'iron chair' for the factory managers, good or bad, and the same
'iron wages' paid to workers whether they work or not.
Official policy is to smash the iron rice bowl, pay higher wages to the
harder-working and sack the surplus workers who account for anything over 10
per cent of a factory's payroll.
The aim is to make the state enterprises competitive and profitable. A third
of them are losing money. They cost the state billions of yuan in subsidies
every year, and the more competitive collectives, private businesses and
foreign joint ventures are growing much faster. These now account for almost
half China's total industrial production, up from less than 25 per cent in
1980.
Reforming the state sector, especially labour reform, is 'in' in China, as
it has been off and on for years. A journalist told of visiting a factory in
the mid-eighties which claimed to be implementing labour reform, offering as
proof the fact that two workers had been sacked. When the journalist asked
what their offence was he was told they had not turned up for work for six
months.
Smashing the iron rice bowl is easier to say than put into practice. The
tendency is to chip rather than smash. The problem is a worker who is fired
loses all the other perks that go with a state job which form the basis of
China's social welfare system, catering to more than 100m workers.
It is not surprising factories tread warily. Even adjusting wages can be a
risky business. A recent report from Yunnan province said a truck driver
went beserk after a row with his bosses over pay and rammed his vehicle into
cyclists and pedestrians, killing nine and injuring 25. Chen Deping, aged
43, was executed.
The Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory claims to be a model of reform. When Wuhan
established a sister city relationship with the German city of Duisberg, the
factory brought in a retired German manager for two years to help with
modernisation. Since 1987 new workers have been employed on labour
contracts, and 15 per cent of the workforce is now on contract.
Labour minister Ruan Congwu has said contracts do not weaken the workers'
position as 'masters of an enterprise', rather they 'legalise' labour
relations.
In practice, contract workers can only be fired if at the end of five years
their performance is found to be not good enough. Four have been sacked but
the labour contract is not very different in reality from the old life-time
deal.
Few companies, let alone the communist government, would be happy about
laying off large numbers of inefficient workers, depriving them and their
families of housing and free services and risking the growth of a hostile
army of urban unemployed. The government particularly fears the emergence of
a Polish-style Solidarity movement.
Most Chinese workers, surveys show, are not anxious to lose their job
security either. Even a model factory such as Wuhan's diesel engine plant,
is a long way from seriously grappling with the problem. Real progress, say
economists, will only be possible when China develops a social security net
and reforms the housing market so that shelter is not tied to employment.
The goal of a free labour market, they say, would not only give individual
employers the right of hire and fire, but the workers the right to choose
their job. Chinese workers who want to quit for a better job must pay their
employer 'compensation'. A state employee who quits may find himself barred
from other state enterprises. There are not enough jobs for the number who
want them in the fast growing non-state sector.
Urban unemployment is put at less than 2.35 per cent, but the figure
disguises a massive problem of underemployment.
Like most state enterprises the Wuhan plant is plagued by the 'debt
triangle' where one factory owes millions to another and is in turn owed
millions by a third. It is owed 19m yuan (Dollars 4.9m) and owes 11m yuan it
cannot pay until it collects its debts.
Moreover its profit level is low because the government fixes the price of
its engines to its main market, the farmers. The factory would double the
price if it were free to do so.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GUERRILLA commander Mr Ahmad Shah Masood yesterday assumed his position
as Afghanistan's strongest figure, inspecting the capital Kabul from a black
Mercedes limousine as his troops took up posts around the city in scores of
armoured vehicles.
Late on Wednesday, Mr Masood had ridden triumphantly into Kabul in a
three-mile-long armoured column that reached the capital after skirting a
final attempt by his rival, the radical Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, to block his
way to power.
As Mr Masood's column rode south from Bagram air base it was fired on by
fighters of Mr Hekmatyar. The column made a quick detour to another road,
and the convoy - carrying thousands of Mr Masood's fighters and his ethnic
Uzbek allies - proceeded to Kabul.
Mr Masood, who is the new defence minister, appeared to be gearing up for a
new offensive against Mr Hekmatyar.
With the backing of his fighters, Mr Masood can wield considerable sway over
the new President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, and the prime minister designate,
Mr Ustad Fareed. Both are seen as comparitively weak figures.
'Every group which is fighting the government, which is not acceptable to
the majority of the people, is a rebel and subversive,' Mr Masood said.
It was clear that Mr Hekmatyar - who according to mujahideen and diplomats
attempted to take power for himself in a joint coup attempt with ethnic
Pushtouns in the left-wing government last week - was heading toward
isolation.
Members of the ruling 51-member ruling council met Mr Masood for the first
time yesterday to discuss, among other topics, Mr Hekmatyar's future. Before
the meeting a spokesman for Mr Mojaddedi said: 'It is up to the council to
decide. But in my opinion, there is no more chance for Hekmatyar to enter
the council. He was given the chance to be prime minister of Afghanistan.
Instead he decided to fight his fellow mujahideen.'
Mr Hekmatyar was said to be with his forces some 20 miles south of Kabul at
Chorosyab.
Mr Noor ul-Haq Ulomi, a Warning, Overset column general of the deposed
regime who has appeared to establish himself in the early stages of the new
government as a prime military figure, said an offensive was planned against
Mr Hekmatyar today or tomorrow. Another general, who asked not to be
identified, said the offensive would involve a combined force of former army
soldiers, mujahideen and ethnic militia.
After almost a week of violence, only a few shells and small arms fire were
heard in the capital. Meanwhile, signs emerged of the new Islamic government
taking hold. In the luxury Chicken Street district, merchants stopped
selling hard liquor, saying they feared trouble from mujahideen guerrillas
running the city of 2m people.
Women who had strolled unveiled in short skirts next to other women in full
burkha, were carefully covering their faces.
Mr Najibullah, the former Moscow-back president, has not resurfaced since
his attempt to flee the country two weeks ago.

A SOUTH AFRICAN judge yesterday sentenced to death a white police captain
convicted of murdering 11 blacks in an attack aimed at sympathisers of the
African National Congress.
It was the first time a member of the security forces had been sentenced to
death for a politically motivated killing, and will fuel controversy over
the role of police in black-on-black violence which has left 11,000 people
dead since 1984.
Mr Justice Andrew Wilson of the Supreme Court in Pietermaritzburg, Natal,
found Captain Brian Mitchell had ordered four black constables to carry out
the killings in the Trust Feed black settlement outside Pietermaritzburg in
December 1988. The court heard that Mitchell had meant the constables to
kill ANC sympathisers whom he regarded as terrorists but that the wrong
people, including women and children, were attacked. The constables were
also convicted of murder and received effective jail sentences of 15 years
each. In giving judgment last week, the judge said there appeared to have

FT  01 MAY 92 / Afghanistan takes stock after 13 years of civil war: David
Housego drives across a devastated country still divided between its
victorious rival factions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE Spinza hotel in Jalalabad, the manager looked blank-faced and shook
his head.
Over the last 13 years of civil war he had been forced to take in Russian
officers or officials of the former Afghan communist regime. But we were the
first western visitors seeking a room - and prepared to pay for it - he had
seen for several years. For until Mr Sibghatullah Mojaddedi took power in
Afghanistan this week at the head of an interim Islamic administration, the
road from Kabul that winds down through Jelalabad to the Khyber Pass and
Peshawar across the Pakistani border had been closed to foreigners.
But the manager said he could do nothing. The hotel - a stylish mansion set
in an orchard but now like everything in Jalalabad heavy with the dust and
scars of war - been taken over by the local mujahideen council. He had no
power to allocate rooms.
Our party of five journalists had hired an open pick-up truck to make the
journey from Kabul to Pakistan because there are still no passenger flights
out of the Afghan capital.
The journey started ominously. Tanks and artillery were shelling Kabul
airport and Martyr's Ridge which overlooks the city. We passed under the
barrels of tank guns firing on the ridge.
The checkpoints through the Kabul gorges - which the previous week had been
jointly manned by soldiers, paramilitary forces and Islamic guerrillas -
were largely abandoned.
At Sarobi, a small town halfway to Jalalabad, came a blunt reminder that the
conflict that has erupted between rival mujahideen factions - and thus
between rival ethnic groups - could be a long one. The pictures of President
Mojaddedi that we had seen earlier abruptly gave way to pictures of Mr
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islam.
Sarobi was packed with heavily armed Hezb supporters, demonstrating his
continuing strength among the Pushtouns of the south-west and their
determination to resist domination by non-Pushtouns backing Mr Mojaddedi.
Further down the road, we passed a dozen lorries full of Hezb guerrillas
with automatic weapons and rocket launchers heading for Kabul. They were
just ahead of the first convoy of trucks loaded with wheat that Pakistan is
sending to the Afghan capital.
Between Sarobi and Jalalabad, we saw the devastation that the war has
caused. Villages beside the road lay abandoned after being flattened during
the war by Russian and Afghan forces denying cover to the guerrillas.
At the sides of the road were the remains of hundreds of Soviet tanks,
armoured personnel carriers and trucks that had been hit by the mujahideen -
a symbolic graveyard of Soviet power.
On the outskirts of Jalalabad, we passed a checkpoint too quickly and an
angry Hezb commander fired into the air to call us back. He then questioned
us aggressively before letting us pass.
We entered Jalalabad as night was falling and as lightning illuminated the
Khyber range of hills beyond.
The town was the scene of a large-scale but abortive mujahideen offensive in
1988. Scarcely a window now remains.
Turned away from the Spinza hotel, we spent the night at the Korshid, a
doss-house in the bazaar.
We left Jelalabad at 4am. Much of the area from there to the border has been
under the control of extremist Arab guerrillas, devotees of a local Afghan
saint. But most checkpoints were deserted.
Instead, on either side of the road, were huge fields of opium poppies that
heve helped finance several guerrilla groups.
At the Afghan frontier post, a new board had been put up to mark the change
of government. It announced that we were leaving the 'Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan'. But it was characteristic of the anarchy now prevailing in the
country that there were no immigration or customs officials to check us out.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S new deputy defence minister, Mr Andrei Kokoshin, yesterday warned
Ukraine that Russia alone could observe and sign nuclear treaties as
successor to the Soviet Union.
The issue has been complicated by this week's statement by Mr Leonid
Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, that the US was willing for all four former
Soviet states holding nuclear weapons - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and
Kazakhstan - to sign the strategic arms reduction treaty.
The dispute between the former Soviet states is delaying signing of the
Start treaty and talks on a Start Two, which Mr Kokoshin is anxious to
begin.
Mr Kokoshin said Russia's new defence doctrine would involve the armed
forces playing a purely defensive role. Troops trained to operate behind
enemy lines in a war in Europe would be redeployed as rapid reaction forces
for emergencies. The army would be reformed on more west European lines.
States could have nuclear cover provided by Russia, 'though they might have
agreements with other nuclear states as well'.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Shevardnadze reigns over Tbilisi ruins: A daunted former
Soviet foreign minister back in Georgia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MONTH since his return to his native Georgia, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,
whose premonitions about a military coup and disagreements with Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, forced him to resign as Soviet
foreign minister, is daunted by the challenges he faces.
Speaking in his office in Tbilisi, just a short walk from the old KGB
headquarters and prison now in ruins, Mr Shevardnadze said the decision to
come back to Georgia had been difficult.
'I am not sure - and I am still not sure - if it is possible for Georgia to
come out of the crisis. I knew I had to participate in trying to get the
country out of this mess. I knew I had no right just to watch from the
sidelines.'
His friends say Mr Shevardnadze, the republic's communist party leader from
1972 to 1985, returned to heal the wounds and unite Georgian society, ripped
apart last January.
During three weeks of bloody street fighting in Tbilisi, a cosmopolitan
Caucasian city, opposition parties fought to oust Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the
republic's nationalist and hardline president elected a year ago.
More than a hundred people were killed, and parts of the capital were
destroyed. The fighting pitted the urban population against the countryside,
which supported Mr Gamsakhurdia.
Under Mr Gamsakhurdia's rule, Georgia virtually became a pariah state. All
links were cut with the outside world, and with Russia, its neighbour on
which it depends for most of its raw materials and energy.
This is one reason industrial production has plummeted 40 per cent compared
with a year ago. Some 80 per cent of enterprises were at a standstill in the
winter because of energy shortages.
On his return to Tbilisi, Mr Shevardnadze moved quickly to restore links
with the international community. The republic is now a member of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank and Georgia's independence has
been recognised by the US and the European Community.
But Mr Shevardnadze said such recognition was not enough to snuff out the
opposition, restore stability and revive the economy.
'The opposition is diminishing. But only last week, it tried to blow up a
tunnel linking the western parts of the republic with the east,' he said.
'The opposition will not continue to diminish if the economy does not
improve. What good are slogans of democracy for people who are hungry? Other
little Gamsakhurdias will emerge if we do not tackle the economy.'
Relief supplies from the US have brought some respite, especially for the
hospitals. But Mr Shevardnadze, who heads the State Council, an interim
broad-based body which has replaced parliament and the presidency until
elections next October, is working on an economic reform programme.
This entails plans for privatisation aimed at attracting foreign investment,
and tapping the creative and entrepreneurial skills of Georgians. Mr
Shevardnadze and Georgian economists believe the economy of this republic of
5.5m, rich in manganese deposits, citrus fruits, spas, and tea, will then
prosper.
Mr Valerian Advadze, chairman of the council's economic commission, said IMF
and western credits would help Georgia negotiate its Dollars 1.3bn share of
the former Soviet Union's external hard currency debt.
Mr Shevardnadze, meanwhile, is eager to consolidate relations with
neighbouring Ukraine, Armenia, and Turkey, as well as Russia. 'We are
drawing up a detailed agreement with Russia which will cover economic,
trade, military and political issues. We will retain the rouble as the unit
of currency,' he said.
On the question of Russian troops, Mr Shevardnadze is more cautious. 'This
is a difficult problem. Of course no country is happy to have the presence
of a foreign army on its territory . . . but the Russian - and not the
Soviet - army is defending our borders with Turkey,' he said.
'If we withdraw them, our borders will be completely open. Georgia is not
ready to defend its own frontiers. We are forming our own army, but it is
very expensive since our economy is completely destroyed,' he said.
As for Mr Shevardnadze's own future, he remains reticent. 'I will stay here
in Georgia, though I have not yet decided to stand in the elections. Maybe,
if the democratic parties form a block, I would be interested in standing -
but only as an independent,' he said, confirming that, as in the past, he
will be nobody's man.

Bombs in Madrid yesterday damaged the Labour Ministry and the headquarters

companies, Tom Burns reports from Madrid.
While the bombs were small and the damage slight, the explosions were a
dramatic prelude to today's May Day rallies, which will underline a growing
union revolt against government policies. In the wake of government cuts in
unemployment benefits and of plans to legislate curbs on wildcat strikes,
unions have planned a half-day general strike on May 28 and further
stoppages in October.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies have risen to the top of the pack of foreign investors in
east Germany, buying 66 companies since 1990, according to the Treuhand
privatisation agency.
However, French companies retained their lead by size of investment,
promising to commit DM2.3bn (Pounds 780m) to their east German acquisitions.
British companies were second, at DM1.5bn (Pounds 510m), and the Swiss third
at DM657m (Pounds 223m).
At the end of last year the Treuhand reported that British investors had
bought only 26 of the east German companies on its books, putting them in
third place after France and Switzerland, which had acquired 44 and 42
respectively.
Although there has been some direct growth in acquisitions by the UK, most
of the change in the league table is accounted for by a change in the
Treuhand's criteria.
The agency had previously ignored companies with partial British ownership
and has now decided to include them.
UK companies said they would guarantee nearly 14,000 jobs in their east
German takeovers, second to the French who promised to guarantee 14,743
jobs, said the Treuhand.
US companies have bought only 19 east German companies but pledged
investments of DM1.5bn (Pounds 510m). Japanese companies, however, have been
prominent by their absence.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Greek resentment rises as Macedonia seeks recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIDE of Greek resentment is rising as international recognition of the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia comes nearer.
Greek possessiveness about the name Macedonia is manifesting itself in
innumerable ways, most notably in a demand for rings, brooches and
cuff-links with the insignia of Alexander the Great, the ancient king of
Macedonia, which Athens jewellers are struggling to meet.
'We carry all sorts of reproductions of ancient coins but people ask
specifically for the Macedonian ones,' says Maria Lalaounis of Ilias
Lalaounis, a leading jeweller.
Trucks, taxis and aircraft cabins, meanwhile, are plastered with stickers
proclaiming 'Macedonia is Greek'. Even the post office is franking letters
going abroad with a similar legend.
In the past, ancient history was a powerful weapon for Greek leaders as they
argued to be included as equal members of western European political and
economic organisations.
But Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, can expect an
unsympathetic hearing tomorrow when he attempts to defend, at an informal EC
foreign ministers' meeting, his country's refusal to recognise Macedonia
under its present name. Mr Mitsotakis took over the foreign ministry two
weeks ago after sacking Mr Antonis Samaras, who proposed that Greece veto EC
recognition of Macedonia and close the borders with its northern neighbour.
The Portuguese EC presidency has done some quiet diplomacy in an attempt at
reconciliation. The Macedonian government is ready to make concessions, such
as accepting a Greek demand to amend the constitution, to avoid implying a
territorial claim on the Greek province of Macedonia, and promising to stop
anti-Greek propaganda. But Mr Mitsotakis is unwilling to break the deadlock
by accepting New Macedonia, the compromise name being suggested, for fear of
provoking a rebellion in his party.
Mr Samaras's hardline views have made him the country's most popular
politician. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the opposition leader, endorses his
position, and has called for a blockade of Macedonia. But many Greek
politicians believe recognition is inevitable in the next few weeks,
especially after Monday's proclamation in Belgrade of a new, truncated
Yugoslav state.
While there is little pressure on Mr Mitsotakis to exercise a veto, he will
have to find a good excuse for not closing the border. In the year since
civil strife erupted in Yugoslavia, Greek exporters have come to terms with
paying higher transport costs to send goods to western Europe through
Bulgaria or by ferry to Italy.
'There are compensating factors. The overall decline in trade with the
ex-Yugoslav republics created a buyers' market here for hiring trucks. It
also means more space available on ships and fewer delays at Salonica port,'
a northern Greek businessman says.

FT  01 MAY 92 / BAe freezes management pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE has frozen the pay of its 2,500 management staff this
year, it was disclosed yesterday.
It has also emerged that directors' pay was reduced last year.
The management pay freeze was disclosed by Sir Graham Day, the outgoing
chairman, at the company's annual shareholders' meeting.
It reflects the continuing difficulties the group faces in several of its
main business activities including commercial aircraft, cars and property
because of the slump in these markets.
Sir Graham told shareholders the company felt it was appropriate in the
circumstances to freeze the pay of executive staff.
The pay freeze coincides with continuing large-scale rationalisation and
restructuring at the company.
In the past year, 10,000 jobs have been lost and, in February, an additional
2,750 job cuts were announced.
The company's annual report for 1991 also shows that directors' pay has been
cut. The highest paid director, believed to be Mr Dick Evans, the chief
executive, saw his pay reduced by 18 per cent to Pounds 338,110 last year
from Pounds 414,211 in 1990.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (22): An ambitious
programme - Taiwan: Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIPEI is yet another teeming, sprawling congested Asian city which has long
outgrown the ability of its roads, railways, power generation and other
services to cope with the rapid growth of its economy and population.
Everywhere there is evidence of new construction, from scaffolding and tower
cranes to the concrete stumps which will carry the elevated sections of the
city's new Dollars 18bn mass transit railway.
This is a country in the middle of rebuilding its infrastructure with a vast
Dollars 300bn six-year development plan approved last year by the Taiwanese
government.
The programme is very ambitious and expensive. There will be opportunities
for international contractors, designers and consulting engineers to bid for
work in areas where the Taiwanese lack skills
The Taiwanese will need international assistance to design and build the
large numbers of bridges and tunnels needed as new roads and railways push
across its mountainous terrain.
Core electrical and mechanical systems for power station and railway
construction - generating sets, rolling stock, signalling, automatic
ticketing systems - will also need to be imported.
Bilfinger and Berger, the German construction group, recently won a TDollars
18.8bn (Dollars 750m) contract for a 4.5km section of Taipei's Dollars 18bn
Mass Rapid Transit light rail system. The contract includes construction of
four stations and all the electrical and mechanical equipment for the route.
Matra of France and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, have
separately supplied the core system and rolling stock for the TDollars 25bn
first section to opened of the mass transit railway which is due to start
operations next year.
The Taiwanese government, concerned at a rising trade deficit with Japan,
has asked the state-owned electricity generating corporation to try to buy
equipment and design assistance from countries other than Japan.
International companies in many cases will be expected to bid in joint
venture with local firms.
The main elements of the six-year plan include:
Roads: Approaching 1,500km of new motorway are planned by the end of the
century under national and provincial investment programmes. A 117km
Northern Second Freeway between Hsinchu and Taipei, expected to cost
TDollars 176bn, is under construction.
There are plans to build a TDollars 60bn freeway 31km long between Taipei
and Ilan in the north-west. This will require five long tunnels.
A much more ambitious proposal is to build a 444km expressway up the western
side of the island which will join up with the Northern Second Freeway to
connect Kaohshiung in the south of the island to Taipei in the north. It
will run parallel to the existing and often congested Sun Yet-Sen freeway.
The road will be let in three sections costing a total of TDollars 550bn.
Mass Rapid Transit: About 60 per cent of the contracts for the 88km Taipei
mass transit railway are already let. About TDollars 50bn for electrical and
mechanical work, however, has still to be let. Most of this will go to
internal companies.
Planning for a mass transit railway in Kaohshiung is well advanced and will
provide more opportunities for overseas contractors. Several more such
railways are planned for other Taiwanese cities under the six-year
development plan.
Energy: A big power station construction and expansion plan is proposed. The
publicly-owned Taiwan Power Company wants to spend Dollars 93.8bn over the
next 10 years on increasing the country's productive capacity from 18,383MW
to 28,500 MW. It says the programme is essential to prevent power cuts which
occurred last summer.
The six-year plan envisages about Dollars 35bn being spent by 1996 on
building and expanding power stations. High-Speed Rail: A 345km high-speed
rail link between Kaohshiung and Taipei represents one of the biggest single
investments proposed by the Taiwanese government. Planning and design have
been approved but the budget for the TDollars 426.6bn rail route has still
to be confirmed.
Cost of providing the core system - rolling stock and electrical and
mechanical equipment - is estimated at about Dollars 2bn. Bidders include
GEC Alsthom, AEG of Germany and Kawasaki of Japan.
Environment: Taiwan is running out of room to dump all its domestic waste.
It currently operates two incinerators, both in the Taipei area, and 200
landfill sites all of which will close by the end of century. Seven more
incinerators are under construction, using Japanese technology, at a total
cost of about Dollars 41.1bn.
A further 12 incinerators with a combined cost of Dollars 1.6bn are planned.
It is hoped these will be built by international companies in joint venture
with local firms. Efforts are being made to encourage US and European
contractors in particular.
The six-year plan also proposes heavy investment in water and ports as the
country tries to encourage new development away from over-crowded cities
into previously rural areas.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRESSURE on the Korean economy means that the government
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
despite ambitious plans to increase investment in infrastructure - needs to
slow down the overall rise in construction output which it has blamed for
the doubling of the country's annual inflation since 1985.
Restrictions on the issue of building permits for private residential and
commercial development have been introduced in a bid to reduce activity.
Controls which had been expected to be lifted in the spring have been
extended. Many people believe they will remain in force at least until the
end of the year - such is the difficulty of cooling the overheated
construction sector.
Private development, dominated by housebuilding, has accounted for about 60
per cent of construction output in recent years.
The government's aim is to restrict real increases in output, after allowing
for inflation, to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent between now and 1996.
But current forecasts are that total construction output will rise by 7 per
cent in real terms this year.
Since 1988, annual construction output has risen by 69 per cent, to account
for about a fifth of GNP last year. Construction workers' wages almost
quadrupled during the same period while GNP rose by 26 per cent.
Mr Lee Kun Kyong, director of overall planning division at the Korean
Economic Planning Board, says the increase in Korean inflation to about 10
per cent last year was due in a large part to the rapid rise in construction
output and wages which created labour shortages and forced other industries
to increase wages.
The government has asked companies to restrict pay increases to 5 per cent
this year.
Investment emphasis will now switch from housebuilding - 2m homes were
constructed between 1988 and 1991 - to state- and local authority-led
spending on infrastructure.
Taxes, however, will have to rise if spending targets are to be met.
The special task force established by the president to identify priority
projects has recommended increased taxes on petrol and diesel to make up a
potential investment shortfall of 10 trillion won by 1996.
Korea has some of the cheapest petrol and diesel prices in the world.
Raising taxes would be very unpopular and might be difficult to achieve in
an election year.
Programmes will also depend upon the ability of state-owned corporations to
raise domestic and international loans.
These would be guaranteed by the government and would be repaid out of
income when projects such as the Yong Jong do international airport and the
Seoul Pusan high-speed rail link start operating.
About half the cost of the railway and about a quarter of the cost of the
airport is expected to be met from domestic and international loans.
Financing the vast development programme proposed by the South Korean
government therefore will be difficult.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (19): Investment in
infrastructure is being given priority - South Korea: Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT TIMES it must appear as if South Korea has become one vast building site.
Cement sales in the country last year averaged just over 1 ton for each
member of the 43m population - a world record for per capita consumption.
Consumption per head of population was ahead of both Taiwan and Italy,
previously the two biggest, according to Korean cement manufactures.
The sharp rise in sales of this most basic of building materials - up a
fifth last year - vividly illustrates the dramatic growth in the country's
construction output since the 1980s.
Cranes regularly punctuate the skyline. Around almost every corner there are
subways, roads, harbours, office blocks, apartments and dams under
construction.
Preliminary design work has begun on a new international airport likely to
cost several billion dollars at Yong Jong do island near the port of Inchon
close to Seoul.
Plans are advanced for a new high-speed rail link, as well as several new
motorways and at least two new ports.
There is also substantial investment in improved water and sewerage
facilities, a trebling in the size of the Seoul subway system, a large power
station building programme and the proposed electrification of 50 per cent
of the rail network by the year 2001.
Central government spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GNP is
forecast to almost double from 1.7 per cent to 3 per cent between 1991 and
1996.
Priority is being given to investment in infrastructure, particularly
transport to relieve congestion and remove bottlenecks which are preventing
commerce and industry from expanding.
The government also wants to encourage investment in less economically
successful areas of the country, notably the south-west region.
A special task force has been established by the president to identify the
most important projects to be built during the next five years. It has
proposed that nearly 40 trillion won (USDollars 52bn) might be spent by the
government between now and 1996. It proposes this would be divided between:
Roads: where about 19 trillion won is expected to be spent on constructing
450km of new roads and upgrading a similar length of existing roads. The
programme would include starting work on three new motorways, a 353km
expressway between Seoul and Mokpu costing 3 trillion won; a 289km highway
between Ch'unch'on and Taegu costing 2 trillion won and a 160km motorway
between Taejun and Chinju.
Railways: some 8 trillion won is expected to be invested in upgrading and
electrifying the existing network and on starting work on the Seoul to Pusan
high-speed railway which is expected to cost 5.8 trillion won when it is
completed, towards the end of the century
Water: about 7 trillion won is planned to be spent between now and 1996 on
improving drinking water and installing new water services to less
economically successful regions to facilitate industrial and commercial
development.
The government also intends to extend sewerage treatment from about 35 per
cent of the population to about 70 per cent by the mid-1990s.
Port development: about 3 trillion won is expected to be spent on completing
the expansion of Pusan port on the south-east coast and for the construction
of two new ports at Kwang Yang, also in the south-east, and at Asan, about
100km south-west of Seoul.
Longer-term, there plans to build two more new ports, next to each other, at
Kun San and Chang Hang, also on the west coast.
The Ministry of Energy and Resources, which has a separate budget funded out
of a special petroleum revenue tax, plans to invest 70 trillion won by the
year 2000 on new power stations and transmission equipment.
The country currently runs nine nuclear power stations. Last year, these
provided nearly half the country's electricity.
By the year 2000, South Korea expects to have another 11 nuclear stations
either built or under construction, making it one of the world's biggest
users of nuclear power.
Developments such as these could provide opportunities for international
contractors where technology and design skills may have to be imported for
more sophisticated projects.
Bechtel, the large US engineering group, for example, is providing
preliminary designs for the new international airport at Yong Jong do
island.
GEC-Alsthom of the UK and France, Siemens of Germany and Mitsubishi and
Marubeni of Japan are among bidders competing to provide the basic design
and some of the more advanced equipment for rolling stock and signalling for
the 409km Seoul to Pusan high-speed rail link.
Most of the civil engineering work will be provided by Korean companies such
as Hyundai and Daewoo, which during the past 15 years have become highly
competitive and proficient in the broad construction skills of pouring
concrete and erecting steel - both in domestic and international markets.
Opportunities for international contractors will therefore be restricted to
niche areas where technology has still to be developed locally or where
there has been insufficient domestic demand to encourage the development of
new skills.
Korea is expected to remain a growth market for international construction
for the next five to 10 years, even if some of the current ambitious
proposals fail to go ahead.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (21): Projects will
cost Dollars 300bn - Taiwan: Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR

<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION companies are used to perusing glossy brochures containing
details of grandiose national development plans. Mostly they come to nought.
Much of eastern Europe, Africa and South America can easily identify great
need for new construction. Unfortunately - in many cases miserably for their
populations - ambitious spending programmes often run well ahead of a
country's ability to pay for them.
Asia is one of the few regions where a need for new construction in
transport, water and energy services is matched by the financial strength of
some of the world's fastest-growing economies.
This is most apparent in Taiwan which last year launched a six-year
development plan to modernise its infrastructure and remove bottlenecks
which are constraining manufacture and transport of goods and services in
the country. The programme is expected to cost more than Dollars 300bn
between 1991 and the end of 1996.
The country has enjoyed continuous economic growth for more than two
decades. The average annual rise in GNP between 1981 and 1990 was 8 per
cent. It was almost 9.7 in the previous decade.
Foreign reserves at the end of last year totalled about Dollars 80bn while
the country had a balance of trade surplus at the end of 1991 of Dollars
15.7bn.
Central government borrowings as a proportion of annual spending only once
exceeded 10 per cent between 1981 and 1991. In three of those years,
government debt as proportion of its annual spending was less than 3 per
cent.
This state of affairs may change as state, local authorities and public
sector corporations increase borrowings to pay for new construction,
Taiwan Power, the state-owned electricity generating corporation, has
estimated that it will need to raise domestic and international long-term
debt of Dollars 70bn by the year 2001. The money will meet three quarters of
the cost of a Dollars 94bn power station development and expansion
programme.
In the fiscal year to the end of June, the government is expected to have
raised TDollars 235bn (Dollars 9.5bn) in treasury bonds. This is likely to
represent about 24 per cent of central government spending in the current
year and would be a threefold increase on the value of the previous year's
government bond issues.
The pace of public sector borrowing is likely to be sustained as
construction of large-scale projects gets underway. There is some concern
about the impact this may have on domestic inflation and interest rates.
Inflation in the year to the end of March rose to 4.5 per cent - the fifth
month in succession that annual inflation has been more than 4 per cent.
Traditionally inflation has been running at less than 3 per cent a year in
Taiwan.
Mr Wang Chien-hsien, finance minister, has said that he will not pursue
developments at the expense of Taiwan's strong economic and financial
position. Budgets, he stresses, will be determined annually according to the
prevailing economic climate and will be trimmed back if necessary.
It is difficult, however, to see how Taiwan can avoid a big increase in
public construction given the shortcomings of its infrastructure which has
reached the point at which it is restraining further economic growth.
Last summer, demand for electricity outstripped the productive capacity of
power stations, leading to a series of power cuts across the country.
Congestion on the roads, particularly in Taipei, the capital, causes serious
delays and inhibits the free movement of goods and services essential for a
healthy economy.
There is also concern about growing social unrest as people demand
improvements to their way of life.
About one third of Taiwan's domestic waste is estimated to be disposed of on
illegal dumps because of the shortage of landfill sites.
There is an urgent need to ease the strain on large cities. One of the most
important aims of the six-year plan is to encourage greater commercial and
industrial development away from the cities to rural areas.
This will require large-scale pump-priming of public sector investment in
land and services before private investment in new factories, process plant,
offices and shops will follow.
There will be some opportunities for private sector investment in
infrastructure but these are likely to be only small in comparison with the
overall cost of development.
The Finance Ministry has indicated it would prefer the proposed TDollars
40bn mass transit link between Chiang Kai-shek international and Taipei
domestic airport to be financed by private investors. This compares with the
T444bn construction cost of the first phase of the Taipei Mass Transit
system, currently under construction, all of which is being funded by the
public sector.
There are also plans to privatise small sections of the proposed new
national motorway network as well as the new high-speed rail link down the
western corridor of the island. In most cases, however, public investment
will have to bear at least the brunt of the initial investment.
The expected pace of development during the next few years, therefore, is
likely to lead to a big increase in public sector capital programmes. Annual
investment in construction by the public sector is forecast to rise from an
average of about 7.5 per cent of GNP during the mid-1980s to an average of
almost 14 per cent between 1991 and 1996.
While there is concern about the impact that this level of spending will
have on inflation and interest rates, there is sufficient room within the
Taiwanese economy to carry out a large slice of a programme to which it
seems firmly committed.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (16): Networks under
strain - Indonesia: Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA has experienced an investment surge in export-oriented
manufacturing over the past four years, but with the increase in industry
and trade its infrastructure has come under strain.
The government, supported by foreign donors, has made infrastructural
development a priority, but the problems of providing cohesive power,
communication and transport networks in a nation of more than 13,500 islands
are immense.
The pace of development is also limited by a public and private external
debt of Dollars 75bn, and a debt-service ratio for public debt of 31 per
cent of export earnings.
The government has ambitious plans for PLN, the state-owned electricity
utility, to double its capacity to more than 18,000MW by the end of the
decade. The current expansion programme includes 11 projects totalling more
than Dollars 7bn, although not all are certain of completion.
Concern over the cost of the expansion programme has led the government to
seek private sector participation, but initial negotiations with private
consortiums have been problematic. For the near future, there is likely to
be an electricity shortfall, with PLN continuing to urge companies to shift
production to weekends to ease demand during weekday peak hours.
There will also be long-term constraints on the telecommunications system.
In 1988, Indonesia began a Dollars 4.5bn programme to upgrade to a digital
network and double its capacity, but the number of lines per head remains
critically low after years of neglect. Fierce competition for contracts, and
disagreement over the use of soft credits to 'sweeten' tenders, has led to
unnecessary delays in project implementation.
In the transport sector, Indonesia's railway network is limited to the
islands of Java, Madura and Sumatra with a total track length of 6,326km.
There is a continuing, but not very far-reaching, plan to rehabilitate and
develop the network.
The nation's port network, however, is extensive with 127 ports open to
ocean-going ships and a further 222 which can cater for inter-island
shipping. Tanjung Priok, which serves Jakarta, is the largest port. A
development programme will expand its handling capacity to 1.2m Twenty
Equivalent Unit (TEU) containers a year by 1995; twice its current capacity.
The port at Tanjung Perak at Surabaya, East Java, is also being expanded,
from 300,000 to 500,000 TEU containers a year, and a modernisation
programme, financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, is
under way at 16 other ports.
Indonesia's international airline, Garuda, is planning an extensive
modernisation and expansion of its fleet to keep in line with a rise in the
number of its passengers which reached 8.3m in 1990. Its management has
announced plans to buy 48 new passenger craft worth Dollars 4bn from Boeing
of the US and Airbus, the European consortium.
Whether the finance will be forthcoming for all the proposed purchases is
not yet clear, but Garuda is scheduled to take delivery of the first of six
Boeing 747-400s in 1994 and nine Airbus A-330s in 1996.
Last year, Garuda took delivery of eight Airbus A-300-600s and four
McDonnell Douglas MD-11s. Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport, capable of
handling 9m passengers a year, is completing a Dollars 500m expansion to
double its capacity.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (15): Test case for the
future - Indonesia: Power projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEART of the government's programme to expand the power sector lies in
the construction of the Paiton complex in East Java with a planned capacity
of 4,000MW. The complex will consist of four pairs of units - two of 800MW a
pair and two of 1,200MW - all anticipated to be coal-fired.
The Dollars 305m contract for the construction of the first 800MW pair of
units, which will be owned and operated by PLN, the state-owned electricity
utility, was awarded in 1990 to a consortium led by Sumitomo of Japan. The
contract for the second 800MW pair has yet to be put out to tender.
In what will prove a test case for the future of the power sector, the
government has asked private consortiums to finance and construct the
remaining, larger, Paiton units. The units would remain privately owned and
operated. An estimated 7,000MW is already privately generated in Indonesia,
but the Paiton units would be the first to be linked to the national grid.
The companies secure a return on their investment by signing a long-term
price agreement with PLN for their production.
Last year, the government awarded an exclusive right to negotiate for the
pair to a consortium of Intercontinental Electric Incorporated (IEI) of the
US and PT Bimantara Baya Nusa, part of the Bimantara Citra Group led by the
second son of President Suharto.
Industry officials say that IEI's preliminary proposal was for a long-term
price agreement of over eight cents a kilowatt hour, while a competing
consortium of Mission Energy of the US and Mitsui of Japan had requested
about 6.3 cents a kilowatt hour. Industry officials say PLN's average tariff
is 6.6 cents per kilowatt hour.
The different bids would have provided a rate of return on project costing
between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2bn, industry officials say. One reason
for the disparity of the bids, donor officials say, may have been the extent
to which the different consortiums were offering to construct
infrastructural facilities or differing assumptions on variable costs such
as fuel.
When the IEI consortium was awarded the exclusive right to negotiate for the
project, industry officials say the World Bank expressed its concern to the
government over the lack of competition in the final period of negotiation.
The World Bank is not directly involved in Paiton, but it is funding other
PLN power projects and has set PLN long-term cost and tariff targets.
An element of competition has now been brought into the process, if only
indirectly. The government has allowed the Mission Energy-Mitsui consortium
to place a proposal for the construction of the remaining 1,200MW pair of
units at Paiton. Neither project has yet been awarded, although the IEI
proposal has received offshore borrowing approval from the government.
Foreign bankers stress that the government must make a final decision
quickly to win the confidence of the money markets.
Industry officials say the pay-back period for the projects would be between
10 and 20 years and there is still uncertainty as to whether either
consortium will raise the finance.
Indonesia's other power sector ambition, still in its infancy, is to
generate nuclear electricity.
Canada's Atomic Energy Company has an active programme training staff of
Batan, Indonesia's atomic energy agency. It has established a nuclear
facility in Serpong, completed in 1989, although this is presently limited
to workshops, a computer centre and a cycloton to produce radio-isotopes for
use in nuclear medicine.
A Japanese consortium is undertaking a consultancy study on nuclear
feasibility, although no commercial reactor is likely to be in place for
another 15 years.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (13): Grappling with
solutions - Thailand: Bangkok transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are two ways of developing a country's infrastructure, a wise diplomat
with commercial experience in Africa and Asia said recently.
In Africa, governments tend to build infrastructure, get into debt and wait
vainly for economic growth and foreign investors. In Asia, they tend to
encourage business, get rich, and try to cope with the resulting chaos by
expensively inserting the infrastructure into the existing economy. Both
methods were flawed, the diplomat believed, but the Asian approach was
better because at least it encouraged the sort of economic growth regarded
as essential in the modern world.
Thailand, and in particular Bangkok, the capital, is probably the best-known
example of the 'let's-build-the-infrastructure-later' approach.
After two decades of rapid growth and industrialisation centred on Bangkok,
it became clear by the late 1980s that the city's nightmarish traffic jams
and environmental problems were starting to throttle the economy, alienate
tourists and make the prospect of life in well-ordered Singapore ever more
inviting for companies and individuals.
Two solutions have been adopted. The first is to try to industrialise in the
regions - especially the eastern seaboard and the southern seaboard - and
the second is to improve the transport network in Bangkok, a city of some 9m
inhabitants plagued by lack of planning, an exceptionally poor road network
and the absence of any underground railway or mass transit system.
Each day in the capital, there are 218 train movements which periodically
stop the already slow-moving traffic at level crossings.
A visitor to Bangkok can see the engineering and management skills involved
in building prefabricated flyovers and elevated expressways with minimum
disruption to the existing traffic. But the large mass transit projects -
delayed for years by indecision and the manoeuverings of successive
governments - have yet to begin.
According to the Seventh Plan Urban and Regional Transport report,
inelegantly named Spurt, about Bt200bn is forecast to be spent on transport
investment in the Bangkok area between 1992 and 1996 (about half of it by
private concessionaires), compared with a total of Bt30bn (mostly by the
public sector) in the previous five-year plan.
Much of the money is destined for three large projects: the Bt80bn combined
property development, road and rail scheme hurriedly proposed by Hopewell of
Hong Kong when the State Railway of Thailand wanted to elevate its tracks;
the Bt65bn Skytrain, an idea dating back 17 years and now to be developed by
a consortium led by SNC-Lavalin of Canada, with the help of CDollars 800m in
Canadian government money; and the Bt18bn elevated railway ordered by the
Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) from local property developer Tanayong.
All the projects have been approved, but there is a snag: they conflict with
each other and with other expressway plans in 33 places and duplicate each
other on certain routes. Such conflicts arose because the three projects
come under the auspices of different authorities - the Ministry of Transport
and Communications for Hopewell, the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority
for the Skytrain, and the BMA for the Tanayong project. The result is that
the concessionaires will find it more difficult to raise finance for routes
duplicated by competing projects, and contracts may have to be rewritten to
take into account changes made to avoid the conflicts.
A report, published last year by consultants Wilbur Smith for the
government, analysed the various conflicts between four expressways and the
three mass transit systems and concluded soberly:
'Worthy as each project may be by itself, co-ordination between these
(government) agencies and the concessionaires involved has been lacking as
to land and air rights usage, and they do not provide for the interchange of
vehicles or passengers to the extent needed to constitute a co-ordinated,
coherent transport system.'
The problem was, the report said, that each of the 33 conflict points could
be resolved individually, but not if it was considered in conjunction with
the adjacent conflict points. Long-suffering Bangkok residents could only
smile as they imagined the bizarre seven-level structure which would have to
be built to accommodate the worst cross-over point involving the various
schemes.
The Smith report, citing the risk of severe environmental damage and high
costs, made recommendations which are generally regarded as sensible both by
the authorities and by the concessionaires.
Thailand had the technical talent to overcome its transport difficulties, it
said, and needed to do so because the cost of delay was far greater than the
combined cost of all the projects. But the country had to have 'a clear
statement of goals'.
Above all, the report recommends the formation of a clearing house, known as
the Office of the Megaprojects (Omega), to resolve conflicts and co-ordinate
everything from engineering and architecture to finance and real estate
management.
Mr Sansern Wongcha-um, director of the infrastructure projects division at
the National Economic and Social Development Board, is philosophical: 'In
Bangkok we never had a plan. Everything grew up individually.'
For Mr Sansern the main obstacle to progress has been the tendency of
successive governments to grant concessions to the private sector without
preparing strict guidelines, but he believes the difficulties will be
overcome. 'I'm sure that we can solve it,' he said. 'Engineering I think we
can solve. We don't have a problem of investment. The only problem that we
have to solve is management.'
Although the concessionaires regard the raising of finance as tricky, they
agree that demand for transport is so high in Bangkok - and the potential
profits from property development along the various routes so tempting -
that viability is not seriously in doubt as long as the conflicts between
the various leading contracts are resolved.
'Some serious decisions have to be taken eventually,' said one senior
project manager. 'The question is when is that to be done? It's really a
question of who builds first.'
With Thai politics in its usual turmoil following the general election in
March, and corruption never far from the surface, the prospect of
contractors rushing to build multi-million dollar mass transit systems and
present their competitors with a fait accompli is likely to attract only the
hardiest investors.
And even if the three mass transit projects go ahead with all the conflicts
resolved under strict government supervision, Mr Sansern will not be
satisfied. 'As for mass transit we need more than this,' he said, pointing
out that Bangkok was expanding to the east and north-east and that the new
airport would be finished in eight years, requiring further transport
decisions within about two years.
'We need another long-term plan,' he said, 'and we should start now.'

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (14): Important
principles - Thailand: Other sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the most urgent and spectacular infrastructure projects in Thailand
are the proposed mass transit systems and expressways aimed at alleviating
Bangkok's traffic problems, many billions of dollars are likely to be spent
on other sectors of this rapidly growing economy before the end of the
century.
The Thai planning authorities have expressed two important principles in
infrastructural development: decentralis ation, to bring economic benefits
to the countryside and reduce the pressure on the capital; and
commercialisation, or the involvement of the private sector in services
which were once the preserve of the state.
'For state enterprises we want to be more commercialised, and then
privatised if we can,' said Mr Sansern Wongcha-um, director of the
infrastructure projects division at the National Economic and Social
Development Board. The commercialisation process, pushed forward by the
reforming government of Mr Anand Panyarachun, is already under way. Among
the most important projects are:
The new airport of Nong Ngu Hao. The existing Don Muang airport suffers from
a shortage of aircraft parking space at peak times and is linked to the city
centre by one of the most congested roads in Thailand. A consortium of six
companies has been chosen by the Airports Authority of Thailand to do
consultancy work on the new airport, which will cost an estimated Bt70bn.
Total investment could reach Bt200bn if related infrastructure projects are
included.
Expansion of the telephone network. The state-controlled telephone system is
notoriously bureaucratic and has failed to keep pace with Thailand's
economic growth. There is a waiting list of about 1m in Bangkok and 700,000
in the provinces.
In an attempt to meet demand, the Telephone Organisation of Thailand signed
a contract this year for 2m new lines in the Bangkok area with Telecomasia,
a company dominated by the Charoen Pokphand (CP) group, in partnership with
Nynex of the US. A contract for a further 1m lines in the provinces had yet
to be awarded at the time of writing.
At the moment there are only three telephones per 100 people in Thailand
(but 15 per 100 in Bangkok). Even if the CP project is finished in five
years, said Mr Sansern, Thailand would only reach a level of 8.5 per 100, or
the equivalent of Malaysia today. A proposed 'land bridge' across the
southern isthmus of Kra; part of the plan to develop the southern seaboard.
The idea is to link the Andaman Sea to the Gulf of Thailand with a pipeline,
a railway, a four- to six-lane highway and large ports on either side,
saving ships the long journey round peninsular Malaysia.
The State Railway of Thailand, meanwhile, is also examining other plans for
new lines and improvements.
Waste water treatment. Only 2 per cent of Bangkok's residents are connected
to sewage treatment facilities. 'It's a new thing in Thailand,' says Mr
Sansern.
There are plans valued at some Bt30bn under which private companies will
build large plants in Bangkok to be operated under management contracts. The
potential for new plants throughout the country is very large.
Electricity generation. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is
generally regarded as one of the more efficient state enterprises but there
are plans to start privatising it in order to release funds for further
capacity expansion.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (17): A basic need for
better facilities - Indochina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE need for improvement of infrastructure is far more basic in the
countries of Indochina than in the rest of Asia.
The attempts of Vietnam and Laos to implement market-oriented economic
reforms are hindered by poor transport facilities and inadequate
communications networks.
In Cambodia, the United Nations is overseeing the start of rebuilding a
country ravaged by 12 years of war.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees must be accommodated, land-mines will be a
serious problem for a long time, and roads and communications are very poor.
Vietnam's cities have seen a huge increase in private business activity  -
albeit from a very low base - but the resultant rush hours still consist
mainly of motorcycle and bicycle traffic.
However, the state of roads is such that the 1,000 miles from Hanoi to Ho
Chi Minh City takes about five days of hard driving by car or about two days
by crowded train.
The Australian company OTCI, has re-vamped the country's telecommunications
so that international direct dialling is now available.
Substantial spending on improving Vietnam's infrastructure to support the
growth of business, industry and agriculture - as well as to meet essential
human needs - must await the lifting of the US embargo on dealings with the
country in effect since the Vietnam War.
This blocks financing from international institutions such as the World Bank
and Asian Development Bank.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (18): Strained
resources - The Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippines has scarce resources for infrastructure development and
these are under strain because of urgent need for rehabilitation of
facilities damaged by natural disasters and for installation of new ones to
meet the demands of a growing economy.
Although foreign assistance continues, the government has found it difficult
to raise local counterpart financing. Many planned projects are still to be
completed or started. Private investment is being sought through
build-operate-transfer schemes in some sectors, notably power generation,
but response has been modest.
In transport, many projects now receiving priority are those originally
planned for 1991. The administration of President Corazon Aquino has not
shown the enthusiasm of previous governments for building roads and bridges.
However, flyovers sprouting in Metro Manila should improve the movement of
goods and people in the metropolis from the middle of 1992.
The Philippines, because it is an archipelago of 7,100 islands, requires an
extensive ports system. The Philippine Ports Authority is refurbishing the
Manila port and eight others. A grains terminal and a bulk cargo terminal
are due to be offered to private companies under build-operate-transfer
schemes. This will ease congestion plaguing Manila South Harbour, the
country's central port for international cargo.
In power generation, a World Bank study has forecast that new power plants
with a combined capacity of 3,700MW are required before 1999 to meet growing
demand, particularly from industry.
The state-run National Power Corporation, until recently the sole
electricity producer, has been unable to provide adequate supply, resulting
in crippling power outages. Last month, more than 1,500 companies in Metro
Manila had to suspend operations for 10 days because of power supply
shortfalls. Power cuts will contribute to price increases until supply is
stabilised.
The World Bank estimated that necessary additional capacity will cost
Dollars 7.5bn, of which more than 70 per cent will have to be financed from
abroad.
In communications, the government plans to treble by 2010 the number of
telephone lines, now standing at only 1.6 lines per 100 people. The
programme is estimated to require investment of some Dollars 8.4bn.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), which accounts for 94 per cent of
all telephones, has a programme to install 296,400 lines in Metro Manila and
147,960 lines in the provinces. New competitors include Digital
Telecommunications, owned 40 per cent by Cable and Wireless, and Philippine
Global Communications. However, they are confined mainly to areas not served
by PLDT and have to make interconnection arrangements with PLDT for toll
calls.

hours. By the end of next year this will be reduced to six hours as a result
of a new road and the tenacity of Mr Gordon Wu, Hong Kong engineering tycoon
and managing director of Hopewell Holdings.
The super-highway is one of several big infrastructural projects being
undertaken in the Pearl River delta region with strong financial and
technical support from the private sector of Hong Kong.
The road, constructed by a joint venture between Hopewell and the Chinese
authorities, will cut through the economic heartland of China. It will link
to the international markets what, according to economists, will be within
10 years the largest manufacturing centre in the world.
'It is probably one of the most important developments in Southern China',
said Mr David Whittall, economist at Baring Securities (Hong Kong).
Hopewell has been the trail-blazer for Build-Operate-Transfer projects in
southern China. Mr Wu spent more than 10 years persuading politicians and
bankers of the need for his super-highway.
The current change in the business community's attitude towards a more
capitalist China, and in particular its economic power-house in the south,
suggests his timing could be close to perfect.
Phase One of the 304km six-lane toll-way will link the provincial capital of
Guangzhou with Shenzhen, China's most affluent city, and will run up to the
frontier crossing with Hong Kong. The 128 inspection passages are already
constructed.
When Phase One is completed, in about December 1993, it will be extended to
link with the western side of the delta, via the Boca Tigris bridge across
the Pearl River. Phase Two will stretch as far as Jiangmen to the west and
will also run south to Zhuhai, another booming Special Economic Zone which
borders the Portuguese enclave of Macau. Phase Three is a shorter stretch,
joining Guangzhou with Phase Two. The entire project could cost as much as
Dollars HK15bn.
Mr Wu is already proposing a more ambitious extension, with a 39km bridge
crossing the mouth of the Pearl River, to link Zhuhai with Shenzhen's port
city of Shekou, at a cost of Dollars 8bn.
Hopewell is not alone in its optimism, which is further emphasised by
several power station projects it has undertaken. New World Development has
taken a 40 per cent stake in the Dollars HK1bn Guangzhou ring road and is
also constructing a power station. Sun Hung Kai Properties is involved in a
light rail project linking Shenzhen with its new international airport and
nearby port.
It is no coincidence that the Hong Kong parties involved are all property
developers: they have residential developments in China which should become
more profitable with the improved infrastructure.
These projects help support the most positive post-1997 role for Hong Kong:
that of service centre for the booming southern region.
But although the rewards may be there, there is also significant
bureaucratic hardship to be endured in embarking on private sector
infrastructural projects in China, as shown by the time-scale of the
Hopewell project. Hopewell's proposals were all but blocked by the political
upheaval following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Further delays
were experienced in obtaining the road's financing from the Bank Of China,
after more than a decade of wrangling with officials both in Beijing and
Guangdong Province.
As a result of these delays, there has been speculation that local
authorities threatened to hand over part of the Phase Two contract to
another prominent local business group.
Mr Wu is adamant this is untrue. He claimed Phase One would be completed a
year ahead of schedule, in June 1993. He has a strong incentive, since this
would result in a bonus payment of about Dollars HK1bn.

other countries - Singapore

ACCORDING to Singapore government statistics, the average speed of vehicles
on the island republic's roads during peak hours is 30kph. The equivalent
figure for Hong Kong is 16kph, London is 15kph and Bangkok's is a mere 5kph.
There is no doubting Singapore's success in creating an infrastructure which
is not only the most efficient and comprehensive in Asia, but is unrivalled
in most of the rest of the world. Singapore has achieved a glowing
reputation for its road network, its port handling facilities and its
telecommunications network.
Changi, Singapore's futuristic airport complex, has consistently been
awarded the title of the world's best airport.
Yet things could have been very different. Singapore covers an area of only
573 sq km. As the republic's economy rapidly expanded, serious congestion of
limited land, sea and air facilities could have occurred. But since
Singapore's emergence 27 years ago as a fully sovereign independent nation,
its leaders have anticipated and planned for future growth in a way which
other countries have failed to do.
Changi airport was opened in 1981. A second terminal, costing SDollars 650m,
opened in late 1990. Now, in anticipation of further increases in passenger
traffic, a third terminal is being planned while other facilities are being
extended and refurbished.
Singapore rivals Hong Kong for the title of world's biggest container port.
In 1990, some 44,606 ships called at Singapore, a 14.5 per cent increase on
the 1989 figure. Recently Singapore has become one of the first ports to be
fully integrated into the 'Tradenet' computer system of export-import
documentation. Ships' officers who once had to deal with up to 20 government
departments and take two days to clear documents can now, through the
'Tradenet' computer, accomplish the same job in 15 minutes.
According to Singapore officials, the system - financed with SDollars 20m
from the government - has paid for itself very rapidly. It has also cut
traders' costs by saving time and has increased export-import volumes.
Perhaps Singapore's greatest infrastructure success has been with the roads.
The country's planners realised some time ago that increased car ownership
was a natural result of economic growth. At first, heavy reliance was put on
a number of fiscal disincentives to vehicle ownership - making cars in
Singapore among the highest priced in the world.
Despite these measures, vehicle ownership continued to grow albeit at a
slower pace than in other Asian cities. In 1974, Singapore had 142,000 cars
on its roads. It now has double that number. In the same period, the car
population of Taipei, capital of Taiwan, has risen from 60,000 to nearly
400,000.
Since 1990, Singapore has brought in a vehicle quota system to directly
control the number of vehicles on its roads. Within three years, the
republic will have an electronic road pricing system in operation, through
which each vehicle will be charged according to the use of roads in
congested areas.
Over the years, massive amounts of government funds have been ploughed into
the infrastructure sector. The expenditure has reaped considerable
dividends. Pharmaceutical companies have invested in Singapore because,
among other things, the republic has clean water and reliable electricity
supplies. Electronics companies rely heavily on Singapore's ultra-modern and
cheap telecommunications system.
Singapore does face some difficulties. It has to rely on its neighbours for
some supplies of water and power.
While its own infrastructure might be very efficient, onward economic growth
could be hampered by bottle-necks caused by shortcomings in the
infrastructure of Malaysia to the north and Indonesia to the south.
But for many years to come, Singapore's infrastructural development is
likely to remain a model for many other countries in the Asian region.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (10): Growing pains
with economic success - Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past five years, Malaysia's economy has grown at an average annual
rate of 8 per cent. In its latest economic forecast, the Asian Development
Bank predicts that in the coming years Malaysia will achieve the fastest
economic growth rate in the Asian region.
The Malaysian government says that in the period 1991-95, the years covering
the country's sixth economic plan, annual growth will average about 7.5 per
cent in real terms.
Over the past 20 years, Malaysia's economy has become manufacturing-based
rather than dependent on commodities.
Economic success has brought considerable benefits in terms of higher living
standards and full employment. But anyone who has threaded their way through
the traffic jams of Kuala Lumpur's narrow streets or driven through the
fast-industrialising state of Johor in the south realises that economic
success is causing Malaysia considerable growing pains.
Dr Gan Khuan Poh, director of the infrastructure section in the office of Dr
Mahathir Mohammed, the Malaysian prime minister, admits that there is
serious congestion on some of Kuala Lumpur's roads and infrastructure
problems in other areas.
But he feels Malyasia's difficulties are small compared to other countries
in the region.
'Everything is relative. There is congestion everywhere. Look at the
problems faced by Taipei or Bangkok,' says Dr Gan. 'Our difficulties are
nothing compared to those faced by the authorities there.'
According to Dr Gan, the most serious bottle-neck in Malaysia at present is
not in relation to inadequate infrastructure but more to shortages in the
labour sector - a view shared by both local and foreign employers.
'In some senses, of course, the two things are closely related,' says Dr
Gan. 'The completion of the north-south transMalaysia highway, due in 1994,
and the building of another east-west highway, is aimed at not only
modernising our road network but also at dealing with problems of labour
shortages.
In some rural areas there are still pockets of excess labour. Once these
roads are completed, people will be able to travel to work much more
easily.'
Infrastructure development is the priority in the present sixth economic
plan. During the period 1987-91, MDollars 15.5bn was allocated by the
government to the transport and communications sector.
In the 1991-95 period, the government is allocating MDollars 25.1bn to the
sector - MDollars 10.7bn from federal government coffers, the remainder from
state enterprises or already partly privatised bodies such as Telekom
Malaysia Berhad, the telecommunications service.
The government emphasises the increased role it anticipates the private
sector - both local and foreign - will have in infrastructure development.
Already, some port facilities have been privatised. What appears to be a
highly successful partial privatisation of the state electricity service is
under way.
Completed sections of the 550-mile transMalaysia highway have been
privatised. Roads will be the priority area in the sixth plan, receiving
nearly two thirds of the total allocation for the transport and
telecommunications sector.
Work will be completed on the north-south and east-west highways: urgently
needed improvements to urban transport, particularly in the Klang Valley
area round Kuala Lumpur, will also be undertaken.
Registration of new vehicles has been growing at more than 4 per cent per
annum, nearly 50 per cent of the total in the Kuala Lumpur area. Some have
advocated limiting vehicle access to the capital city, as is the case in
Singapore, or putting higher taxes on cars. The government has shown no
inclination to implement such policies: rather it wishes to support the
country's own fledgling car industry by encouraging vehicle ownership.
Congestion around Kuala Lumpur is likely to be eased when the first phase of
a light railway project is implemented in early 1994.
Significant amounts of the rail network, due to be 'corporatised' before
1995, will be double tracked and electrified over the next four years.
Total air passenger traffic has increased by 11 per cent a year over the
past seven years and is expected to grow by between 7 and 10 per cent a year
over the next three years.
While existing airport facilities are felt to be adequate, Subang
International airport outside Kuala Lumpur is being upgraded and
construction of a new international airport south of the capital is due for
completion by 1997.
Port facilities, at Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur, in Johor along the east
coast and in East Malaysia, are being upgraded and expanded.
There are also plans to expand the Malaysian merchant fleet although so far
the government has had little success in encouraging investment in the
shipping industry.
There are other problem areas: some government critics feel that not enough
attention is being paid to the develpopment of infrastructure in East
Malaysia. There are also those who question the environmental impact of some
of the development schemes, while others feel that targets set by the
government for private sector infrastructure investment are too ambitious.
In recent years, Malaysia has gained a reputation for not merely producing
detailed development plans but implementing them. If only 75 per cent of
infrastructure projects in the sixth plan are achieved, the face of Malaysia
will be significantly changed.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (8): Region of huge
contrasts - Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN Asia is a region of huge contrasts in telecommunications.
Large countries such as China and Indonesia have fewer than one telephone
line for every 100 people. But small territories, in particular Hong Kong
and Singapore, have telecommunications networks that rival the best of those
in western developed countries.
In most of the region, the challenge is to provide new telephone lines
quickly enough to satisfy pent-up demand. In the more advanced countries -
such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan - the challenge is to
develop advanced telecommunications networks.
Singapore has made telecommunications a high priority for many years. Its
aim has been to use advanced networks to attract foreign investment in
industries such as financial services, and to develop itself as a regional
hub for telecommunications traffic.
Singapore Telecom has international call charges which are among the lowest
in the world. It has also pioneered new services such as Integrated Services
Digital Network, which allow high-speed data and telephone services to be
carried simultaneously on the same telephone line. The Singapore government
is moving ahead with plans to privatise Singapore Telecom. And, from 1994,
Singapore will be directly linked to Europe with an underwater fibre optic
cable.
Hong Kong has had a similar focus on high quality services at low costs.
Hong Kong Telecom, a subsidiary of the UK-based Cable and Wireless Group,
has a monopoly on basic domestic and international services. But it faces
competition in mobile communications from several rivals including Hutchison
Telecom, part of Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa conglomerate.
One of Cable and Wireless's strategic objectives has been to open up
telecommunications links with southern China. The result has been a surge in
the telecommunications traffic between Hong Kong and China. This route
accounted for 410m minutes of traffic in 1990 - making it by far the busiest
bilateral route within the region, according to a report from the
London-based International Institute of Communications.
Cable and Wireless is also trying to turn itself into the main carrier for
the Pacific basin. It recently became the second operator in Australia and
its AsiaSat satellite - a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa and the
Chinese government - is providing services in Thailand, Mongolia and eastern
Siberia.
South Korea, which has established a high-quality basic telecommunications
service, is now liberalising its market with the aim of developing more
advanced services.
Last year, Dacom, a local telephone company owned mainly by large Korean
companies, started providing a rival international service to that run by
Korea Telecom, the state-owned group. Prices immediately fell sharply.
This year, the government is holding a competition to find a new operator
for cellular communications.
Other countries in the region are still struggling to provide adequate basic
telecommunications. The twin challenges are to reform the telecommunications
industry so that modernisation can proceed efficiently and to find
sufficient finance for investment.
There is a trend towards putting national telephone companies, which have
traditionally been run as government departments, on a more commercial
footing.
Malaysia has already partly privatised its Telekom Malaysia. Other
countries, such as Indonesia, have retained state ownership but established
a more arms-length relationship between the telephone company and the
government.
There is also a greater willingness to countenance foreign investment. While
political sensitivities often prevent full-scale privatisation, Thailand and
Indonesia are experimenting with halfway houses which involve attracting
private capital while retaining state control.
The largest scheme of this type is a 25-year concession for Nynex, the US
telephone company, and Charoen Pokphand Group, the Thai agri-industrial
conglomerate, to build and operate 2m lines in Bangkok at a cost of about
Dollars 3bn.
China is in a category on its own. Foreign investment has been welcomed in
equipment manufacturing, with western companies such as France's Alcatel,
Germany's Siemens and Britain's GPT forming joint ventures. But there is
almost no foreign participation in the provision of services.
Even China, though, has started restructuring its telecommunications
industry in order to improve efficiency. Over the past few years, the
central government has delegated power to decide prices and some aspects of
investment to 2,500 post and telephone enterprises in cities, towns and
rural areas. It is now contemplating a second phase of restructuring which
would involve turning these enterprises into corporations.
The Chinese telephone network has been growing at a compound annual rate of
20 per cent. About Dollars 2bn is being invested each year, making this the
largest telecommunications programme ever in a developing country.
But there are still only 8m telephone lines in the whole of China - about
the same as in London.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (6): Markets turmoil
raises doubts: Japan: Regional role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Kumagai Gumi became the first Japanese general contractor to win an
international tender, for a water channel in Hong Kong 31 years ago, it was
a symbol of Japanese industry's determination to play an increasingly
important role in the development of east Asia.
But the aggressive Kumagai Gumi has now become a symbol of the limits to
Japanese ambitions. Having been wounded in the international property
market, the contractor and developer has announced that it will concentrate
on the home market for the next few years and gradually sell off its
international holdings.
The turmoil on domestic financial markets, and the resulting higher capital
costs and extra pressure on profits, have raised unexpected doubts about the
ability of Japanese companies to participate in regional projects. At the
same time, the Ministry of Finance, troubled by a slowing of tax revenue, is
attempting to cut spending and has taken aim at foreign aid programmes.
In the late 1980s, when the Tokyo stock market rose ever higher, Japanese
companies were easily able to raise funds for investment abroad. But the
higher capital costs have forced Japanese contractors, among other
companies, to be more selective about exposure to low-margin projects. In
Kumagai's case, international contracts for the current year will be about
Y50bn, down from Y150bn last year.
The stock market collapse has also bruised Japanese banks who are struggling
to meet international standards for capital adequacy and are reviewing their
regional investments. Banks say that plans to expand offices in Asia are
being reviewed, postponed or even shelved and they warn that asset growth
generally must be limited.
After the stock market peaked in late 1989, direct investment in members of
the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) also peaked. Having
risen from Dollars 856m in fiscal 1986 to Dollars 4.68bn in 1989, the figure
declined to Dollars 4.08bn in 1990, and in the fiscal first half to end
September last year, the total further declined to Dollars 1.73bn.
However, Japanese government and industry will continue to play an important
regional role, both through the funding of infrastructure projects in
countries such as Indonesia, Burma and China, and through the continuing
transfer of technology to industries in more developed economies such as
those of Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia.
Japanese industry, still suffering from a labour shortage despite the
domestic slowdown, has sound reasons to continue investment in the region.
Trade with Asean rose from Dollars 35.1bn in calendar 1987 to Dollars 63.2bn
in 1990 and Dollars 69.4bn last year. Growth has slowed, but Tokyo sees the
region as an important source of low-cost manufacturing capability and as
the home of an increasing number of consumers of Japanese products.
The region is also the testing ground for Tokyo's emerging political
profile. The Japanese government has made clear its intention to assist in
the reconstruction of Cambodia and to encourage the development of Laos and
Vietnam.
Vietnam, in particular, will be a test of Japan's political will. The
Keidanren, the Federation of Economic Organisations, sent a delegation to
Vietnam late last year, while officials at the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry have decided, in principle, to resume the provision of
trade insurance to Hanoi.
The dilemma for Tokyo is that it would like to encourage investment in Hanoi
but risks criticism from Washington, which has yet to lift its economic
sanctions on Vietnam.
Presuming that official assistance will resume in the near future, Japanese
trading houses have expanded their Vietnamese operations and are putting
together lists of likely investment opportunities.
Meanwhile, the Japan International Co-operation Agency (Jica), the
government agency responsible for technical co-operation, is continuing to
expand assistance programmes in the region.
In fiscal 1990, the organisation was involved in 89 technical co-operation
projects and began 40 new studies, with involvement ranging from a
waste-water disposal project in Indonesia to a hydro-electric plant in
Malaysia, as well as a geological survey in the Philippines.
'Obviously we have a geo-political interest in Asian development. It is very
important to us,' a Jica official said.
Over the past five years, about 30 per cent of Jica's expenses have gone to
projects involving Asean members and Japan now provides more than half the
bilateral assistance received by east Asian nations.
The Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF), the government agency
providing long-term concessional loans, disbursed Y922.1bn in official
development assistance funds last year, an increase of 20.4 per cent.
Net disbursement, the gross figure less principal repaid, was Y775.4bn, a
24.6 per cent increase on 1990 when about 73 per cent of loans were devoted
to projects in east Asia.
Of the total loans to foreign governments made by the OECF in fiscal 1990,
26.8 per cent cent were for transport projects, 13.8 per cent were for
electric power and gas, 7.7 per cent for mining and manufacturing, and 6.4
per cent for telecommunications. Commodity loans accounted for about 26 per
cent of the total.
Apart from the well-intentioned aim of assisting the development of the
region, the aid programme overlaps with the interests of Japanese industry
which is reluctant to invest without the confidence that there will be
sufficient energy to run factories and enough transport to carry goods to
foreign markets.
Japanese companies are already profiting from the gradual rise of a consumer
class in south-east Asia and they are still excited by estimations of latent
demand in China.
Evidence of that demand was shown in the mid-1980s when Japan's television
exports to China rose from Y87bn in 1984 to Y285bn in 1985, then plunged to
Y5bn in 1986 after a tightening of import controls.
In February this year, Japan's exports to China were 59.8 per cent higher
than a year earlier.
Until now, Japanese project assistance has come with few strings attached, a
policy that has helped Tokyo cultivate friendships in some Asian governments
with less than perfect human rights records.
While Japan claimed to have 'frozen' Y810bn in loans to China after the
crushing of the pro-democracy movement, preparatory work continued in Tokyo
and the loans have since been disbursed on schedule.
There are signs that a higher political profile may bring a tougher stance
on concessional loans but the foreign ministry is still reluctant to
criticise acts interpreted by most western governments as an abuse of human
rights.
Tokyo argues that freezing of such loans further injures a people already
suffering under their own government.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (7): Focus on quality
of life - Japan: National goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Japan has a national goal for the 1990s it is to bridge the gap between
its First-World economy and Third-World standard of living by focusing
massive investment on a woefully inadequate social infrastructure.
A widely-held view that average citizens have not benefited fully from the
nation's rising affluence, coupled with US pressure to drastically boost
domestic demand, prompted the government in June 1990 to pledge Y430,000bn
in infrastructure spending over the next decade.
That total is equal to slightly more than last year's gross national product
and should roughly double from the previous decade the annual growth rate of
public investment to 6-7 per cent, as it did in the first year of the
programme which ended this March.
The government also decided in early April to 'front-load' the fiscal 1992
public works budget by spending 70 per cent in the first six months to
jump-start the sputtering economy. This alone will not inject new revenues
over the full year, but a supplemental budget now appears likely.
'Thirty per cent of construction activity is public works and 70 per cent
private at most general construction and mid-sized companies, so public
spending alone cannot offset private declines,' says Ms Akemi Toyonaga,
construction industry analyst for Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan).
Government spending - shaped both by need and political considerations  -
will be funneled into three broad areas: residential infrastructure
centering on housing, sewers, parks and traffic control; public facilities
such as airports, harbours, railways, roads and erosion and flood control
systems; and industry-related programmes focusing on waste and environmental
management.
Among the varied targets are: expanding average housing floor space over the
decade from 89 square metres in 1988 to 95 sq m; increasing the number of
homes connected to sewerage systems to 60 per cent from 40 per cent over the
same period; and enlarging by half the trading vessel harbour space by 1995.
'Twenty or 30 years ago, big infrastructure projects involved the so-called
bottleneck programme for industry. But from now on, the main concentration
will be on people's living standards,' says theJapan Development Bank.
The biggest uncertainty affecting the government's initiative is the price
of land. Reflation could mean using far more than the 15 per cent of the
Y430,000bn budgeted for real estate purchases and lessen the impact, says
the bank.
An Economic Planning Agency committee is set to release an infrastructure
policy review in May or June in which the most notable feature will be
proposed user fees to help cover the enormous expense of the government's
many initiatives, he predicts.
'In general, the difference this spending makes is going to be felt on the
micro level, neighbourhood by neighbourhood - and hopefully it will be
followed by private investment, especially in housing, to improve people's
immediate quality of life,' adds Mr Peter Sanborn, senior analyst at Jardine
Fleming Securities. 'The large projects may attract attention from the media
and contractors, but in the end they are likely to be far less important to
average Japanese.'
Among the largest of high-profile undertakings are new airports. Faced with
an acute capacity shortage, the government is increasing total airport
construction spending by nearly 70 per cent in fiscal 1991-95 from the
previous five years to Y3,220bn (Dollars 24bn).
The flagship facility is the New Kansai International Airport off the coast
of Osaka. The Y1,430bn island terminal will be the cornerstone of the Kansai
region's efforts to draw business to Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto and will be
Japan's first 24-hour air terminal. The venture has run into problems -
including more sinking than expected of the man-made island on which the
airport sits - and it is now set to open in mid-1994, about 15 months behind
schedule.
The cost has also risen 40 per cent, partly because of expanded terminal
capacity, says a spokeswoman for Kansai International Airport. When
completed, the airport will be connected to the mainland by a road and rail
bridge and accommodate nearly double the capacity of the area's current air
terminal.
Big airport projects also are planned at several regional capitals, while
the Narita and Haneda airports serving Tokyo are also being significantly
expanded.
Waterfront development is another big initiative area, although much of the
capital is private. Along Japan's most congested waterfront, the Trans-Tokyo
Bay Highway is scheduled in 1998 to connect Kawasaki, just south-west of the
capital, with Kisarazu on the relatively pristine Boso Peninsula, site of
the Kazusa Research Park and numerous tourist and resort developments. The
project, now well under way, involves building bridges, tunnels and
artificial islands at an estimated cost of Y1,150bn. Another structure at
the mouth of Tokyo Bay, and the Akashi Straits Bridge on Seto Island, will
be the world's two longest suspension bridges.
The Tokyo Bay area is being transformed by numerous other large projects,
including several on artificial islands. One of the biggest is the municipal
government's Tokyo Teleport, recently delayed two years and set to open in
1996, and the Tokyo International Convention Park. Private consortiums also
are developing large commercial and residential ventures in the area. A new
train line, loop highway system and road extensions will provide access.
The Nihon Convention Centre (Makuhari Messe) and a monorail are already
operating, and construction is in progress of scores of related facilities.
In Yokohama, the Y2,000bn Minato Mirai 21 project will house Japan's tallest
building, 75 stories high, on reclaimed land. It will join Yokohama Hall and
two already completed museums and numerous private projects.
Japan's quasi-public organisations are another source of heavy
infrastructure spending. For example, the Japan Railways (JR) group plans to
extend its bullet train lines. The Railway Technical Research Institute, a
JR affiliate with national and local government support, is conducting the
more ambitious of Japan's two magnetic levitation (maglev) linear railway
development projects.
If successful, it will help revolutionise train travel and cut by two thirds
the travelling time between Tokyo and Osaka, to one hour. The group is now
building a Y340bn, 27-mile track in Yamanashi Prefecture, 80 miles from
Tokyo, to test full-sized rail cars at speeds of up to 310mph. Many
technological hurdles are yet to be overcome, including big advances in
energy efficiency and the prevention of suspected health risks linked with
exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Commercialisation is not expected
until at well into the next decade, at least. By some estimates, the
phenomenal cost of building a new line along the congested Tokyo-Osaka
corridor could delay it indefinitely.
HSST Corporation of Nagoya is separately promoting three schemes, including
an inter-city maglev railway that would cruise at 186mph, a commuter version
and a downtown people-mover. The group includes Nagoya Railroad and Aichi
Prefecture, and it hopes full-scale testing recently begun will attract
national subsidies for a Nagoya commuter line.
Japan's now private telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone is also
planning an aggressive infrastructure enhancement programme in the 1990s.
Combined with the JR it will add some Y25,000bn to infrastructure spending.
In addition, the nation's 10 electric power companies will invest trillions
of yen to increase generating capacity 16.2 per cent in the next five years
alone.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (4): Demand for air
travel outstrips capacity - Airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOME of the world's biggest airport construction contracts are expected to
be awarded in Asia during the next 10 years.
Demand for air travel in the region, which houses some of the world's
fastest-growing economies, is already outstripping capacity. Countries need
to increase runway and terminal facilities if they are to avoid the kind of
congestion seen recently in Europe.
According to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), Asian
Pacific Rim countries will by the year 2010 account for 51 per cent of world
air passenger traffic.
The number of passengers travelling by air in north-east Asia is forecast to
rise at an average annual rate of 9.7 per cent between 1991 and 1995. This
represents almost twice the average annual growth rate of 5.6 per cent
forecast for the world as a whole. In south-east Asia, air traffic is
expected to grow at 9.2 per cent a year.
Preliminary studies, design work, and some construction, is already under
way on at least three large new international airports, each of which will
cost several billion dollars to build. These are:
The world's biggest airport project at Chek Lap Kok, adjacent to Lantau
Island, Hong Kong. The total cost including associated infrastructure will
be almost HKDollars 100bn. Work must be completed by 1997 when Hong Kong
ceases to be a British colony.
A number of large contracts for the project have already been put out to
tender and will be let shortly. Maunsell and Mott MacDonald, two British
consulting engineers, have been involved in providing designs and
engineering studies for a large part of the project.
Kansai International Airport at Osaka in Japan which is under construction
on a man-made island in the sea. The airport, which rivals Chek Lap kok in
scale, is needed to alleviate congestion at the existing Osaka airport and
at Narita airport in Tokyo.
Construction of Kansai began in 1987 but is not due to be completed until
the mid-1990s. It is expected to cost more than USDollars 7bn to build.
Malaysia has identified a 10,000 hectare site for a new international
airport near Sepang, about 50km south of Kuala Lumpur, the capital. In
February, it awarded a contract to provide a master-plan for the airport's
development to an Anglo-Japanese consortium of the BICC engineering group;
Trafalgar House, the construction, property, hotels and shipping group; GEC
Marconi, the electronics group; and Marubeni, the large Japanese
conglomerate. Plans must include road and rail links to Kuala Lumpur.
Other airport projects are in the pipeline. Preliminary design work has
begun on a new airport, expected to cost about USDollars 1bn, at Macau.
Indonesia is expanding its Soekarno-Hatto International airport where a
USDollars 550m new terminal is being built.
In South Korea, Bechtel, the large US engineering group, is preparing
preliminary designs for a new international terminal at Yong Jong do Island
about 50km east of Seoul. The cost of the airport is expected to be about
USDollars 4bn.
Longer term, there are proposals for new airports in the north-east and
south-west of the country as part of plans to encourage greater economic
development away from Seoul and the south-east of the country. About a
quarter of the cost of Yong Jong do airport is expected to come from private
developers, from land sales and from the award of airport concessions.
Another quarter will be raised from international loans. Airports which
attract international clientele and currency may provide a more attractive
vehicle for private investors than road and rail schemes which rely mainly
on domestic traffic.
The Pakistan government recently sought tenders from developers wanting to
express an interest in privately financing building and operating two new
international airports at Lahore and Peshawar.
Development of regional airports is needed to encourage growth in
less-developed areas as well as to take the strain off existing
international airports which may be constrained by space and environmental
factors from expanding further. In Malaysia, Taylor Woodrow, the British
contractor, is upgrading a small airfield at Kuantan.
In Japan, there are now 11 regional airports offering international services
to more than 30 European, US and Asian cities. Even some of these regional
airports are starting to feel the strain.
Some of the developments now planned will not be completed until towards the
end of the century. Other schemes have still to be announced. Some may not
be built. Cancellations and postponements inevitably will occur as
countries' financial and economic priorities change. Nonetheless,
development of new airports and expansion of existing airports is likely to
increase as pressure on runways and terminals grows, providing opportunities
for international contractors and designers.
Orient Airlines Association predicts that aircraft movements in the region
will have increased by 87 per cent by the year 2000. By 1995, it says, 40
per cent of airports will have reached saturation.
Building an airport is expensive and highly technical. It therefore has a
much bigger export potential than many other types of construction such as
roads which can be easily handled by domestic companies. Asia is likely to
remain an exciting market for those companies which can provide skills and
technology not produced locally.

opportunities - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF the devil was to redesign a transport system for hell, he could do no
worse than model it on Bangkok, Thailand's capital.
Cross-town journeys which would take no more than 30 minutes elsewhere often
take several hours through the congested streets of this teeming Asian city.
The average speed of vehicles in Bangkok has been estimated at 5kph. There
are many times when it seems slower.
Traffic flows with equal difficulty in Taipei, Taiwan's capital, and in
Seoul, capital of Korea, where the air pollution caused by car exhausts
regularly hangs in a pall over the city.
There is a desperate need to modernise transport systems in many Asian
countries - and not just in large sprawling cities where massive traffic
jams are customary and smog fills the air for many months each year.
The free flow of goods and people is essential for industry and commerce to
flourish and also if governments are to persuade populations and investment
to move from over-crowded cities to under-developed areas.
The lack of adequate road and rail links will constrain further economic
growth in these countries unless development plans for rapid transit
systems, high-speed rail links and new motorways proceed.
It is not surprising, therefore, that increased investment in transport has
been given a priority in national development plans. The excitement for
international engineers, wishing to share in some of the hundreds of
billions of dollars of contracts on offer, is that they will be dealing with
governments which can afford to pay them in currencies which are worth
having.
Some of the world's fastest-growing economies are to be found in Asia which,
unlike Africa or parts of eastern Europe and South America, combine need for
new construction with financial strength and, in the main, political
stability. It makes the region one of the world's most attractive
construction markets.
Construction of roads, particularly new motorways, provides a key element of
transport plans. Thousands of kilometres of new expressways are planned in
countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
In some cases these are needed to provide extra capacity on already
overcrowded trade routes. In other cases, such as in South Korea, road
development is being used to open up undeveloped areas of the country and to
encourage investment away from congested metropolitan centres.
Most of the roads will be built by domestic construction companies which are
well skilled in the mechanics of pouring concrete and tarmacadam. A few
opportunities for international contractors may arise in countries such as
Taiwan which may require specialist skills such as tunneling and
bridge-building.
The high cost of road and railway building has meant that Asian governments,
despite the strength of some national economies, are already looking at ways
of softening the impact of big public spending programmes on local inflation
and interest rates.
One alternative is to encourage the private sector to invest in transport
projects under build-own-operate arrangements. The government gets a road or
railway it would not otherwise be able to afford. Investors get their return
from collecting tolls or fares. In many cases the route reverts to state
ownership after an agreed number of years.
Much of the North-South Highway that runs the length of Malaysia has been
financed in this way by the private sector. Taylor Woodrow of the UK advised
on large parts of the project.
Trafalgar House, the UK construction, property, shipping and hotels group,
has submitted proposals to build one of 17 private toll roads identified by
the Indonesian government. Taiwan, which has a large highway development
programme, is also investigating the possibility of financing part of this
from the private sector.
Most roads, however, are likely to be financed by the public sector given
the problems over securing government guarantees on debt repayments.
Governments may also want to retain some measure of control over pricing on
sensitive routes.
Construction of railways, both light rail and metros to ease congestion in
big cities, and high-speed rail links to connect big centres and export
ports, also figures highly in the development plans of Asian countries.
The Seoul Metro is being expanded while construction of a Dollars 18bn rapid
transit system is under way. Bangkok has longstanding plans to ease its
congestion problems through a privately-financed light rail system.
Hopewell, the privately-owned Hong Kong development group, is the favourite
to finance and build the project.
Many other Asian cities have plans to build metros and light rail projects.
Even if only a quarter of these are built it will provide a large amount of
work for railway engineering groups. Much of the electrical and mechanical
works, the signalling, locomotives, and automatic ticketing systems, will
need to be imported, providing work for international companies from Europe,
Japan and the US.
Plans for high-speed rail links are well advanced in South Korea and Taiwan.
These projects, costing many billions of dollars, will also provide
opportunities for overseas companies which again will be expected to supply
the core systems. The basic track laying will be done locally.
Companies winning contracts will be expected to work in joint venture with
domestic groups. Transfer of technology is almost as important to Asian
countries as the actual building of these projects.
As with roads, the bulk of the finance for these schemes will come from the
public sector but there may be some opportunity for private investment. In
some cases, concessions to operate rapid transit systems may be sold off
once the project has been developed.
The opportunities, as with so much construction in Asia, are vast.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (3): Mindboggling
prospects - The Power Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER plant suppliers are not the kind of people to get carried away by
excessive euphoria over business prospects, but there is little doubting
their enthusiasm over the outlook for power generating equipment orders in
Asia.
Against a backdrop of growth in populations and economies - an important
combination for spurring power demand - and rather less exciting forecasts
for growth in many western markets, the additional capacity requirements
forecast for the region in the 1990s look almost mindboggling.
Suppliers' and official forecasts vary according to their assessment of the
outlook for different technologies and their own position in individual
countries. But few quibble with the assessment of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) that a further 300,000MW will be required this decade. This comes on
top of installed capacity of about 500,000MW.
Siemens, the German power plant supplier, expects the Asian market,
excluding India, to require 31,000MW of additional capacity each year this
decade, or 37 per cent of expected world demand. Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swiss-Swedish supplier, contrasts the forecast growth in the Asian market of
5-10 per cent a year with expansion of between plus and minus 2 per cent in
the western hemisphere.
The cost of this investment in power plant capacity is estimated by the ADB
at Dollars 500bn, and suppliers recognise this will place immense strain on
countries in the region. That explains why utility privatisation and
alternative means of financing such as build-own-transfer (BOT) and
build-own-operate (BOO) are being actively developed in the face of some
obstacles.
Despite that, there is considerable confidence among suppliers that much of
what is required will get built, even if some countries' power station
building programmes have to be taken with a mild pinch of salt.
Suppliers keen to help build Asia's future are acutely aware, too, that the
market is changing. Apart from privatisation of utilities, economic growth
in south-east Asia is taking countries out of the aid financing category,
encouraging more suppliers to bid for contracts and thus enhancing
competition.
Old ties that have their origin in colonial days are gradually being
loosened, introducing greater fairness - although the size of power station
projects will never remove realpolitik from the bidding process.
Change is also occurring in the type of equipment ordered by suppliers.
Asian governments, admittedly somewhat behind their western counterparts,
are waking up to environmental pressures, prompting a wave of orders for
combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants. These are also quicker to build and
will thus appeal to privatised utilities.
But the prospects are also good for suppliers of large coal-fired plants.
'Coal and combined-cycle, they all play in south-east Asia,' says Mr Don
Kusza, appointed in February to head the Asian activities of General
Electric Industrial and Power Systems.
Encouragingly, many of the planned coal-fired projects in the region include
flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to reduce emissions. The World
Bank, which is active in many of the region's projects, ties its
participation in financing large coal-fired projects to the inclusion of
such equipment.
With coal-fired orders drying up in much of the western world, this is one
further reason why the big equipment suppliers give Asia such a high
priority. Nuclear power, too, remains on the agenda in some Asian countries.
In Taiwan, Taipower has three plants with two units each, and is considering
two more units, while Korea also has an active nuclear programme.
Mr Nick Salmon, deputy managing director of GEC Alsthom's power plants
division, says the prospects for the region can be summarised in two words:
growth and change. Along with these external trends, however, is an
important factor that is particularly relevant to power plant suppliers: an
imbalance of about five to one between Asia's needs for power generating
equipment and its own capacity to manufacture it.
Consequently, for the foreseeable future, it is inevitable that the western
and Japanese suppliers will take a large share of the market, even if they
often can only win contracts through developing partnerships with local
equipment suppliers that will gradually reduce the manufacturing imbalance.
Historically, the Japanese suppliers Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba
and Hitachi, and GE of the US have supplied more than half of Asia's power
capacity, followed closely by India's Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL)
and Anglo-French GEC Alsthom. The two other European suppliers, Siemens and
ABB, are less entrenched historically but fighting hard to catch up.
In individual Asian countries, the market shares of foreign and domestic
suppliers vary widely. In China, GEC Alsthom is comfortably the largest
foreign supplier, due to the big efforts made in the past by both GEC and
Alsthom in establishing high-level contacts.
Siemens, in contrast, has won very little business in China but is now
preparing a strategy to penetrate the market.
Across Asia, suppliers are making similar decisions, whether in pursuit of a
single contract or for securing a better permanent market presence.
Judgments on subcontracting the civil work or component supply, forging
technology transfer links with local plant suppliers and forming consortiums
to build power stations, vary widely from one market to another.
In Indonesia, for example, there is capacity to produce heavy components
locally which does not exist to nearly the same extent in Hong Kong where
manufacturing is inclined more towards lighter components. On the other
hand, excessive local content could jeopardise a western supplier's ability
to secure financing from its own country.
Consequently, in a region whose immense needs for additional power capacity
inevitably produce a strong flow of large projects costing more than Dollars
1bn, co-operation between equipment suppliers and civil engineering
companies from different nations is becoming necessary to maximise financing
opportunities.
Such international co-operation is set to continue, while more novel project
financing methods will also become more prevalent. So far, BOT or BOO
schemes have failed to make much impact, partly because many countries lack
the legal framework or because of difficulties with repatriating revenues,
but their attraction for countries with heavy spending commitments outside
power is clear - so long as they can find investors.

THE project: to take Asia, the world's fastest-growing region, to a new
stage of development in which living standards rival those of the
industrialised world. The cost: more than Dollars 600bn in the principal
developing countries of north and south-east Asia alone.
Asia's rapid expansion has outstripped the ability of its infrastructure -
transport, energy and communications capacity - to cope. Cities are choking,
ports cannot handle the increased flow of goods. Growth has also produced
labour shortages in some areas and has raised environmental concerns.
Crawling traffic, restricted power supplies and lack of telephone lines are
not just irritations. They restrict the flow of goods and services and
reduce the potential of economies to grow.
Just as important for economies which have grown principally because of
private investment in manufactured exports, infrastructural bottlenecks are
discouraging foreign companies from making new investments. The businessman
who, after a long flight, is delayed by airport crowds and a slow taxi ride,
and then cannot get a telephone line, will begin to wonder whether he might
more profitably spend his company's time and money elsewhere.
The Asian Development Bank, in its 1992 outlook for developing member
countries, says: 'The greatest challenge facing governments in the 1990s is
to find adequate resources for the provision or promotion of physical
infrastructure, human resource and technology development, and environmental
protection.'
Physical infrastructure, the ADB says, 'has become a binding constraint
among the rapidly-growing newly-industrialising economies and south-east
Asian economies, with the possible exception of Singapore.'
Governments have recognised that the problem needs attention. Fiercely
competing with each other for investment and export markets, they realise
that their standing among their neighbours depends a lot on their economic
progress. Their hold on domestic political power has also relied to a large
extent on their countries' growing prosperity.
Public spending on infrastructure is an important instrument of social
policy, even in economies which have been driven generally by private sector
enterprise. In Taiwan, for example, the aim is to attract people out of the
main cities into new development areas. In Japan, the ambitious airport
being built on reclaimed land off Osaka aims to bring business to the
surrounding region.
The spending is also an economic policy instrument, useful at a time when
recession in some industrialised countries has dented export growth for
Asian countries. But in some of them it will raise questions about the
durability of economic growth. Governments cannot afford not to improve
infrastructure, but the effort may risk overheating and take fuel away from
the engine of export-led growth.
The ADB notes that the need to spend comes while budget deficits are growing
and aid from industrialised countries is becoming harder to obtain.
The newly-industrialising economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and
South Korea, with per capita gross national product averaging Dollars
10,000, have been the most successful at following in Japan's footsteps
towards industrialisation. Behind them come Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
which saw a boom in foreign investment in manufacturing in the late 1980s.
Coming up fast are southern China and Vietnam, with low labour costs
attracting manufacturers to invest just as they did in the now richer
neighbouring countries in previous decades.
All these countries have targetted significant infrastructural schemes with
the aim of providing the base for a shift to the next level of development.
Some of them already have a highly developed infrastructure. Hong Kong's
growth has depended on continual reclamation of land and provision of
transport systems ahead of time. The world's largest airport construction
project - with associated expressways, railways, bridge, tunnel and
container terminal - is an important symbol of confidence in the territory's
prosperity as a hub for southern China after Beijing assumes sovereignty in
1997.
Singapore, also with a relatively small area, has planned its economic
growth. Construction of the roads, telecommunications and other systems to
support the economy have been part of the planning. New projects will seek
to stay ahead of needs.
Larger countries, however, cannot predict their needs so easily. They have
to counter established bottlenecks with projects which exceed current
demand.
The most ambitious of these by far is Taiwan, which intends to spend more
than Dollars 300bn on infrastructure by 1996. The Kuomintang Nationalist
government's extraordinary six-year plan, the central plank of its policies,
includes social development as well as construction projects.
South Korea's planned projects total half Taiwan's, also a huge amount even
though the Korean economy is seriously overheated. Even Japan, with a
well-advanced infrastructure, has pledged to spend more than last year's
gross national product on improvements over the next decade, with the aim of
boosting general living standards to levels compatible with its status as a
leading industrialised country.
Thailand, despite its continuing dynamic economic growth, is the best
example of how much-needed infrastructural spending can get caught up in
politics and stall. Even after years of the notorious Bangkok traffic
problem, there is still no clear idea of how it will be dealt with. Yet the
government has ambitious programmes.
Malaysia, which Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, plans to be a
developed country by the year 2020, has less serious problems but they bite
precisely in the areas where foreign investment has been concentrated.
Indonesia is suffering in similar ways.
The pressure on them to provide adequate roads and other support will come
increasingly from competition from southern China and, eventually, Vietnam,
which offer plentiful, cheap, hard-working labour forces for manufacturing
companies and can still easily qualify for concessional finance to improve
their infrastructure.
Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers are investing heavily in south China and
Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, has talked of Guangdong province as
a new 'dragon'. When the US embargo on Vietnam is lifted, international
institutions such as the World Bank and ADB are likely to pour money into
the country for basic projects.
Spending on infrastructural improvements in Asia thus offers the potential
for a bonanza for construction, engineering, communications and equipment
companies around the world. The extent to which they can participate will
vary considerably between countries and industrial sectors. Companies which
can provide technology not available locally, for example in
telecommunications, will clearly be at an advantage.
Japan and Korea can be expected to handle the bulk of their needs without
outside contractors, although there are opportunities in Korea for advanced
technology and design work on, for example, airports and power stations.
Taiwan is actively seeking foreign contractors. Malaysia has used foreign
advisers on, for example, its north-south expressway project.
Can all this expenditure be afforded? Asian countries are generally in a
better position to pay than most others. But there are risks involved.
Public finances are likely to be stretched just as economies face external
pressures. The aim will be to seek private rather than public investment
wherever possible. Projects may be spread out over a longer period than
currently targeted, especially in Taiwan. But the message which most
countries have grasped is that they have to make the commitment to better
infrastructure if their dynamic growth is to continue.

FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (2): A difficult
balancing act - Regional economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE industrialised economies have been dawdling or going backwards in the
past year, Asia's have continued to motor ahead. Developing Asia as a whole
produced a growth rate of 5.8 per cent in 1991, and the pace in China,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand was above
the average.
The prospect is for accelerating growth, according to the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), which is forecasting a moderation in some countries but an
average growth of 6.5 per cent this year and 6.7 per cent in 1993.
The forecast is principally based on expectations of a recovery in the world
economy and trade, with exports continuing to provide impetus to Asian
growth. But a strong stimulus will come from government spending to ease
infrastructural bottlenecks.
All of the main Asian developing countries except Hong Kong and Taiwan did
suffer a slowdown in growth last year. But they showed greater resilience
than they might have hoped. There are several reasons for this.
First, they have mostly diversified their export markets considerably so
that they are far less dependent on the US than they were. According to the
Amex Bank Review, the share of exports going to the US has dropped from
about one third in 1985 to one fifth in 1991.
Meanwhile, the proportion of trade which Asian countries do with each other
has grown sharply. Intra-Asian trade accounts for 48 per cent of Malaysia's
exports, 32 per cent of Singapore's, and 26 per cent of Taiwan's, according
to the Review.
The growth of trade within Asia raises the prospect that the region can to
some extent develop endogenously, independently of broader economic trends
in the rest of the world.
The idea becomes exciting on examination of several growing economic zones
in which complementary capacities - finance, management, technology and
cheap labour - are put together across borders. The most striking of these
is centred around Hong Kong and combines investment and management from Hong
Kong and Taiwan, labour in southern China and the export facilities of Hong
Kong.
Such zones generate not only export potential but also growing prosperity
and demand domestically.
However, the present sobering reality is still that Asian countries depend
heavily on exports to the US and Europe and that they remain vulnerable to
continued sluggishness in the industrialised world - including Japan, now
undergoing a significant economic slowdown. Moreover, they face a number of
domestic constraints to growth.
The need for infrastructural spending, while providing the opportunity to
take up the slack of weak exports, poses a considerable risk that economies
will overheat.
Taiwan, for example, argues that its massive building programme can be
funded because substantial excess private savings can be mobilised, through
the purchase of government bonds, to finance the growth. The government will
need to keep a close watch on inflationary pressures, with money supply
already growing rapidly.
Korea has already run into economic problems, with surging domestic demand,
a large trade deficit, higher inflation and rising wages. Its need to invest
substantially in technology and infrastructure in order to boost export
competitiveness may not sit easily with the need for tight policy to rein in
the overheating economy.
The constraint on budgets will increasingly lead governments to seek
alternative ways to finance necessary infrastructural growth, involving the
private sector as much as possible. But, as the ADB notes: 'Physical
infrastructure is generally capital-intensive and most of it is in the
public sector domain.'
In Hong Kong, which has grown with the least direct government intervention,
the role of the state is growing because of the massive airport project. In
Korea and Taiwan, a shrinking government participation in manufacturing
production (due to privatisation) is being balanced by the rapid rise in
spending to overcome infrastructural bottlenecks, as well as on housing and
other social spending.
There is also the risk that public sector infrastructural projects could
crowd out other demands on capital and labour and also, at least
temporarily, restrict the development of export potential.
The justification for heavy spending on infrastructure will be the provision
of a platform for further efficient, export-driven growth. There is no room
for white elephants providing employment, said Jardine Fleming, the
investment bank, in a review of infrastructure: 'Virtually all the projects
cited generally meet tests with respect to an acceptable marginal return on
the investment. Consequently, all but the most controversial are likely to
go ahead.'
On the way, however, governments will need to be extremely watchful that
they do not allow their economies to become overheated by domestic demand
while export demand is flagging. The risk is that they will have spanking
infrastructural facilities, but that the export-driving foreign investment
has headed for cheaper homes, that the investment in higher technology,
higher value-added industry has been crowded out, and that economic growth
suddenly plummets while inflation rises. It will be a difficult balancing
act.

Crescent Petroleum, a small private Abu-Dhabi-based oil company has won a
Dollars 350m (Pounds 198m) contract to build an upgrading unit for one of
Pakistan's oil refineries, writes Deborah Hargreaves.
The company will hold a 35 per cent equity stake in the project which is
expected to be partly financed by the World Bank. The hydro-cracking unit
will produce around 1.6m tonnes of oil products a year.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Volvo optimistic on Renault
alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish car and truck group, said it would save SKr4bn (Dollars
670m) a year - equivalent to 5 per cent of group sales - by the end of the
decade as a result of its alliance with Renault, the French vehicle group.
Mr Christer Zetterberg, chief executive, said the alliance with Renault
would provide savings of SKr400m this year for Volvo.
Separately, Mr Zetterberg said that in spite of the weak start to the year,
1992 would be 'clearly better than the preceding year,' although no precise
forecasts were given by the group.
Speaking at a press conference before Volvo's annual general meeting
yesterday, Mr Zetterberg said that when the group entered into its alliance
with Renault in 1989, 'we estimated that the savings - integration gains -
would amount to SKr800m annually within two to five years, increasing
thereafter to SKr2bn a year. Today, our calculations indicate a savings
potential of SKr4bn annually toward the end of the 1990s'.
Mr Zetterberg said Volvo's alliance with Renault was 'developing very well .
. . in fact, significantly better than we dared hope in the beginning'.
About 75 per cent of the savings related to product development and the
supply of components, he added.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman, stressed the strategic motivations behind
the group's alliance with Renault. He said that the link provided economies
of scale, highly complementary product programmes, and a presence in the
European Community. It also provided gains through industrial co-operation
in product development, procurement and manufacturing, he added.
However, on a less optimistic note, Volvo said 1992 had seen a rather weak
start.
In the truck sector, Volvo experienced a decrease in market share in Europe,
and its truck division suffered from 'substantial costs' related partly to
the development of new products.
Volvo said that car sales had declined in 17 of its most important markets
in March, although the group managed to increase its market share in Sweden.
Mr Zetterberg, who is responsible for introducing a cost-cutting programme
which included slashing 11,000 jobs, said the full effect of the
rationalisation would not be felt until 1993.
He is leaving the group this autumn following a surprise management shake-up
last month. Mr Soren Gyll replaces Mr Zetterberg as chief executive officer.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: SKF still in the red but sees
profit for full year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKF of Sweden, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, reported a
first-quarter loss (after financial items) of SKr34m (Dollars 1.7m),
following a final quarter loss of SKr306m in 1991 and a first-quarter profit
last year of SKr59m.
The group forecast a full-year profit for 1992 and said it does not expect
to see a further deterioration in business conditions, although it warned
that an upturn was not expected until the first half of 1993.
SKF made a loss of SKr221m (after financial items) for 1991 as the world
recession hurt demand for its products.
Group sales in the latest quarter were SKr7.16bn, up 14.8 per cent on the
previous quarter and 3.4 per cent up on the 1991 first quarter.
SKF's bearings division reported a first-quarter profit (after financial
items) of SKr90m, against SKr79m in the same period last year and a loss of
SKr260m in the final quarter of 1991.

Wagons-Lits

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has cleared Accor's bid for Wagons-Lits, the
Franco-Belgian travel company, but on the condition that the French hotels
group sells Wagons-Lits' chain of motorway cafes in France.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, has set a legally-binding
deadline for the sale of the Wagons-Lits division. Officials would not
indicate the final date, on the grounds that it might be used by potential
buyers to extract a better price out of Accor.
Brussels' merger task force concluded there were no objections to the merger
in the hotels and general catering sector, but that the groups would have
over half the French motorway cafe market.

FT  30 APR 92 / Ontario to increase taxes as deficit grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO's beleaguered social democratic government is to raise taxes in a
budget to be presented in Toronto today.
Despite the tax rises, expected to hit big business and high earners,
analysts are predicting a sharp increase in the budget deficit and borrowing
requirement of Canada's wealthiest province.
Interest rate spreads on Ontario bonds have already widened in anticipation
of the budget, and credit-rating agencies will be watching the budget
closely with a view to a possible downgrading.
The province and its power utility, Ontario Hydro, are among North America's
biggest borrowers on international capital markets. They borrowed about
CDollars 10bn last year.
Ms Hilary Geller of SA Murray, a Toronto lobbying firm, said the government
was likely to expand its borrowing capability by setting up separate
corporations for various public services, such as transport, water and
sewerage.
The budget deficit for the fiscal year to March 31 1993, which was projected
last year at CDollars 8.9bn, is now expected to reach at least CDollars
11bn. The shortfall was only CDollars 3bn in the year to March 1991.
Ontario's economy, which is heavily dependent on the steel, motor and
resource industries, has been hit hard by the recession. The Wefa Group, an
economics consultancy, forecasts GDP growth of no more than 2 per cent in
1992, following two successive years of decline.
Public spending, especially on health and welfare, accelerated sharply under
both the previous Liberal government and the ruling New Democratic party,
which took office in September 1990.
But the fiscal squeeze is now forcing Ontario, like Canada's other
provinces, to tighten its belt. The provincial treasurer, Mr Floyd Laughren,
is expected to announce delays in many projects and to trim the provincial
civil service. Mr Laughren announced earlier that transfers to hospitals,
municipalities and schools will rise by only 1 per cent this year.

FT  30 APR 92 / Papers battle for black readers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE circulation battle among newspapers aimed at Britain's black population
will be heightened with today's launch of The Weekly Journal, the first
broadsheet newspaper targeted at the growing young black middle class, with
a potential readership of 1.1m.
Black readers are already served by at least four other papers. The
10-year-old tabloid weekly The Voice has a circulation of 47,000, double
that of the Caribbean Times, its nearest rival.
Black Briton claims weekly sales of 20,000. The Weekly Gleaner, owned by
Gleaner Group of Jamaica, and first published in the UK in 1951, has a
circulation of 15,000.
Most of these papers rely on the public sector for the bulk of their
advertising.
The Weekly Journal is owned by Voice Communications, publishers of The
Voice, which is being challenged by Black Briton, a middle-market tabloid
launched last August by a former assistant editor of The Voice.
The Voice reacted to the launch of Black Briton with a hastily arranged
reorganisation, new features and an advertising campaign.
Reporters say they were threatened with legal action if they left The Voice
and joined Black Briton within a year. Former staff members who had agreed
to join Black Briton - and in some cases had started work on it - were lured
back with greatly enhanced financial packages.
Critics say The Weekly Journal was devised as a spoiler. With a print run of
40,000, it is aimed at young, educated, upwardly mobile blacks in the ABC1
socio-economic groups.
Under its main title, a strapline says 'For today's Black Briton'.
Mr Diran Adebayo, a former journalist on The Voice who left the paper last
year and now works for the BBC, said the new title 'was conceived as a
spoiler. The only strong reason for its launch is to counter Black Briton.'
Mr Val McCalla, chairman of Voice Communications, said: 'The launch of Black
Briton did act as a catalyst for the launch of the new paper. It became
clear after Black Briton's launch that it was not satisfying the market.
'There is a gap in the market for a more authoritative, reliable and
informative broadsheet from a black viewpoint such as The Journal. Black
Briton is not right for that market. It is just trying to replicate The
Voice.'
Mr Joseph Harker, publisher and editor of Black Briton, said of Mr McCalla's
new venture: 'I think he's on a loser and I'd advise him to put his money
elsewhere.'
The new paper is launched against a background of the continuing recession
in advertising. Nevertheless, Mr McCalla says he is prepared to support The
Weekly Journal for 'as long as it takes to make it a success'.
Mr Werbayne McIntyre, a partner at WM&amp;P, a black advertising and marketing
consultancy, said: 'Judging by the advertising in Black Briton, if it
doesn't increase its advertising revenue, it is difficult to see how it will
sustain itself.'
Mr McIntyre believes that there is a place for a paper such as The Weekly
Journal and says that it should survive, especially if it can attract
display advertising from the private sector.

FT  30 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities race ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOOMING results season for the utilities and the above-average yield
attractions of the water, electricity and power generation stocks triggered
a flurry of demand for all three sectors.
County NatWest was said to have been among the keenest supporters of the
spread of utilities. Ms Rachel Lucas, at County, said the sectors offered
considerable potential following the general election result. County
especially favours the regional electricity companies and the generators
which, according to the broker, stand to gain most from growing perceptions
in the market that the recent national grid report on overcapacity is
implausible.
County was particularly keen on utilities reporting early in the season,
including North West Water, up 9 at 422p; South West Water, 6 higher at
421p; and Norweb Electricity, 8 ahead at 343p. National Power rose 6 to
227p.
Glaxo gain limited
Pharmaceutical group Glaxo Holdings retreated following the dramatic fall
and suspension of shares in Toronto of an allied company.
Glaxo had started brightly in London, along with the other leading drugs
stocks, putting on 18 by midday. However, as Toronto opened, Biochem Pharma,
which is developing its 3TC anti-Aids drug exclusively for Glaxo, requested
a suspension after seeing its shares plunge, and talk in the London market
erroneously put this down to problems with the new drug.
The group's request came as a result of rumours that it had run into
difficulties with a share placement, due to be made by US broking house
Morgan Stanley. Biochem shares resumed trading after London had closed and
ended sharply down. The company said it was not aware of any reason for the
decline, and said it intends to proceed with an issue of up to 3.5m common
shares in late May. Glaxo closed in London 2 up at 738p.
Banks weaker
Trade in Midland Bank slowed to only 8.1m shares, compared with 27m on
Tuesday, as the market continued to take on board implications of the bid
situation. The stock slipped 7 1/2 to 386 1/2 p after the bank again
recommended the offer from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking. Rival bidder
Lloyds Bank lost 2 to 415p.
Analysts suggested that there may be sizeable arbitrage trade between shares
in Lloyds and Midland over the next few months, with prices reflecting
whether investors believe the Lloyds bid will succeed. At present the
cheapest way into a combined Lloyds/Midland group is through Midland.
Barclays declined 6 to 347p on continuing worries about its exposure to the
debt of property company Olympia &amp; York.
Institutional buyers snapped up Williams Holdings' 9.8 per cent stake in
Racal, the 130m shares being placed by SG Warburg at 58 1/2 p. Williams,
which collected Pounds 81m from the sale, closed 7 firmer at 352p. Racal
held at 60 1/2 p.
RTZ jumped 23 to 635p in brisk turnover of 2.9m. There was talk that a
strike in Chile, the world's largest copper producer, could benefit RTZ, and
also that the company had sold part of its industrial division.
Speculation of a takeover offer from Minorco lifted Lonrho 7 to 98p.
British Airways was in demand ahead of the annual meeting later this month.
The shares gained 9 to 280p as a hefty 9.2m were traded.
Vodafone slipped 6 to 351p in busy volume of 5.6m as James Capel downgraded
the telecoms group.
Fisons, up 18 at 384p, led a strong drugs sector, with the market keen to
anticipate a positive decision by the US Food and Drugs Adminstration, which
is examining Fisons' Holmes Chapel facility.
Presentations by Wellcome over the next few days, and in the US next week,
ahead of its share issue helped the stock rise 7 to 1036p.
Whitbread 'A' climbed 13 to 457p, outperforming the rest of the sector on
hopes of recovery. Mr Mike McCarthy, breweries analyst at Smith New Court,
said Whitbread has the most recovery potential among national brewers.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew took Travis Perkins, which reported results in line with
expectations yesterday, off its buy list following the builders merchant's
recent good run. The shares were unchanged at 224p. The broker is
recommending a switch into Wolseley, off 8 at 453p, or Meyer International,
down 3 at 415p.
Two crosses by a leading agency broker in Costain Group - one of 1.4m shares
at 81 1/2 p and another of 2.5m at 82p - lifted the day's turnover for the
stock to 8.5m. The shares put on 2 to 81p.
Selected construction issues advanced on offical figures showing a rise in
orders for the first quarter.
The long-awaited finance deal between Greycoat and a consortium of banks for
the property group's Embankment Place development in central London lifted
it 7 to 61p.
Talk that ICI's first-quarter results today will contain some good news
pushed the shares 11 higher to 1381p. A shortage of stock in BOC Group
squeezed it up 13 to 726p.
Among supermarkets, Tesco receded 9 to 282p on turnover of 5.4m shares
following a recommendation by BZW to switch into J. Sainsbury. The latter
was unchanged at 433p as the sector continued to react nervously to Credit
Lyonnais Laing's criticism of property valuation and accounting policies.
Dixons was off just a penny at 256p in hefty turnover of 3.1m shares after
recovering most of an early loss caused by a profits downgrade from County
NatWest.

FT  30 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market confident of scaling new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WORRIES about the biggest ever auction of gilt-edged stock
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pounds 2.5bn worth - and concern that the market may have run out of steam
were firmly shrugged aside as equities moved tantalisingly close to an
all-time closing high.
The FT-SE 100-share Index ended the session 13.9 higher at 2,664.9, with a
sizeable placing of Racal Electronics stock and renewed takeover speculation
elsewhere in the market the day's chief features.
There was considerable uncertainty around equities at the outset, with
dealers still nervous about Wall Street, in spite of its late rally on
Tuesday that left a modest closing gain, and the prospects for the gilt
auction. It was also felt that most of the big trading houses had plenty of
stock on board, and would probably be quick to unload if the market turned
against them.
While always maintaining a healthy premium over fair value, the performance
of the Footsie future was never entirely convincing and kept traders looking
over their shoulders for a sharp decline.
However, developments in mid-morning delivered a substantial boost to
confidence. The main factor behind this came from gilts, where the auction
of Treasury 8 3/4 per cent stock 2017 was said to have gone exceptionally
well.
First indications that the gilts offering had been well received coincided
with news that the near 10 per cent holding in Racal Electronics, a block of
130m shares, acquired by Williams Holdings during its unsuccessful bid
attempt last year had been placed with ease by SG Warburg Securities.
Warburg was thought to have acquired the shares at 58p and placed them with
a broad spread of institutions at 58 1/2 p.
Specialists said these were snapped up within minutes of being offered and
that a number of institutions were unhappy at not being given the chance to
take up the Racal shares. It was also pointed out that the market's appetite
for such a large lump of stock as the Williams stake was a good barometer of
the overall market.
With the Racal stock safely placed and the auction going smoothly,
institutional buyers moved back into the market, driving the Footsie up,
from its brief excursion into negative territory during early trading, to a
day's high of 2,673.5 just before the opening of Wall Street. Thereafter,
the index slipped back to end within 15 points of its all-time closing peak
and around 19 points below its intraday record.
The Racal placing, which allowing for double counting involved 260m shares,
gave a massive boost to stock market turnover, which shot up to 869.1m
shares. The value of business on Tuesday returned to above Pounds 1bn,
reaching Pounds 1.21bn.
The bank sector saw profit-takers move in on Midland, while Barclays fell
back amid worries about potential losses from the property sector.
Retailing issues such as Dixons and Kingfisher were hit by bearish noises
emanating from County NatWest, while Vodafone, a key component of the poorly
performing telephone networks sector, suffered from a profits downgrading
from one of the market's most influential agency brokers.

<TEXT>
STOCK index futures moved forward yesterday, the June FT-SE breaking through
the 2,700 level for the first time this year, though volatility in trading
saw it end below the day's best, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract started the session at 2,688, a 33-point premium to the
underlying cash market, and a slight squeeze saw it advance to touch 2,700
by mid-morning.
Nerves appeared to have set in on that advance and profit-taking saw June
retreat to 2,677 by midsession, tracking the cash market, which was also in
decline.
However, sentiment changed again in the early afternoon, when June was once
more in demand helped by a positive Wall Street - and this time the 2,700
mark was firmly passed, June accelerating to attain 2,707.
June closed below the session's high at 2,696, just one point above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. In spite of the
volatility, turnover was poor at 5,936 lots.
In traded options, volume amounted to 43,468 contracts, with trading in
stock options accounting for much of the day's total. The FT-SE 100 option
had a mere 9,113 lots dealt, well below expectations ahead of its expiry
today.

Wall Street
A STRONG performance from the big three US auto makers contributed to solid
gains on Wall Street yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator finished 25.26 ahead at
3,333.18 following moderate volume on the New York SE totalling 206.8m
shares. Advancing issues led those declining by 1,092 to 606.
Among other market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 registered a rise of
2.91 at 412.02. The advance was more pronounced in the secondary market,
where the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks climbed 9.61 to
569.94.
Although there were some economic data to digest in the form of personal
income and spending for March, the stock market focused on corporate news.
There was no discernible reaction to the 0.6 per cent increase in personal
income in the month or the 0.3 per cent rise in personal consumption
expenditures.
Motor company stocks dominated big board trading on the back of encouraging
first-quarter results, with General Motors moving ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 42 3/8 , Chrysler Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 and Ford Dollars 2
to Dollars 45 3/4 . Ford reported first-quarter earnings of 60 cents a
share, including a special gain of 13 cents, against a loss of Dollars 1.88
previously. On Tuesday, GM turned in its first quarterly profit in 1 1/2
years thanks to a smaller loss from its core North American vehicle
business.
Eastman Kodak, which unveiled a 19 per cent drop in first-quarter profits on
flat sales after the close of trading on Tuesday, moved forward Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 40. The photographic equipment maker warned Wall Street in
March that it would have a difficult first quarter.
Among other active blue chip issues, Pepsico appreciated Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 35 1/2 on top of its Tuesday Dollars 1 gain, Boeing slipped Dollars
 1/2 to Dollars 43 7/8 and Glaxo eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 25 3/8 .
Cooper Industries fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 after Salomon cut its
investment rating on the stock and reduced its earnings estimates for the
company.
Exxon held steady at Dollars 59 1/4 after the company increased its
quarterly dividend to 72 cents a share from 67 cents. Bethlehem Steel
improved Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 in spite of once more omitting its
dividend.
Delta Air Lines put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 after the big US
airline said it had trimmed Dollars 5bn from its nine-year capital spending
plan. AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 66 1/2
and USAir rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 .
Among actively-traded over-the-counter stocks, Microsoft rose Dollars 2 3/8
to Dollars 111 3/8 and Intel added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 52 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO blue chips gained ground but the broad market ended on a mixed note.
Traders said the Ontario budget, due to be released after the market closes
today, was putting a damper on equities. The market is expecting tax rises
and a record deficit.
The composite index ended 19.1 up at 3,357.0, but declines led rises by 278
to 262. Volume amounted to 23.3m shares.
Imasco reported higher first-quarter earnings and said analysts are on track
with estimates for 1992 net of CDollars 2.95 to CDollars 3.05 a share,
compared with 1991 net of CDollars 2.56. The stock was up CDollars 1 to
CDollars 37.
Biochem Pharma plunged CDollars 5 3/8 to CDollars 17 5/8 . The company said
it was not aware of any reason for the decline, and said it intends to
proceed with an issue of up to 3.5m common shares in late May.
Biochem had surged from CDollars 21 last June to CDollars 35 1/4 this year,
even after a stock split, amid optimism about its anti-Aids 3TC drug.

FT  30 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Escudo's ERM entry lifts Portuguese
shares - Interest rate cuts also bring relief, though exporters may have
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portuguese stocks were given a welcome boost by the escudo's entry into the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) on Monday, April 6, but after the
initial excitement the market has stabilised at higher levels.
The announcement was made late on the previous Friday, and by the close on
the following Monday, the Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) index had risen by 26.2
to 2,052.5 - a gain of 1.3 per cent, compared with the 2.5 per cent advance
made since the beginning of the year. The market has since benefited from
renewed foreign investor interest, and the BTA index closed at 2,121.6, up
4.7, yesterday.
Shares gained at the expense of government securities - receiving additional
help from the Bank of Portugal's decision the same week to cut its two key
interest rates. The bank reduced the top rate, at which it injects liquidity
into the money market, by a full point to 17.9375 per cent, and the rate at
which it drains liquidity from the market by 1/4 percentage point to 15.375
per cent.
The ensuing cut in rates by commercial banks has given some relief to
Portuguese companies, which have complained loudly that they were being
penalised by high domestic interest rates in the face of foreign
competition. This is especially true of the construction sector, which
labours under high indebtedness.
For exporters, however, the escudo's ERM membership could cause some
problems, as they will no longer be able to profit from the currency's
depreciation. 'In the short term they will have to cut prices or face the
prospect of losing markets, because the alternative of increasing
productivity is difficult and takes a long time,' says one analyst.
Lower interest rates at a time of rising costs are expected to erode profit
margins in the banking sector. 'Margins are coming down fast and costs going
up,' says another analyst. 'This will show in this year's annual accounts,
and especially next year's'
Government securities have reacted more calmly. Many traditional investors
in Portuguese state paper had to some extent anticipated the decline in
interest rates, so there was no rush to buy. The escudo had been shadowing
the ERM basket of currencies for some time, and entry formally anchored it
to the system, though at a higher rate than the government had wanted.
Most analysts, however, have welcomed the move. 'It will give greater
security to foreign investors by reducing the risk of foreign exchange
losses,' says an analyst with Gestifundo, the fund manager.
Further cuts in interest rates will depend on reducing inflation. Reversing
a trend of several months, prices rose by 0.9 per cent in March, bringing
the year-on-year rate to 8.5 per cent. Prices are expected to rise again in
April when the one-off effect of a new value added tax, introduced at the
end of March, is fully felt.
Economists hope that if inflation resumes its downward trend in the next two
months, as is officially hoped, further interest rate cuts are likely. But
Mr Miguel Beleza, who takes over as central bank governor in May, is by
nature cautious and unlikely to take any precipitate action.
Many company results for 1991 have now been published, and as expected,
earnings have fallen. The appreciation of the escudo in real terms and high
interest rates are mostly to blame, while restructuring costs have been an
additional burden for some companies. Recession in large international
markets impaired the performance of exporters.
The government has resumed its privatisation programme, but the results have
been disappointing as far as the market is concerned. The partial
privatisation of Petrogal, the big oil group, found only one taker - a
consortium led by Total, of France, with Portuguese partners. This month's
public flotation of insurance concern Mundial Confianca failed to attract
enough investors and 35 per cent of the company's equity remained with
underwriters.
Small investors stayed away, confirming that, short of the prospect of a
quick gain, most Portuguese prefer to hang on to their savings.

FT  30 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Mixed feelings about dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PUBLIC holiday in Japan ensured that yesterday was the quietest day in
some time on the foreign exchange markets. But compounding the slowness of
trading was continued uncertainty about the dollar, which held to a narrow
trading range throughout the day, writes James Blitz.
Traders continued to feel jaded about the US currency in the wake of a mixed
batch of economic indicators, none of which has conferred the seal of
approval on the expected economic recovery. On Tuesday, indicators showed a
2 per cent rise in GDP in the first quarter but were disappointing on the
issue of new home sales, which plunged 14.8 per cent in March.
The picture was darkened yesterday by disappointing US income data, in which
most March gains were concentrated in the farm sector rather than industry.
The dollar ended a touch firmer against the D-Mark at DM1.6565, up from
DM1.6555, but never broke out of its trading range. In Europe, however,
traders may have stayed their hand in anticipation of figures for quarterly
refunding of Treasury bonds, which came too late for the markets. In New
York the dollar finished slightly higher at DM1.6575.
Dealers believe today's weekly jobless figures from the US government may
have some effect on the dollar. But Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Yamaichi Bank, thinks the currency will have to struggle hard if it is to
break through its next big target rate against the D-Mark.
He said: 'You really need some fairly substantial data to see a breakthrough
to DM1.6750.' Similar to other City economists, he believes dollar trading
will remain mostly quiet until the US government's monthly employment
figures are issued a week from tomorrow.
The dollar again firmed slightly against the yen, to Y133.45 from Y133.25,
partly helped by a public holiday in Japan. A trader said: 'Without the
Japanese in the picture, there is no yen market.' It closed in New York at
Y133.45.
The fall in the yen, however, will still come as a disappointment to the
Bank of Japan, which does not want the currency to weaken against the dollar
as it tries to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus. It was said to have
intervened in the market on Monday night to the tune of Dollars 100m in an
attempt to strengthen the yen.
For the first time this week, the D-Mark appeared steadier. In spite of the
mounting economic crisis in Germany, there is no doubt that high German
interest rates are here for some time to come.
The D-Mark gave sterling its first difficult day of the week, with the pound
closing  1/2 pfennig down at DM2.9325. One dealer, bewildered by more
profit-taking against the pound, said: 'Everyone seems too long of the
currency at present.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates creep higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES IN the UK money market moved higher yesterday as traders held back
paper in anticipation of a large end-of-month shortage today.
As usual, a large shortage was anticipated on the last day of the month, as
banks carry out particularly large payments to the Bank of England on behalf
of clients. That shortage will be compounded this time by the large Pounds
2.5bn gilt auction launched by the Treasury yesterday.
Discount houses were therefore anticipating a rise in rates today and
limited their trading with the Bank of England. 'People are not selling
paper today, thinking that they will get better value tomorrow,' said Mr
John Trimming of Union Discount.
As a result, short-term period rates ended slightly higher in the interbank
market. One month rates ended at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, about  1/16 up on
the previous day's close. The overnight rate also closed at 10 7/8 - 3/4 per
cent, having gone over 11 per cent at several points of the day. Dealers
said that the one-week rate was also up, ending at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent,
about  1/8 higher on the previous day's close.
In the discount market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around
Pounds 700m, and in early operations purchased Pounds 2m of Band-1 bank
bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 16m of Band-3 bank bills at 10 5/32 - 1/8
per cent and Pounds 24m of Band-4 bank bills at 10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent.
The forecast was revised to around Pounds 850m before taking account of the
early operations. The Bank purchased Pounds 8m of Band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per
cent, Pounds 11m of Band-2 bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 5m of Band-3 LA
bills at 10 1/8 per cent, Pounds 56m of Band-3 bills at 10 1/8 per cent and
Pounds 131m of Band-4 bills at 10 1/32 per cent.
The forecast was again revised to Pounds 950m. In the afternoon the Bank
purchased Pounds 226m of Band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 4m of
Band-4 bills at 10 1/32 per cent. The Bank then provided late assistance of
around Pounds 360m.
In Germany, call money rates fell to 9.60-65 per cent from 9.60-70 per cent
after monthly pension payouts were returned to the banking system. One
trader said that month-end liquidity was now adequate.
There was no regular securities purchase offered by the Bundesbank and the
next one is due on May 6.

FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry stands out against
CAP compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday dissociated itself from attempts by the
current Portuguese presidency of the European Community to limit the cuts in
subsidised cereals prices envisaged under Brussels plans to reform the
common agricultural policy.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, told farm ministers he would
not let go of this central plank of his reform proposals. He took the
unprecedented step of getting his opposition written in as a dissenting
opinion in the presidency's latest compromise paper on CAP reform.
This was presented to ministers here yesterday and confirmed Portugal's
intention to try to broker agreement on a new target price for cereals of
Ecu112 (Pounds 78) a tonne by the 1995-96 season, well above the Ecu105 the
commission is prepared to accept. The presidency's proposal amounts to a 27
per cent cut on current price levels of around Ecu155 per tonne, against the
35 per cent cut originally sought by the commission.
The commission needs a weighted majority of member states to get its
proposals through, but only the unanimity of the 12 can force it to change
them. The wide spread of different interests make this very unlikely, but a
reform package which looked within reach could now be receding.
Mr MacSharry made clear yesterday he would not move as far as the
presidency. 'I've always said we are prepared to be flexible,' he said
before the hard bargaining started. 'But we have to have a (cereals) price
which is competitive.' He later told ministers that 'Ecu105 is the limit of
competitiveness. . . it is not a question of bargaining around an arbitrary
price. At Ecu112 the surplus in cereals is some 8m tonnes greater than at
Ecu105, in which case the set-aside requirement would increase to 22 per
cent,' he warned. The 'set-aside' requirement now envisages taking 15 per
cent of land out of production as a condition for receiving compensation for
the cuts.
Presidency officials argued yesterday that their softening of the reform
proposals was what now made an agreement likely. The commission retorted
that there was no point in a reform which failed to address the fundamental
problems of oversupply and would require remedial action later. Cheaper
cereals for feedstock, moreover, are meant to offset cuts in the dairy and
meat sectors, and commission officials expect that ministers will therefore
seek to limit these cuts too if the Portuguese price targets for grains are
accepted.
The presidency compromise makes other controversial changes in:
Compensation: which it wants for all land set-aside, whereas Brussels had
excluded larger-scale farmers. This was partly to address British protests
that their big farms were being discriminated against. 'There is no doubt
that in the major areas (the presidency paper) is moving in our direction,'
said Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister.
Livestock: where limits on the number of cattle per hectare the EC would
finance have been loosened, in a way the commission believes will encourage
production and increase surpluses.
The commission has had no constant allies on reform, but it is not without
fellow-travellers on cereals. The UK, Netherlands and Denmark want deeper
cuts; crucially, so does France, which fears that the alternative would be
administrative restraints on production that would cripple its huge and
competitive grains sector.

FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'No alternative to tobacco
crop'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING ALTERNATIVE crops such as cut-flowers or fruit is not a viable
option for most tobacco producers, according to a report from the
International Tobacco Growers' Association.
The report, published yesterday, is the growers' answer to campaigners
against tobacco, who claim that a reduction in the land and labour devoted
to the tobacco industry would help to stop people smoking.
Tobacco production in Zimbabwe, Malawi, the US and Canada is studied in the
report, which identifies Canada as the only case where substitution might be
possible, given the country's climatic disadvantages, falling domestic
consumption and failure to find new export markets.
In Zimbabwe and Malawi, however, many of the possible alternative crops 'are
limited by instability, risk or difficulties in marketing and could take
several years to yield their first returns'.

FT  30 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Good institutional response to Pounds
2.5bn gilt auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England comfortably sold Pounds 2.5bn long-dated government
bonds yesterday, drawing a good response from UK institutions to the first
auction in the Pounds 33bn funding programme expected this fiscal year.
The market reacted positively to the results of the auction, with dealers
relieved the heavy funding programme had started well. Bids for the 8 3/4
per cent bonds maturing 2017 covered the stock available by 1.82 times.
The results showed a consensus among investors on the correct pricing for
the new issue. The lowest price accepted by the Bank of England was 97 3/8 ,
where the yield is 9.02 per cent. Around 19 per cent of the issue was sold
at this low level. The highest bid was 97 15/32 , for a yield of 9.01 per
cent.
The difference between the yield on the highest bid and the average yield
was zero, indicating that the Bank did not have to accept low-price bids to
sell all the bonds.
Following the announcement of the auction results, the gilt futures contract
on Liffe, the London futures exchange, rose sharply from an opening level of
98.17 to 99.04. Traders said the rally was exaggerated by dealers covering
positions taken ahead of the auction.
However, in the afternoon prices settled. By the close the contract stood at
98.20. Trading volume was a heavy 58,000 contracts. The 9 per cent gilt
maturing 2011 closed unchanged on the day at 99 23/32 , for a yield of 9.02
per cent.
Most of the new stock was taken by UK institutional investors, such as
pension funds and life insurance companies, with very long dated
liabilities.
The issue creates a liquid benchmark at the long end of the gilts market,
where liquidity was relatively poor.
Market-makers also reported some buying from overseas investors, unusual for
such a long-dated issue.
Coupon payments on the bonds are exempt from withholding tax for overseas
residents, a feature designed to attract international investors into the
bonds.
Analysts said the government has now raised Pounds 7bn since the
Conservative election victory.
GERMAN government bonds traded lower yesterday in a lack-lustre day which
saw low trading volume and little hard data to lead the market.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond closed on a yield of 7.99 per cent,
having finished on Tuesday 7.98 per cent.
On Liffe, the London futures exchange, the June bund futures contract closed
at 87.21 from an opening level of 87.40 and a close of 87.35 on Tuesday. The
contract moved within a narrow range, in listless trading. Volume was a
sluggish 30,000 contracts - around half the trading activity seen on Monday
and Tuesday.
The state of Hesse released consumer price inflation data which showed a 0.3
per cent increase in prices in the month to mid-April, for a year-on-year
rate of 4.5 per cent. The figure was in line with expectations and,
following similar data from the states of Baden Wuertemberg and North
Rhine-Westphalia, suggests consumer prices in western Germany rose by 0.3
per cent in the period, for an annual rate of 4.5 per cent.
THE Italian government bond market easily absorbed L5,000bn 10-year fixed
rate government bonds yesterday, although demand from international
investors was tempered by the political uncertainties facing the country.
Bond prices were buoyant on the day, with the benchmark 10-year fixed rate
bond (BTP) maturing January 2002 traded at 98.35 in late afternoon, up from
98.27 at Tuesday's close.
The new paper was sold at an average price of 99.25, for a yield net of
withholding tax of 10.86 per cent. At the January auction, new 10-year paper
was sold at an average price of 98.60, for a net yield of 10.97 per cent.
The new bonds are immediately deliverable into the Liffe bond futures
contract, which makes them attractive for international portfolio investors.
However, dealers in London said international buying was less than expected
following the resignation of Mr Francesco Cossiga, president.
US Treasuries prices briefly bounced higher yesterday afternoon following
news of a smaller-than-expected quarterly refunding package, but bonds were
unable to hang onto their gains and ended the day broadly lower.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was off  7/32 at 99
7/32 , yielding 8.06 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/8 to yield 5.43
per cent.
The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market yesterday
morning. The lack of intervention was expected, with Fed Funds trading at 3
per cent, slightly below the Fed's perceived target of 3 3/4 per cent.
The market was surprised by the size of the refunding package, which at
Dollars 36bn was at the low end of expectations and triggered some
short-covering. The package is made up of Dollars 15bn in 3-year notes,
Dollars 11bn in 10-year notes and Dollars 10bn in 29 1/2 year bonds.
The Treasury also decided to re-open the 8 per cent long bond.
There was little reaction to the morning's release of personal income and
spending figures for March. Personal income rose 0.6 per cent in the month
on a seasonally adjusted basis, while February's increase was revised to 1
per cent from a previous estimate of 1.1 per cent.

<TEXT>
KOOR Industries, Israel's largest industrial conglomerate, yesterday
reported its first annual net profit in five years. The company posted net
earnings of Dollars 89m in 1991, after losing Dollars 48m the previous year.
Faced with the threat of liquidation three years ago, Koor launched a
recovery programme and last September signed a comprehensive debt
restructuring programme with its local and foreign creditors.
'For the first time in 1991, our financial statements reflected the full
extent of an administrative, operational and financial revolution that has
taken place at Koor,' said Mr Benjamin Gaon, president. 'Comparison of the
reported results since 1988 clearly indicates the constant improvement over
those years.'
Koor's operational profits were up by 84 per cent last year, to Dollars
134m. Sales fell 11 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn, compared with the previous
year. This was attributed to reduced holdings in subsidiaries.
Since 1987, Koor has registered Dollars 720m in accumulated losses. As part
of its recovery programme, it cut its workforce by almost 50 per cent, to
about 16,000 people. It also sold off more than Dollars 300m in assets.
Under the terms of the financial restructuring signed last year, the Israeli
banks, which were owed Dollars 600m, exchanged a third of their debt for
equity and rescheduled the remainder over nine years. As a result, they have
become collectively the biggest shareholders in Koor.

RIO ALGOM, Canadian subsidiary of the UK mining group RTZ, suffered a
two-thirds drop in first-quarter earnings on lower mineral prices and stiff
competition in the metals distribution business, writes Bernard Simon.
But Mr Colin Macaulay, chief executive, told yesterday's annual meeting that
the company was continuing to seek sizeable base-metal acquisitions, mainly
in North America. Rio Algom has earmarked a large chunk of its cash
reserves, which totalled CDollars 180m (USDollars 151m) on December 31, for
takeovers.
Net earnings skidded to CDollars 4.9m from CDollars 14m a year earlier.
Mr Macaulay said 1992 earnings would be similar to the 51 cents a share
earned in 1991.

MCCAW Cellular, the largest cellular telephone company in the US, yesterday
reported a substantially lower first-quarter loss, improved cash flow and a
41 per cent year-on-year increase in cellular subscribers.
McCaw, which has incurred a heavy debt burden to build up a national
cellular network, is not expected by Wall Street to become profitable for a
considerable time.
It reported losses of Dollars 118.9m, or 67 cents a share, compared with a
loss of Dollars 169.1m, or 97 cents, a year ago. However, revenues grew 32
per cent, from Dollars 209.6m to Dollars 276.6m, and cash flow was up 41 per
cent at Dollars 113m, against Dollars 80m. Its interest expense dropped from
Dollars 152m to Dollars 129.3m.
The number of subscribers in markets where McCaw owns a controlling interest
 -plus those of its subsidiary LIN Broadcasting and the jointly owned San
Francisco system - rose to 1.77m at end-March, compared with 1.26m a year
earlier.

MR Robert Campeau, the fallen Canadian property and retail tycoon, has given
Olympia &amp; York another headache by filing a CDollars 1.25bn (USDollars
1.05bn) lawsuit against the cash-strapped developer.
Mr Campeau, out of the public eye since financial difficulties forced him to
relinquish control of his family company, alleged that O&amp;Y paid Campeau
Corporation an unrealistically low 'insider's price' for the 50 per cent O&amp;Y
did not already own of Scotia Plaza, one of Toronto's biggest office
buildings.
The allegations are spelt out in detail in a 32-page statement of claim
lodged with an Ontario court. The claim is also directed at National Bank of
Canada, the largest single shareholder in Campeau Corporation after seizing
a block of Mr Campeau's shares.
O&amp;Y is likely to defend the claim vigorously , but the threat of the large
lawsuit will be of no comfort to the banks negotiating to restructure its
Dollars 12bn debt.
Mr Campeau alleges that Campeau Corp directors nominated by O&amp;Y and National
Bank approved the Scotia Plaza sale. He said O&amp;Y paid CDollars 225m for the
50 per cent stake in Scotia Plaza last year, while a leading Canadian
pension fund had offered CDollars 776m for the entire building in January
1990. Mr Campeau said he obtained reputable valuations a month before the
sale which indicated that the value of the building 'was well in excess of
what O&amp;Y had paid'.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Calpers blocks directors seeking
re-election at Sears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE California Public Employees' Retirement System, better known as Calpers
and the largest public pension fund investor in the US, said yesterday it
had voted against all the directors standing for re-election at Sears,
Roebuck, the retail and financial services group.
Sears, which has been the subject of shareholder agitation for several
years, is holding its annual general meeting on May 14. Three directors on
its reduced nine-man board are up for re-election.
Mr Dale Hanson, chief executive, said the fund's proxy guidelines normally
require a supportive vote. 'In this case, Sears' continual poor performance,
and the board's obvious reluctance to insist that Mr Brennan (Sears chairman
and chief executive) make the changes necessary to save this company,
compelled us to express our displeasure in some tangible way.'
Calpers threw its weight behind four motions put forward by dissident
shareholders at Sears including one which requires a study of the
possibilities of splitting the group's different interests into separate
companies. Much of the dissatisfaction with Sears centres on its large
retail operations. Some of its financial services interests, which include
the Dean Witter brokerage and the Allstate insurance company, are seen as
more attractive propositions.
The other three proposals backed by Calpers include a suggestion that the
jobs of chairman and chief executive be split between different people; a
strengthening of confidentiality of the proxy vote; and the elimination of
the staggered terms for board directors. Directors currently hold office for
three years, and each year approximately one third of the directors' terms
expire.
Calpers owns 2m Sears shares, worth about Dollars 85m at yesterday's price
of Dollars 42 7/8 , up Dollars  1/4 . This represents about 0.6 per cent of
Sears' stock. However, as one of the biggest institutional investors in the
US with assets of Dollars 68bn, it has taken a leading role in matters of
corporate policy.
Sears has battled against shareholders' criticism with attempts to revamp
its stores, overhaul the organisational structure on the merchandising side,
and several tranches of job cuts. Last year, it pushed up net profits from a
depressed Dollars 902m to Dollars 1.28bn, but said that more needed to be
done.

<TEXT>
FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, lifted net
income by 20.5 per cent to R187.8m (Dollars 65.2m) in the six months to
end-March on the back of asset growth of 18 per cent, writes Philip Gawith
in Johannesburg.
The bank recorded a 26.9 per cent increase in net interest income, to
R920.6m, and a 21.8 per cent rise in the bad debt charge, to R160.5m. Mr
Barry Swart, managing director, said the interest performance was due to the
bank's focus on profitable business. The 27 per cent rise in net interest
income came from a 20.6 per cent rise in advances. Other operating income
was 21 per cent higher at R645.4m, but was overshadowed by a 23.1 per cent
rise in other operating expenses.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: European offshoot stages a
recovery

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Europe staged a financial recovery in the first three months this
year and achieved a net profit of Dollars 84m against a loss of Dollars 129m
a year ago.
Its automotive operations, including Jaguar, its UK luxury car subsidiary,
slumped to a net loss in the whole of last year of Dollars 1.079bn from a
net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989.
Ford said it operated profitably in most of its main European markets in the
first quarter, and had reduced the operating losses of Jaguar to Dollars 90m
from around Dollars 130m.
The company claimed Ford of Britain - now excluding Jaguar, where ownership
has been transferred to the US parent company - had also achieved a small
profit in the first three months after suffering record losses last year.
The financial improvement in the UK, achieved despite the continuing decline
in the UK new car market, was the chief factor behind Ford of Europe's
return to profit.
In the whole of last year the losses of Dollars 761m at Ford of Britain and
Dollars 354m at Jaguar had more than offset profits made in continental
Europe and in some other overseas markets.
Ford of Britain, excluding Jaguar, made a small profit in the first quarter,
despite a 10.3 per cent fall in sales volume to 95,896 from 106,892 a year
ago.
Ford said its UK marketing costs, although still high, had been reduced to
17 per cent of sales revenues from 19 per cent a year ago.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Ford returns to the black with
earnings of Dollars 338m

FORD Motor yesterday under-scored the gradual recovery under way in the US
car market with its first profit since the third quarter of 1990.
General Motors, the biggest US vehicle manufacturer, on Tuesday reported its
first profit after six quarters of red ink.
Both companies were hit hard last year by a slump in demand during the US
recession, which led to heavy price discounting. They are now being helped
by a modest pick-up in orders, resulting in lower rebates and sweeping
cost-cutting programmes.
Ford surprised analysts by also reporting a net profit of Dollars 84m from
its European operations, compared with a loss of Dollars 129m in the same
period of last year.
Most surprising of all, the company made a small profit in the UK after
record 1991 losses.
The company said group earnings for the quarter totalled Dollars 338m, or 60
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 24.6bn, compared with a net loss of
Dollars 884m, or Dollars 1.88, on sales of Dollars 21.34bn a year ago.
Mr Harold Poling, chairman, warned that a continuation of the turnround
would depend greatly on a sustained recovery in the US and other key
markets. 'Although industry sales in the US remained weak in the first
quarter, there are signs of an improving trend,' Mr Poling added.
Ford's US automotive operations earned Dollars 57m, against a loss of
Dollars 947m a year ago. However, the business was only put into the black
by a Dollars 61m gain from the sale of a computer concern.
Overseas, the group earned Dollars 28m, compared with a loss of Dollars
208m.
The financial services group contributed Dollars 253m, down Dollars 18m,
which the company attributed to one-off gains a year ago.
Ford officials said reasons for the US improvement included a sharp
reduction in heavily discounted sales to wholesale fleet buyers, which
dropped from 37 per cent of vehicle sales to 29 per cent.
Despite this, the company's share of the US car market rose one percentage
point from the full-year 1991 level, to 21.1 per cent.
Despite the improvement in Britain, Ford's Jaguar luxury car business lost
'a little' less than Dollars 100m, according to a company official, against
a loss of 'a little more' than Dollars 100m a year ago.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: GM tunes up its recovery plans -
Some urgency at the slow-moving car maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, a large foot appears to have hit the accelerator marked 'reform'
at General Motors, the troubled but slow-moving US vehicle manufacturer.
In quick succession over the past week the world's largest vehicle company
has announced plans for a Dollars 2.3bn international share offering; a
reorganisation of the management structure in its loss-making North American
car operations; and the group's first quarterly profit after 18 months of
red ink.
At first glance all this might seem a rapid and dramatic response to the
extraordinary boardroom coup which shook GM at the start of this month.
That was when the company's non-executive directors, frustrated by
management's slow pace of reform, clipped the wings of Mr Robert Stempel,
the GM chairman, by removing him from the leadership of an important board
committee.
They also demoted two of his lieutenants, including Mr Lloyd Reuss, the
group's president and head of North American operations, who was replaced by
Mr Jack Smith, head of GM's highly profitable international operations.
Certainly, since the coup, GM has been setting about restructuring itself
with a much greater sense of urgency. Yet the road it is following is
basically the same as that outlined by the 'old' management team between
December and February, when Mr Stempel announced plans to close 21 plants by
the middle of the decade, cut 70,000 jobs and radically overhaul the North
American management structure. That said, Mr Smith has added some
significant new twists to the strategy.
GM's basic problem in North America is its bureaucratic, slow-moving,
nature. This means it has failed to react - until now - with sufficient
vigour to its loss of market share to Japanese rivals, and has tended to
avoid labour confrontations by buying off the powerful United Auto Workers
union.
It produces a bewildering range of cars, serving overlapping markets, which
bear seven different brand names and have a decidedly mixed design
reputation.
To sustain its 35 per cent car market share, it relies heavily on discounted
sales to fleet operators.
Its past failure to close excess capacity means many of its plants are
running way below break-even, while its contract with the UAW means it pays
members irrespective of whether they are actually working.
All this could be glossed over during the industry's up-cycle in the late
1980s, but the recession of the past year has exposed the company's
fundamental weaknesses. Its losses of Dollars 4.5bn in 1991, the highest
ever reported by an American company, eroded its balance sheet and
liquidity, and created a very negative climate on Wall Street.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, lowered its rating on GM's
senior debt in mid-March, on the grounds that the group's North American
reforms looked inadequate to bolster liquidity.
Even more seriously, S&amp;P threatened to do the same for GM's commercial
paper, which provides cheap funding for its important financing arm.
The share issue which GM announced last Friday, but which appears to have
been approved by the board many weeks ago, forms a major plank in the
company's efforts to convince Wall Street that it has sufficient liquidity.
The company will also issue Dollars 500m of shares to its underfunded
pension scheme. All this, together with several recent tranches of
preference stock, will bring to more than Dollars 6bn the amount of equity
capital GM will have raised since last summer.
The success of the issue will depend on Mr Stempel and his colleagues
convincing investors during an international road show that the company
really is getting to grips with its operating problems.
They will get a little help from this week's first-quarter figures, which
were modestly better than analysts had been expecting. The group made
Dollars 179m, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.1bn before special items a
year ago.
North America was still heavily in the red - to the tune of Dollars 1bn,
according to analysts' estimates - but the losses were much reduced.
Detroit rival Ford also reported a return to profit yesterday, and recovery
from recession over the next year should float the industry as a whole away
from the financial rocks.
Yet GM's profit levels are derisory for a business with quarterly turnover
of Dollars 32bn, and investors will need convincing its recovery plans can
not only produce a sustained improvement, but do it mighty quickly too.
Mr Stempel hinted in a speech this week that he did indeed plan to speed up
his leisurely schedule of 21 factory closures. So far only 14 of those to be
shut have been identified.
And his plans to reorganise North America's management structure have also
been accelerated since the coup. The idea, first outlined by Mr Stempel in
February, is to cut out bureaucracy and speed decision-making by scrapping
the framework established in 1984 by Mr Roger Smith, GM's previous chairman.
Roger Smith set up three cumbersome divisions. Two of them made and sold
cars - Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada and Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac - and
one did the same for trucks and buses.
All this has been ditched in favour of a single umbrella organisation,
headed by Jack Smith. There is a single team in charge of passenger car
engineering and manufacturing, a similar one for trucks, and a single group
to oversee all US vehicles sales and marketing.
The result should be a more coherent, co-ordinated approach to the business,
and could eventually mean rationalisation of the model range, or even total
elimination of one of the brand names.
The top managers for the new structure were appointed last week and the
biggest gainer is Mr Michael Losh, 45, who has been put in charge of all
sales and marketing. For running the struggling Oldsmobile division, where
he was credited with considerable marketing flair.
However, the structure announced last week contains one large change from
the pre-coup, pre-Smith scheme. A new post, head of worldwide purchasing,
has been created, and it is to be filled by Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, a 50-year-old Spaniard, who is head of GM purchasing in Europe.
When Mr Smith was turning round GM Europe in the mid-1980s, Mr Lopez played
a key part in the strategy of cutting components costs by buying cheaper
ones from non-traditional suppliers around the continent and beyond.
Mr Lopez's new role suggests Mr Smith will try the same tactic in North
America, which could spell trouble for GM's in-house parts operations, which
have been shielded from competition. It could also spell confrontation with
the UAW, which is opposed to further out-sourcing of parts.
Another important ingredient in the GM's successful European operations has
been the introduction of three-shift, round-the-clock working at its
factories.
Mr Smith may try to replicate this in the US, again risking difficulties
with the UAW, which is smarting from the 21 closures.
The union does not appear in a particularly strong position. It suffered a
serious defeat earlier this month at Caterpillar, the heavy equipment group,
where a management threat to replace strikers led to a return to work.
But even if GM's management changes proceed smoothly - a big if, given the
turmoil that followed the 1984 plan - Mr Smith will need to tread softly and
carry a very big stick if he is to bring the UAW along with the revolution.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Delta Air slices Dollars 5bn off
nine-year spending

<TEXT>
DELTA Air Lines, one of the three US 'mega-carriers', yesterday announced
plans to cut more than Dollars 5bn from its capital expenditure plans over
the next nine years by reducing new aircraft deliveries.
The carrier said the spending reduction was part of an attempt to 'implement
changes in its fundamental cost structure,' and would result in the airline
taking delivery of over 100 fewer aircraft. Capital spending plans had
previously stood at about Dollars 22bn.
Delta's action mirrors that of American Airlines and United Airlines, its
two big rivals in the US.
Delta declined to specify precisely which aircraft would be affected
although it said both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft were involved.
It has 275 aircraft on option with the two manufacturers, and 168 on order.
But The airline said it would not exercise options expiring on May 1 for
10MD-88s and two Boeing-757s.
Boeing said yesterday it had only had preliminary discussions with Delta,
and believed only aircraft under option were affected. Delta, however, said
 -within the total cuts - both aircraft on order and under option would be
involved.
The Atlanta-based carrier, which last year bought Pan Am's east coast
shuttle and transatlantic routes, stressed that other efforts to prune its
cost base were under way.
Mr Ron Allen, chairman, said personnel would be cut via attrition, some
facilities consolidated, some hub city flight complexes streamlined, and
more use made of part-time and contract personnel.
Delta has one of the youngest fleets in the US, with an average age of 9.17
years.
It has also been among the strongest carriers financially. However, this
month it reported a Dollars 199.3m operating loss for the first quarter of
1992, despite a lower fuel bill.
Mr Allen conceded that losses had escalated recently.

THE SPANISH stock market commission yesterday disallowed a Dollars 133m
(Pounds 75.1m) bid by J Bibby for control of Finanzauto, the country's
monopoly Caterpillar distributor. The bid will have to be resubmitted in
mid-May.
The commission said Bibby, the industrial and agricultural conglomerate
which is 79 per cent owned by the South African Barlow Rand group, had not
presented proof that its shareholders supported the bid. The UK group will
have to call a shareholders' meeting to confirm their support. Bibby's
advisers, Baring Brothers, said yesterday that the meeting would take place
on May 14.
Meanwhile, the commission said trading in Finanzauto, which has rejected the
Pta 1,300 (705p) a share offer as too low, would resume on May 4. It seems
likely that the share price will rise sharply from the Pta 1,075 at which it
was suspended last week.
Before the market watchdog stopped the bid, analysts in Madrid had almost
unanimously welcomed it.

763m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MAXWELL Communication Corporation's liabilities exceeded its assets by
Pounds 763.5m at the end of last year, according to a letter sent yesterday
to MCC's creditors by Price Waterhouse.
The accountants, who are joint administrators of MCC under UK insolvency law
following the collapse of the business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell,
will meet creditors on May 14 to discuss plans for selling the businesses.
The letter's Statement of Affairs, drawn up by some of MCC's directors and
sworn by Mr Basil Brookes, finance director, says that at December 20 MCC
had liabilities of Pounds 1.49bn but assets of only Pounds 724.9m.
Liabilities included unsecured borrowings of Pounds 1.28bn and foreign
exchange and swaps contracts of Pounds 59.7m.
They also included a Pounds 52m liability for the deficit on the pension
fund which was plundered by Mr Maxwell, together with the pension funds of
his other companies, in an attempt to prop up his tottering private
companies. However, the administrators have received legal advice that 'MCC
has no liability in this respect'.
The biggest part of the asset figure - Pounds 673.5m - is the estimated sale
value of MCC's subsidiaries. However, the letter emphasises that the
administrators have not yet decided whether to sell the US publishing
businesses, the largest of the subsidiaries, in one piece or broken up.
Price Waterhouse will now ask other directors for their sworn statements of
concurrence with these figures, and confirmed last night that this will
include Mr Kevin Maxwell, the late publisher's youngest son, formerly MCC's
chief executive.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD Black, the Canadian publisher who owns the Daily Telegraph, has
been given one month to see if he can forge a deal to buy the New York Daily
News, the paper said yesterday, Reuter reports.
The Daily News, currently under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, has been
seeking a new buyer since the publishing empire of Mr Robert Maxwell, its
last owner, collapsed last year.
Mr Black, who has extensive interests in Canada and also owns the Jerusalem
Post, was given the go-ahead to begin negotiations to buy the paper at a
meeting with the Daily News management, unions and creditors on Tuesday.
The paper said the go-ahead did not constitute approval of Mr Black's
proposal to buy it, but one member of the 'working group' at the meeting was
quoted by the paper as saying that the decision meant that the Canadian
publisher has now become the front-runner.
Mr Black was given four weeks to see if he could fashion a deal through
Hollinger, his Vancouver-based company. If he fails, the working group said
there were other alternatives.
One was to turn to Mr Mort Zuckerman, a real estate developer who has also
made a bid for the paper. Also there was speculation that Mr Black might be
interested in a joint deal with Mr Peter Kalikow, the owner of the New York
Post. But it is thought that Mr Kalikow and Mr Black's discussions have
ended.
New York newspaper industry sources said a deal to buy the Daily News could
total about Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) - about Dollars 30m to pay off
creditors, another Dollars 30m to buy out staff and Dollars 40m in working
capital to modernise the paper.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Policing problems ahead over quality of the
distilled essence - The operating and financial review for company accounts
should be popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDESPREAD welcome for the operating and financial review proposed
yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board is likely to be matched only by
the problems of effective enforcement.
The review is designed to extract and boil down the details of accounts and
present them in a way that is easy to understand.
Indeed, for lay readers, it may well replace the accounts themselves as the
main point of reference.
It will appeal to many preparers of accounts for at least two reasons.
First, while it places great emphasis on presenting a balanced, detailed
commentary on a company, it is deliberately vague in specifying exactly what
information will be required.
Second, it is not legally enforceable. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the
ASB, says the board would have preferred the review to be an accounting
standard which could be policed by its financial reporting review panel. But
because it is not part of the accounts and goes far beyond existing
accounting practice, it has had to settle for a voluntary statement instead.
Both points place the review in stark contrast to its equivalents in the US
and Canada, where the so-called 'management discussion and analysis' is a
mandatory part of the annual report, and has been criticised for being brief
and uninformative as a result.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, chairman of the technical committee of the Hundred Group
of leading companies' finance directors, says: 'We are certainly more
positive than negative about the review. We want something that is
interesting, readable and relevant, not turbid, mechanistic and useless.'
The board is relying on the power of moral suasion to put the review into
practice. It hopes that bodies such as the Stock Exchange, the Confederation
of British Industry and the Hundred Group will apply pressure on individual
companies to embrace both the principle and the spirit of the guidelines.
If it is widely adopted and consistently applied, it may, at some time in
the future, fall within the realms of normal accounting practice, when it
could be legally enforced.
In the meantime, it could lobby for two possibilities. The Stock Exchange
could insist on adoption of the review from quoted companies - in the same
way that management discussion and analysis is required by the US Securities
and Exchange Commission.
Alternatively, auditors could be required to verify the review, to ensure
that it is accurate. If it contained a sentence saying that the text had
been produced in line with the guidelines, auditors might be obliged to
comment publicly if they disagreed or felt that it did not fairly reflect
their own understanding of the company.
Failing that, the board must rely on a more gradual, voluntary adoption of
the review, coupled with criticism from investors, analysts, journalists and
other users of accounts to bring the laggards more in line with its
principles.
The board has been cautious to build early support for the review, by
showing early drafts to outside organisations, including the Hundred Group,
before issuing the discussion document for wider consultation yesterday.
The stamp of these preliminary talks with industry may explain much of the
thrust of the document: it places more emphasis on companies looking
backwards to the last year, rather than forwards to its survival.
It also leaves companies wide leeway to explain what they consider are the
most important factors influencing their development, rather than any
mandatory requirements of factors to be listed.
The scope of the review is still ambitious, however. A handful of companies
 -such as Cadbury Schweppes, BOC and Shell - already exhibit some of the
points the review is trying to achieve. But even these statements have
limitations, while the vast majority of reports fall far short of what will
be required.
Only later in the autumn, when the formally worded exposure draft appears,
will users be able to judge how strict the final requirements of the
statement are likely to be.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: MFI summer reflotation details expected
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI is expected to announce today that it is going ahead with its
reflotation this summer.
The kitchen and bedroom furniture retailer's shareholders met yesterday to
discuss proposals for the float.
The group, which was the subject of a Pounds 718m management buy-out from
Asda, the supermarket group, in 1987, has fought off recession and a Pounds
500m debt burden to return to the stock market.
Analysts are forecasting that it will make trading profits of Pounds 65m to
Pounds 70m for the year which ends this month. MFI reported a rise in
trading profits to Pounds 25m (Pounds 20.6m) at the interim stage.
It said that January sales were buoyant and trading wasstrong.
On that basis the group could be valued at more than Pounds 750m in the
flotation.
The issue will raise cash to pay off most of the debt as well as providing
some return for existing shareholders.
Asda retains a 25 per cent stake in MFI, which it carries at nil in its
books, and has some convertible loan stock, acquired when MFI had a
refinancing in 1989, which it wrote down to Pounds 2m in its balance sheet.
MFI appointed advisers for the float in February. County NatWest is the
merchant bank, and Smith New Court Corporate Finance and Rowe &amp; Pitman are
the brokers.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sale of many branches likely to be
difficult - The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED merger would result in the closure of 800 to 1,000 branches
over the next four years, according to Lloyds.
Chartered surveyors believe that the clearing bank might not find it easy to
shed so many branches at a time of weak demand, although the disposal
programme is unlikely to make a significant impact on the market for high
street property.
Well-located branches would attract good demand, said Mr Chris Peacock of
Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyor. 'However, if the more poorly
located secondary and tertiary buildings were offered, there would need to
be an upturn in the market in order to implement a successful disposal
programme.'
In the past year, however, Midland has had no difficulties in disposing of
20 or so branches in secondary and tertiary positions in the south-east,
according to its advisers. 'They tend to be prominent sites in the heart of
a small community,' said one surveyor.
Disposing of bank branches poses particular difficulties.
They tend to be housed in substantial stone buildings with few windows - in
short, the kind of buildings which need extensive conversion work to render
them suitable for retailers.
The style and the position of the buildings often lend themselves to fast
food outlets, pubs and restaurants, although obtaining planning permission
for this change of use can sometimes be difficult.
In the past, building societies have been a strong source of demand for
unwanted bank branches, although banks were sometimes unwilling to sell
their leases to a direct competitor.
However, after rapid expansion during the 1980s, building societies have
been retrenching. 'The backlog of demand from the building societies is not
there,' according to Mr Richard Smith, retail director at Debenhams Tewson &amp;
Chinnocks, the property adviser.
The closures are likely to make the greatest impact in the Midlands and
South Wales, areas where both banks have a large number of branches.
However, high streets in these areas have been relatively robust at a time
when some parts of the country are struggling badly as a result of surplus
space, increased business rates and depressed demand.
According to Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyor, retail rents fell by
2.2 per cent in Wales and by 1.1 to 2.2 per cent in the Midlands in the year
to February.
The proposed bid highlights the large amount of potentially surplus property
owned by banks. Lloyds maintains that the same number of branches will be
closed even if the banks remain independent.
Mr Brian Pitman, its chief executive, believes that half the 20,000 bank and
building society branches across the UK will close over the next decade.
Over the past three years, Lloyds has closed and merged 400 branches,
reducing its total to 1,900, while Midland has closed 180 branches reducing
its total to 1,830.
Banks have been acutely aware of the need to improve their property
management, as their premises account for a significant proportion of their
assets. At the end of 1991, the net book value of Midland's property was
Pounds 1.1bn with a shortfall between the book and market value of Pounds
226m. At the end of 1990, Lloyds' premises were valued at Pounds 1.2bn.
The prospect of several thousand buildings seeking new occupants over the
course of the decade raises broader issues about the state of the high
street. The growth of out-of-town stores during the 1980s led to concern
that high streets were being undermined.
However, these fears have tended to subside as high streets have held their
own against shopping centres in a difficult letting market. 'The death of
the high street is greatly exaggerated,' says Mr Harold Couch of Hillier
Parker.
Vacancy rates in high streets are relatively low at less than 5 per cent,
according to Mr Couch.
High street rents have fallen by about 4 per cent in each of the last two
years.
The banks may experience greater problems in disposing of their London
office properties, in a market that is suffering from severe over-supply and
poor demand. Both Lloyds and Midland own 19 City properties, according to
Applied Property Research, an independent research group.
'In the oversupplied central London market, a rationalisation programme
involving the administrative and headquarters office buildings could prove
to be problematical, at least in the short term,' said Mr Peacock. 'However
the well located branch offices in established retail pitches will attract
considerable interest.'
'This will be a further test of the banks' ingenuity in coping with surplus
space at a time when they have already found extreme difficulty in disposing
of such buildings,' said Mr Geoff Marsh of APR.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs help push Wharfedale
to losses of Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHARFEDALE, the loud-speaker manufacturer, fell into losses in the six
months to December 31.
The Leeds-based company, which is being reorganised under a new chairman and
chief executive, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.34m compared with a
profit of Pounds 106,000 last time.
The outcome was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 443,000
covering reorganisation and other costs. There was also an extraordinary
charge of Pounds 366,000 relating to the write-off of its investment earlier
this year in Finewood, a loudspeaker cabinet maker, and the closure of its
Germany subsidiary.
Turnover for the period fell to Pounds 4.75m from Pounds 6.72m as the
company faced difficult markets in the UK, where it has 40 per cent of
turnover, and Europe.
Losses loss per share were 6p compared with earnings 0.2p and there is again
no dividend. The last distribution to shareholders was in 1988.
Mr Pieter Totte, who took over as chief executive in January, said that the
reorgan isation programme was going according to plan, operatio nal
performance had improved and that the company was on the way to recovery.
Wharfedale was also preparing to make a sizeable ac-quisition in the hi-fi
industry in the next three months, he added.
The main priorities of the reorganisation were to concentrate on the core
businesses, cut costs and reduce gearing. The company has already reduced
the workforce by 30 per cent and cut Pounds 880,000 of costs.
Wharfedale would not indicate what its borrowings were but said it hoped to
reduce gearing by bring-ing debtors and stock levels down.
Mr Totte indicated that the company was now ready to make acquisitions in
order to attain the critical mass necessary to fund R&amp;D expenditure.
Even excluding the large Japanese manufacturers, there are about 20 smaller
players in the UK with turnover of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 15m.
'We want to take the fragmentation out of this market by assuming critical
mass of about Pounds 40m in turnover,' he said.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Banks' German subsidiaries face an
uncertain future if the merger goes through - The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS easy to forget that two of Germany's leading investment banks are
owned by Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank, so discreetly is the arms length
relationship conducted on both sides.
Midland owns 80 per cent of Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, the Dusseldorf bank which
specialises in innovative securities dealing, while Lloyds has more than 75
per cent of Frankfurt-based Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst which concentrates on
institutional stockbroking and fund management.
What will happen to them if a merger between the UK banks goes through?
At this stage, the future of the German banks must have a low priority for
their parents.
First of all, the legal complexities of any merger would have to be
negotiated. Then, the initial concentration if a deal took place would be on
sorting out the British operations.
Both Trinkaus and SMH are profitable and have high reputations, so no
immediate action would be necessary in Germany.
Clearly, however, a merged UK bank would have to consider whether it needed
two private German banks, however successful.
This raises the question of sale or merger. Trinkaus is a quoted company, so
its sale would conceivably be easier. There have been market rumours in the
past that Midland might be forced to sell the bank, but it has asserted that
it intends to keep Trinkaus. Lloyds, for its part, has sold off some of its
smaller foreign operations, but has hung on to SMH.
Alternatively, the German banks could merge, especially since their
operations complement each other rather than overlap. This then raises the
question of style and personal chemistry and again is something Lloyds and
Midland would certainly not address at the start of any merger.
At present, the German banks are clearly happy with the policy of
non-interference followed by their UK owners. 'We do not have griffins (the
Midland emblem) stamped all over us", said Mr Herbert Jacobi, Trinkaus's
senior partner.
Before Midland came on the scene in 1980, Trinkaus was owned by Citibank of
the US, which had tended to neglect securities dealing in favour of
commercial business. Since then, it has developed its strength as an
innovator on the capital markets and is also active in commercial banking
and asset management.
Lloyds rescued SMH after it nearly collapsed in the early 1980s over a
lending scandal. Three years ago, it sold about 5 per cent of its holding to
the German bank's partners and management to help it cultivate its identity
as a specifically German private bank.
A month ago, SMH, which concentrates on institutional stockbroking and fund
management, announced its first capital-raising exercise in eight years with
a planned rise in equity capital of DM40m to DM180m (Pounds 61.2m).

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat loan lifts shares 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Greycoat, the UK property group, leapt 13 per cent
yesterday as it was confirmed that the Pounds 126m refinancing of Embankment
Place, the group's 345,000 sq ft property in London, had finally been
completed.
Greycoat had attempted to refinance the development, which was started five
years ago, at the beginning of this year.
However, its attempts to interest investors in a deep-discounted bond issue
at that time were unsuccessful.
The company announced yesterday that it had now completed a Pounds 125.8m,
seven-year syndicated loan involving a total of nine banks.
The deal, which gives the company an option to extend the loan to 10 years
in all, should carry the group over until London property prices are next on
a rising trend, maintained Mr Richard Guignard, managing director of
finance.
Greycoat has swapped the floating rate money provided by the banks into
fixed-rate finance, at a rate of 11.2 per cent.
That implies a margin of about 1.5 per cent over the banks' cost of funds -
about double the margin paid by Greycoat on the initial financing for the
development, and a reflection of the bank's lack of appetite for greater
exposure to the UK property sector.
Mr Guignard said that the loan had been completed without Greycoat being
forced to accept more onerous covenants than had existed on the previous
financing, an important consideration for the equity market, which has taken
fright at property companies.
Greycoat's shares gained 7p to 61p yesterday, having risen from a floor of
33p as recently as April 13.
'The market was concerned about our ability to refinance and retain these
major buildings,' said Mr Guignard. The company has no other sizeable
refinancings to complete until 1995, when a Pounds 50m zero coupon bond
issue matures, he said.

INGHAM, the wool textile spinner, announced a reduction, from Pounds 223,000
to Pounds 152,000, in pre-tax losses for 1991 on turnover down from Pounds
5.11m to Pounds 4.83m.
Losses per share amounted to 4.7p against 6.1p, but the final dividend of 2p
maintains the total at 3p.
Accompanying the announcement were details of the acquisition of Eborgate
for Pounds 949,000, which will be satisfied by the issue of up to 998,947
new shares of 95p each. Further consideration may be payable.
Ingham is to raise about Pounds 2.8m net via a 1-for-1 rights issue, also at
95p a share.
Proceeds of the issue, fully underwritten by Singer &amp; Friedlander, will be
used to strengthen the balance sheet and to provide funds for further
acquisitions.
Ingham has forecast total dividends of 4.75p on the enlarged capital.
Mr Nicholas McMahon Turner, appointed chief executive in February, is also
chief executive of and a substantial shareholder in Eborgate.
Together with members of his family he holds 43 per cent of Eborgate's
ordinary shares.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Chief says BSkyB was near liquidation last
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, came close to
liquidation last year, it was revealed yesterday.
Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of the consortium, said the trouble came less than
five months after the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky
Television when Barclays Bank turned down an application for a Pounds 200m
project loan.
Mr Barlow is also group managing director of Pearson, which owns the
Financial Times and has a significant stake in BSkyB.
'Technically we (BSkyB) were insolvent. If we went on trading without
further financing we would have been trading while insolvent and I could
have gone to jail,' Mr Barlow said yesterday at a London lunch.
Mr Barlow immediately flew to Tucson, Arizona where Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief
executive of The News Corporation was staying at a health farm. News Corp
has a 50 per cent stake in BSkyB.
Mr Barlow said that over dinner he explained that unless Mr Murdoch could
invest Pounds 100m he would seek the protection of the courts and that would
have led to liquidation with vast debts.
'Rupert was very sympathetic, although obviously he thought I was trying to
pull some plot to reduce his stake.' The Pounds 200m was raised with Mr
Murdoch putting up part of his Pounds 100m in value. Mr Barlow forecast that
by mid-1993 the venture would make profits after financing charges.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Both banks have their roots in Birmingham -
The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH LLOYDS and Midland have their roots firmly embedded in the industrial
heritage of Birmingham and both played important roles in the industrial
development of the Midlands.
Mr Carl Chinn, community historian at Birmingham University, argued that
Lloyds rather than Midland had the strongest historical identity in the
City: 'I doubt if most people would know that the Midland started here but
children are taught about the Lloyd family at school and know about the
beginnings of Lloyds bank.'
In 1765, Mr Sampson Lloyd, the Welsh Quaker iron-master, together with Mr
John Taylor, a button-maker, founded Taylors and Lloyds bank, the forerunner
of Lloyds, in Birmingham, and started a Midlands tradition of banks working
closely with the early industrialists.
Mr Chinn said: 'People think of Birmingham as an industrial community which
it is, but the industry could not have survived without the provision of
capital. Birmingham was a great banking centre and local people put up the
money to make it happen.'
Only later, he said, did the image of northern industrialists divorced from
City bankers develop as London became established as the centre of banking.
'In the early 1800s there was not the split between industry and capital
that there is today,' he said.
Midland was founded in 1836 by Mr Charles Geach, a former Bank of England
employee who opened the first headquarters in Union Street, Birmingham. Mr
Geach once rode through rioters to get help from the military when
Birmingham's financial district was threatened by a mob.
The big difference between Midland and Lloyds was that Lloyds was for many
years a family partnership whereas Midland was a company owned by
shareholders from the start. Joint stock banks, as they were then called,
were allowed by Parliament in 1826.
Midland still has strong ties with Birmingham where it found many of its
most loyal industrial account holders. Mr Edwin Green, the Midland Bank
archivist said: 'It is remarkable that two of the largest clearing banks
originated in Birmingham. There was a close relationship and it continued in
our case. Our customers were often our shareholders as well and it meant
there was a long loyalty from the 1830s onwards.'
Though Birmingham retains its importance to the Midland, Sheffield is now
its most important administrative centre. Since moving many of its head
office functions to Sheffield about 20 years ago the bank has been one of
the city's biggest private employers.
Some 2,000 staff work at Griffin House, Sheffield, which houses the bank's
marketing operations, information technology, mortgage processing, financial
services and a number of international operations.
Many of the Sheffield staff are now uncertain about their futures after
Lloyds' stated commitment to streamline administrative operations if it is
successful in its takeover plans. A large proportion of staff have cheap
mortgages which would be increased to normal interest rates if they were to
be made redundant.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: A Quantum leap by CMB with a ring-pull
fluted can
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAYS of the can opener may be numbered.
CMB, the Franco-British packaging group which makes about half of the 6bn
food cans manufactured in the UK each year, is launching a new product with
a radically different fluted body and a ring-pull end.
It claims this is the most significant development in can technology since
the invention of the two-piece can some 20 years ago.
Mr Francisco Serrano, the marketing manager responsible for launching the
can, said CMB was close to finalising a deal with a big consumer products
company and expected it to appear on supermarket shelves by the late summer.
The Quantum can, as it is known, has a vertically-fluted shell which gives
it a distinctive appearance and greater strength enabling the use of thinner
steel.
The new can's wall is 0.17mm thick compared with the 0.21mm in existing
straight-walled cans.
The can is likely, however, to cost more than the conventional product
because of the ring-pull end which tears away completely. The company
believes the extra cost means it will initially be used only for premium
products.
But the smooth texture of the can allows direct printing onto the metal,
dispensing with the need for a wrap-around printed label.
Steel cans were first produced 180 years ago to preserve food for military
forces. In those days cans were manufactured at the rate of six an hour.
Modern production lines turn them out at a rate of 500 to 1,000 a minute.
CMB says its new product can be used on existing filling lines with only
minor modifications. Its launch follows a three-year development programme
at CMB Foodcan's research facility at Wantage, Oxfordshire.
In market research studies, CMB found the can was preferred by more than 80
per cent of shoppers. But whether consumers with arthritis will be so
appreciative of the 'easy-to-open' ring-pulls remains a matter of doubt.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: EC regulations could halt Lloyds bid - The
Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK'S attempt to buy Midland could founder in a matter of a few
weeks, depending on the outcome of an arcane calculation on the magnitude of
another bank's UK assets which has to be made by the European Community
competition directorate, DG4, in Brussels.
Lloyds has set the pre-condition that its Pounds 3.6bn offer terms will only
be available to Midland's shareholders if both its bid and Hongkong and
Shanghai's rival bid for Midland are referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in the UK.
In order for this to happen, DG4 has to surrender jurisdiction for judging
the competition issues raised by Hongkong Bank's bid. It has to decide that
the questions should be examined by the UK competition authorities, the
Office of Fair Trading and the Department of Trade and Industry. Thereafter,
the DTI would have to decide whether to refer the bid to the MMC.
Under the EC Merger Regulation, the relatively new legislative framework for
EC competition policy, the question of whether DG4 or a member country's
authority has jurisdiction is decided by a number of tests. In the case of
the Hongkong Bank bid, the key condition relates to the percentage of its
assets which are in the UK.
An individual EC country's competition authority automatically has
jurisdiction over companies involved in a takeover bid if more than two
thirds of the companies' combined EC turnover is in that country. In the
case of banks, which do not have sales or turnover in a conventional sense,
the two thirds yardstick relates to assets.
The bulk of a typical bank's assets are loans. If two thirds of loans made
by Midland and Hongkong Bank are to customers in the UK, then the Hongkong
Bank bid would fall under OFT and DTI jurisdiction.
It is probable that more than two thirds of Midland Bank's loans are to UK
customers. However, the issue in the case of Hongkong Bank is more
problematic.
When it announced its Midland bid, it published a geographical analysis of
assets, showing that Pounds 14.4bn were in the UK and Pounds 604m in
continental Europe.
This would appear to be prima facie evidence that the DTI has jurisdiction
over this bid. However, Hongkong Bank's asset figures are misleading.
They are believed to relate to the origin of the assets. In other words,
they show that Pounds 14.4bn was lent by its UK operations. It is not the
origin of the loans which matters, under the merger regulation but it is the
destination which counts.
It is not clear whether that Pounds 14.4bn was lent to UK customers. There
is separate controversy over the definition of a UK customer.
Much of the Pounds 14.4bn will have been lent to other banks in the London
interbank market. If the funds were lent to the UK branch of a foreign bank,
it is unclear in the merger regulation whether the loan counts as a UK loan
or a foreign loan.
DG4 is at this moment trying to establish the destination of Hongkong Bank's
assets. In the coming month it will make a decision about whether it has
jurisdiction on this basis.
Lloyds is particularly anxious because it does not believe it has any right
to scrutinise the figures supplied by Hongkong Bank to DG4.
It may have to rely on the DTI to vet the figures. DTI officials made it
clear that they would take care in checking DG4's work. They dislike
surrendering authority to Brussels unless they have to.
But even if, in the coming weeks, DG4 does surrender jurisdiction to London,
Lloyds is by no means home and dry. It would then have to persuade Mr
Michael Heseltine, the new President of the Board of Trade, that there were
grounds for making a reference of the Hongkong bid to the MMC. That would
probably be an even tougher challenge.

FT  30 APR 92 / Call for fuller company reports: Accountancy body seeks
disclosure of more details by all quoted groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES should help share-holders by providing far more detailed comments
on their activities in annual reports, says the UK accountancy standards
body.
A new 'operating and financial review' statement should give a balanced,
objective statement of good and bad news, the Accounting Standards Board
recommends in draft proposals issued yesterday. It should include operating
results, financial needs and resources and shareholder value, and should be
written in an accessible style.
Mr David Tweedie, the board's chairman, said: 'What we're after is
management going behind the numbers and helping people understand their
business. I suspect many private shareholders will read this rather than the
accounts.' The suggestions are likely to lead to a statement of best
practice rather than the legally enforceable accounting standards the board
has been producing until now.
It would not be audited because it is not part of the accounts. But one
option being considered is whether auditors should be required to approve
the statement to ensure it complies with the guidelines.
Discussion of the ideas will lead to an exposure draft in the late autumn
and could be converted into a formal statement early next year.
The board would like this to apply to all the quoted companies, as well as
other businesses, including the private companies and large entities in the
public sector.
Among the more important items which the discussion paper says companies
should discuss are:
the main risks and uncertainties facing the company, including environmental
protection costs and liabilities; dependence on important customers or
sources of scarce raw materials; and the impact of exchange rate changes on
the results;
the current capital structure of the enterprise including the purpose and
impact of financial transactions undertaken; acquisitions and disposals; and
current solvency and liquidity, with details of peak borrowing requirements
and facilities;
the strengths and resources of the business with value which is not
adequately reflected in the balance sheet, such as brand names and other
intangible items.
The statement will not require profit forecasts and future projections, but
should look forward as well as backward and help users in making their own
projections of future results.
The review should be the responsibility of all the directors, and might
ultimately replace either the existing directors' report or the chief
executive's review included in existing annual reports.

FT  30 APR 92 / Police seek name of Channel 4 terrorism informant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL 4 television could face fines or seizure of assets if it refuses to
give police the name of an informant. They want to know who revealed the
existence of a secret loyalist organisation behind sectarian death squads in
Ulster.
The Department of Public Prosecutions was yesterday given High Court
permission to start proceedings against Channel 4 and Box Productions, an
independent producer, for contempt of court.
The Committee, a programme broadcast last October, alleged that members of
the security forces, loyalist paramilitaries and local businessmen organised
sectarian killings in the province. The programme showed an anonymous
informant in silhouette.
Soon after the programme was broadcast, Channel 4 handed the police an
80-page dossier which including 19 names. Four weeks after transmission
Channel 4 and Box Productions were served with orders under the Prevention
of Terrorism Act requiring them to reveal all their evidence, including
names and addresses.
Channel 4 decided not to comply fully with the orders because of the 'acute
and real risk' to the life of their main informant.
It claimed yesterday that this was the first time the authorities had used
the Prevention of Terrorism Act to try to compel journalists to reveal
sources and name key informants.
The main source agreed to appear on the programme on the strict
understanding that his identity would be protected.
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said yesterday: 'If
journalists investigating terrorist activity cannot protect their sources,
matters of legitimate public concern will become journalistic no-go areas.'
Ms Liz Forgan, director of programmes at Channel 4, said: 'We are not
talking about protecting terrorists. It (the programme) exposed a dangerous
and sinister terrorist organisation and therefore tried to prevent
terrorism.'
Before the broadcast of the programme and since, Channel 4 said, there had
been threats to those involved - the most recent on Tuesday.
The move to commit Channel 4 and Box for contempt is likely to be heard in
the next few weeks.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act gives no protection to information given in
confidence but the court can make an order only if it is satisfied that itis
in the public interest to do so.
Channel 4 will argue that it was in the public interest to present
first-hand evidence of death squads being organised with the collusion of
members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
The company agreed to protect anonymity of individuals 'because their
evidence concerned a matter of the gravest public interest and because their
lives were clearly at risk'.

FT  30 APR 92 / Bangemann hits back at critics
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC INDUSTRY commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann yesterday attacked critics who
claim he is tampering with the working of the free market.
He was speaking at a news conference outlining Commission plans to make the
European car and aircraft industries more competitive.
Mr Bangemann insisted that industrial and competition policy went hand in
hand but criticised competition 'ayatollahs' who assumed that more
competitors always meant more competition.
'Sometimes that is nonsense. You could have very vivid competition between
three competitors and no competition at all between 100,' he told
journalists.
Several of Mr Bangemann's colleagues, including Sir Leon Brittan, the
competition commissioner, and the social and regional funding commissioners,
had sought changes to the Commission's paper on the car industry. In the
event the amendments have been minor.
Mr Bangemann defended his proposals for more on-the-job training of car
workers to reduce the risk of redundancies. Some of his colleagues are
worried such a move would drain existing EC funds - targeted on long-term
unemployment and training of young people - into the coffers of private car
manufacturers.
'Could you please explain why it is that we have to sit around and wait . .
. until a person is (defined as) long-term unemployed and only then are we
able to act?' he asked. 'I think it's completely nonsensical to do that.'
Mr Bangemann refused to comment on Sir Leon's parallel paper on EC car
prices, publication of which has been postponed, but indicated they had
resolved some of their differences over a 'friendly lunch' on Tuesday.
Sir Leon's car price study originally appeared to contradict the Bangemann
paper, especially on the sensitive question of what to do about exclusive
car dealerships in the EC. Sir Leon mainly blames the system, which is
exempt from competition rules until 1995, for the price differences on new
cars across Europe. He wants dealers to prove that the system is efficient.
The car industry paper produced yesterday takes a neutral line on whether
the system should be maintained until the end of the century, while the EC
market is opened to Japanese car imports.
Following minor amendments, the paper says that 'provided it works
satisfactorily and efficiently (the system) would help in the management of
the transitional period'.
Irritated at accusations that the Commission was intervening in areas better
left to companies, Mr Bangemann apologised ironically for trying to fulfil
his role as industry commissioner.

Charming Scotsman Eddie Bell, boss of HarperCollins UK, these days part of

Formerly just a plain old chief executive, Bell has now been elevated to

management board called the Chief Executive Office. (Who could manage
without one?)
Bell is normally credited in the industry with a more material generosity -
having pioneered the inflationary mega-buck advance payment that rival

years.
He explained yesterday that the Chief Executive Office is there to grasp the
opportunities of the 1990s. 'This is the decade of service to authors . .

Ashes to ashes. Cigar-smoking Harry Turner, the characterful chief executive
of Television South West, is moving on.
Always noted for his grand gestures, he was caught out by the grandest: his
bid of over Pounds 16m a year for his franchise. It was a touch too rich for
the Independent Television Commission - a view endorsed by both the High
Court and the House of Lords. TSW is now running down to the handover to
West Country Television on January 1.
'I am a mover and a shaker and there isn't going to be much moving and
shaking at TSW any more,' he says.
After more than 35 years in the media, all but five of them in ITV, it is
time to take a break. 'I'm riding off into the sunset and will probably turn
up as a belly dancer in Libya,' he adds.
Although his pay-off is probably in the Pounds 200,000 bracket, TSW's
greatest tribute is not trying to replace him. He is irreplaceable.

According to them, it has: '. . .a very strong achievement culture; a strong

'At its simplest, this means that it is not an organisation where people

Poor old Boris Yeltsin. As if he hadn't enough trouble with his country

accusing him and his regime of 'stalling, smoke-screens and incompetence'.
Today Spartacists worldwide will be demonstrating over the murder two months
ago of one of their comrades, an American called Martha Phillips, in Moscow
where she was evidently striving to forge a new Leninist-Trotskyist party.
'It used to be that if a Trotskyist died under suspicious circumstances
anywhere within the long reach of J V Stalin, the question of who was
responsible was not really a question,' the organisers mutter darkly.
True, the Spartacists admit that the culprit's identity is no longer as
certain as it would have been under Uncle Joe. 'But it cannot be ruled out,'
they add, that her death was 'a political act.'
Wondering about the evidence, Observer called their London office to put a

from - a line of questioning which apparently awakened the spokesperson's
suspicions.
'I wasn't born yesterday,' she snapped.

FT  30 APR 92 / A financial stitch in Time: The world's largest media group
is restructuring Dollars 7.2bn of debt. Will the strategy work?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since it was formed in a Dollars 14bn merger in 1989, Time Warner, the
world's biggest media group, has been out of favour with Wall Street. This
week, as it launches a Dollars 7.2bn restructuring of the debt taken on in
the takeover, there are signs that investors are starting to warm towards
the company once more.
Many observers of the entertainment industry seem to have been persuaded by
the company that its latest plan - being worked on by Bankers Trust,
Chemical Bank and others - to reschedule most of its Dollars 8.7bn of debt
will ease short-term financial constraints.
Debt has been the name of the game at Time Warner since its formation in a
highly leveraged merger which ranked among the last hurrahs of 1980s
corporate deal-making. Last year Time Warner spent Dollars 966m on debt
servicing alone.
The onerous debt burden has preoccupied top management, eaten up large
chunks of cash flow, hindered the company's ability to make large strategic
acquisitions and plunged it into the red, in spite of healthy operating
profits at its main divisions.
The search for a solution to the debt problem has highlighted the
controversial management style of Steve Ross, the fast-talking chairman who
recently engineered the resignation of Nick Nicholas, his co-chief
executive.
It is a story of four personalities: Ross; his Israeli-born adviser, Ed
Aboodi; Jerry Levin, the new co-chief executive; and Nicholas. Many of the
differences between the two camps concerned how to get the debt down.
Nicholas, for example, favoured the disposal of up to 2m of the group's 7m
US cable television subscribers, which could have raised as much as Dollars
4bn and stabilised the debt picture quickly.
Nicholas wanted to sell off such operations, which he considered less
strategic, in the same way as Rupert Murdoch disposed of assets at News
Corporation or Lou Gerstner at R J R Nabisco. But Ross, as his friends note,
never sells anything. He prefers complex financial mosaics such as the
present debt restructuring being spearheaded by Aboodi, a friend who is part
of the Ross kitchen cabinet.
The heart of the Time Warner debt restructuring plan is a fresh Dollars
6.2bn bank loan that shifts debt off the main balance sheet to a newly
created subsidiary, and stretches out the timetable for repayments of
principal that would otherwise have started to come due next year. There is
also a separate Dollars 1.1bn private placement in the works that will
replace other bank loans.
A closer look at Time Warner's finances suggests that the Ross-Aboodi
approach, while conserving assets, is more costly to the company's
shareholders, who have never seen a share price of Dollars 200, promised at
the time of the merger. The rescheduled debt will probably carry a higher
interest rate.
Nicholas believed that Ross and Aboodi were engaged in financial
pyrotechnics that would neither boost the stock price nor generate enough
cash to reduce the debt rapidly. In February he paid for his disagreement
with Ross when he was forced out.
The elevation of Levin appears to mark the triumph of the highly personal
style of management epitomised by Ross. Colleagues say Levin, who once
headed Time Warner's cable division, is attuned to the entertainment side of
Time Warner and especially to 'Steve's way of thinking'.
The Ross style was most harshly criticised by former Senator Abraham
Ribicoff, an opponent of Ross's who quit the Warner Communications board in
1987 and made a blistering remark cited recently in To the End of Time, a
book about the merger by former Time executive Richard Clurman: 'I have
never in my life been with a board so subservient to the chairman or the
CEO,' said Ribicoff, adding: 'You have a bunch of morons on the board
completely manipulated by Steve Ross, stooges to give Steve Ross anything he
wanted.'
One of the things Ross acquired with the Time Warner merger was a 10-year
Dollars 196m compensation package, including Dollars 78.2m in 1990 and more
than Dollars 70m of stock options in 1991. Substantial chunks of the package
consisted of a one-off payment for his interests in Warner. Ross has been
attacked fiercely by shareholders for the scale of his pay. This has been
especially awkward in the current climate in the US, where shareholders are
scrutinising the pay of some top executives.
Wall Street has generally applauded the replacement of the cost-conscious
Nicholas by the more visionary Levin. Levin's defenders maintain that this
is because he has a broader view of Time Warner's future than Nicholas, who,
since resigning, has been depicted by Levin and Ross's allies as an
unimaginative 'bean counter'.
But a certain amount of bean counting is no bad thing at a behemoth such as
Time Warner, with operating earnings of Dollars 2.26bn in 1991, and
debt-servicing costs that resulted in a loss of Dollars 692m.
Ross has been full of optimistic forecasts for the future of his company,
but with a few exceptions, such as the cable business, few new revenue
streams and profit sources have been created by the supposed synergies
touted at the time of the merger.
In the words of Allan Sloan, the US columnist: 'As far as I can see, the
formation of Time Warner resulted in one giant, high-debt company replacing
two big, low-debt companies that were perfectly able to compete on their
own.'
As presently structured, Time Warner's debt calls for annual repayment of
principal - of Dollars 2.3bn in 1993 and of Dollars 1.4bn each year from
1994 to 1997. Projections by analysts who have studied Time Warner's
accounts indicate that the company will not achieve a net profit - defined
as net after all interest and dividend payments costs are calculated -
before 1994.
The debt rescheduling now under way will stretch out maturities. Even
bullish analysts such as Ms Jessica Reif of Oppenheimer, the New York
investment firm, say the group's 1992 loss after preferred dividend payments
is likely to be Dollars 430m.
These calculations include not only the present Dollars 8.7bn debt, largely
in bank loans, but also Dollars 6.3bn more of preferred stock generated by
the merger. Normally such preferred stock is considered equity rather than
debt, but Ms Reif says that 'nobody thinks of this as equity. It's debt.'
The reason, in part, is that the stock can be converted into debt at Time
Warner's option.
The company's balance sheet may be debt-laden, but each of the five
operating divisions - the Hollywood studio, the music business, the magazine
and book publishing division, the HBO cable programming division and the
company that operates cable television systems for home subscribers - has a
strong underlying cash flow.
The cable systems division is the biggest money spinner, and generated
nearly Dollars 900m of operating income last year, followed by music
(Dollars 560m), films (Dollars 390m), publishing (Dollars 246m) and cable
programming (Dollars 195m).
Unlike Murdoch, who sold off assets, Ross has pursued complex fund-raising
ventures devised by Aboodi, who is not a Time Warner executive but who sits
in company headquarters and plots company strategy.
Aboodi was behind last year's controversial rights issue, which eventually
raised Dollars 2.6bn, but only after a revolt from investors  - alarmed that
their holdings would be seriously diluted if they did not participate -
caused Time Warner to make a change in the offer terms.
The 50-year-old Aboodi was also the man behind a joint venture, soon to be
completed, with Japan's Toshiba and C Itoh, the trading house. The Japanese
companies are putting up Dollars 1bn for 12.5 per cent of a Time Warner
subsidiary that includes the company's movie, cable programming and cable
operations assets and is called Time Warner Entertainment (TWE). The next
step of the joint venture plan is to try to raise another Dollars 1bn or
Dollars 2bn by bringing in a European partner or Chinese-language investor
from Hong Kong, or even a US partner.
Bankers say Aboodi's most urgent priority, which should come to fruition by
June, will be to move Dollars 7bn of Time Warner's Dollars 8.7bn of debt
over to TWE.
The debt rescheduling, assuming it succeeds, will probably be presented as a
victory by Time Warner. Yet moving debt to an 87.5 per cent-owned subsidiary
does not make overall debt servicing costs, of Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m
a year, go away. Stretching out billions of dollars of principal repayments,
however, will at least put off the day of reckoning.
There is another reason why TWE is not a panacea for Time Warner. As part of
its creation of the subsidiary vehicle, TW will spend about Dollars 1bn to
buy up the remaining 18 per cent it does not already own of American
Television and Communications (ATC), a publicly quoted cable operating
subsidiary. ATC will then be placed in TWE.
'The Dollars 1bn comes in from Toshiba and Itoh and it goes out again as new
net debt to pay for the ATC shares,' says one adviser to Ross.
A top Time Warner executive, with knowledge of the company's financial
commitments, puts it this way: 'This company has been jumping through
unbelievably complex hoops, but it hasn't really changed the debt profile.'
Time Warner is very sensitive to outside criticism - from shareholders or
from the media. It has argued that critics focus too narrowly on its debt
burden, which masks the group's real strength in cash flow terms.
In the past, Ross has always managed to confound his critics, rising from
his first job at an undertakers to his present role as one of the US's best
known and best paid executives. Now in poor health, he is determined to
preserve his legacy at Time Warner. With Levin as his heir apparent, a debt
rescheduling under way, and Wall Street warming to his cause, he has gone
some way towards achieving this ambition. History's judgment of his
achievements, however, are likely to rest on whether the next few years
produce a lasting solution to the debt problem and some clear evidence of
the synergies promised from the merger. Unless Time Warner can deliver
these, Wall Street's more favourable view of the company may prove
temporary.

FT  30 APR 92 / Leading Article: The challenge for the Labour party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE WEEKS ago, the Labour party presented itself to the electorate as an
alternative government; today it hardly resembles a viable opposition. The
abrupt resignation of Mr Neil Kinnock has left it effectively leaderless, at
a time when it should be reflecting upon why it has lost four general
elections in a row. Its behaviour over the past week, as factions have
quibbled over the rules for electing a new leader while trade union bosses
have called the tune, has been dispiriting. The temptation is to write it
off completely. This should be resisted.
Democracy cannot function if there is no credible opposition. Yet while it
is not certain that Labour can fulfil that role again, it is the largest
opposition party Britain has. Some believe that that is a good starting
point. The theory is that with 'one more heave' Labour will find itself back
in government. It improved its position in 1987 and again this year,
bringing 69 new MPs into the Commons. A new leader, a little tidying-up of
policy here and there, perhaps some tentative overtures to the Liberal
Democrats and next time the Conservatives will lose.
It is necessary to reflect for only a moment upon the depth of the party's
recent defeat to see that this is wishful thinking. At a time of deep
recession, the Conservatives retained their previous share of the vote,
while Labour was rejected by two-thirds of the voters. The lesson is
unmistakable. Labour must restructure itself, or make way for a party that
is better suited to the needs of the 1990s. The restructuring must be
radical, perhaps more so than Labour can bear to contemplate.
Unions out
If it is to have any chance of winning a future election, it must first
sever all formal connections with the unions. They may contribute to funds,
as the AFL-CIO does for the Democrats in the US, but they should not
participate ex officio in party affairs. This means no bloc vote at the
annual conference, no union presence in Labour's policy-making counsels, and
no union participation in the election of the leader. It is too late to
avoid the latter absurdity in the present contest but if, as expected, Mr
John Smith wins, his first action should be to start the process of
de-unionisation. When it is completed he should re-submit himself for
election.
To achieve that would be revolutionary by the standards of five years ago,
but by the needs of five years hence it might seem a mere beginning, a
clearing of the decks. Labour's fundamental problem, which it faces in
common with other European parties of the left, is that it may serve no
political purpose in a post-socialist age. Its original interest group, the
organised working-class, is a dwindling minority. Its former generators of
ideas, the leading socialist thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries,
have been discredited by events and not replaced.
Tentative embrace
The result is that Labour's embrace of the market is tentative and
uncertain. Its substitution of regulation for state ownership is
disquieting. Its 1960s-style plans for redistributing incomes are
indiscriminate and wasteful. It has failed to dump its Clause Four
commitment to public ownership. Above all, it offers more government when
taxpayers are unwilling to finance much, if any, more than the present
amount.
The Conservatives are moving in the opposite direction. By the time of the
next election, they will have devolved much more administrative power to
unelected school boards, trust hospital managements, housing associations
and other sub-branches of 'Great Britain plc', all to be controlled by means
of careful cost accounting at headquarters in Whitehall. If this great
assemblage of quangos functions well, and gives people what they want, it
will stick.
Yet Labour may usefully offer an alternative approach to the governance of
Britain. The Celtic regions may still want home rule. Local government by
independent elected authorities, may seem worth reviving. A party that thus
espouses democratic reforms, champions the consumer, outflanks the Tories in
its zeal for competition, thinks afresh on the environment, and finds some
room for targeted help to the poor may yet stand a chance. But there is a
great deal of rethinking to do to get from here to there.

FT  30 APR 92 / Arts: Folk to the fore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
John Drummond would once have agreed with Thomas Beecham - 'try everything
once, apart from incest and folk dancing.' Now he has changed his mind, at
least about folk dancing. As director of the European Arts Festival he has
decreed that almost a fifth of his Pounds 6m budget will be devoted to folk
festivals.
This is understandable. Folk music is international and bubbles up from the
community. With only three months to plan the Festival, the brainchild of
John Major and created to celebrate the UK's six month Presidency of the
European Community from July 1, it is naturally strong on relatively
inexpensive grass roots events and short on big and costly galas which take
time to organise.
Drummond, who has just retired as Controller of Radio 3, has spread the
Government's money over 600 events. His aims have been to permeate the whole
country, to include all art forms, and to reflect the artistic life of the
eleven other community members.
In many cases he has given money to events that were gleams in the eye of
the organisers but which needed extra cash to come to full fruition.
Among those coming to the UK are the Theatre du Soleil Ariane Mnouchkine,
presenting The House of Atreus in a former carpet factory in Bradford; the
Piccolo Theatre from Milan and Franco Zeffirelli's company, both coming to
the National Theatre in London with, respectively, La Baruffe Chiozzotte by
Goldoni and Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author; and Greek
Theatre Attis from Athens appearing in Cardiff and Belfast with a modern
version of The Persians.
Dance is enhanced by the Netherlands Dance Theatre paying its first visit
for 17 years, in Bradford, and Pina Bausch returning to the UK, to the
Edinburgh Festival, after a ten year gap, plus Wim Vanderkuybus from
Brussels, at Oxford, Nottingham and Newcastle, and the Bagouet Company from
Montpellier on its first UK visit.
Among the foreign orchestras coming are the Royal Concertgebouw and the
Berlin Radio Orchestra. Many of the grander events considered, like
Pavarotti in Tosca at Covent Garden and the British premiere of
Stockhausen's Sternklang in Birmingham, would have happened anyway, but
Festival money smoothed the way and it has enabled the Royal Opera to put on
a Piazza live relay of Tosca.

FT  30 APR 92 / Management: Sitting down to the opposition - Big seats are
among incentives on offer to win airline passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European and American airlines are lining up to win back long-haul
passengers as the world emerges from recession. Virgin Atlantic Airways'
launch of a 'Mid Class' ticket this week was the latest manoeuvre in an
increasingly bitter marketing war.
This is a critical moment for the industry. Airlines need to attract
customers with low fares and then keep them with high standards of service
and other incentives.
But the airlines are far from agreed over how to do this and have taken
different tacks at different times. Some set store by innovative service.
Virgin provides limousines to take passengers to and from airports, beauty
therapy and massages. Others, like Swissair, prefer to promote a more
traditional image, highlighting the personal attention they give customers.
Even passenger surveys disagree over what customers want. The US National
Institute for Aviation Research at the University of Wichita, Kansas rates
punctuality as the most important attribute. Next comes safety and baggage
handling. Fares are some way behind.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) said this week that the
most important factor for business travellers it had questioned was a big
aircraft seat. Ticket flexibility and fast check-in were next, with
membership of a frequent flyer programme fourth and lack of crowds fifth.
Harold Shenton, an economist at Avmark, the aviation consultancy, warns that
the Kansas research is misleading. He says it is based on interviews with
airlines' own experts combined with records of what passengers most complain
about. The Iata survey, by contrast, resulted from direct questioning of
passengers who had identified their journey purpose as 'business'.
Neither improving punctuality nor fitting bigger seats to aircraft will be
easy. Punctuality is often governed by airport congestion and is out of the
hands of airline managements while bigger seats mean fewer people in an
aircraft and possibly less revenue. The result could be higher fares.
Airlines are already raising published tariffs on the busy north Atlantic
routes, partly in anticipation of rising demand. They are attempting to
boost slow sales now by heavily discounting some tickets. The logic is that
discounts can be abandoned at short notice if business picks up, while
published fares take longer to change.
While passengers are still scarce, airlines have also renewed efforts to
promote what the surveys identify as the most popular incentive: frequent
flyer programmes which lead to free flights or upgrades.
Limousines to the airport and free gifts are playing a smaller part in this
year's promotions.
Virgin's new Mid Class ticket reflects the changing mood, offering wider
seats and special check-in desks. Virgin previously had economy class and
'upper' - where prices were roughly comparable with business class on other
airlines. Now, anyone who pays for a non-discounted economy ticket will
travel Mid Class.
Virgin has much to gain. The rush to discount tickets, especially on the
viciously competitive transatlantic market, has left Virgin with fewer than
4 per cent of its economy passengers paying the full fare. With Mid Class,
it hopes to raise this to more than 10 per cent.
Although Virgin's extra layer of economy class is, perhaps, unique, the
strategy is straight out of the long-haul travel management textbook: cut
prices for leisure travellers and improve service for business passengers.
Others are doing the same thing. Canadian Airlines International is offering
business class seats to passengers who pay full economy class fares. The
strategy is risky. Instant upgrades and giving away free flights through
frequent flyer programmes may cut revenues in an already tough environment.
But airlines are prepared to do this because they believe recovery is on the
horizon. After nearly two years of recession, the business is lean and fit
and demand could catch up with supply. If it does, airlines will be quick to
turn away from the heavy promotion of bigger seats and free flights.

FT  30 APR 92 / Management: Death as a salesman - A macabre approach to
promoting products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past few months, the advertising world has lifted the veil from the
last taboo of the late 20th century and started exploring the use of death,
or at least mortality, as a messenger.
The most dramatic images of death come from Benetton, the clothing retailer
already known for its willingness to upset accepted mores. In its latest
advertising campaign, the company uses a series of photographs of disasters
 -ranging from an exploding car to an Aids patient on his death bed - with
only the Benetton logo to identify the company and its product.
Athletic shoe makers have seized on a lighter approach, but there no
escaping their carpe diem messages. 'I believe Life is short. Play Hard,'
extols the Reebok ad. 'Someday, since you are human, you will notice that
time has passed and you are not who you were 20 years ago or 10 years ago or
even last week,' is the message from Nike. "Your life was programmed at the
factory for continuous play. With proper care and maintenance your life will
provide a lifetime of enjoyment,' LA Gear proclaims.
Using dead stars to sell products is also increasingly popular. Diet Coke's
latest offering employs the services of Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and
Louis Armstrong, with Elton John representing the living.
Perhaps the most macabre of all are the endorsements from the grave. Michael
Landon, a popular American television actor whose well-publicised death from
cancer dominated the tabloids and People magazine last year, can be seen on
TV stations across the nation promoting educational study aids. 'Because of
Michael Landon's belief in this programme, he authorised the producers to
continue its broadcast after his death,' is the introduction to the
television spot for 'Where there's a will, there's an A'
Michael Landon's desire posthumously to promote a product, which has no
relevance to the actor's life or death, is a long way from the first sombre
use of a dead celebrity, when Yul Brynner spoke out against smoking for the
American Cancer Society in 1986, in an ad made to be shown after his death.
'I really wanted to make a commercial when I discovered that I was that
sick, and my time was so limited I thought I would make a commercial that
says simply: 'Now that I'm gone, I tell you, don't smoke - whatever you do,
just don't smoke'.'
No one is quite sure why death has come out of the advertising closet, or
how prevalent the theme will become. At Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the person in
charge of monitoring trends recently started a file on death. 'There's a
death theme that she's seeing more and more, and she doesn't know what to
make of it,' said Shelly Lazarus, who worked on the LA Gear account.
Some believe that western society will become increasingly concerned with
ageing and death as the so-called baby boomers age and die. Others believe
that Aids has thrust death into the limelight.
It is only recently that we've become squeamish about death. In his book,
'Western attitudes toward Death,' French social historian Phillipe Aries
says 'the more society was liberated from the Victorian constraints
concerning sex, the more it rejected things having to do with death . . .
The interdict on death suddenly follows upon the heels of a very long period
 -several centuries - in which death was a public spectacle from which no
one would have thought of hiding and which was even sought after at times.'
Benetton, which has been charged with exploiting serious issues to sell
sweaters, maintains that its provocative ads force people to think and
discuss important issues, and that its target customers - 18 to 34-year-old
women - 'are more socially active and aware than any generation that
precedes them. Various studies have shown that in 1992, consumers are as
concerned by what a company stands for as they are about the price-value
relationship of that company's products.'
Larry Kopald, executive vice president of Foote Cone and Belding, a
marketing consultancy, says: 'There has been a tremendous reaction to the
Benetton ads. Many people think it is a gross misuse of a real life tragedy,
that is being used for shock value. I think that advertising is always
trying to find new ways to make a message relevant, and this is a new way
for some people to do it. I hope it isn't a trend.'
Bill Katz, executive vice president at BBDO, the advertising agency, has not
noticed an increased obsession with death but believes there is a trend away
from 'fluff and peripheral imagery and towards more substance and reality.
It gets back to the pundits and soothsayers of our industry who try to plot
and charter the future and believe the 1990s, with recession hitting, are
about reality.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Technology: Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The software industry has only recently moved towards the formalisation of
testing and, more importantly, the automation of test procedures. Standard
Chartered Bank has recognised that thorough testing is essential in any
financial institution. The cost of errors can be astronomical.
The bank's approach is heartening to the professional developer. It has
recognised that testing is a valuable asset. The past performance of a
program is a useful yardstick to compare with the current behaviour.
It has also made a clear decision to 'stick with the knitting'. Since
Standard Chartered is not a software house it wisely devolves the risks and
costs of software development to the vendors. In doing so, it gives up some
level of customisation and tailoring. On the other hand, it is free to
change suppliers if service is not acceptable.
Phil Reed, IT manager, concentrates on ensuring that the packages fit the
business. Interestingly, he states categorically that operational methods
must be changed to fit the software. I would only agree up to a point. Much
software is poorly designed - especially on mainframe systems. It is often
written by programmers who have no understanding of the business. To let
them dictate the day-to-day running of a multi-million pound business seems
a little risky.
The bundling of IT with strategic planning and personnel is unusual.
Hopefully it reflects that recognition of the links rather than a rag-bag of
jobs that no one else on the board wanted. Reed has wisely avoided the snare
of all-in-one systems and has looked at the best way of achieving the goals
by integrating multiple packages.

FT  30 APR 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Keeping the cash flowing -
Claire Gooding continues a series on getting the most out of software by
tackling the thorny subject of maintenance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British banking is behind the times. Despite the millions spent on
technology it still takes three days to clear a cheque. Automated Teller
Machines (ATMs) are often not working or out of step with a customer's
banking details.
This is partly due to the constraints imposed by the software which runs
large banking systems. These represent a big investment but, once
implemented, become a liability as much as an asset. A simple amendment to
the software can cause chaos out of all proportion to the scale of the
change.
In the banking industry, maintenance raises questions of scale, and not just
because so many systems run on multiple mainframe computers serving
thousands of ATMs. There are personnel and staffing issues, and
multi-country operations to be considered.
Custom-built or bespoke systems pose the thorniest problems because
knowledge of them tends to be esoteric, and confined to the original
developers. It is for this reason that the Standard Chartered Bank has taken
a long-term view of the maintenance issue when implementing new systems.
'The main foundation of our policy is that we do not develop programs, we
buy packages in,' explains Phil Reed, group IT manager. The bank also
believes in developing in one central site, and then shipping out to others.
The policy is the result of a large technology review carried out by the
bank between 1986-87. The issue of multi-country operations loomed large, as
the systems in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and the UK varied widely. The
businesses were of different sizes and all supported home-grown systems and
maintenance teams. In Hong Kong, a Unisys system ran the retail side and an
NCR system was used for corporate systems.
A review by Andersen Consulting focused on economies of scale. 'The issue we
faced was not just cost, but whether we could do it with the resources
available,' explains Reed. Standard Chartered's strong presence in the Far
East also brought home the high expectations of customers there.
'As a customer, I regularly use banks in the Far East and the US, and I can
be in and out in a couple of minutes having done everything I want,' says
Reed. 'For the last two years, anyone in the Far East has been able to pay
in money at the counter and check the correct balance on the ATM outside
within 10 seconds.'
This gave the bank a strong incentive to introduce improved business
benefits at the same time as streamlining its technology on a worldwide
basis. 'The level of service we offered as a retail bank in the mid 1980s in
the Far East was restricted: very similar to that offered in the UK now.'
The main aim was improved functionality, and 'real time banking' was chosen
as the best route forward. The implications of this were 24-hour banking and
a high degree of on-line resilience; far higher than that needed by batch
systems.
There were three main components in the plan: retail, treasury, trade
finance and business (including corporate) systems. Standard Chartered
decided on the package route for all. 'The attempt to create new banking
systems from scratch has proved time and again to be too difficult,' says
Reed.
He sees two big issues in the decision characterised as 'the maintenance
issue' and 'the big picture'. The trouble with all-singing, all-dancing
systems, he observes, is that one person cannot keep the whole picture in
their brain.
To this he attributes the downfall of several large-scale banking schemes
that have been shelved several years, and several millions of pounds, down
the development line. 'The project manager and the MIS manager cannot have
the whole view. Both have large teams which, although they might be termed
development teams, are maintenance teams as well.'
The solution to both these problems was to buy packages, sticking closely to
those perceived as 'standards' in the IBM world. 'There had to be a common
technical structure, however much people claim to be different,' says Reed.
This fitted the bank's policy of delivering functions from one country to
another. 'The issues facing us when implementing packages are very different
from bespoke software. The question is: do I modify my working environment
to fit the software, or do I modify my package to suit my working
environment?
'The answer is yes to the first - any other route throws away the benefit of
using packages.' It was a board decision that the packages should be
'modified to a limit'. Senior management is closely involved in the IT
process, and recognises IT as a 'people issue'.
'IT and personnel report to one executive director because IT affects all
employees and the way they operate. It's a personnel and union issue. We
haven't got it right yet, but we do have a product management methodology.'
This consists of managing the 'product' from the cradle to the grave, the
product meaning Reed's 'big picture' of software product, benefits, culture
and lifestyle. As with many successful projects, the first step is to get
the most senior person in the business to sell it down the line.
The maintenance issue is woven into this philosophy. 'Maintenance and
development are intertwined. Everything has to be tested and tested well.'
But, he points out, user-testing is too expensive on a manual basis,
involving users and programmers working day and night, larger machines to
run test systems alongside live ones, and so on.
Reed's team came up with the concept of having various tools and products
for maintenance. 'If you glue them together with a methodology, you have a
much-enhanced set of benefits so that you can use it over and over.' The
package approach ruled once again, and the bank turned to products from
Dunstable-base Compuware.
Compuware's Playback and File-AID packages have formed the basis of a
re-useable system for the testing phase - generally the Cinderella of the
software development cycle. The pressure to deliver new systems often means
that developers fail to test every possible path, and therefore miss the
repercussions of 'minor' changes.
Ian Weavers, manager of development environments for group IT, heads a small
team in charge of testing. He believes few developers bother to treat their
test data as a re-useable asset. 'Completed test data were often discarded
after use. This is a tremendous waste - as crazy as throwing source code
away.'
Testing is estimated to take up 40 per cent of the total development cost: a
figure that stays constant in later releases, even where development costs
lessen. Here the Repeatable Test System proved its worth.
The International Banking Application, from banking software specialist
Hogan, was tested and implemented in Hong Kong initially. The two-year cycle
was cut down to six months when the process was repeated in Singapore, and
an even shorter cycle in Malaysia. The bank plans to use the system with
IMMS and Imex from Surecomp.
Reed recognises his re-usable test harness as an asset, which saves the
valuable time of programmers, users, and technical staff who would otherwise
be involved.
On average, the combination of RTS and Playback has brought down the amount
of user-acceptance testing down from 28 per cent to 2.3 per cent of total
effort. Actual costs of testing dropped from Pounds 431,250 to Pounds
53,000.
'In a world where 53 per cent of defects are caused by changes, we have
raised the quality of the software and reduced the time it takes to deliver
working systems to users,' concludes Reed.
BUZZWORDS
REAL-TIME OPERATIONS demand speed and reliability because they are
instantaneous. Often the computer code also triggers off a 'real' or
mechanical event, such as the control of an ATM.
BATCH SYSTEMS process high volumes of transactions, usually overnight, and
are the basis of most older mainframe systems.
ON-LINE SYSTEMS provide 'interactive' access to information, though the data
may not be up to date if it fed by batch rather than real-time systems.
Company Snapshot
Standard Chartered Bank, founded in 1853, operates from 700 offices
worldwide. The group's main strength is in the Pacific Rim, Africa, the
Middle East and south-east Asia. It was formed from a merger of the Standard
Bank and the Chartered Bank in 1969. Its Shanghai branch, opened in 1858,
makes it the oldest foreign bank in China. Operations in Singapore and Hong
Kong were opened the following year.
Nature of business: International banking, with operations in 50 countries.
Turnover/profit: In 1991 the bank showed a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 205m. Trading profits in the Far East rose a fifth to
Pounds 184m.
Employees: 30,000 worldwide, of whom 1,200 work in information technology.
IT expenditure is about Pounds 100m annually.
Technology File
Software: Core packages include Imex, a financial trading package, and IMMS,
a back office support system, both from Surecomp. Also Hogan's International
Banking Application, IBA.
Hardware: Five IBM-compatible mainframes running IBM's MVS/CICS operating
environment are located in Malaysia, Hong Kong (IBM), Singapore and Wales
(Hitachi Data Systems). The bank also runs more than 100 mid-range IBM
computers (AS/400s, System 36 and 38s) and systems from ICL, NCR and Unisys.
Standard Chartered's policy is to remove its mid-range computers entirely
and transfer applications to Novell PC local area networks, or to the large
mainframe-based data centres.
Maintenance and testing: The Repeatable Test System has been developed on
the back of two software testing products, Playback and File-AID.
Suppliers: Compuware, a privately owned US software house based in Michigan,
with UK headquarters in Dunstable, specialises in automated software testing
tools.
Value of contract: Initial licensing costs at the time of installation
(1988) were around Pounds 150,000. Product maintenance fees are typically 16
per cent of contract value.

FT  30 APR 92 / Bitter-sweet win awaits Labour: The battle for control of a
city council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE and local government are hardly bedfellows, but things are
changing. Gloucester City Council has moved, mayor and all, from the ancient
Guildhall to an industrial warehouse on the edge of its now-defunct docks.
The council paid Pounds 1 for its new home; it let the Guildhall for Pounds
3m - and in the process helped make the dockland a business and tourist
magnet.
Gloucester's docks symbolise Labour's trauma in middle England. They closed
a few years after the defeat of the city's last Labour MP in 1970, and the
city has had a Tory MP ever since.
Yet Labour is the largest party on the city council - on which no party has
overall control - and in next week's local elections looks set to make the
single gain needed to take overall control. For Mr Kevin Stephens, leader of
the Labour group on the council, it will be a bitter-sweet triumph: as the
party's general election candidate, he was more than 6,000 votes behind the
Tory.
Why do the Tories enjoy national success but local failure? 'It's national
factors: poll tax, cuts and the like,' says Mr Michael Pullon, Gloucester's
Tory leader. 'Every year's local elections offer a chance to protest.' The
Tory collapse has been steep and rapid: they ran the council until 1989, and
in 10 years have dropped from 23 to 10 councillors (out of a total of 33).
The election is taking a now-typical course: Labour almost unchallenged on
the council estates of Matson, Tuffley and Coney Hill; the Tories competing
with them in more 'mixed' areas; and a separate Tory-Liberal Democrat
contest in the leafy groves of Kingsholme and Hucclecote. The Liberal
Democrats' seven seats were all gained from the Tories. 'It's a secure but
narrow base', says Mrs Mary Gould, the Liberal Democrat group's leader.
The political battle on the council has an unreal quality. There are
divisions aplenty, and real bitterness two years ago over plans by the
outgoing Tory administration to hand the council's entire housing stock  -
6,200 tenants - to a housing association.
Yet reacting to government policy - and working within its constraints  - is
the main preoccupation of all three parties. All supported a poll tax
(Pounds 309) at the government capping level - arguing mainly about how much
should go to voluntary organisations.
All are relieved that the city's manual-labour contracts were won by its own
workforce.
Furthermore, all are ardent supporters of the 'historic cities group',
campaigning for the restoration of unitary county boroughs in cathedral
cities. 'We have little in common with the rural parts of the county - 10
per cent of our population are from ethnic minorities, for a start,' says Mr
Stephens. Were the group to succeed and education pass from the county to
the city council, battles over Gloucester's four grammar schools might
ensue. But with two opted-out and the others likely to follow, even there
scope for intervention is contracting.
Housing policy highlights the tensions graphically. For all the opprobium he
attracted for his housing association plan, Mr Pullon is critical of
government-imposed restraints, particularly the refusal to allow local
authorities to use capital receipts for social housing.
On having sunk Mr Pullon's housing association venture, Labour and the
Liberal Democrats are now launching one of their own. The city council is
proposing to grant land and development rights to Oxbode, a new association
of whose 15 directors three will be from the council. If it secures
registration, the association will use council land and funds from the
Housing Corporation and private lenders to build social housing.
Mrs Gould is candid: 'Oxbode was really seen an escape route for us if the
Tories won - and we need it now if there is to be any new low-rent housing
at all.'
It is a similar picture with council services. 'Quality, accountability and
efficiency are our watchwords', says Mr Stephens. If Labour takes over, he
plans customer contracts, an autonomous ombudsman to deal with complaints,
and proper redress for failures. On compulsory tendering, his fear is that
white-collar employees are not showing 'as great a realisation as the
blue-collar unions of the impact - and the need to respond'.
The three leaders unite on another theme: the growing difficulty in finding
people willing to stand for election, and the need for salaried councillors.
'We've got a Pounds 34m annual turnover: you've got to pay the going rate to
get good managers,' says Mr Pullon.
CONSERVATIVE councils will force pupils to 'pay as they learn', the Labour
party said yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, campaigning for next week's
local government elections, said free state education was under threat and
parents would have to pay more and more for their children's schooling
because of government spending limits.
The elections would be about 'higher standards in schools, better value for
money and a rejection of the Tories' policy of 'pay as you learn',' he said.
He said one Kent school, which he refused to name, was already charging
pupils Pounds 12 each to buy essential books. A report last year found

Mr Straw said other Conservative local education authorities were being

FT  30 APR 92 / Amazons sail to rescue of boatyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nancy Blackett, a 28-foot cutter once owned by the writer Arthur
Ransome, has come to the aid of an ailing family-run boatyard business.
The cutter was named after Ransome's heroine in his most famous book, the
children's adventure story Swallows and Amazons. Nancy was the captain of
the Amazon, 'a fine little ship, with varnished pine planking'.
In recent years, the Nancy Blackett has been less than fine, languishing in
Scarborough harbour, sunk and a danger to shipping. Now, with advice from
the Rural Development Commission, the cutter has been partly refitted and
made ready for commercial use by Harbour Marine Services, a small boatyard
in Southwold, Suffolk.
Just over a year ago, Mr John Buckley, the owner of the business, was
suffering through a combination of spiralling interest rates, customer debts
and cashflow difficulties. He approached the commission, the government
agency that promotes the economic and social wellbeing of rural communities.
He said: 'It's amazing what you spend without realising it. The commission
sent an adviser along who told us how to keep a tighter control on things,
how to talk to the bank manager, and talk back to him.'
Advice has included taking on the contract to complete the refitting of the
Nancy Blackett. The contract is worth only Pounds 3,500 a year in
maintenance - some 10 per cent of the boatyard's annual turnover - but is
expected to bring in many additional local and inter-national customers
because of the popularity of the boat.

FT  30 APR 92 / BA told to cut some flights in regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Civil Aviation Authority yesterday ruled against British Airways at a
preliminary hearing over charges of anti-competitive practices.
In an unprecedented decision, it instructed BA to halve the number of
flights it operates between Edinburgh and Manchester from four daily to two.
That would allow a rival, Loganair, owned by British Midland Airways, to
make a profit on the route.
BA said it was 'surprised and disappointed' at the decision, and would
appeal to Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary.
It will maintain four flights a day pending his decision, which is expected
before the CAA's public appeal scheduled for June 18 and 19.
If upheld, the ruling would open the way for similar complaints such as that
by Virgin Atlantic Airways against BA. The two are engaged in libel actions
over allegations that BA had engaged in anti-competitive behaviour against
Virgin.
Virgin said yesterday that it would wait until after the court cases were
settled before considering going to the CAA.
Loganair had complained that it would lose money on the route unless BA's
flights were restricted.
BA increased its daily frequency on the route from one flight a day to four
in October 1991. Until then, Loganair operated four flights daily on the
route to BA's one.
The CAA found that both would lose money but that Loganair would suffer
more.

FT  30 APR 92 / BR threatens to shelve rolling stock renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail is threatening to postpone orders for new rolling stock for
five years as part of a campaign to win extra government funding for railway
investment.
Also likely to be shelved until 1997 unless there is more funding is the
Pounds 4.5bn Channel tunnel rail link and the Pounds 1bn development of
London's second Channel tunnel rail terminal at King's Cross. That would
mean that it will be well into the next century before the high-speed link
is completed.
With the recession depressing BR's revenue and income from property sales,
Sir Bob Reid, chairman of BR, has told Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, that the company has only enough money to cover safety and
maintenance programmes.
While the government increased BR's borrowing limit for the current year by
almost Pounds 1bn in the last Autumn Statement, the amount available for
investment will tail off in the following years.
In what will be seen as an early bid for an increase in funds in the autumn
public-expenditure white paper, BR is warning that without additional
borrowing there will be no new orders of rolling stock in the next five
years.
Orders for 1,500 new Networker coaches for Network SouthEast's Kent coast
services - costing Pounds 700m - would be postponed. The introduction of the
new generation of InterCity 250 trains on the line linking London,
Manchester and Glasgow would be shelved to save Pounds 350m.
Much-needed improvements in track and signalling on the line would go ahead,
but line straightening to increase maximum speeds above the present 125mph
would be postponed.
BR estimates that it needs an extra Pounds 7bn to fund the four key
projects.

FT  30 APR 92 / Rise in construction orders played down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CONSTRUCTION orders rose sharply during the three months to the end of
February, according to figures published yesterday by the Environment
Department. Construction industry leaders were swift to deny that this
indicated that a recovery may have begun.
The department said public and private orders placed with contractors rose
by 2 per cent compared with the previous quarter and by 12 per cent compared
with the corresponding period a year earlier.
The Building Employers Confederation, representing 7,000 companies with a
combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, said: 'The increase in
new orders is due almost entirely to an exceptional rise in public,
non-residential orders in February - which could be due to just one very
large contract.
'We see no sign of recovery at this stage and are forecasting a further
sharp fall in construction output this year.'
According to the department, the value of public non-residential orders, at
constant 1985 prices, was 6 per cent higher than in the previous three
months and 45 per cent higher than in December, January and February 12
months ago.
Public housing orders, including orders placed by housing associations, were
51 per cent and 80 per cent higher respectively.
Private commercial orders and private housing orders remained sharply lower
than during the corresponding period a year earlier.
REDLAND, a building materials group, announced the closure of six brickworks
and the loss of some 260 jobs in its first rationalisation move since it
took over Steetley earlier this year.
Three former Steetley and three Redland British plants will cease production
later this year. Five works mothballed by Redland in 1989 will be closed
permanently.

FT  30 APR 92 / 'Improved image' for estate agents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION and tighter regulations governing estate agents are combining
to improve the image of the profession, Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general
of fair trading, said yesterday.
Complaints were still being made, but the image of estate agents had
improved, he told the annual conference of the National Association of
Estate Agents in London.
'A short time ago, the image of estate agents could hardly have been worse,'
he said.
'Any stand-up comedian searching for an easy laugh could . . . (conjure) up
a picture of a wide boy with a cellular phone making a fortune out of other
peoples' homes with very little effort.'
The Office of Fair Trading had banned about 155 estate agents from the
property business in the past 10 years, and recently the rate of expulsions
had increased.
There was also a rise in complaints about estate agents.

FT  30 APR 92 / Oftel is urged to order BT price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT, THE telecommunications group, should be required to make a one-off cut
in its prices because it is earning 'excess' profits, consumer organisations
said yesterday.
The National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association, the UK's two
leading consumer groups, argued that consumers should receive a cut in phone
bills as part of price controls being negotiated by BT and Oftel, the
industry watchdog. That would be in addition to annual price cuts, which are
expected to be a part of the deal.
The council said BT's profits were high enough to allow a 6 per cent
across-the-board price cut or a 20 per cent reduction in rental and
connection charges.
Both organisations said in evidence to Oftel that BT's profits - Pounds
3.1bn in the 1990-91 financial year - were not solely the result of
efficiency. They also resulted from higher-than-expected levels of inflation
in the past few years.
Oftel refused to comment on the submissions by the consumer groups. In the
past, though, it has been reluctant to contemplate one-off cuts in BT's
prices, preferring gradual annual adjustments.
BT said its price formula, which requires it to cut the price of a basket of
its main services by 6.25 per cent less than inflation each year, was the
toughest for any UK utility. 'Making a profit is not a mortal sin,' it said.
The council also argued that residential users had lost out badly as a
result of competition between BT and Mercury.
BT is trebling the staff at its software development centre in Glasgow with
a Pounds 5.5m investment which will create 200 jobs for software engineers,
James Buxton writes.
The centre was set up in 1988 to develop software to support BT's service
and network management systems.
BT's new investment in the centre has received a large grant from the
Scottish Office and the project is assisted by the Glasgow Development
Agency, part of Scottish Enterprise, the development body.

FT  30 APR 92 / MPs see scope for cut in fighter order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK could reduce its purchases of the planned European Fighter Aircraft
(EFA) from the present target of 250 in order to limit the cost of the
programme, the Commons defence committee suggested yesterday.
Its report, which also raised the issue of whether the Royal Air Force still
needed such a high-performance aircraft, is likely to add to the uncertainty
surrounding the project.
The four-nation fighter is expected to figure prominently in talks in Bonn
today between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and Mr Volker Ruhe, his
German counterpart. The meeting will take place amid continuing widespread
opposition to the fighter in Germany.
The next few months will be crucial for its future as the partner nations -
Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain - prepare to move from development to the
investment needed for production.
Total costs for the UK on current plans are put at Pounds 20bn for the whole
life of the aircraft.
The RAF said yesterday it still had 'firm plans' for 250 aircraft, the level
set for the UK when development began in 1988. It wants to use the aircraft
not only to replace its Phantoms and Jaguars, as originally planned, but
also as an eventual substitute for the long-range air-defence version of the
Tornado.
However, studies are still going on at the MoD on the size of the purchase.
Officials said final numbers would become clearer towards the end of the
year. Germany, Italy and Spain are all expected to reduce their purchases.
If the UK cut its requirement to 200, the total might fall to fewer than 600
compared with the planned 765.
That would, however, be more than the total of 400 to 450 seen by the MoD as
a minimum for economic production.
The committee said that when the government decided about the project, it
should take into account the aircraft's importance for UK high-technology
industries.
'It remains open to question how far the RAF still requires an aircraft with
the full level of performance offered by EFA,' the MPs said. But they added
that there was no alternative to EFA that offered the same level of
performance at an acceptable cost with anything approaching comparable
technological benefits.
While no defence programme costing Pounds 20bn could be described as cheap,
EFA should be 'substantially more economic' than its competitors, the MPs
commented.
German withdrawal would be 'a grave setback', although the project could
survive, they added.

FT  30 APR 92 / Ulster leaders begin fresh round of talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN IRELAND's political leaders began talks yesterday in a fresh
attempt to test whether decades of distrust in the province can yet be
overcome.
The resumption of negotiations at Stormont, outside Belfast, marked a
reaffirmation of UK ministers' belief - or perhaps hope - that by juggling
conflicting aspirations of nationalist and unionist leaders, and of the UK
and Irish governments, a political solution can be found.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, acknowledged the scale of
his task in a written statement - his sole public comment - talking of the
province's political impasse being resolved 'step by step'.
In fact the agenda, as in the original set of talks under former Northern
Ireland secretary Mr Peter Brooke last summer, is far grander - exploring
the 'totality of relationships' including those between the republic and
Northern Ireland and those between London and Dublin. Yet no participant
pretends it is a 'peace conference' to secure an early to end terrorist
violence. Another Roman Catholic was shot dead in north Belfast yesterday by
loyalist paramilitaries.
The timetable is tight. Three months have been set aside before the next
Anglo-Irish conference, which is the cut-off point because of the hostility
of Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader and the Rev Ian Paisley,
leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to talking while the conferences
take place.
Talks - also involving Mr John Hume's nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party and the cross-community Alliance party - are planned for only
two or three days a week.
Most critically, 'strand two' of the talks - when discussion turns from a
devolved government to relations between Northern Ireland and the republic -
is due to begin 'within weeks'. It is the point at which the Irish
government enters negotiations and a test of Unionists' willingness to talk
to Dublin.
It could be the breaking point.
The rift may not be irreconcilable but inter-government rows do not help
keep suspecting local political leaders at the negotiating table.
Nevertheless there is renewed optimism. Already the talks have almost
exceeded the achievements of last year, when seven weeks of wrangling
delayed the start of plenary sessions. The tensions and insecurities of
politicians unused to negotiations have been lessened by familiarity.
Sir Patrick will make less of a feature than his predecessor of diplomatic
niceties. A business committee has been set up to stop plenary sessions
stumbling amid procedural rows.

If Britain complied with the European Community's proposed working time
directive it would add less than one per cent to the nation's wage bill,
according to the Low Pay Unit, Ivor Owen writes.
In a briefing issued to members of the European parliament, ahead of today's
meeting of EC social affairs ministers, the pressure group strongly disputes
the claim made by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the directive
'would hurt British industry and destroy jobs'.
The unit says Britain has fewer public holidays than most EC member states -
only Denmark and the Netherlands have less - and that most provide a
statutory entitlement to four weeks holiday.

FT  30 APR 92 / Social Europe: Brussels may force clock watchers into a
re-think - The implications for British companies and their workers of the
EC directive on working time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 2m British workers who work more than 48 hours each week, and the
thousands of companies they work for, may have to re-think radically if
European Community employment ministers today reach outline agreement on the
EC working time directive.
If agreement is not reached today it will come at the ministers' meeting in
June and, although the government is likely to oppose it, the directive may
become part of UK law within months.
The 'opt-out' from the next stage of EC employment legislation won by the
government at the Maastricht summit was too late to fend off the directive.
Because it has been introduced under health and safety legislation, it
requires only a qualified majority - at least one other big EC country plus
a small one, or three smaller countries, must side with the UK to block it.
British officials believe there is a new willingness to do a deal with the
UK, especially with Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary in
the chair, and that a high degree of flexibility in implementing the
directive might be allowed at national level.
The UK's preferred option is to allow work over 48 hours provided people
have passed a health risk assessment.
If the UK government is not satisfied with the outcome, it will probably
launch a legal challenge to the health and safety basis of the directive.
Alternatively, it may simply refuse to implement the directive and wait for
the EC Commission to take it to the European Court of Justice.
Either way, there is no certainty that the UK would win.
The directive includes:
A ceiling on the working week of 48 hours including overtime, averaged
within a reference period, likely to be set at four months.
A minimum daily rest period of 11 hours, with Sunday 'in principle' treated
as a day of rest. That principle can be broken with impunity but is still
unpopular with the UK government because of the support it gives to the
anti-Sunday trading lobby.
Minimum annual paid holiday of four weeks - three weeks for the first three
years of the directive.
Some groups of workers, including managers, the self-employed and transport
workers, are exempt from the directive and there are 'derogations' for other
groups that allow particular measures such as the 48-hour week to be
breached but insist on 'compensatory rest'.
The proposals - particularly the 48-hour limit - would seem a classic case
of the EC's legislative norms being imposed upon the UK's more flexible
system of industrial relations.
Almost all other EC countries, apart from the Irish Republic and Denmark,
have had detailed legislation in those areas for decades.
Partly as a result, there is a much stronger convergence of working time in
other EC countries and far fewer people working more than 48 hours.
The EC's average working week is close to 40 hours, but 36 per cent of
workers in the UK work between 35 and 40 hours a week, compared with 72 per
cent in the rest of the community.
The UK has a much higher incidence of part-time work and of long hours - for
full-time workers, the UK has the longest average working week in the EC at
45.5 hours. British workers also do more overtime and more shift-work than
those elsewhere in the EC.
A total of 2.7m British employees - 11.7 per cent of the workforce -
regularly work more than 48 hours per week, far more than elsewhere else in
the EC.
There is a high concentration among particular groups of workers - rail
workers, farm workers, crane drivers, food industry workers - mainly as a
result of high overtime. But Department of Employment economists say there
is a sprinkling of over-48-hour working in almost all industries.
The cost to British industry of maintaining output while complying with the
directive is impossible to calculate. The government's estimate of Pounds
5bn - of which Pounds 3.5bn comes from the 48-hour limit - is very rough.
Some managers say it is good management to cut chronic overtime. Some
companies, such as ICI, are not enthusiastic, but say they live with such
restrictions on the Continent. With a little reorganisation they could do so
here.
Nevertheless, the bulk of UK companies strongly oppose the directive and
fear higher costs unless productivity can be correspondingly raised.
Much will depend on how quickly it has to be introduced and how adaptable
employees can be.

Mr Phil Gray, RCN director of labour relations, told reporters at the annual

The Department of Health believes trusts should use national rates as a

local level.

FT  30 APR 92 / Minister gives reasons for City regulation move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANTHONY NELSON, economic secretary to the Treasury, has explained
publicly for the first time the government's reasons for a planned upheaval
in the regulation of financial markets.
He also restated the government's intention to oppose proposed EC
legislation that might threaten the UK's securities industry.
Mr Nelson said responsibility for regulation of financial markets and
non-bank financial services would not be shifted from the Department of
Trade and Industry to the Treasury for a 'month or so'.
It is understood that legal difficulties have delayed the move, which was
announced in the Conservative manifesto.
Mr Nelson said the switch reflected developments in financial markets. 'The
barriers between the different industries are crumbling,' he said, and it
made sense to bring together regulation of both the bank and non-bank
sector. It would give more weight to the UK financial sector's views
internationally.
Mr Nelson said: 'If UK interests are to be represented and expressed as
effectively as possible, they should be concentrated in one department and
one set of ministers.' The dividing line on big fraud cases between City
regulators and criminal investigators should be reconsidered, Mr Christopher
Sharples, chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority, said. 'There may
well be advantages in allowing City regulation, with its ability to act
quickly and get results on a much less legalistic basis, to deal with some
of the alleged offences at the outset.' He added that that might apply
particularly 'when they are of a nature more akin to breaches of City codes
or ethics or market misconduct, rather than fraud or theft in the
traditional sense.'

FT  30 APR 92 / How turning away old customers can attract new business:
Co-operative Bank launches its new 12-point ethical policy today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNING AWAY customers may seem an unusual way to gain business, but for the
Co- operative Bank it is an inevitable part of the ethical policy it
launches today.
The bank's 12-point code reflects its attitudes towards a number of business
activities. The bank says it will not support, invest in or supply financial
services to regimes, organisations and individuals involved in:
The oppression of the human spirit, taking away the rights of individuals or
manufacturing torture instruments.
Providing weapons to countries with oppressive regimes.
Cosmetics testing on animals.
Exploitative factory-farming methods.
Blood sports.
Production of animal fur.
Tobacco manufacturing.
In addition, it says it will try to ensure that its services are not
exploited for the purposes of money laundering, drug trafficking or tax
evasion, and that it will encourage business customers to take an active
stance on the environmental impact of their own activities.
Such an aggressive position has its drawbacks. The bank has identified six
existing customers which appear incompatible with these objectives,
including five organisations involved in blood sports. All are likely to be
asked to remove their business within the next three months.
A sixth is a farm that derives a small proportion of its income from battery
farming. The bank is already in discussions with the business, and hopes to
persuade it to change its practices and remain a customer.
The negative effects are likely to be minimal, however. The total value of
these six accounts is about Pounds 100,000. Mr Terry Thomas, managing
director, estimates that at worst it will lose one account for every 10 it
gains.
He says that since news of the ethical policy leaked last week, the bank has
received 'hundreds' of calls and letters, only one of which was not
supportive. One customer in the opened an account with a Pounds 60,000
deposit as a direct result.
The Co-op has few large corporate customers, and only a handful of those are
quoted. About 250,000 of its accounts are held by small and medium-sized
businesses. The vast majority - about 1.25m - are personal customers, mainly
individuals who appear strongly sympathetic with the policies.
While the bank says it has always operated ethically, this is the first
attempt to develop a formal written set of policies. The issues were
selected after detailed market research including a questionnaire sent to
30,000 customers last November. Most of the respondents supported the code,
with only 2 per cent strongly disagreeing.
A total of 90 per cent of respondents said the most important issue to them
was human rights, while 60 per cent said tobacco manufacturing was the issue
they felt most strongly about. Any issue, such as nuclear power and the
testing of drugs on animals, which less than 60 per cent of respondents felt
was most important was not included in the final policy.
What remains to be seen is how far the bank can effectively enforce its
principles, and how many new customers will be sufficiently committed to
ethical banking to switch their allegiance.
'There's no denying this is a marketing initiative,' says Mr Thomas. 'Why
else do it? But we are not part of the long-haired sandal brigade. We are
socially concerned bankers.'
Mr Thomas emphasises that the ethical code is the second 'chapter' of its
customer charter, launched last year. The first pledged that no financial
information would be released to third parties without the customer's
approval. The third will be a much more detailed statement on environmental
policy.

MAERSK, the Danish shipping line, is to close its dedicated roll-on roll-off
terminal at Dartford, Kent, next month, less than two years after it took
over as operator. The company blamed the recession for the closure, which

CHANNEL 4 is likely to increase its share of advertising when it starts

The ITV companies presently sell Channel 4's advertising air time and pay a

and the Welsh fourth channel, S4C. From next year the government will fund
S4C, which has had advertising revenues of about Pounds 4m a year.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel, believes that next year
Channel 4 will be able to earn 17.6 per cent of terrestrial advertising
revenue in its own right, with the possibility of winning a greater share if
it retains its audience.

Mr Justice Brooke told prosecution and defence lawyers there was
'considerable public concern' about the handling of such trials.
He was anxious that issues be clarified and the amount of evidence reduced
before juries were sworn in.
He recently took over from Mr Justice McKinnon, who was widely criticised
for his handling of the first trial, which lasted a year and four days.
Proceedings against the four remaining defendants will be split into two
trials, Mr Justice Brooke ruled.
The trial of Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown, both former Phillips &amp; Drew
equity directors, is expected to start in October. The trial of Mr Charles
Villiers and Ms Elisabeth Brimelow, both former County NatWest directors, is
expected to start early next year.

FT  30 APR 92 / Business leaders call for support from Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS yesterday called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, to end years of alleged ministerial misunderstanding about the
needs of British manufacturing industry and to champion its cause at home
and abroad. Mr Heseltine was given the message at a meeting with members of
the Confederation of British Industry's National Manufacturing Council, set
up to promote the manufacturing sector. The session with 50 leading
industrialists was his first outside engagement since taking over the
department.
He was told industry wanted, above all, a champion for business in
Whitehall, at Westminster and in Brussels.
Those responsible for UK and EC legislation had to be asked to examine its
effect on business, in particular in respect of costs.
With Mr Heseltine long-pledged to make his department a more powerful
advocate of industry's interests throughout government, he will have readily
welcomed the CBI's views, although the meeting was primarily billed as an
opportunity for him to listen rather than to respond. Since his appointment,
Mr Heseltine has not given any public indication of his detailed ambitions
for the DTI, but he is due to make his first keynote speech next week.
The DTI last night had no comment to make on the talks, which it said formed
part of Mr Heseltine's initial dialogue with the business community.
The CBI, which was critical of the government's relations with industry
under several of Mr Heseltine's predecessors, said it wanted him to stand up
for industry inside the Civil Service and government, within the European
community and other export markets. The CBI said after the meeting: 'In the
past, UK industry has been ill-understood by the DTI and its interests have
been subordinated to the interests of more powerful departments like the
Treasury. Business needs to be properly represented in the corridors of
power.'
The CBI said it was very important that the DTI understood the importance of
wealth creation and the international competitive pressures on different
industrial sectors.
It was made clear that industry was not looking to the DTI for subsidies or
handouts but it was concerned to ensure that it was not placed at a
disadvantage by financial and other forms of assistance given to competitors
by other governments.
The CBI also called on Mr Heseltine to help improve export promotion and to
encourage the development of Training and Enterprise Councils.

FT  30 APR 92 / Institutions tackle 'short-termism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders are asking companies to tell them more about
their investments in research and development in an effort to counteract
charges that shareholders are short-term in their outlook.
Companies have complained that they are discouraged from spending on R&amp;D by
shareholders who would rather see money spent on bigger dividends or on
acquisitions.
The Bank of England-backed Institutional Shareholders Committee will today
announce a suggested format for companies beyond principles established by
the Accountancy Standards Board.
'This paper attempts to break the impasse by setting out those facts about
R&amp;D that it would be useful for institutional investors to know. The onus is
now with companies to provide that information,' the ISC said.
Mr Michael Sandland, chief investment officer at Norwich Union and ISC
chairman, said he believed companies would adopt the new format, even though
it was voluntary. 'If this document came out two years ago, it would have
been laughed at,' he said. 'But now I think it will lead the way.'
The drive for improved corporate governance and the concurrent demands of
shareholders for more information were likely to encourage companies to
comply, he said.
The proposals urge each industry to establish its own detailed definition of
R&amp;D to invite comparisons of expenditure among similar companies. It urges a
particularly broad interpretation of development costs and asks companies to
disclose all those relating to existing products and services as well as
those under development.
Companies are also urged to spell out which of their research expenditure is
'pure' or applied to specific products, along with a discussion of the
potential returns from each category of expenditure.
Because the information is broader than that required by the ASB, the
shareholders' group suggests that companies disclose it in annual reports or
in separate presentations to shareholders rather than in corporate accounts.
The ISC proposed the rules after it was approached by the Electrical
Equipment Association, an electronics trade body, whose members were
concerned about short-termism.

   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LLOYD'S of London insurance market may be forced to hold an
extraordinary general meeting of its 22,400 Names - individuals whose assets
support underwriting.
Mr Richard Astor, acting on behalf of the Names' Fraud Action group, has
accused Lloyd's of not doing enough to prevent the financial ruin of
hundreds of Names.
Mr Astor needs 100 signatures to force Lloyd's to call an extraordinary
meeting, which must be held it has to hold within 42 days of receiving a
requisition.
Lloyd's said yesterday that the call for a meeting was 'a curious thing to
do'. An annual general meeting is planned for June, when Lloyd's will
announce results for the 1989 underwriting year. An extraordinary meeting
would 'entail considerable extra expense,' Lloyd's said.
Meanwhile, a leading analyst of the London insurance market said yesterday
that Lloyd's might be jeopardising its long-term future by short-term and
unco-ordinated responses to its present difficulties.
Ms Julianne Jessup, director of De Lisle Jessup Scott, mergers and
acquisitions specialists for the insurance sector, said at a conference that
Lloyd's agents were shifting the focus of their business away from high-risk
areas because that was superficially more attractive to Names.
Ms Jessup also said it was difficult to see how corporate capital - which
the Rowland task force recommended should be introduced to the market -
could co-exist with Names' underwriting on an unlimited basis.
Reliance on corporate capital would almost inevitably change the structure
of Lloyd's and erode its ability to be innovative and flexible.

its North American polyester fibres operations, writes Paul Abrahams.
The group plans to build a 125m lb a year staple fibre installation at

This follows an announcement last week that it was expanding the scale of
its proposed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plant there from 70m lb a year

The investment would not increase North American capacity. Hoechst said it
was considering closing outdated, non-competitive equipment at other Hoechst

Beginning in 1993, the plant in Vietnam would produce about 400 buses and
trucks a year.
Daewoo has agreed to a 60 per cent share in the venture and plans to invest
more to produce passenger cars within the next two years.
South Korea has no diplomatic relations with Vietnam but business ties
between the two countries have increased recently as Korean companies have

FT  30 APR 92 / World Trade News: Warning on failure of arms trade curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS TO control trade in weapons solely through agreements between
supplier countries will fail in the long run to prevent proliferation and
excessive arms build-ups.
This warning is one of the conclusions of a report published today based on
soundings among a wide range of arms experts and decision-makers, including
government officials from 16 countries in Nato, the former Warsaw pact and
the Third World.
It also questions the extent to which 'selective embargoes' such as those
against Iraq and Libya can be effectively enforced.
The report by the Oxford Research Group. an independent study organisation
devoted to security issues, says that 'supplier regimes' - on the lines of
the current Missile Technology Control Regime - were regarded as no more
than holding operations that would slow down proliferation. Negotiations
should aim instead at a 'participatory regime' involving voluntary
co-operation among all producers and buyers, on either a regional or a
global basis, according to the report.
Independent inspectorates could be set up to monitor compliance, with
sanctions imposed on countries failing to agree to inspections or violating
the rules.
'At no time has the political will world-wide been more favourable towards
the negotiation of international controls,' the report says.
It highlights widespread scepticism about the effectiveness of the UN arms
register due to be set up in the aftermath of the Gulf war.
The first data for the register, referring to 1992 arms transfers, is due to
be supplied by April 30 next year.

FT  30 APR 92 / World Trade News: Tariff row spoils Caribbean community
spirit - Moves towards a common market have fuelled policy disputes on
protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) to create a common
market in two years are being hampered by continuing uncertainty over the
establishment of a customs union with the implementation of a common tariff
on imports from third countries.
The debate over the common tariff and the attacks which have been levelled
at it illustrates the conundrum being faced by small, open economies seeking
protection for nascent industries amid a global tendency towards deregulated
trade. Caricom has argued that the common external tariff is needed to
protect its members' economies while it creates the common market which
would give it the strength to compete in the global marketplace.
But the structure of the common tariff, and its likely effect on trade, has
been attacked by the US and queried by institutions such as the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund. This, combined with the reluctance of
four of Caricom's 13 members to implement the tariff regime, has forced a
rethinking in the community of the need for the tariff as it is now
structured.
'The relatively high level at which the tariff has been set has been drawn
to our attention by the multilateral institutions,' said Mr Wendell Mottley,
finance minister of Trinidad and Tobago. 'They say the tariff levels in
other parts of the world are lower, and that Caricom is not moving fast
enough to deal with this. I foresee some debate on this matter.'
Caricom, which has a market of 5.5m people, is made up of 13
English-speaking countries of the region, including Belize in Central
America, the Bahamas, and Guyana in South America. The Community was
established in 1973 with the aim of strengthening the economies of its
members through increased regional trade and a common approach in trade
negotiations with third countries. All members, except the Bahamas which is
not a signatory of the trading agreements, had said they will implement the
common tariff. However, several countries have repeatedly missed target
dates, saying they feared adverse effects on their economies.
The common external tariff imposes low rates of duty on imports which do not
compete with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on any
imports which are likely to injure domestic industry. Under the new tariff
the highest rate of duty within the community will be 45 per cent and the
lowest five per cent. This replaces a structure in which tariffs ranged from
five per cent to 70 per cent. Rates differ where the imports are raw
materials or finished products, and agricultural products will be given
protection while inputs for agriculture will be subject to very low tariffs.
The US, Caricom's main trading partner, is unhappy with the structure of the
tariff, and has suggested changes which it says are in keeping with the
trend towards the removal of barriers. Mr David Malpass, the US deputy
assistant secretary of state, said the common tariff will reduce Caricom's
trade competitiveness by protecting vulnerable industries.
'I am concerned that the current structure of the common tariff could keep
the region from achieving the competitiveness and growth which it so badly
needs and wants,' Mr Malpass said.
'The real crunch is the obvious tension between trying to protect vulnerable
industries and sectors, and the need to liberalise to make these economies
more efficient.' Caricom's progress towards trade liberalisation was lagging
substantially behind that of other groups in Latin America, such as the
Central American Common Market and the Andean Pact, which have undertaken to
impose a common external tariff with a maximum level of 20 per cent in
general, Mr Malpass said.
The criticism was immediately rejected by Caricom technocrats. Mr Byron
Blake, director of economics and industry at the Caricom secretariat, said
US trade with Caricom had grown significantly from 1984, while there had
been a decline in the exports of community members to the US.
While Caricom's tariff regime appeared to be a 'real problem' for the US, he
argued, it would neither reduce imports from the US nor impact negatively on
regional competitiveness.
'Some Caricom members, such as those in eastern Caribbean, by and large have
very low tariffs.
'Their exporters have not been able to compete in the extra-regional
markets. So clearly there is not a question of tariffs which deals with our
ability to compete.' The 45 per ceiling in the community's tariff affected
only a few products, Mr Blake said. It is now clear, however, that the
community will have to rethink the manner in which it will create the
customs union which it says is fundamental to transforming itself into a
common market.
The nature of the likely alteration in the structure of the common tariff
has been indicated by Mr Edwin Carrington, a former secretary general of the
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, and who will take office as
Caricom's secretary general in September. Rather than having a regime which
demands the same tariff levels, he argued, it is more realistic to determine
which goods are produced, or can be produced, in the community.
'We can then design a tariff which deals with these products, but which
leaves member countries to impose differing duties on products which are not
produced in the community,' he argued. 'The entire instrument needs to be
revised. The IMF and the World Bank are pressuring us to remove barriers,
and the world is moving in the direction of lower tariffs.'
Business leaders, such as Mr Pat Thompson, executive director of the
Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce, believe the problem has to
be resolved quickly.
'If is it not then we will not have a common market because it is not
possible to have a common market which does not have a common external
tariff.'

dispute
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush yesterday slashed Dollars 60m worth of Indian products from
its duty-free preference scheme for poor countries in retaliation for
India's continued refusal to provide patent protection for foreign
pharmaceutical and chemical products.
The sanctions, imposed after years of US complaints, are directed towards
Indian exports of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and related products. Mrs Carla
Hills, the US Trade Representative, said the action is 'meant to be a rifle
shot absolutely focused on the entities that are benefiting from the theft
of our patents'.
In the Uruguay Round and in bilateral negotiations with the US, India has
resisted US demands arguing that, as a developing country, it is entitled to
different 'rules of the game' in trade.
However, under US pressure it last February agreed to expand market access
for foreign films and provide more protection for foreign trademarks.
'Because India is negotiating in one areas it doesn't mean we are satisfied
with how the pharmaceutical issue is being treated,' Mrs Hills said. 'We
suffer the loss in this country of roughly Dollars 60bn in the theft of our
intellectual property . . . We are as keenly interested in protecting
intangible property as we are in protecting tangible property.'
In a related action, Mrs Hills announced that under the annual 'Special 301'
review, Taiwan has been added to a special list - along with India and
Thailand - of countries considered the worst offenders in failing to provide
intellectual property rights protection. They could be subject to
retaliation this year.
Although Taiwan has proposed improvements in its intellectual property laws,
it has made 'little progress' in enacting or implementing them, Mrs Hills
said.
Thailand was listed because of failure to enforce copyright protection and
deficiencies in its patent protection. 'Thailand is energetically trying to
correct its problems,' Mrs Hills said.
'But there is a brand new government. I cannot tell you what action we will
take until we meet.'
Mrs Hills named nine trading partners, including the EC, to a 'priority
watch list' for its inadequate intellectual property protection. The EC was
named for its Broadcast Direction, which requires states to ensure 'where
practicable' a majority of broadcast time for European programmes.

PERSONAL incomes continued to rise in the US last month, helping to fuel a
modest revival in consumer spending.
The Department of Commerce said personal income rose in March by 0.6 per
cent to an annual rate of Dollars 4,990bn after seasonal adjustments,
following February's 1.0 per cent increase.
Disposable incomes rose somewhat faster as a result of a reduction in income
tax scales ordered by President Bush and applied in March.
The department said disposable incomes rose 1.1 per cent, or 0.6 per cent in
real terms.
Spending on personal consumption rose modestly for the fifth month, gaining
0.3 per cent to an annual rate of Dollars 4,041bn. In real terms, however,
personal consumption spending declined by 0.2 per cent.
Personal saving increased to an estimated annual rate of Dollars 233bn.
Economists said the data announced yesterday by the Commerce Department were
consistent with Tuesday's report that GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 per
cent in the first quarter.
They have been divided, however, over whether the upturn in demand is likely
to spill quickly over into the creation of new jobs, so fuelling a stronger
recovery.

FT  30 APR 92 / Poor nations accuse the rich of breaking their own rules:
The developing world's growing frustration at the west's failure to practise
what it preaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY developing countries probably left this week's IMF/World Bank meetings
feeling somewhat frustrated. The anodyne official communiques made all the
right noises yet there was a sense that rich countries, beset by their own
economic problems, had difficulty focusing on the Third World.
The need to divert scarce capital and human resources to support reform in
the former communist countries played a role in this, although many
developing countries recognise that they, too, stand to gain from an
enlargement of the international economic community. The problem lay more in
the perceived reluctance of industrialised countries to follow talk with
action.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean minister who chairs the joint IMF/bank
development committee, summed up his frustration by contrasting the Group of
Seven industrialised countries' demands for radical structural reform in the
former Soviet republics with their reluctance to take even modest steps to
eliminate their own economic distortions - some of which are hurting the
developing world.
He pointed out that rich countries spend Dollars 250bn on agricultural
protection - about five times the total devoted to official development
finance. 'It was disturbing,' he said, that the Uruguay Round trade talks
were languishing because rich countries lacked the courage to make reforms
that would adversely affect only a tiny percentage of their mainly urban
populations. Many developing countries have unilaterally reduced trade
barriers and implemented a range of market-oriented policies: they cannot
understand why their teachers in the industrialised world refuse to obey the
rules.
Mr Foxley warned that if developed countries did not soon agree to
liberalise trade, Third World countries might be obliged to form their own
regional trading blocs. He hoped such pacts would be compatible with Gatt
rules, but there is an obvious risk they might undermine multilateral trade.
The development committee's final communique noted these tendencies, but its
only new proposal on trade was the minor recommendation that the bank and
IMF publish regular assessments of the impact of changes in trade patterns
on poor countries.
The Third World is also disappointed that real growth in overseas
development assistance has petered out. In 1990 prices, official aid
totalled Dollars 41.3bn last year, fractionally less than the previous year.
The grant component fell from Dollars 26.5bn to Dollars 24.7bn. Yet the
demands for funds are growing: to take one example the drought in southern
Africa looks like being one of the worst in decades.
Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, argued vigorously for more cash for
the poorest countries. But in its communique the development committee
regretted the increase in poverty, but lamely agreed only to 'discuss all
resource flows and transfers in more depth' at next September's IMF/bank
meeting. The bank is pressing for a substantial increase in funds for the
International Development Association (IDA) - its soft loan affiliate. But
with most of the large donors running big budget deficits, the 10th
replenishment of IDA (which covers the three years beginning next July) is
unlikely to do more than keep pace with inflation. Meanwhile, many new
countries - including former Soviet republics in central Asia - will meet
IDA's Dollars 800 a year per capita income means test.
As the Earth Summit in Rio draws closer, the environment forms a third
source of friction between rich and poor countries. The development
committee communique, echoing the analysis of the bank's forthcoming World
Development Report, declared that 'continued, even accelerated economic
growth and human development can be consistent with improving environmental
conditions.' Life may not prove so simple.
Mr Foxley is probably not alone in fearing that rich countries will use the
environment as an excuse for sneaking in new trade barriers, whose real
purpose would be to mollify special interest groups at home. Another
possibility is that industrialised countries will prove genuinely committed
to a cleaner global environment, but turn to trade sanctions as the only
effective way of forcing compliance with tougher standards.
The underlying problem is that worthwhile environmental improvements will be
costly. To make an impact, the bank reckons developing countries will have
to spend at least 2-3 per cent of gross domestic product every year - a
large sum in poor countries facing many competing claims on resources.
Judging from the communique, as a gesture ahead of the Rio conference,
industrial countries will support an expanded role for the Dollars 1.3bn
environment facility set up by the World Bank and United Nations to pay for
environmental projects with global pay-offs. But this will still be a drop
in the ocean. Rich countries do not appear willing to commit resources on
the scale needed to really help the Third World.

FT  30 APR 92 / Women's campaigner steals poll headlines in Pennsylvania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE two big lessons out of Pennsylvania are that Bill Clinton lives and that
women scorned can be a potent political force this year.
The biggest story was the triumph in the Senate Democratic primary of Ms
Lynn Yeakel, who rose from oblivion in the polls at the beginning of the
year to a comfortable 44-33 per cent victory over Lieutenant Governor Mark
Singel, the initial favourite son candidate.
In contrast the Arkansas governor's victory - by 57 to 26 per cent over
Jerry Brown and with at least 110 of the state's 169 delegates added to his
tally - was not surprising. Doubts may persist about his viability as a
presidential candidate, but there can be few doubting now that he will be
the Democratic nominee.
He came to Washington yesterday to persuade Democratic senators and
congressmen, many of them among the 772 'super delegates' to the convention,
of this fact. Though he did not ask for endorsements, he reportedly was well
received and Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, predicted that
'a sizeable number' would soon declare for him.
He said Congress should give the president what is known as line item veto
power, reform campaign finance laws, practise better budgetary discipline
and pass a national health insurance scheme.
The best news for Mr Clinton, who, with approaching 1,500 delegates now,
seems to accept he may not finally nail down the 2,145 needed for the
nomination until the final primaries on June 2, was that, according to exit
polls in Pennsylvania, over 60 per cent of Democrats thought he was honest
enough to be president, up from under 50 per cent in earlier primaries.
This partly offset the fact that the turnout in the state, as elsewhere, was
very small, reflecting lack of enthusiasm for the candidate. In this
respect, Mr Clinton is in the same boat as President Bush, who had the
admittedly minor mortification of seeing Patrick Buchanan, who hardly
campaigned, still win nearly a quarter of the vote. Mr Bush will be assured
of the Republican nomination very soon.
Ms Yeakel, a successful fund-raiser for women's causes, triumphed in her
first ever political race by looking past her primary opponents to the
November election against Senator Arlen Specter, the incumbent Republican,
who won easily on Tuesday.
It was Mr Specter's aggressive grilling of Professor Anita Hill in the
hearings to confirm Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court last year
that induced Ms Yeakel to run. Her campaign featured commercials replaying
at length Mr Specter's hostile questioning, which included his brandishing a
copy of the novel, 'The Exorcist,' and asking Ms Hill whether she drew her
allegations of sexual harassment from it.
As with Ms Carol Mosely Braun, who unseated the Democratic incumbent in the
Illinois primary last month, Ms Yeakel tapped a deep well of discontent,
among men as well as women, about the perceived indifference, exemplified by
the Thomas hearings, of the Washington male establishment towards women's
issues. She made much of being an outsider capable of changing that
establishment.
Mr Specter is, in most things, a moderate Republican. Unlike his president,
he believes, for example, in the right to abortion. Pennsylvania's law
restricting that right is currently before the Supreme Court, on which
Justice Thomas now sits.
The man he beat in his primary was the architect of that law, but polls in
the culturally conservative state showed over 60 per cent in favour of the
freedom to choose abortion.
Ms Yeakel's success, allied to that of Ms Braun, will doubtless encourage
other women candidates across the country. Particular attention will now
focus on California, where Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San
Francisco, and Congresswoman Barbara Boxer are bidding for the two Senate
seats at stake this year.

FT  30 APR 92 / Bond's debts exceed ADollars 700m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, has debts and contingent
liabilities of more than ADollars 700m (Pounds 297m) and assets of just over
ADollars 1m, according to a statement of his financial affairs filed in the
Federal Court yesterday.
The statement shows that Mr Bond, former chairman of Bond Corporation
Holdings, does not own a home, and is living in an apartment in Cottesloe,
Western Australia, for which he pays ADollars 200 a week rent.
He lists assets of ADollars 1,000 in cash, ADollars 2,669 in bank deposits
and shares, a wristwatch worth ADollars 1,200 and ADollars 1.13m in
paintings. Most of the paintings are claimed by the liquidator of Dallhold
Investments, Mr Bond's private company.
The statement reveals the existence of 11 family trusts, some of which own
property in New South Wales and Western Australia. However, Mr Bond says he
has received no income from the trusts for two years.
Mr Bond says his only income is ADollars 195,000 a year in consultancy fees
from two UK companies: Heyside, of Darlington, and Expo Development and
Trading, of Jersey.
The statement shows Mr Bond paid ADollars 486,441 to lawyers and accountants
over the last year as he sought to avoid bankruptcy. He also says he lost
ADollars 10,000 in casinos in the last six months.
Mr Bond puts his debts and contingent liabilities at ADollars 411.8m, plus
damages sought by the liquidator of JN Taylor Holdings, former Bond Corp
subsidiary, in relation to alleged mismanagement by Mr Bond and others. The
damages sought have been quantified in court papers as in excess of ADollars
300m.
Mr Bond disputes many of the claims against him, including the action
brought by JN Taylor. He also claims he is owed ADollars 265m, mostly by
co-guarantors of an ADollars 256m bank loan to a Dallhold subsidiary.
The statement gives a fascinating glimpse into the lifestyle enjoyed by Mr
Bond and his family during the boom years of Bond Corp in the late 1980s,
when the company controlled assets worth more than ADollars 10bn and Mr
Bond's personal wealth was estimated at more than ADollars 100m.
Between May 1986 and December 1989, Mr Bond gave his family cash and gifts
valued at nearly ADollars 30m, including jewellery worth ADollars 10.7m to
his wife Eileen, from whom he is being divorced.
Other presents include a watch worth ADollars 26,000 for his son Craig, a
ADollars 253,000 bracelet for his daughter Susanne, 32, and a ADollars
69,000 Jaguar car for his daughter Jody, 26.
Mr Bond resigned as chairman of Bond Corp in September 1990, two days before
the group announced an Australian record loss of ADollars 2.24bn.
Bond Corp is being restructured under a debt for equity swap which will
reduce Mr Bond's holding from more than 50 per cent to 5 per cent.
Most of Bond Corp's assets have been sold.

THE TAIWAN franchisee for McDonald's has been forced to close all 57 of its
hamburger outlets on the island for an unspecified period after two bombs
exploded in McDonald's restaurants, leaving one policeman dead and three
people injured, writes Luisetta Mudie in Taipei.
Three other bombs were found and defused after telephone warnings. Extortion
notes were also received by McDonald's staff before the bombings began on
Tuesday, demanding payment of NTDollars 6m (Pounds 134,000) in protection
money.
Taiwan McDonald's chairman, Mr David Sun of the Quanta group, the privately
owned franchisee, said: 'It is the responsibility of our company not to
concede to this kind of request.'
Mr Sun is offering a reward of NTDollars 12m for information leading to the
arrest of the culprits.
The incident spread such alarm that the prime minister held a special
meeting with police to discuss the problem.
A government spokesman, Mr Jason Hu, said afterwards he hoped that the
incident would not spread terror within society. 'Our society has always
been a peaceful and quiet one,' he said. 'People are not used to incidents
of this nature.'

<TEXT>
BRITAIN is increasing its drought aid for southern Africa by Pounds 20m,
only a month after it had pledged an initial Pounds 10m tranche, writes our
Foreign Staff.
Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, said: 'This drought has
devastated harvests throughout the region. By acting now we can help avert
the threat of widespread starvation seen elsewhere in Africa.'
She called for more EC support. On a visit to Brussels at the weekend she
would seek 'to ensure the European Community package of 800,000 tonnes of
extra food aid, including 680,000 tonnes for Africa, is approved at the
Development Council on May 4 and then implemented very swiftly.'
Of the latest Pounds 20m disbursement, Zambia and Zimbabwe will receive
Pounds 7.5m and Pounds 5m for food imports. Direct shipments of food, mainly
for Mozambique, will cost a further Pounds 5m.
The rest will go to countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and
Namibia.

Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee told the white-dominated parliament he would
table legislation soon to support police in their fight against township and
political violence that has claimed 5,000 lives since 1990.
Meanwhile President F W de Klerk shelved a controversial plan for limited

Government negotiator Mr Tertius Delport said Mr de Klerk would put on ice
his own proposals for interim rule while delegates to the Convention for a

<TEXT>
A DISINFECTANT spray allegedly able to kill the Aids virus in 30 seconds is
one of many fake medicines on the Chinese market making extravagant and
false claims for their curative powers.
Composed of medicinal plants and herbs, 'Shenglu' can be rubbed or sprayed
on, injected or gargled, says the advertising literature. It is one of a
number of 'anti-Aids' products, claiming to kill or prevent the spread of
the deadly virus, which are available over the counter in Beijing department
stores.
Chen Minzhang, health minister, called this week for a crackdown on illegal
profiteering from imitating well-regarded traditional Chinese medicines. But
despite the misleading claims made for the restorative herbal powers of
anti-Aids products in particular, health authorities seem powerless to act
or to help people distinguish genuine from false medicine.
The medical claims for some products are merely odd. SOD is an
'anti-senility' toothpaste, developed and manufactured by the Shanghai
Toothpaste Factory which produces 600m tubes a year.
SOD (superoxide dismutase) toothpastes are believed to be able to resist
senility in the human body, the Xinhua news agency reported with only a hint
of scepticism.
Another Xinhua report from Taiyuan claimed a newly-developed traditional
Chinese medical concoction could cure mental retardation. The product,
Xingnaokang, is reported to have had a 95 per cent success rate in raising
IQs without side effects.
Aids products are in a different category, as unscrupulous manufacturers
play on people's fears of a terminal and terrible disease to make money,
with widespread ignorance about Aids encouraging exploitation.

SHARE values on the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest, have plunged by
17.75 per cent in the last two days as fears spread that stocks had been
bought up in recent months using funds improperly diverted from the
gilt-edged market.
State Bank of India, the country's largest bank, has said that an audit
following its March year-end revealed that Rs6bn (Pounds 118m) in bankers'
notes had not been surrendered on time by a gilts broker. It described this
as an invalid transaction which had now been 'regularised'.
In New Delhi Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, came under
pressure in parliament to explain the Bombay equities slide.
The country's Central Bureau of Investigation is also inquiring into the
case, which has raised questions about gilts trading procedures. Stock
market analysts see the decline as reflecting fears of forced selling in a
number of issues where the broker was said to have built big positions.
The BSE index fell 222.49 points yesterday to 3,674.41 following a plunge of
570.42 on Tuesday, the first trading session after a five-day suspension
caused by a brokers' strike. At issue in the stoppage was the registration
of brokers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market
watchdog.
As prices fell, restrictions on share dealings using borrowed funds were
relaxed by the authorities at the BSE, which accounts for two thirds of
national share trading.

<TEXT>
THE EC has been urged to offer the Maghreb countries of North Africa free
trade and an intensified political dialogue as a means of encouraging
stability and limiting migration across the Mediterranean. The European
Commission yesterday approved a policy document containing such proposals
for presentation to EC foreign ministers in mid-May.
Brussels hopes that such 'a new Euro-Maghreb partnership' will balance, to
some extent, the Community's fast-growing ties with its northern and eastern
neighbours.
The Commission is already holding exploratory talks on Moroccan free trade
proposal, and is ready to do the same with Tunisia. The other potential
beneficiary is Algeria, though rapid rapprochement is unlikely after the
Algiers government's move this year to stem Islamic fundamentalism by
suspending elections.
The two other Maghreb countries are considered excluded from the
Commission's initiative - Libya, because it is the target of EC and United
Nations sanctions over airline terrorism, and Mauritania, because it gets
separate EC benefits through the Lome convention.
Maghreb countries already stand to gain from the EC's Mediterranean
programme of Ecu4.4bn (Pounds 3.13bn) in grants and loans for 1992-96.
Disturbed by human rights abuses in Morocco, European MPs are currently
blocking money for Morocco, as well as Syria.
Francis Ghiles adds from Washington: A Dollars 275m (Pounds 155m) structural
adjustment loan to Morocco is due to be approved today by the board of the
World Bank. The loan is part of a co-financing package to which the African
Development Bank will contribute a further Dollars 100m. It is the seventh
World Bank loan to support restructuring and liberalisation of Morocco's
economy after the foreign debt was rescheduled in September 1983.

FT  30 APR 92 / UN body calls for cut in population growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD population growth rates will have to be reduced over the next decade
if economic development is to be sustained and the environment protected,
according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
Human numbers are growing at record rates, with an annual increase of about
97m projected for the next 10 years, says the organisation's State of the
World Population 1992 report.
That would mean 6bn people in 1998, and 10bn in 2050, compared with 5.48bn
this summer. Without 'immediate and determined action' to reduce future
family sizes, world population could reach 12.5bn in 2050, it warns.
UNFPA found that, since 1975, population growth rates have been linked to
per capita income in developing countries - before then, no such connection
had been established.
Countries with slower population growth rates saw annual incomes rise by an
average 1.23 per cent a year in the 1980s compared with a fall of 1.25 per
cent in countries where population grew faster. Lower birth rates also meant
higher savings and investment ratios.
Eliminating extreme poverty, improving health and education, and raising the
status of women are seen as essential steps to encouraging reduced family
sizes.
Such policies should give special attention to Africa and south Asia, which
are responsible for more than half the population increases and which
contain most of the world's very poor, says UNFPA.
The issue of sustainable development is also tackled in the report, which
says record population growth rates are being accompanied by record human
consumption of resources.

<TEXT>
The European Commission still appears to be backing a mandatory EC-wide
'carbon tax' to reduce energy pollution, but leaning towards making it
conditional on main industrial partners pledging similar action at the June
'earth summit' in Rio, David Buchan reports from Brussels.
The EC executive yesterday debated the controversial tax - strongly opposed
by industry but championed by environmentalists - but postponed a decision
because too many of its 17 members were absent.
Most of those present were said to favour a binding tax on fossil fuels,
which like all EC fiscal measures must get unanimous approval of the 12
governments, on condition that countries such as the US and Japan match it.
The EC accounts for 13 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, the
US 23 per cent and Japan 5 per cent. Brussels is also weighing proposals to
encourage energy saving and efficiency and to promote renewable sources of
energy.

struggles to get peace talks started in Lisbon
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIGHTING last night broke out in nearly every quarter of Sarajevo, capital
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, between the republic's mainly Moslem defence forces
and Serb irregulars.
The clashes - the most serious in the city since last Thursday - were
reported by Sarajevo television and came just hours after Serbian TV
announced that Moslem forces in Bosnia had effectively declared war against
the Serbian-dominated federal army.
Bosnian officials claimed no such order had been given and accused the Serbs
of a trick to make it look as if they wanted war. Fighting also erupted last
night in the republic's southern city of Mostar.
The reports on Serbia's Belgrade TV were based on a despatch by Tanjug, the
Belgrade-based news agency which reflects Serbian views. This said the
Territorial Defence organisation had called for 'the stepping-up of all
battle activities' on Bosnian territory and a mass blockade of all federal
army installations in Bosnia.
Tanjug appears to have based its own despatch on a statement made earlier
yesterday by Colonel Vehbija Karic, a leader of the Bosnian forces, in which
he called on the republic's inhabitants and all Territorial Defence units to
stop unauthorised removal of army equipment and the movement of army troops
not escorted by the Territorial Defence.
European Community observers stationed in three towns in Bosnia were
recalled to their headquarters for consultations yesterday but also because
their security could no longer be guaranteed.
In Lisbon, meanwhile, leaders of the republic's three national communities
gathered for EC-sponsored peace talks. Leaders of Bosnia's Slavic Moslems,
Serbs and Croats appear to agree only that the urgent despatch of United
Nations troops could curb the violence; beyond that, the warring factions
remain far apart.
Preliminary bilateral talks continued into the evening, with the opening of
full discussions being continually delayed. Officials hoped the arrival of
Mr Aliza Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, would be the beginning of
substantive talks, but prospects were dimmed when he said he could only be
there for a day. 'I have come here to explain the situation . . . to the
European Community,' he said.
Funding the UN peace-keeping force in Croatia created serious problems for
the secretariat in New York and the international community has indicated
its considerable reluctance to become involved still further.
Meanwhile, the EC and the US appear to have backed down from warnings to
Serbia of political and economic isolation for its role in destabilising
Bosnia. Instead, they appear to have given President Slobodan Milosevic
leeway to try to stop the fighting by bringing paramilitary units to heel.
Diplomatic pressure on Mr Milosevic eased somewhat when the US revised its
position and placed part of the blame for the violence on Croatia, which it
suspects of aiming to divide Bosnia with Serbia.
Economic sanctions, it is argued in Belgrade, risk strengthening support for
Mr Milosevic by bolstering popular resentment of 'western interference'.
Many fear further detoriation of the economy would give rise to an ultra
nationalist administration. Sanctions would also hurt the already hard-hit
economies of Bosnia and the independence-seeking Macedonia.
Hunger already threatens Bosnia's 4.35m inhabitants. Serb road blocks have
all but stopped the transport of foodstuffs and relief supplies. Serbia has
banned most exports of food to Bosnia. Factories, not yet damaged by war,
have had to cut production for lack of raw materials.
A PORTUGUESE spokesman said yesterday that European Community recognition of
the new Yugoslav republic would depend on its fulfilling three basic
conditions, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. It would have to withdraw its
troops from all neighbouring states, accept the terms of the peace
conference aiming to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict, and show
willing to negotiate with all the other states of the former Yugoslav
republic on the division of its assets and liabilities.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICANS are to be offered a personal telephone number for life, the
perfect accessory for a nation whose citizens move house an average of 11
times.
In June, AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, will introduce a personal
telephone number that will allow subscribers to be reached at any telephone
in the continental US.
AT&amp;T's Easy Reach 700 service provides subscribers with a personal
identification number - their own access number to the service. The number
need not change if the subscriber moves house within the US.
Although call-forwarding is already available, Easy Reach subscribers not
only have a number for life but can also select which calls they want
forwarded to them at any location.
At Dollars 7 (Pounds 3.90) a month the service will not be cheap for
consumers used to receiving telephone numbers free. Calls within the US will
cost 25 cents a minute between 8am and 5pm and 15 cents a minute at other

FT  30 APR 92 / Attack on Kohl intensifies feud within coalition: Germany's
future deputy chancellor calls for stronger leadership

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl, faced with spreading strikes across Germany,
yesterday came under attack from his future deputy chancellor who called for
stronger leadership and drastic budget cuts.
The call, from Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister who has just been
nominated for the deputy's post, fuelled the bitter feuding between the
parties that make up Germany's ruling coalition.
The recriminations followed Monday's dramatic decision by Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher to resign as foreign minister and deputy chancellor - and
disagreements within the government over who should succeed him.
At the same time, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of
Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), bitterly criticised Mr Mollemann
and his Free Democratic party (FDP) for upsetting the coalition, and called
on Mr Kohl to carry out a drastic government reshuffle.
For their part the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), taking advantage of
the obvious confusion in government ranks, called for new elections two
years ahead of time.
The FDP yesterday attempted to close ranks after a revolt by its members of
parliament, who rejected the leadership's nomination of Mrs Irmgard
Schwaetzer as new foreign minister, and substituted Mr Klaus Kinkel, the
present justice minister.
At the same time, the party is insisting on Mr Mollemann as its candidate
for deputy chancellor, although he is unpopular with the coalition partners.
That is the job which the CSU believes should now go to Mr Theo Waigel, its
leader and the current finance minister.
Mr Mollemann has chosen just this moment to launch an offensive on the
government's spending plans, delivering a 16-page paper to Mr Waigel calling
for drastic budget cuts, according to today's issue of the independent
Suddeutsche Zeitung.
Mr Mollemann also called for urgent action to privatise significant state
holdings such as Lufthansa, the German airline, Deutsche Telekom, the state
telecommunications monopoly, and the post office savings bank, in order to
raise more cash.
The report says he is calling for a common line from the chancellor, the
finance minister and his own economics ministry, proposing cuts - including
a reduction in social spending, an area which Mr Kohl has specifically ruled
out for savings. Mr Mollemann also called for 'strong political leadership'
in Bonn, the newspaper said, clearly implying weakness in the chancellor.
The timing of his initiative has fuelled speculation that the FDP may be
seeking a confrontation with its coalition partners, given the sliding
popularity of the government in the opinion polls, and the ever-more
unpopular costs of paying for unification with eastern Germany.
In his paper, Mr Mollemann argues that the budget faces increased charges
totalling billions of D-Marks from compensation costs related to unification
 -DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in 1993, DM15bn in 1994 and DM25bn in 1995.
Mr Kohl is simultaneously facing grumblings of discontent from the CSU,
whose leader, Mr Waigel, does not appear to have been seriously consulted
over the Genscher succession.
Last night the party and parliamentary leaders of the three coalition
partners were meeting in an attempt to agree on their outstanding
differences, including the question of budget strategy in the coming months.
Mr Peter Struck, the SPD parliamentary group manager, said there was a
simple answer to the coalition's crisis: new elections.

FT  30 APR 92 / Labour may end role of unions in leadership elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLE of trade unions in the election of Labour leaders could end this
autumn, it emerged yesterday, as the party ordered an inquest into what went
wrong in its general election campaign.
Labour's packaging of policy was also under attack last night from deputy
leader Mr Roy Hattersley, who told ITN that the Sheffield election rally
'epitomised five to 10 years of mistakes'.
The move to end the unions' role would significantly reduce the party's
historic links with the trade unions. It follows mounting criticism of their
conduct in the current leadership contest, not least the refusal of several
of the largest to ballot members.
Front runner in the leadership race, Mr John Smith, meanwhile, was putting
the finishing touches to a 6,000-word manifesto to be launched today aimed
at quashing criticism that he has so far offered few new ideas.
A novel proposal in the document is for a 'special commission' into social
justice aimed at creating a broad non-Tory consensus on how to reconcile
pressing social needs without unduly raising the tax burden.
It would ally political parties with interest groups and aim to put fresh
pressure on the government.
The shadow chancellor will also emphasise his intention to run an open-door
leadership, responsive to the views of all sections of the party.
Mr Robin Cook, his campaign manager, said last night: 'He wants the
leadership election to open up debate about the future, not to close it
down.'
Labour's national executive committee had agreed that the rules for future
leadership elections should be reviewed immediately and the review completed
before the party's conference in October, Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general
secretary, said.
He would not rule out the possibility of ending the electoral college system
which gives 40 per cent of the votes to unions and 30 per cent each for MPs
and individual members.
The current leadership battle between Mr Smith and Mr Bryan Gould, which
will be over by July 18, would not be affected by any changes.
Meanwhile, plans for an investigation into Labour's election defeat were
under way, as members of the NEC asked the organisation committee to conduct
a comprehensive inquest into what went wrong, and to report before the
autumn conference.
But a preliminary assessment by Mr Whitty concluded that voters' last-minute
fears of the uncertainties over the recession and the impact of a Labour
victory had scared them into the Conservative camp. Mr Neil Kinnock, party
leader, said: 'It was a choice between fear and hope and fear was what won
out.'
Mr Hattersley said the party had to answer the question of why people's fear
of Labour had cost it the election. There were two or three explanations.
'Certainly the lies about Labour tax policy frightened a lot of people. The
question is why we didn't overcome those lies,' he said.
Criticising the emphasis on packaging, he told ITN: 'We have packaged our
product wonderfully. We have packaged it so well that too many people have
described the package without describing the contents.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Midland softens support for Hongkong takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK softened its support for Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's Pounds
3.3bn takeover bid yesterday in the wake of Lloyds' Pounds 3.6bn offer
proposal.
As the battle for control of Midland gained momentum, it also emerged that
National Australia Bank (NAB), which owns the Yorkshire and Clydesdale
banks, has told Lloyds it would be interested in buying several hundred of
Lloyds' and Midland's branches if Lloyds succeeded in buying Midland.
Lloyds was encouraged by the first official announcement from Midland since
it made its offer proposal. Midland's board said it 'intends . . . to
recommend Hongkong Bank's offer, provided this would not conflict with the
ability of Midland shareholders to consider a firm offer from Lloyds which
secured demonstrably greater value for their shares'.
Under the terms of the takeover code, this does not constitute a firm
recommendation in favour of Hongkong Bank's bid. A Midland director said:
'The recommendation is slightly on the shelf.'
The Midland statement was approved by the board after a two-hour meeting
with the bank's advisers on Tuesday evening. Directors felt they could not
dismiss Lloyds' offer because it was proposing to offer more than Hongkong
Bank.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, said the board had to take into
account the interests of the bank's shareholders. But he pointed out that
Lloyds had not made a formal bid and would do so only if it was not
obstructed by the EC and UK competition authorities.
Meanwhile, it also emerged that NAB's merchant bank adviser, Lazard
Brothers, has told Lloyds' chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman, that NAB would
be interested in buying Midland and Lloyds branches. NAB has already
acquired several hundred branches from Midland, having bought Midland's
Clydesdale and northern subsidiaries in 1987.
Lloyds is considering the NAB approach, but is unlikely to begin detailed
negotiations for several weeks. It has been considering whether it would
avoid having its proposal to acquire Midland being being referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority, if it were
to agree to sell branches.
Lloyds believes an MMC reference is probably inevitable and is concentrating
on persuading the Department of Trade and Industry to also refer Hongkong
Bank's bid to the MMC. However, Lloyds may try to do a deal with NAB or
another bank at a later stage, during the MMC investigation, to persuade the
MMC not to block a Midland takeover.
In a separate development, it emerged that there is considerable legal
uncertainty over a key article in the EC Merger Regulation, which will
determine whether Hongkong Bank's bid falls under the jurisdiction of UK
competition authorities or the EC authority. The article refers to the
location of bank assets.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (17): Big change of culture
for a family business - A long-established company moves from central
Manchester to mid Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE the main door of William O'Hanlon's new plant in Newtown, mid Wales,
is a plaque recording the names of all those employees who have spent more
than 50 years with the company. There are 42 of them, including three
members of the founding O'Hanlon family.
Two more names could soon be added. One employee will join the select band
later this year - and the present chairman, Mr Esmond O'Hanlon, great
grandson of the founder, has just three years to make his half century.
A move from its only home for a private, family concern such as O'Hanlon was
therefore taken with some trepidation. The company had been in the centre of
Manchester since its inception in 1870; the only move it had previously
undertaken being no further than crossing Dale Street.
Would its employees come with it to mid Wales, the directors wondered.
O'Hanlon's problem was that its Victorian six-storey building was no longer
suitable for its business, making roller blinds, curtain fabrics and made-up
curtains for the small retailer. The factory was, in effect, a series of
small, inter-linking rooms in which the various compartments of the business
could be carried on.
'It was a wasteful method of organisation,' says Mr Andrew Hoyle, the young
managing director who joined the company six years ago. 'In its time, the
arrangement was suitable. In bad times some of the rooms could be shut down
as the company retracted and let off to bring in income. In good times, we
could expand carefully.
'But the building was wasteful in modern terms since it meant we had to
employ people doing largely the same sort of work in different rooms. A move
made sense, especially as we wanted to develop our export business.'
There was, however, also the 112 staff to be considered. O'Hanlon set great
store by good employees relations. The O'Hanlons had been prominent in
helping Manchester's problems and it did not want to abandon anyone,
especially in the economic climate last year.
In the event, 34 decided to make the move and only two of those have
returned - 'even those two were not unexpected,' Mr Hoyle says, 'because
they were in two minds about coming.'
Every member of the staff who took up the offer to visit Newtown opted to
move with the company. Offset against the two are four who have subsequently
rejoined the company after initially deciding to stay in Manchester.
The shape of the building was only one reason O'Hanlon looked elsewhere.
Labour problems in inner Manchester made it difficult to recruit and keep
staff. Newtown posed no such problems.
There is no serious unemployment in the town and it had an added attraction
to O'Hanlon: it has several Laura Ashley plants. A supply of trained labour
accustomed to working in the textile industry was on tap.
'Laura Ashley has been going through problems over the past year,' Mr Hoyle
says, 'and our arrival was a good reason for many of its workers to see if
they could switch. Although we only wanted 14 people for the start-up date,
we got 164 applicants, most of them qualified people. And we now have people
working with us for less than they received at Laura Ashley.'
The company looked at several sites before it settled on Newtown. The first
area was within distance of Manchester, to try and retain its roots.
Preston, Runcorn and Wigan were all considered, but it was felt these towns,
which had all developed over the past 20-25 years, had gone through their
early expansion phase whereas Newtown was still to reach its potential.
Responsibility for the move was given to the finance director. He first
contacted the inner-core of managers to alert them to the company's thinking
and when the decision had been made, each of the three executive directors
talked individually to every member of the staff.
A relocation package was drawn up for those thinking of moving and an
alternative package, involving bringing forward pensions as well as
enhancing redundancy pay, was created for those who were to leave the
company.
'O'Hanlon has always been a good company to work for,' Mr Hoyle says, 'and
the O'Hanlon family has always played an important part in the social life
of Manchester. They were particularly interested in schooling and care of
children. So we were not going to leave Manchester without making every
provision possible for all our employees.
'We would have liked everyone to come with us and I am sorry more did not
take up our offer because it was a tremendous opportunity for them. But
people have different family, work and other claims and I understand their
decision.'
The company did not employ specialists on employee relocation, but the
finance director spoke to several of his friends who had been through a
similar experience.
In the event, everyone who said he or she was interested in the move
actually went south with the company, even some with over 25 years service.
Mr Hoyle believes the move has been a success though the 34, as well as the
company itself, have had to come to terms with a new culture, especially
concerning the environment.
Newtown is as crime-free as it is possible to get, so the staff are relaxed
about going out at night. But it is a country area and two-car families are
the norm. Social life is different: better for the families who have tended
to mix more together, but worse for the bachelors who miss Manchester's
night life.
Mr Hoyle believes the move has been a success, but he will not really know
until a report commissioned from an independent consultant has been
received. The report should have been in his hands by now but the consultant
relocated himself to the north of Scotland.
Mr Hoyle's regrets are not about the move, but that once the next two names
of those serving for 50 years are on the plaque there will be no one to
follow them. Given that an entrant joins at 16 and serves to retirement at
65, it is no longer possible to get 50 years in with a single employer.
He also regrets, too, that only two of the O'Hanlon family remain on the
board. Mr Esmond O'Hanlon is 68 and so approaching retirement, which leaves
only Mr Timothy O'Hanlon, a non-executive director, behind him - 'this is a
very happy, family-dominated company which has looked after its staff
throughout its 122 years. It will be a sad day when an O'Hanlon is no longer
at the centre of its affairs.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (18): And finally . . . the
one that got away - Teesside's 'buns not guns' controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL go down as one of the oddest relocation tussles ever.
Stockton-on-Tees, promised 1,600 Ministry of Defence Quality Assurance Unit
jobs, many of them high quality technical and scientific posts, ended up
instead with a consolation prize - a cheesecake factory.
The 'buns not guns' controversy which erupted earlier this year generated
bad feeling which extended beyond Teesside. The row did nothing to sweeten
relations between Labour-controlled Cleveland County Council and Stockton
South's Conservative MP, Mr Tim Devlin, since re-elected with a
substantially increased majority.
But it is still unclear whether, in the end, Stockton would have been better
off with its lost MoD project or the promised substitutes.
The saga began in early 1989 when the government announced that, as part of
its policy of relocating staff away from the south east, its 1,500-job
Quality Assurance Unit headquarters and laboratories would move from
Woolwich and Bromley to Preston Farm, a 90-acre industrial site in Stockton,
in Cleveland, north east England.
It subsequently said four smaller MoD labs, scattered throughout Britain and
employing 100 in total, would also move.
News of the Pounds 100m relocation was warmly welcomed in Teesside, a high
unemployment area still smarting at the scrapping in 1979 of the Property
Services Agency's proposed move to Middlesbrough. The local authorities saw
the MoD relocation as a way of widening Teesside's economic base.
But in 1990 it became clear the government was having second thoughts due to
increased cost estimates and 'peace dividend' defence spending cuts.
The government-funded Teesside Development Corporation has planning and
marketing powers over the Preston Farm site, formerly occupied by engineers
Whessoe, and now cleared for new industry. As uncertainty over the MoD
relocation dragged on, the TDC lobbied discreetly while the local
authorities appealed to Margaret Thatcher and John Major, dispatched
delegations to London and sent a Why It Must Be Stockton leaflet to hundreds
of MPs and civil servants.
This, said Cleveland County Council, was a 'battle of principle' for the
whole of the North. Teesside's biggest employer, ICI, also became involved,
offering facilities in the area if Preston Farm no longer suited the MoD.
Teesside wanted the project but, as prospects dimmed, its front was far from
united. A bad-tempered rift developed between Cleveland County Council,
which argued the project must be 'saved' for the area, and Mr Devlin, who
was much less enthusiastic, maintaining that if the plan were off it would
be better Preston Farm were released for other uses.
Maybe the government thought it was pouring oil on troubled waters when it
announced in February that, whilst the MoD Unit was now to be merged with
the Defence Research Agency and dispersed among DRA sites in southern
England, Preston Farm was to have a Pounds 7m cheesecake and gateau factory,
creating 700 jobs.
"Absolutely brilliant,' insisted Mr Devlin, then sitting on a slender 774
majority in a three-way marginal seat. 'About one third of these jobs will
be leading edge technology jobs.' He forecast that incoming projects on
other parts of the site meant that it would probably end up with more jobs
than the MoD had offered.
Cleveland county council was unimpressed - 'no way can you compare 700 jobs
at a cake factory with the sort of high quality, technical scientific and
training opportunities which the MoD would have brought,' insisted a
spokesman. The cake factory project, it transpired, was the brainchild of a
flamboyant and controversial Cypriot entrepreneur 'Mr Chris' Liveras. In
1982, Mr Chris started a gateau business in Hartlepool, CDL 44 - his
initials and age at the time - selling out in 1988 to Allied Lyons and
moving back to Cyprus from his Teesside residence, Black Forest Chateau.
But after the Stockton project was announced, it emerged it had originally
been destined for Peterlee, nine miles north of Hartlepool. Lengthy
discussions with County Durham's inward investment agencies had foundered
after the Department of Trade and Industry declined a Pounds 1.8m Selective
Regional Assistance grant, largely because of fears the new gateau plant
might displace jobs at Mr Chris' former Hartlepool factory, still trading
under Allied Lyons.
Angry Durham Labour politicians talked of 'duplicity and political
expediency' - Preston Farm is only three miles further from Hartlepool than
Peterlee, but whilst Peterlee is part of the rock-solid Labour Easington
constituency Stockton South was a Tory-held marginal.
The TDC, funded by the Department of the Environment, not the DTI, declined
to reveal how much of the Pounds 7m being invested in the project was public
money. But it insisted there was no threat to the Hartlepool plant since the
new Livera Foods factory at Preston Farm will be supplying a national and
international market. It also said restrictions placed on new projects by Mr
Chris when he sold to Allied Lyons had elapsed by the time his scheme
reached Stockton. Mr Chris, buoyed up by turning swords into cheesecake,
boldly forecast he would produce up to 75m gateaux annually from his new
plant.
Cleveland County Council, meanwhile, called for a thorough parliamentary
investigation into the cake factory affair. Cleveland, it claimed, had lost
not only the MoD jobs but also 1,000 spin-off jobs, plus 2,200 posts in
another potential civil service project deterred from Cleveland by fears of
possible MoD competition for labour.
Mr Devlin, returned with a 3,369 majority in the general election, claims a
further 1,300 jobs are about to be announced for the site, where Mr Chris'
project still leave 75 acres available. Mr Devlin is lukewarm about
government relocations - 'the north east culture needs to move away from
large-scale state investment towards small private sector investment."
He is pressing the TDC to reveal details of the new companies he claims are
to move onto the site. Cleveland County Council is maintaining a 'we'll
believe it when we see it' stance.
The TDC, for its part, is trying to please everybody by assembling a big
announcement of up to five incoming projects, large and small, at Preston
Farm. An announcement is anticipated next month. But a celebratory
cake-cutting looks unlikely.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (15): Japanese group prepares
for expansion - How Sony, the electronics manufacturer, selected a
purpose-built, 180,000 sq ft headquarters in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE driver's eyes lit up. Crouching lower behind the jolting wheel, our
galumping Land-Rover was magically transformed into a vintage Bentley,
roaring along the strip of weed-strewn concrete.
In a blink it was over, and the ghost of Ascari dissolved back into an
anonymous chauffeur - 'that's the bit everyone likes best,' he murmured, as
if the show was for bored passengers, rather than his enjoyment. But a
slight smile remained around the eyes.
This small crescent of banking is all that remains of the Brooklands circuit
at Weybridge in south-east England, revered during the golden pre-war age of
motor racing.
Even faster fliers took over when Vickers then British Aerospace flattened
the track to make way for its jets. But it, too, has now gone.
The intruding runway could be ripped out if the new owners have their way,
ironically outlived by a few hundred yards of the banking it made redundant.
Brooklands is about to write another chapter in the history of technology
and relocation. Just as cars gave way to aircraft, electronics are now
moving onto the site.
Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment group, has chosen the site
for its new UK headquarters in one of the largest office pre-lets seen on a
British business park.
The deal, involving a purpose-built 180,000 sq ft complex at an initial rent
of Pounds 29 a sq ft, comes as a breath of fresh air for current owner
Trafalgar House which has just bought out British Aerospace's half share in
the 350-acre site.
The recession has dampened enthusiasm for business parks as companies hold
back expansion plans, but Sony proves that some businesses are still in the
market. But only for the right space in the right location.
The Japanese group only moved into new premises at Staines, west of London,
in 1984 and never expected to be ripping up roots again so soon  - 'but life
moves on,' says Mr Malcolm Willings, the deputy managing director.
'We want to have everything under one roof - management, administration,
sales and so on. We need a high level of intercommunication between staff.
'This is why we centralised in Staines. But by early 1990, things had
fragmented again because of expansion.
'We were in four locations and the capacity of those buildings were
strained. We were using up vital training and meeting areas.'
Meanwhile, rent reviews were coming up and decisions had to be made on the
best way to spend money, so a new hunt started.
'We looked at around 60 new places and drew up a short-list, asking
developers for basic designs,' says Mr Willings.
Honing down that list in a market thick with desperate developers was not as
difficult as it might seem.
Firstly, Sony looked no further than commuting distance outside the M25 and
only in the south-western sector running out of London.
"This is where our staff live, and we want to keep them,' says Mr Willings.
Proximity to Heathrow was also important - 'I use it every week'. So was
continued good access to central London, where the bulk of customers are
based.
The site also had to be big enough for expansion - no more unplanned
upheavals because capacity begins to run out again in the late 1990s. Good
surroundings and architecture were essential because the company likes to
project a high quality image.
Several leading business parks fell by the wayside - 'they were either too
big, drowning out individuality, or the designs were questionable,' says Mr
Willings.
'We were really looking for a small park which would provide a presence and
a building which would not look strange or dated in 20 years.'
All the more strange that he chose Brooklands, one of the country's largest
development sites. But Trafalgar House has hived off an area called The
Heights, creating a separate 750,000 sq ft office campus with its own
charisma.
The rest of the site also breaks away from the conventional office park, as
it is given over to housing, industry and retail.
Trafalgar has just sold six acres to Marks &amp; Spencer for a 10,000 sq ft
store next to 85,000 sq ft already being created by Tesco. That means staff
will have somewhere to shop - an important consideration which often makes
workers reluctant to leave town centres.
That part of the park also has 1m sq ft of distribution and industrial
occupiers.
Other factors which helped force Brooklands to the top of the short-list
were Covell Matthews Wheatley's 'ageless' designs and provision for more
than 860 parking spaces - 'they are also well hidden by excellent
landscaping,' says Mr Willings. 'It could so easily have turned out like an
ugly sea of cars.'
The building will be created by Trafalgar for occupation by 550 staff from
the end of next year. They will provide management, marketing and
administrative sales support for Sony's electronic goods, as well as
co-ordination of European television operations.
The company will also take enough land for an extra 50,000 sq ft of offices
when required.
The deal involves a 'very short' rent-free period and includes an option for
Sony to purchase the freehold if it wishes.
'It will enable us to plan into the next century,' says Mr Willings.
Long before then, Trafalgar hopes to enhance Brooklands even further as a
relocation centre. It wants to build another 700,000 sq ft of business
space, an hotel with conference and leisure facilities and lay out a 70-acre
park next to the River Wey.
'Our strategic plan is to create a first-class headquarters business
environment while still providing all the amenities and shopping essential
for a stimulating working environment for high-calibre staff,' says Mr David
Calverley, managing director of Trafalgar House Property.
It would be apt to see a few Bentleys back at Brooklands again - and the
odds are that few managing directors will be able to resist that sliver of
banking as they make for the car park.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (16): A centre for advanced
communications - Northern Ireland now claims to have one of the most
advanced fibre-optic telecom networks in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PERSON dialling directory enquiries in London might be somewhat bemused
these days to find the operator answering in a broad Ulster accent. The
reason is that around 10 per cent of all London directory enquiries, or
40,000 calls per day, are now routed through Portadown, 20 miles outside
Belfast. Thanks to fibre optics, 200 operators in Northern Ireland, linked
to a computer database in Sheffield, can do the job more cheaply and as
efficiently as a similar number in London.
Northern Ireland now claims to have one of the most advanced fibre-optic
telecommunications networks anywhere in Europe. It is one of the chief
selling points that Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board (IDB) is
keen to impress upon visiting business executives curious about relocation
or inward investment in the province.
British Telecom's Pounds 100m investment in the network, which began five
years ago, and is continuing with an additional Pounds 40m per year in
upgrading, has converted all the trunk routes to optic fibres. The system
can thus cope with high density data transmission and conference networking.
A BT spokesman says that the network puts Northern Ireland on a par with
London and other leadinging European capitals 'with the difference that the
network extends throughout the province. No opportunity for inward
investment need be lost for the lack of advanced telecommunications.'
'It cuts away this idea of peripherality,' says Ms Janet McIver the director
of the Northern Ireland Business Centre in London, an IDB marketing arm. She
says that the transfer of 'back-office' data processing activities to
Northern Ireland is now a prime focus of IDB's marketing effort.
'This has been our main success story in the British market and is a very
important and exciting possibility for the future,' she says. Around 1,500
jobs have been created in Northern Ireland in the past two years as a result
of relocation of data processing activities.
Besides BT, the UK's Department of Social Security has relocated its claims
processing to Belfast from its offices in seven London boroughs including
Brixton and Lewisham. Five hundred staff process some 160,000 claims per
week. The passport office is processing nationwide passport applications out
of Belfast.
In the private sector, Nationwide Anglia is processing UK mortgage accounts
out of Northern Ireland, and Prudential Assurance has transferred its UK
life assurance claims processing activities to Belfast.
Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce the chief executive of Prudential Financial Services
says: 'A combination of staff shortages and the fact that we were simply
running out of space at our Reading offices forced us to look for
alternative solutions.'
He adds that the choice of Belfast has been an 'outstanding success.'
Better-qualified staff availability, and low personnel turnover has meant
that the same volume of work is now being handled by fewer employees - 'the
cost of recruitment, induction and on-going training is minimised,' he says.
Computer training begins at an early age in Ulster's schools. Some 500
graduates in computer studies emerge from Ulster's two universities each
year. Together they provide a large pool of computer-literate labour. Ms
McIver says that wage costs in the data processing industry are some 10-20
per cent lower in Northern Ireland compared with UK.
Relocation of manufacturing industry has been less of a success story than
in the services industry, although according to Mr John McGuckian, the newly
appointed chairman of IDB, 'for internationally mobile projects we are
competitive with anywhere.'
Capital grants of up to 30 per cent are available, as well as additional 20
per cent grants in high unemployment areas of Northern Ireland.
Assistance is also available for R&amp;D, training and marketing and certain
relocation costs of staff and Mr MrGuckian says 'we pride ourselves on our
after-sales service. Some of our best envoys have been those that have
already established themselves here.'
AVX, a leading electronic components manufacturer last year chose the port
of Larne in Northern Ireland, as the base for its European distribution
centre.
According to Mr Greg McMahon, AVX's European Distribution Manager, 'far more
important than geography in a distribution operation these days are
management skills - skills in inventory control, in negotiating the most
efficient and economical form of transport, and in meeting the precise
requirements of customers.'
Company executives who have moved from the mainland to Belfast point to the
good schools, cheaper housing, (as much as half the cost of that available
on the mainland), and uncongested roads as well as the variety of outdoor
leisure activities - such as golf, sailing, hill-walking and horse-riding -
that are available within 30 minutes' drive of Belfast.
Their surprisingly sanguine view of the 'troubles' perhaps has something to
do with the police statistics which reveal that the risk associated with
terrorist-related crime in Northern Ireland is substantially less than the
risk of being a victim of violent crime in most cities on the mainland.
Mr McGuckian comments: 'It is true we are a divided community, but enormous
efforts are being made to solve that problem. The reality is that it has
little or no impact on running a successful industry here.'
Trying to convince outsiders of that though is IDB's most formidable task,
and no-one doubts that political stability would provide the 'missing
ingredient' to make Northern Ireland a highly attractive region for
relocation. Fresh hopes for a political solution await the next round of
inter-party talks, due to begin next month.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (14): Motives for moving vary
greatly - Despite financial incentives and prospects of better premises, few
companies move willingly - and some relocate for the strangest reasons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY relocate? Priorities vary considerably between individual companies,
although relocation agencies are fond of listing cost-related reasons why
companies generally choose to move.
The relocation business is full of apocryphal and sometimes true stories of
locations being chosen because the plant manager wanted to be near the sea,
so he could go sailing at weekends. Or allegations that the chairman's wife
wanted to be closer to her family.
'It isn't surprising that the south of France and the Mediterranean coast of
Spain have attracted so many companies in recent years,' says David Rees,
director of Ernst &amp; Young's European Location and Advisory Services, (ELAS).
Some companies, he adds, are not so accommodating in the motives for moving
 -they see relocation as a chance to 'lose the dead wood' and to introduce
fresh working methods with a completely new staff.
Because business relocation is often disruptive and costly in financial
terms and in managements' time, companies rarely relocate willingly - and
generally will only move if forced to do so by cost pressures, lease-expiry,
lack of space for expansion or because of significant changes in company
operations, comments John Siraut, a consultant with the ELAS team in London.
Nevertheless, the strangest reasons for relocating - such as the length of
golf club waiting lists and even the number of swans on a river - are among
light-hearted examples listed by respondents in The Director's Guide to
Relocation Management, just published by the Institute of Directors and
Black Horse Relocation Services, part of the Lloyds Bank group.
'Miscalculations during the relocation process can lead to the loss of key
employees, plummeting morale and escalating costs,' says John Carolan,
managing director of Black Horse Relocation.
"And since the average cost of relocating an employee is around Pounds
14,500, companies really should plan every aspect of their relocation very
carefully indeed.'
But for most companies, relocation is a rare event - often imposed by
unforeseen pressures - and the majority of directors will never before had
to tackle the complex issues involved.
The Blackhorse guide - one of a growing number of publications available
from relocation agencies - offers insights into the project management of
moving to new factories and offices, ranging from finding the right
location; employee assistance and communication; the role of professional
advisors; the legal minefield of redundancy and how to organise the physical
move itself.
Inspite of the upheaval of relocation for businesses, more than 3,600
organisations in the UK, including 1,000 of the largest companies, 17 per
cent reported in a new report that that they have 'firm plans' for
relocation or expansion elsewhere, particularly in the areas of office
accommodation and warehousing.
'Despite the recessionary climate, it is clear that the corporate relocation
market remains very active,' comments Stephen Mallen, head of Research at
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, which carried out the survey, in conjunction with
Stanhope Properties. Among the business sectors which indicated they were
most likely to relocate were energy (17 per cent), transport and
communications (nearly 15 per cent), retailing and catering (14 per cent).
The manufacturing sector remains the least active in relocation (at seven
per cent), while only three per cent of the top 1,000 companies in the UK
say they have plans to take new premises on the European continent - 'the UK
relocation market will continue to be an intrinsically domestic domain,'
comments Stephen Mallen.
Fifty per cent of the UK companies which are considering relocation said
that they hoped to implement their plans in the next 12 months, with a
stronger preference for freehold property, rather than leasehold tenure.
Nearly a third of the companies with relocation plans said that their prime
reason for moving was the poor quality or inadequacy of current premises -
'the main concern is now the quality and suitability of new premises, rather
than its cost implications,' suggests Stephen Mallen.
In another new report, Jones Lang Wootton's review of property confidence
lists the factors influencing the choice of location, in order of
importance. They include:
Accessibility and communications.
Property costs.
Labour availability.
Property availability.
Local environment.
Labour costs.
Image of the company.
Business services available.
Housing costs.
Local housing supply.
Schooling facilities.
Employment for family members.
Cultural, entertainment and shopping facilities.
Regionally, the patterns for relocation vary considerably: in the south-east
of England, where Jones Lang Wootton interviewed more than 650 companies,
employing, in all, 600,000 office workers and occupying over 100m sq. ft of
office space, less than a fifth of the companies expect to take more office.
'Demand for office space in the south-east as a whole is expected to reach
13.8m sq. ft - only half the amount of six months ago,' say JLW analaysts.
Office employment in the region is expected to fall by 3.1 per cent over the
next year. This, they suggest, is equivalent to the loss of 56,000 office
jobs in the south-east.
Nevertheless, business confidence is stabilising, with fewer than 10 per
cent of companies reporting that they are 'less confident.'
Nearly a third of businesses claim they are 'more confident' about the
outlook for their business over the next six months, although companies in
the region appear to have 'narrowed their planning horizons.' The number of
occupiers with property plans extending beyond two years has fallen
significantly.
Companies offering guaranteed house-sale price support to relocating staff
are currently voicing concern over the increasing potential for capital
losses in the weak property market.
In an effort to illustrate the cost-effectiveness of using relocation
agencies to arrange staff housing, Nationwide Relocation has just released
figures to support its claim that using an agency can provide savings of up
to a third, compared with companies which attempt to arranging their own
relocation.
Citing an example of a client seeking to relocate an employee who wants to
sell his house for Pounds 106,000, Nationwide claims it could achieve a 33
per cent saving through using its services.
The agency says it would provide almost a 50 per cent savings to its client
on bridging costs alone. Much of this would be achieved by a substantially
reduced selling period, thus cutting the time for a client to provide a
bridging loan.
On a Pounds 106,000 house, this might work out at around Pounds 6,420,
compared with Pounds 13,780 without using the agency service, assuming that
Nationwide sold the house within seven months, compared to the present
national average of 12 months. The company claims that other savings could
be made on reduced legal fees, removal and survey costs.
In total, it would cost the average business more than Pounds 27,000 to
relocate an employee, including bridging loan, legal fees, surveys and loss
on sale - compared with around Pounds 18,440 by using the Nationwide
services, including fees.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (13): British Gas plans to
relocate 1,300 London staff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is preparing to relocate 1,300 employees from London to a new
300,000 sq. ft headquarters to be built at Birmingham Business Park.
The site was chosen after a detailed examination of potential venues
throughout the east and west Midlands.
The British Gas building, which should be ready by the end of 1994, will be
developed on a 20-acre plot within Arlington's 39-acre business park,
(pictured above and below). Companies moving to the business park in the
last year included Wang, Sema, Severn Trent Water, Bull, Apricot, Charles
Haswell, the Co-op Bank and Hutchison Telecommun- ications.
They joined other companies such as Rank Xerox, Lucas, Digital, Equitable
Life and the West Midlands Development Agency, already located there.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (12): Moving closer to the
customers - Staff relocations are seldom easy, but in a phased move, Norwich
Union's first wave of employees to Sheffield 'has eased the fears of the
waverers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN REGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION'S decision to transfer a large slice of its life and pensions
operation from Norwich to Sheffield was based on both economic and strategic
considerations. However, as with most relocations that are taking place
during this recession, the economic considerations no longer apply with
quite the force they once did.
In the time-lag between the decision to move and the move itself, the
pressures which contributed to the decision have receded. Office rents in
Norwich have fallen substantially over the past 18 months, while in
Sheffield they have actually risen. The difficulty of recruiting skilled
staff, one of the prime factors in the relocation decision, has also been
eased - this time by rising unemployment.
Indeed, the job market has changed so much that the company's initial plan
to recruit most of its Sheffield workforce locally has now been changed.
Most of the 800 jobs involved will now go to those who relocate.
The strategic considerations, however, are unchanged. The company argues
that to service its customers, it needs to be geographically close to them
and a substantial operation in the north has long been seen as desirable.
The relocation involves the transfer of all the life and pensions
administration for the north-east and north-west regions.
The choice of Sheffield as a location was not made as the result of 'a
beauty contest.' Norwich Union had already expanded into the city in the
late 1980s, setting up an operation to service new distribution channels,
such as direct marketing and direct sales. It saw the relocation as an
opportunity to build on this presence.
Detailed planning for the move began in November 1990. It was approached as
a dual-track project management programme, with each region's move being
co-ordinated separately under a core team of senior managers. This approach
means that both regions must co-ordinate activity, if only to sort out
practical matters such as which floors of the new building are to be
occupied by which region. Overall project management is controlled from
Norwich.
The main challenge was to move staff within an 18-month timescale, whilst
keeping fully operational. The fact that there will be some members of staff
 -though fewer than originally anticipated - meant that the option of
transferring within a shorter time-frame did not exist.
The company decided on a phased relocation, using a three-month work cycle.
Sections of the operation are being moved and given time to gel, before the
work is transferred from Norwich. The first sections moved to the city last
July.
At present, the north-east region is half way through its relocation, with
the north-west region due to follow next year. Curiously, the north-east
region is moving temporarily into an existing Sheffield office building.
The eventual home of both regions will be a new 180,000 sq ft complex now
being built on the site of the former Rabone Chesterman tape measure
factory. The company will be a tenant in the scheme at a rent of around
Pounds 14 a sq ft, one of the highest rents ever achieved in Sheffield.
The operation will barely have time to settle before it is uprooted to its
permanent home, yet Martyn James, who is in charge of relocation the
north-east region, sees few difficulties.
'I think moving from Norwich to Sheffield is a great deal more complex than
moving within a city centre. Our next move will be like any other business
moving into new premises,' he says.
During the planning stage, Norwich Union examined several large relocations,
but failed to find anything upon which it could base the project management
of its own move.
'We looked at a lot of relocations, but couldn't find anything that
paralleled our own. As an organisation we are fairly used to moving people
around, so we actually have managers who know about relocation,' he says.
Martyn James acknowledges that one of the most difficult aspects of the move
was the initial task of finding people prepared to relocate voluntarily.
The original idea to take only those with core skills changed with the
recession, and more staff had to be persuaded to relocate.
The company, having told all its staff about the plan, advertised internally
for volunteers. This was followed by a presentation evening in Norwich at
which estate agents and educationalists from Sheffield gave brief
descriptions of the city's strengths. Coach trips to Sheffield were then
arranged to allow staff to discover the city for themselves.
The relocation package which the company already offers some key staff was
extended to all those willing to move north. This included a disturbance
allowance, up to three weeks hotel accommodation, all removal and legal
expenses and, for those with homes to sell, a guaranteed purchaser.
Despite these efforts, James admits a little disappointment at the take up -
'we would have liked more people to have come forward, but Norwich and
Sheffield are very very different places. There were a lot of
preconceptions.'
The phased nature of the move, he says, has helped considerably. The first
wave of relocating staff has eased the fears of the waverers - 'as we get
more people up here, a more positive message begins to get across.'
Thus far, he is delighted with the way the project is progressing and says
there have been few unforeseen problems.
'We always planned to do the move over 18 months, rather than trying to do
too much in one go. What we have tried to do is to start as small as
possible and build up from there.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (10): On schedule and within
budget - Manchester's largest relocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN REGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER gasworks within walking distance of the inner city areas of Moss
Side and Hulme may not seem the most promising site for the British Council,
but it was this site, owned by British Gas, which clinched Manchester's
largest relocation.
The Council examined over 200 potential locations and narrowed the choice
down to four cities: Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and Glasgow. The Manchester
site, Grand Island, is within the area covered by the Central Manchester
Development Corporation and under a complex grant-aided deal allowed the
British Council to tenant a purpose-built headquarters.
The building, known locally as 'The Battleship' because of its grey
exterior, is now complete and houses the British Council's UK operations.
These include the student exchange division, the library and English
language specialists and the division responsible for winning projects from
organisations like the World Bank. There are now around 650 staff in
Manchester, though this could rise to over 700.
The Council had considered relocation, on and off, for the past 15 years but
it was the expiry of a lease on premises off Oxford Street and the seemingly
inexorable rise of London rentals which finally pushed it.
Dr Robert Taylor, the assistant director in charge of the move, admits that
staff are now asking whether the Council would have moved had it realised
that London office rents were about to collapse.
'It's a fair question, but we are in a period when all public bodies are
under pressure to reduce overheads. We will still be saving Pounds 1.6m a
year in Manchester and that doesn't include the Pounds 2m we would have paid
in London,' he says.
Dr Taylor was recalled from Greece to handle the move which has been
project-managed using the Prince methodology, a government-sponsored and
intensely-complicated method of project-management. The initial task was to
set up a series of project boards at different levels to handle specific
aspects of the move. One of the fundamental strengths of the Prince method
is that nobody does anything without telling everybody else.
The British Council main board set up a sub-committee to monitor the
decisions taken by the relocation project. Dr Taylor was then placed in
charge of the various project teams. Five separate project teams were set up
to cover the areas of:
The building.
The move.
Work organisation.
Information technology and personnel.
Each project team had its own project manager and board and had total
responsibility for its particular task.
The 'move' project, for example, was responsible not only for moving people
and equipment from London to Manchester but also for re-arranging the
remaining London operation so that the staff exodus did not affect
continuity.
The 'work organisation' project looked at how best to ensure that there was
continuity of work during the work, while the IT team looked after
telephones and computers. The building project was responsible for
delivering the building on time.
To ensure that the method was working, each project had a quality assurance
team attached. This also allowed progress to be examined objectively.
Constant monitoring and assessment underpinned the methodology. Each project
was divided into stages and sub-stages, at each of which the project team
would meet. There was also a full-time co-ordinator whose job was to examine
the dependencies between the various projects. In total, 16 staff worked
full time on the move, with others participating during the normal working
day.
Dr Taylor believes the method has worked exceptionally well, notably in
giving warnings of possible delay - 'overall, there is a critical path
analysis, and so you know that if one part is holding up the rest, there are
alternatives. This is one of the points of mid-stage assessment,' he says.
'What I've been surprised at is the relative ease with which the move has
taken place. We are still on schedule and within budget.'
Problems occurred when people forgot the methodology: a re-locator bringing
a favourite filing cabinet or desk without telling the people responsible
for ordering office equipment.
Another surprise was the willingness of staff to re-locate. The Council
originally guaranteed that everyone who wanted to move could but working on
the national average in similar re-locations anticipated that only 150 would
take up the offer.
In the event, 350 agreed to move. The removing 300 staff have been recruited
locally from over 4,000 applications - 'we have far exceeded our target
which has meant that continuity has been much easier than it might otherwise
have been,' says Dr Taylor.
The Council set up family trips to the city, paying weekend hotel bills and
laying on coach trips to show housing and schools. It also set up an an
information room and published a newsletter showing how the project was
progressing. The Development Corporation played an active part in this
process.
In retrospect, Dr Taylor believes that job security and Manchester itself
were the two crucial reasons for the high number of re-locators.
'I'm not just being polite to Manchester. We had people telling us that they
had gone on the trip because it was free, but they liked what they saw. In
that sense, Manchester sold itself.' Housing and house prices were also
important, particularly among junior grades who found themselves able to
move from London bed-sits into home-ownership, albeit small homes in less
affluent suburbs.
The Manchester operation is now at the heart of the British Council's
long-term strategic planning. Dr Taylor is bullish about the future: 'I want
the British Council in Manchester not to be just an office block but to
contribute to what goes on in the city. We can't do that in London because,
frankly, no-one's interested in the British Council - it's just one more
organisation.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (11): Royal Armouries will
move to Leeds: There are strong economic arguments for moving historic
treasures from the Tower of Londo - The Royal Armouries found the Leeds case
unbeatable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY

<TEXT>
THE Royal Armouries, the treasure trove which includes Henry VIII's
battledress and an entire suit of armour for an Indian elephant, have been
in the Tower of London for 900 years, so the relocation of part of the
collection was hardly likely to have been characterised by haste.
The story of the armouries began, along with schoolboy history, in 1066. The
search for a new home for part of the collection began 15 years ago, in
response to acute space problems, and is now moving rapidly towards the
planned opening of a new Pounds 35m museum at Clarence Dock, Leeds, in 1996.
The armouries are to follow the trend set by the Tate Gallery, the V&amp;A, the
Imperial War Museum, the Science Museum, and the National Portrait Gallery,
all of which have established provincial 'outstations.' The relocation of a
large part of the 40,000 items in the armouries is the result of complex
push-and-pull factors, the seeds of which were laid in 1489 when a German
visitor asked to be shown round the legendary armouries: the Tower's first
tourist. By the end of the 16th century, curious visitors were part of the
life of the Tower.
Guy Wilson, Master of the Royal Armouries, says that without a move, the
Tower was heading for serious problems by the mid-1990s because of
over-crowding. The armouries is the biggest single organisation housed in
the Tower. Some 73 per cent of the collection is usually in store because of
lack of space and the Crown Jewels are not reaping their full potential
because of the cramped conditions.
While the lack of space dictated 15 years ago that 'outstations' be found
for the collection, government policy, requiring museums to maximise their
earning potential, added momentum for radical change. Changing esthetic
standards meant that building within the Tower had to stop to preserve the
original fabric. Modern expectations in tourist presentation, requiring
audio-visual techniques, could not be used in the context of the ancient
buildings of the Tower.
Originally, a small outstation was set up at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth, to
house artillery but it was found that plans to found another for hunting and
sporting weapons were not viable. It became clear that a large part of the
collection needed to move to provide the critical mass for a major tourist
attraction.
Economic arguments were also powerful. The Royal Armouries could not charge
for admission inside the Tower and its commercial activities were restricted
within a Royal Palace and by competing retail outlets. A strategic study
concluded that earnings at the Tower could be boosted by Pounds 4m per annum
if the arms and armour collection was moved out. Benefits included extra
space for catering facilities and better presentation of the Crown Jewels.
MORI, the research organisation, was taken on to evaluate the market for a
major new museum which would allow 80 per cent of the collection to be shown
to the public at the two existing sites and the new location. MORI found
that the public was 10 per cent more likely to visit a museum based in the
north. It was expected that such a museum could attract 1.3m visitors a year
The Royal Armouries felt that the new museum should be part of an urban
tourist development. The government's efforts to bring about inner city
regeneration could also be harnessed by finding a site covered by a
development corporation. Finally, MORI had indicated that a site beside
water: like Liverpool's Albert Dock, was most likely to maximise visitor
numbers.
While most of the major conurbations in England tried to woo the Royal
Armouries, the clear winner appeared to be Sheffield, which had a strong
added advantage in its historical associations with cutlery and canon
production. The fact that Leeds won the race proves that swift action by a
local community can swing a major location decision.
Leeds Development Corporation spotted a newspaper article indicating that
Sheffield was going to get the Royal Armouries. Stuart Kenny, director of
development and marketing, telephoned the Tower - and the Leeds' bid was
underway.
Leeds felt it was vital to present a united front on the bid as a
significant financial input had to be secured to get the armouries to
abandon Sheffield. Under the umbrella of the existing Leeds Initiative,
which includes the LDC, City Council, Chamber of Commerce, Leeds University
and Polytechnic and government bodies, a financial package was put in place.
The LDC believes it can provide up to Pounds 5m for the relocation: either
through grant or land. The private sector may contribute Pounds 5m - not as
charity - but to secure a foothold in the Clarence Dock development. And
Leeds City Council hopes to provide between Pounds 2m-Pounds 4.5m.
Perhaps more than the proposed financial package, the united front from
local government, business, and the city, secured the trust of the Royal
Armouries. Lord Eden, chairman of the trustees, said: 'We chose Leeds
because of a combination of factors - its central position in the UK; its
excellent communications by road, rail, and air; the unrivalled attractions
of the Clarence Dock site, close to the city centre with its extensive
water-frontage; and the evident commitment and enthusiasm of the various
authorities, educational establishments and business representatives.'
The trustees of the Royal Armouries, and ultimately the government, found
the Leeds case unbeatable.
A creative team has been appointed to design the new museum, which will
include an outside area for jousting and falconry.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (9): Smooth move for National
Grid - Persuading more than 250 families to move from one region to another
was not an easy task, but the relocation has so far gone well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN A small Portakabin alongside a windswept building site, a family with two
children is in search of a cup of tea.
Inside, six cramped but cheerful office workers are putting on the kettle,
chatting to the family and busily tapping into computers.
Behind the small cabin of activity, a grandiose palace of concrete and glass
stands against the grey Coventry skyline: by the end of this summer it will
house 300 or more employees of National Grid who have chosen to relocate
from the electricity company's current London headquarters.
The tea-seeking family are one of those due to move to Coventry this summer
so that the father, a systems operator, can continue in his post. They have
called in at National Grid's information centre to take a break from the
house-hunting.
Where to live is only one of the many concerns on their minds. They have to
find a school for their children, the wife wants to work part-time and they
are apprehensive about leaving behind their family and friends in London.
Persuading more than 250 families to move to the Midlands was never going to
be an easy task. As Mr Raymond Bowker, the relocation manager, says: 'Very
few people out of the total population would choose to relocate because any
change is likely to be a strain on the employee or the family.'
Mr Bowker has been seconded from his own company, Tavistock Relocation
Management, which manages relocations for other companies. His approach to
National Grid's huge project was to concentrate on the practical
difficulties of moving families from one area of the country to another.
Companies have traditionally thrown money at a relocation, he says,
neglecting the need to get partners and families involved.
It was the emphasis on housing, education and getting to know the area, that
he believes helped make the National Grid move a smooth one.
One of the main problems facing the relocation team was how to overcome the
unease created by the announcement of the move among the London-based staff.
Initially, this was done by giving every member of staff (all were offered
the choice of relocation) a binder of information setting out what the
company's role would be in assisting with the practicalities of relocation.
A first hurdle was the general misconception of the so-called 'Black
country' that greeted the announcement of the move, made to staff in the
late summer of 1989.
'There were mixed reactions,' says Mr Bowker diplomatically. 'Especially for
people who had lived in the south east all their lives.'
The company organised a series of coach trips to the area for employees and
their families considering the move. Those who took up the offer were taken
from London in a double-decker coach (children were enticed along with a bag
of 'goodies') and put up in a four-star hotel.
Over the weekend, adults were given conducted tours of the area, visiting
nearby towns and villages like Warwick, Leamington and Kenilworth where they
would perhaps decide to buy houses.
On Sunday morning they explored Coventry and the City's schools and sports
centres.
'We took them through the grotty areas of Coventry too,' says Mr Bowker.
'We didn't want them to think we weren't being objective.'
Meanwhile, the children were kept busy visiting a zoo, the Cadbury's
chocolate factory and Warwick castle.
Back in London presentation evenings were organised to answer fears and
queries and provide more information, a system that helped keep partners
involved.
'This got round the problems that often happens that companies communicate
with employees but don't get through to the families,' says Raymond Bowker.
In addition a monthly publication, and even a series of videos were sent to
the homes of employees considering the move, with information and updates on
the area.
One real concern was leaving behind the London circle of friends and
families, but according to National Grid the outings and presentations went
some way towards easing this problem, by introducing the families to each
other. However, the main areas of concern remained housing and education.
The company employed an education consultant to find suitable schools in the
area and answer queries.
The task was made easier by Warwickshire education authority's good record
and its own active role in providing information and assistance.
For help with housing, National Grid organised a computerised housing data
base - one was placed in the information centre in the London headquarters
while the other was set up in the Portakabin adjacent to the new site.
The data base contained every house that was for sale within half an hour of
the new HQ (roughly 9,000 properties at any one time) and house-hunters were
able to key in their specifications - location, number of bedrooms, detached
or semi, and a price range.
They then received a print out of options that met their requirements.
By looking up the properties on file at the centre, they were able to avoid
traipsing around estate agents.
With all the problems facing the housing market, National Grid introduced a
'Managed Home Sale' service for the employee's existing home.
Under this system National Grid provided the bridging finance, while
Tavistock's relocation team instructed valuers, made all the necessary
financial arrangements, appointed the estate agents, considered the offers
and looked after vacant properties.
They also tried to ensure their employees were in strong purchasing
positions by enabling them to make cash payments for the houses around
Coventry.
'This made them the most favoured applicants,' says Raymond Bowker.
Employees with partners unable to move to Coventry because of their own jobs
in London, were encouraged to find houses between the capital and Coventry,
in towns like Oxford and Milton Keynes.
Families taking time off to look around Coventry were able to use the the
Coventry base not just for the house search, but for maps, information,
somewhere to change nappies, or somewhere to put their feet up.
Furthermore, a small cottage located near the new headquarters was turned
into a comfortable rest centre.
By the spring of this year, some 40-50 families had already made the move.
With National Grid's target date for the opening of the new centre around
the beginning of September, most were expecting to move this summer.
Some temporary office space was taken over to allow some of those as who
moved early to work near their new homes, although some continued to
commute.
In addition to the organised trips, the company agreed to pay all the
'reasonable costs of relocation.'
Bills incurred on individual trips to the area for house and school-hunting
were met as were all the costs of the actual move.
In addition, a cushioning period of just over four years was arranged to
ease families off their London allowances. Employees had the option of
taking the money as a lump sum. Many of those who had survived as one car
families in London but who felt they would need two in the new location took
it up. Employees also got a relocation grant related to their salary and the
size of their family.
Meanwhile, partners who had to sacrifice their London jobs were given the
opportunity to apply for vacancies within the company. An employment
consultant was taken on to give advice for those looking for different type
of work. It is early days to judge the move, but Raymond Bowker says that
without exception, the families who have made it are pleased. Other reports
suggest families believe the the 'quality of life' is higher and an
overwhelming response has been 'the journey to work is so short]'
One employee comments: 'The company has been very positive. No member of
staff has been left 'out of pocket' as a result of the relocation. It must
have been a very costly process.'
'It did all cost money,' reflects Raymond Bowker. 'But we retained good
quality staff - it would have been even more costly to lose them.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (8): New ways to ease stress
 -The psychological impact of relocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr BRYAN TULLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY it is widely recognised that moving home can lead a significant levels
of stress. But planners in the 1950s and '60s were nevertheless surprised
that so many former slum-dwellers pined for their old homes after they had
been relocated to improved housing.
'New town blues' characterised many relocated young families at that time,
although there was plenty of historical evidence of homesickness in other
situations where people were uprooted - for example, in the 17th century,
migrants and soldiers' described maladie du pays, a painful longing to
return home.
Furthermore, Austrian doctors in the First World War found that homesickness
was a significant factor in cases of desertion.
Psychologist Shirley Fisher of Strathclyde University has recently
investigated severe instances of homesickness which can prevent students
finishing their studies. Typical signs of severe homesickness are passivity,
depressed moods and difficulties in concentration.
Thoughts of home or memories of years spent elsewhere intrude persistently
into consciousness. Fisher found that the tendency to habitually use
fantasies about happy times elsewhere, in order to help overcome present
boredom or loneliness, can undermine a person's capacity to improve their
present situation.
Regional and international relocation for work reasons will often involve a
change for entire families. Researchers and experienced management
psychologists indicate that the 'family' is a significant cause of
assignments coming to an end prematurely. Conversely, a poorly-planned
relocation can be a strong contributor to family stress and sometimes even
to its break-up.
An increasing level of expertise - ranging from advice on housing and local
educational facilities to legal issues and counselling - is now available
from the larger business relocation agencies.
These facilities help many families avoid the stress in moving. For example,
when Nissan European Technology Centre planned their move from Sunderland to
Cranfield in 1991, they sought out a relocation company which would address
the stress issues.
Nissan chose Blackhorse Relocation Relocation Services, an offshoot of
Lloyds Bank's Black Horse estate agencies, because of its experience in
preparing people for such life changes.
The question of the 'trailing partner' (see page three) is receiving more
attention in relocations. In a recent study, Miriam Smith of Organisation
Resources Counsellors found that lack of foresight and agreement about what
the relocation is going to entail for the partner or spouse, can lead to
serious conflict later, when it may not be easily resolvable.
Miriam Smith found that relatively few companies were offering planning and
support in this area, although BP is an exception and an acknowledged
pioneer in this field.
A little imagination goes a long way in helping husbands and wives adjust to
a new location. For example, in Cleveland, a consortium of companies has a
joint clearing house for job vacancies and partners' career details.
International relocations involve the additional problems of cross-cultural
adjustment. Premature terminations of such postings are very costly in both
human and financial terms. Most people experience an initial 'honeymoon'
period of great interest and excitement, but as time passes, the 'loss' of
old friends and activities, together with new local frustrations, create
feelings of disappointment and doubt as to whether 'the big move' was really
worthwhile.
Personal suitability for making a success of international relocations
requires maturity, social skills and appropriate cross-cultural awareness.
Supportive social networks will then grow and foster both self-development
and increase cultural learning. These are the benefits for those who make
the best of their international assignments.
There are often other problems for families who relocate abroad, and then
move back to their original base, since 'repatriation' is not always easy.
Expatriates, who were known historically as 'exiles,' return to find that
they have missed significant developments in the lives of friends and
family. Having not shared in these events, former expatriates often report a
feeling of dislocation from the lives of their old friends.
Not everyone will make a success of relocation, so it is worthwhile making
early evaluations and preparation. We are talking here of an individual's
qualities, rather than qualifications.
Many relocation agencies have developed an awareness that husbands and wives
are not always 'on the same wavelength' about an intended move. According to
Carla Roundell-Greene of People and Property, it is important to understand
the social implications of moving to particular locations in order to
satisfy a particular housing need.
And how far can a prosperous, middle-aged couple with adolescent children
sustain initiatives to build social networks, when for a decade or more they
have enjoyed easy reciprocity with long-established friends and close
relations? Do they want to live within a corporate neighbourhood with
ready-made colleague/friends, - or as far from that as possible?
Providing realistic job/relocation previews is a wise course. Europeans
posted to busy and exotic locations - such as Hong Kong or Tokyo - have
sometimes suffered panic attacks in such densely populated and unfamiliar
urban environments.
Evaluating employees for likely success for an overseas posting can save a
lot of grief. Businesses with North American connections such as RHR
International - the firm of consulting psychologists - and PRlcoa Relocation
Management, a subsidiary of Prudential of America, which also offers
psychological advisory services, are aware of the legal and political
sensitivities of probing into employees' private lives. They offer the
family an opportunity to review their position within a confidential
counselling session, so that the family itself raises the crucial issues.
The outcome of this, according to Robert Brown, director of consulting at
PRlcoa, is that clear suitability may or may not be established, but the
particular training or support systems which will be needed to make a
success can be undertaken. As an aid to this, Brown uses a validated
psychometric instrument, the 'overseas assignment inventory.' He is careful
not to allow this to be used as a 'Go' - 'don't go' flag, but rather to help
the employee, the family and the employer see how a good judgment can be
made in complex circumstances.
Hambro Countrywide Relocation have now added a 24-hour 'stress counselling
service' to its relocation package for corporate clients. Occupational
psychologist Dr Tony Munton, a research fellow with the Medical Research
Council, says that 'people's attitude to the whole relocation operation in
influenced by the personal touch.
'However generous the financial package, the employee will not be grateful
unless he is helped to sort out the problems of new schools for children, a
job for the spouse and the possible pyschological fall-out from the stress
of the move.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (6): The scientific approach
 -The Japanese manufacturer, Pioneer, applied rigorous economic criteria in
its search for a European production location
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Pioneer Electronic, the hi-fi manufacturer, to invest Pounds
20m in a new factory at Wakefield, West Yorkshire, provides an insight into
the scientific approach to international industrial location.
A recent Institute of Directors survey in the UK found some companies
choosing a relocation site on the basis of golf club waiting lists and the
number of swans on a river: the Japanese approach is slightly different.
The story of Pioneer's move to Wakefield is one of careful strategic
planning providing the corporation's main board with a series of viable
options. But refreshingly the final choice may well have hinged on human and
cultural factors.
Pioneer wanted to be in Europe ahead of the 1992 Single European Market. In
many ways their investment in factories like Wakefield was risk capital
against the possibility that the EC would construct trade barriers around
'Fortress Europe.' Pioneer also wanted to expand in the midst of their
market.
For five years from the mid-1980s, Pioneer sent out an international study
team to look at European options. Enquiries to the UK for potential sites
would have been fielded by the Investment in Britain Bureau and the
Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency. A second study team followed in
1989 to look at options in Yorkshire and Humberside and the UK's only other
continental rival: Barcelona.
Mr Zenkichi Igarashi, managing director of Pioneer Electronics Technology
(UK), explains the final choice: 'We chose Wakefield because of its
location, communications and workforce. If you draw a circle of a 300 km
radius around Wakefield, all our component suppliers in Scotland, Wales, and
the Midlands fall within that circle.
'Our Wakefield site is on the M62, half way between the interchanges with
the M1 and the A1, and so our suppliers can reach us in short time periods
and we can export our products through the Humber ports easily.
'The site is also adjacent to Port Wakefield and we hope to use the rail
freight terminal to export our finished goods through the Channel tunnel. We
also have good air links to Europe through Leeds/Bradford Airport and can
reach London in two hours by train.'
Wakefield's accessibility to suppliers appears to have been decisive as
Pioneer's goods must be 40 per cent value-added within the EC to count as
'Made in Europe.' The labour market factor also meant that Pioneer was
looking for a location away from competing Japanese inward investors:
Wakefield's hinterland has few competitors for Pioneer's light engineering
skills.
No financial inducements were offered to Pioneer to come to Wakefield, but
the role played by the metropolitan district council certainly helped force
Barcelona into second place. They provided an information answer-service for
Pioneer which always beat a 24-hour deadline.
Ms Amanda Spalding, acting deputy chief economic development officer, says
that on one occasion she rushed to Leeds with information on prevailing
winds at the Wakefield site and 'gatecrashed' a meeting of the Pioneer study
team. Interestingly, Japanese companies often require extensive written
submissions which are thoroughly double-checked - while US companies often
ask for condensed options.
Once inside the meeting, she had a unique glimpse of 'consensus'
decision-making as the team discussed, in Japanese, the various Yorkshire
and Humberside sites and then voted on various aspects of them: location,
workforce and so on. They then flew to Barcelona.
Having discovered that the group was staying in the Hotel Sofia (by faxing
all hotels of that name in the region]), Wakefield's team persisted in
providing prompt information faxed to Spain.
Once the final decision was made by the main board in Tokyo, it was swiftly
converted into a major investment with room for expansion. The Five Towns
Resource and Teaching Centre was made available for the project group. A
company was formed in May 1990, the building occupied (on a Green Belt site)
on June 3, 1991, and production began on August 12 1991.
In retrospect, the company admits that purely economic locational factors
were bolstered by cultural ones: English is Japan's second language and
clearly this factor also helped edge Barcelona from the field. An
Anglo-Japanese Saturday School has been set up in Leeds for the children of
relocated executives and managers and an Anglo-Japanese Society is being set
up with the help of the YHDA.
Of the 240 people working at the Wakefield site, only seven are from Japan:
two directors and five managers. All were offered relocation packages and
most brought their families with them to West Yorkshire. Next month the
workforce should jump a further 60 and the final target is 700.
Production thresholds have been met and the workforce has proved a success
with the new Japanese managers. Senior staff recruited in Yorkshire were
taken to Japan for two training courses. Communications have proved
excellent although the current public inquiry into the opening of Port
Wakefield, close to the Pioneer site, has thrown a shadow over links with
the Channel tunnel.
The only problem appears to be the factories' image of growth and
profitability which has focussed interest locally on the first round of wage
negotiations at the Wakefield plant where a single-union deal was struck
with the EETPU electricians union after a 'beauty contest,' including four
other unions. The company would point out that if low wages had been a
crucial location factor, they would have chosen Barcelona.
The recession has obviously tempered Wakefield's short-term potential for
expansion, but the site offers radical growth opportunities with just
100,000 square feet of production area on 30 acres. Production now includes
tuners, CD players, and mini-systems. Stereo radio tuners production was
relocated to Wakefield from Belgium.
Pioneer applied rigorous economic criteria to their search for a European
site tempered, when the choice was narrowed to two, by cultural and human
factors. The economist Losch said: 'The question of the best location is far
more dignified than determination of the actual one.' In Pioneer's case the
two were nearly identitcal.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (7): In staff moves, no two
cases are the same - As Royal Mail employees relocate from London to nine
new regional divisions, executives discover that there is no such thing as a
mass exodus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN

<TEXT>
ROYAL MAIL knows a thing or two about moving around the country. It handles
60m pieces of mail a day, and faced with a need to restructure its letter
business and move staff out of London to nine new regional divisions
including the capital, it had to apply its specialist knowledge to its own
staff.
The decision to cut its London headquarters staff to 140 from 2,000 and
create regional divisions is the result of identifying a need to become more
responsive to customers and to create a new management structure under Royal
Mail's Business Development Plan. A total of 600 staff are in the process of
moving to the new regions - Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham,
Gloucester, Chelmsford, Brighton and Reading.
The choice of the new centres was dictated in part by the natural
geographical regions of the country. However, other factors played a part in
the decision, including consideration of properties already owned by Royal
Mail. For example, the decision to site the south-west region in Gloucester
was in part influenced by the fact that the company already owned an old
training college in the city, which could be converted. Similarly, an unused
property in Brighton helped pinpoint the town as headquarters for the
south-east division.
The staff moves are being co-ordinated by an in-house team headed by Ms
Angela Colyer, equal opportunities development and training manager, whose
responsibility it is to deal with the human side of relocation.
The team was drawn from Royal Mail's personnel department, which itself has
already moved from London to Croydon and faces a further move to
Chesterfield in Derbyshire under the business development plan.
The team has its own budget, and works under its own logo and the slogan 'A
First-Class Way to Move.'
'Staff were told of the plans in December 1990,' says Ms Colyer. Each member
of staff was assessed and asked to indicate their preferences on willingness
to move and locations they would be prepared to go to, as well as being
asked if they would like to change jobs once the scheme moved into action.
'There was some unhappiness about the relocation scheme,' says Angela
Colyer, who herself has moved to Croydon, and faces the further move to
Chesterfield. She quotes her own experience of hearing the news from her
line manager and then breaking the news to her husband, who was initially
opposed to moving.
However, it was thanks to help from National Startpoint, a
Staffordshire-based independent relocation consultancy, that her husband,
who ran his own construction business, was won over.
National Startpoint, owned Mr John Poole, exists to help companies with
relocations such as Royal Mail's; its other clients have included Barclays
Bank, British Coal and IBM. It produces guides about areas which include
statistical details about population and business to advice on which areas
to avoid when looking for houses.
'Their guides are very good,' comments Ms Colyer. They encompass details of
just about anything someone moving to a new area might need to know. This
includes details of the local road networks and public transport, as well as
central offices and services such as electricity, gas and water, Citizens
Advice Bureaux, and health services. They also cover details on local
entertainment facilities, including sports, theatres, cinemas as well as
local radio stations and newspapers.
Residential areas are also covered, including information on noise levels
and pollution, traffic levels and congestion, as well as the 'social
desirability' of areas, as Mr Poole puts it.
The decision to use National Startpoint was taken after Royal Mail came into
contact with the company at a Confederation of British Industry relocation
conference early last year. Although the company offers many services
including presentations to employees and specific research on sites, Royal
Mail decided to use only its core service of information guides. These are
produced from National Startpoint's computer database.
Staff proposing to move to the new centres had to make their own
arrangements to visit the areas, says Ms Colyer, although they could claim
hotel accommodation and travel costs for their families.
Angela Colyer says that one of the things the team had to do when
considering moves for families was to update the concept of the family -
'instead of the old married/single definition, we changed it to
accompanied/alone,' she says. This broader definition takes on board
one-parent families, divorced parents, families with other dependents
including older relatives and single-sex households.
The team also had to cope with the problems faced by staff of selling
property in the midst of a recession - 'obviously we couldn't reimburse
losses, but we could help with interest-free loans,' adds Ms Colyer. Other
problems faced by staff included the timing of moves to fit in with
children's schooling, which the team coped with by scheduling moves for
those affected in school holidays.
Finding appropriate schools for children is part of the service offered by
National Startpoint, a service which Angela Colyer and her family is taking
advantage of. Her potential move to Chesterfield means that her two
children, aged nine and six, have to move schools. As a result of the NS
guides, she and her husband are 'looking at village schools'.
Royal Mail expects to complete its relocation early next year. A total of
400 have already made their moves or are in the process of moving, and the
team will be kept busy with the remaining 200 staff. On the whole, Angela
Colyer believes, the move is going well. However, some lessons have been
learned from the experience - 'I would like to have more staff in a
relocation team,' she says, 'and I would like them to have had a training in
counselling.'
All members of the relocation team were drawn from personnel, and had
experience of the kind of contact with people the task demanded, but Angela
Colyer believes that a trained counsellor would have been a valuable
addition.
Also, says Ms Colyer, she has learnt that moving 600 people is not 'a mass
move', but that every case has to be looked at individually. 'People have
mortgages, pets, grannies, aunties, children and husbands, and they all have
to be taken into consideration. No two cases are the same.'

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (4): The great London exodus
is faltering - Plunging property costs are dazzling the most determined
movers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON

<TEXT>
MORE than 35 companies left London last year, carrying off almost 14,000
jobs, but the trend appears to be slowing down.
This indication will came as a welcome relief to the beleaguered property
industry. Already swamped by empty offices, it can ill afford to see extra
space vacated. But more pain is inevitable, as another 25 moves are
scheduled this year and a further in 1993, according to the authoritative
annual study on office decentralisation by Jones Lang Wootton Consulting &amp;
Research. That will put almost 2m sq ft of space on the market - more than 1
per cent of the total stock.
What central London loses on the swings, others hope to gain on the
roundabouts. Markheath, the property developer, appeared cock-a-hoop after
finding that another 145 of the capital's top companies aimed to move over
the next three years. But then it has its 600,000 sq ft King's Park
development in central Stevenage to promote, despite the fact that JLW says
businesses are increasingly looking outside the South-east.
One might wonder, however, why anyone is moving nowadays. Occupation costs
have always been cited as the main reason why companies tear up roots. It
remains the central force behind more than 60 per cent of current moves
investigated by JLW.
Yet property prices have collapsed in the last couple of years. Central area
prime rents are around half the 70 peak touched during the boom and
landlords are clamouring to unload second-hand space for much lower figures
as 20 per cent of offices stand empty.
Sedgwick Group, for instance, is offering its 165,000 sq ft headquarters in
Aldgate High Street on the eastern City fringe for 15 a sq ft, fixed for 10
years. Others are asking a nominal rent just to escape the burden of uniform
business rate and to keep out squatters. So why are companies still leaving?
The main reason is that current moves were planned two or three years ago
when vacancy rates averaged only five per cent and rents were increasing by
as much as 30 per cent a year. In 1987, London was four times as expensive
as Birmingham and five times more than Bristol, Birmingham and Manchester.
'It was not difficult for companies to decide the time was right to leave,'
Mr Michael Strong of Richard Ellis told a recent Financial Times seminar.
By the end of last year the picture was very different. Discounting wage
variations, the cost of keeping a worker in London averaged Pounds 9,000
compared with Pounds 3,000 in Bristol and Pounds 4,000 in the other centres.
On the face of it, that still justified relocation - but for one important
fact: the housing slump. The CBI calculated in 1990 that relocation costs
average at Pounds 12,000 per worker. That does not, however, take account of
bridging finance required where a member of staff cannot sell their home -
pretty much the norm nowadays. Borrowing Pounds 100,000 for up to a year can
double moving costs, says Mr Strong. Compensation for any price shortfall in
the worker's house adds even more to the bill.
'It is not uncommon for the cost of relocating an employee to be as much as
Pounds 40,000 - or even more when moving to a higher cost area,' he said.
That means a job moved to Bristol could cost between Pounds 25,000 and
Pounds 40,000 for the sake of saving no more than Pounds 6,000 a year.
Some movers, of course, are happy to shed staff and pick up local people to
fill their new office, so the economics vary widely. Most, however, aim to
maintain a core of executives - who incidentally will be the most expensive
to move because they live in more expensive homes.
Personnel considerations are becoming more important than mere bricks and
mortar, according to Rob Harris, research director of Stanhope Properties.
Most long-distance movers are more concerned with saving staff than cutting
rents. Only within the M25 do they seem to concentrate on cost-saving.
Debenham Tewson Research points out that 'prime factors driving firms to
relocate remain those of expansion and operational efficiency rather than
the need to cut costs,' while Markheath's investigations found that close to
a third of London's intended movers were spurred by inadequate premises.
Another 15 per cent were escaping the impact of congestion on staff morale.
This all serves to blur the seemingly clear-cut relationship between
occupation costs and relocation. It also contradicts an equal amount of
research showing that costs are the main spur to moves.
The explanation may be that rising bills are only noticed when buildings and
their surroundings pass a threshold of discomfort and inefficiency. Even
when rents are falling and space is plentiful, companies might decide the
old place is still poor value. Add to this the poor quality of life in
central London and a new home appears enticing, no matter what the
comparative figures say. This makes predictions of the impact on property
markets difficult and dangerous. Mr Strong believes private sector moves
will slow to a trickle and government moves slow over the next few years.
This introduces a new and even more unpredictable factor - politics. Civil
servants are front runners by a mile in the latest surge of decentralisation
because of a government committed to shifting staff out of the south-east.
This was planned to take advantage of lower provincial wages and boost the
regions at far less expense than development grants.
Big moves are still under way. The Inland Revenue, for instance, is
decamping to the East Midlands and the Department of Health is off to Leeds.
But that has not stopped the latter from snapping up Ake Larson's 200,000 sq
ft development on London Road, SE1 - reputedly for well under 15 a sq ft.
The Defence Ministry has also cancelled relocation of 1,600 jobs to
Cleveland, deciding instead on a broad distribution across southern England.
On the other hand, Michael Heseltine is ready to flex his muscular views on
regional development at the Department of Trade, so costs may not enter the
equation.
Much of this hypothesising depends on companies acting logically, however -
a rare commodity when most still refuse to take buildings seriously until a
crisis looms.
'The head of property can be six layers or more down from the chief
executive,' says Stanhope, drawing on research commissioned from Hillier
Parker and PMA.
When relocations do take place, most decisions are rushed - and often
botched - because no-one has clearly thought out what they want. Only a
minority even carry out proper investigations about whether to move. Then
they give too much weight to initial rents, rather than considering factors
such as fitting out and long-term operating costs of new premises.
For this reason alone, the relocation tide may ebb over the next few years,
as London's plunging costs dazzle the most determined movers. Whether they
choose the right buildings is another matter - but at least some developers
will look a little happier than of late.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (5): Predicament of the
trailing partner - It can no longer be assumed that the wives of male
employees will automatically fall into line with relocating companies' plans
/ The issue of spouses' jobs is now more important
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KAREN DILLEY found herself as a 'trailing spouse'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the unattractive term used in the relocation business - when her husband
John recently had to move from the Midlands to the south-east coast for his
job.
A well-qualified secretary who had never been short of work back in Market
Harborough, she was shocked to find there was no job for her near her new
home in Hastings. She went from agency to agency for a month and then rang
her old employers. They said she could resume work on Monday morning and
that was enough to decide her. Mrs Dilley returned to Market Harborough
without her husband and went back to work.
The separation was not as serious as it might at first appear: Mr Dilley, a
trainer for Emap, the publishing group, had been posted to Hastings for just
six months and his company paid for him to travel back to Market Harborough
each weekend. Nevertheless, the strain on the couple was considerable -
surprisingly perhaps, the stress was worse for him than for her.
Mrs Dilley says she is 'one of the world's copers' and, unlike her husband,
was on her home territory, doing familiar work. Mr Dilley, meanwhile, was in
strange surroundings and, at the end of each busy week, was faced with a
long drive. His six-month stint has since been completed and they are now
re-united.
The predicament the Dilleys faced is increasingly common. The 'cornflake
family' of television advertisements - with a Dad who goes to work and Mum
who stays at home - is now comparatively rare. Women make up nearly 50 per
cent of the workforce and just 14 per cent of women fulfil the traditional
role of looking after their children full time. Few working couples can
afford to give up a chunk of the family income.
It can no longer be assumed, therefore, that the wives of male employees
will automatically fall into line with relocating companies' plans. Nor can
it be assumed that female employees will refuse to relocate because of their
husbands' jobs: the 'trailing' male is not the unusual figure he once was.
Organisations are aware of these trends. According to a survey carried out
by the Confederation of British Industry, 73 per cent of companies consider
that the issue of spouses' work has inhibited relocation plans; nearly half
agree that employees have refused to relocate because their partners would
have had to give up their jobs.
Mr Jim McCredie, from KPMG Management Consulting, says theissue of spouses
is now of such significance that relocation plans may be scuppered entirely
by the prospect of losing staff. One example he gives is of a semi-public
sector organisation - a quango - for which he carried out a relocation
feasibility study. The study showed the quango would have saved a great deal
of money by moving out of London and, operationally, the organisation would
have suffered little from the shift.
However, the study also revealed that up to 80 per cent of the staff might
have refused to move, chiefly because of their spouse's jobs. Says Mr
McCredie: 'For the money that was going to be saved, it was not worth the
risk they could lose so many people.'
The quango had a very high proportion of professional employees -
professionals are more likely than other groups to have professional
spouses, unwilling to ditch their careers.
According to Mr McCredie, seven or eight years ago the bulk of relocating
companies were organisations, like banks and insurance companies with high
numbers of clerical and administrative workers. These companies were
prepared, even keen, to lose employees because they could be hired more
cheaply at the new location.
In recent years, however, improved communications have meant that companies
staffed by professionals have formed a greater proportion of relocating
companies - the issue of spouses' jobs has therefore become of even greater
importance.
While the CBI survey found employers are aware of these trends, it also
highlighted the fact that few companies have formal policies for helping
spouses as part of their relocation packages. Just 9 per cent have formal
policies - of these, 30 per cent offer financial compensation and 70 per
cent give practical assistance such as career counselling, help with finding
a job and assistance with CVs.
A greater number of employers - more than 40 per cent - are prepared to
offer help to spouses informally, according to the CBI.
Again, practical help is the most popular, with 55 per cent providing job
search assistance, 33 per cent career counselling, and just 4 per cent
financial assistance.
According to Ms Sue Shortland, manager of the CBI's employee relocation
council, compensation for loss of earnings remains rare because it is seen
as too short-term a measure and no substitute for a spouse finding a job. In
the few companies where money is paid, it is likely to be equivalent to
three to six months of spouses' former salaries. Says Ms Shortland: 'More
common is help in identifying spouses' potential and converting skills.'
As far as the actual guarantee of a job is concerned, most organisations
will not want to get involved unless they themselves are also the employer
of the spouse. Marks and Spencer, for example, says it will always try and
provide suitable jobs for partners of relocating M and S staff - but only if
they already work for the company.
However, most organisations will want to stick to fairly basic practical
help, such as providing information packs about the new locality, so that
spouses can do their own research into local employment opportunities, says
Ms Celia Baxter of KPMG Management Consulting.
'Lots of companies don't want to get involved beyond providing a financial
package and trying to ensure a house-move that's as disruption-free as
possible. It's often cleaner for them not to make promises they can't
deliver later on,' she says.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (3): It pays to be choosy -
Relocation companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JUDGING from the small ads in the property columns of local newspapers,
there are hundreds of specialist firms eager to help companies and their
employees relocate. Do not be fooled. Many are small, under-employed, local
builders more than ready to fill in the empty hours house-sitting and
showing prospective buyers over a property for an absent owner. The bulk are
perhaps redundant or pregnant estate agents, 'keeping their eye in' while
working from home.
Professional nationwide specialist assistance is available, however, on a
scale large enough to cope with a large company headquarters move. In the
last three years, two trade associations have even sprung up: the CBI
Employee Relocation Council, with more than 200 members, half drawn from
corporations, half from removals companies and relocation agencies; and the
Association of Relocation Agents with 300 members specifically dealing with
employers.
Six or seven groups dominate the field: market leader is widely thought to
be Black Horse Relocation Services, an offshoot of Lloyds Bank's Black Horse
estate agencies, with nine years experience; next, thickly bunched, come
Nationwide, Hambro Countrywide and Hamptons, the estate agents; and finally,
two with US parentage - PRIcoa Relocation Management, a subsidiary of
Prudential of America which took over the worldwide realty interests of
Merrill Lynch some three years ago, and PH Home Equity which continues to
specialise primarily in trans Atlantic relocations.
Each of the six would argue that its particular approach and techniques sets
them apart from the rest, but the similarities are more striking than the
differences. And these are determined by the complex range of problems to be
solved in a company move.
In today's depressed housing market, for instance, there is widespread
agreement that the traditional techniques of putting employees up in a hotel
until they sell their old homes, or alternately providing a bridging loan
are no longer practicable.
Bridging loans result in horrendous bills for the employer as employees lack
the motivation to sell their old properties in a falling market. Hotel
accommodation means money bleeding out of the business at upwards of Pounds
30 a head per night, in addition to the disruption to the employee's family
life.
The leading relocation agencies today offer a variation of the scheme
described by Michael Lansley, managing director of Hambro Countrywide
Relocation: 'We arrange for two valuations of the old home and buy the
property at a price midway between the two, leaving the employee with the
benefit of becoming a cash purchaser. Any profit goes to the employee; any
loss is made good by the employer.'
The funds, in Hambro Countrywide's scheme, come from Barclays Bank at
typically 0.75 to 1.75 points above LIBOR compared with the usual bringing
loan premium of four points over base rate. The employer, needless to say,
services the interest charges. (In some other schemes, the employer provides
all the funds, but the principle is the same.)
The relocation specialist then actively markets the property while
maintaining it in good order, keeping the garden tidy and carrying out any
essential repairs. During 1991, even at the bottom of the property market,
Mr Lansley says that his company took an average of four to five months to
sell properties bought under the scheme - much faster than most individual
home owners have managed in this market. HC's advantage is a network of
2,000 estate agents nationwide, including its own 470, on whom it can exert
direct pressure.
Like Hambro Countrywide, PRIcoa strongly emphasises the need for
regionalised marketing to exert effective pressure on local estate agents as
well as to provide the large number of other local services involved in a
move of several hundred families. As might be expected from a US-owned
operation, PRIcoa makes a special feature of helping spouses rebuild their
careers in a new location by offering guidance on job applications,
interview techniques or the pool of potential new employers nearby.
Michael Tagg, the national sales manager, also emphasises the importance of
what personnel managers call 'education counselling.' One family may want to
move immediately to settle children into new schools; another might want
their offspring to complete exams in a familiar school before moving.
No wonder corporate moves are such a lengthy process. Two to three years is
not uncommon in PRIcoa's UK experience, which, under one name or another,
spans just over 20 years. Eighteen months ago PRIcoa was appointed by Conoco
UK to help the oil company move its headquarters and 600 staff from London
to Warwick. The exercise, which involved a special management task force, is
still going on.
In 1989, PRIcoa helped HJ Heinz move 200 employees from Hayes Park, west
London to Wigan. At the time the key challenge was to reassure employees
worried that they might never be able to re-enter the London property market
in the future. By the time all had moved (in the first half of 1991) the
price differentials had been somewhat eased by the savage fall in housing
values in the south-east.
Other problems arise where the company is moving from a low cost to a
high-cost housing area. There too, specialist advice is useful for the
employer. The Inland Revenue permits employers to assist employees
financially to move to similar properties in the new area, but the
assistance cannot be paid as a lump sum and must be spread over a period of
years on a declining scale. The complexities of the regulations call for
professional interpretation.
Professionalism will be even more at a premium as the European Single Market
tempts more companies to relocate operations outside their country of
origin. Most of the leading relocation specialists are busy at present
building up a network of professional contacts across Europe in order to be
able to offer the same local expertise as they do at home where they offer
panels of solicitors, estate agents and mortgage providers to help incoming
employees find a new home.
Despite the solid case to be made out for the specialists' relocation
skills, only 20 per cent of companies who move use their services. Whether
this suggests great growth potential in the field may become clear within a
couple of years of the Single Market.
It may instead fuel the growing diversification of the big six accounting
firms away from their traditional auditing and accounting base. For each of
them offers a strategic relocation advisory service through their management
consultancy arms.
At present, companies tend to appoint, say, Price Waterhouse or Touche Ross,
as project managers to monitor the specialist relocators. With increasing
experience of the subject, however, the management consultants may feel
confident of carrying out the secondary role themselves. But that is a story
for another day.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (2): How financial packages
ease the burden - Moving home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR GUILD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVING managers can be an expensive business. It is estimated that more than
Pounds 4bn is now tied up in bridging finance alone on 35,000 unsold houses
throughout the UK. But companies are also becoming aware of the affect such
delays in selling a home can have on the performance of staff once they have
moved, particularly if they are having to meet the interest on bridging
finance.
The type of relocation package on offer varies greatly. Of the 120,000 moves
sponsored each year by companies, 50,000 are fully sponsored, including
bridging finance, while the remaining 70,000 are unbridged, with other kinds
of corporate assistance.
But with the cost of bridging on a Pounds 100,000 home over 8 1/2 months
with interest rates at 12.1 per cent adding up to Pounds 8,600, the
proportion of fully sponsored moves is falling.
Increasingly, companies are now providing relocatees with more financial aid
towards the direct costs of moving home, such as legal fees, temporary
accommodation and removal expenses.
That assistance ranges from five to 50 per cent of salary. It is being
extended by companies to groups which previously did not qualify, such as
junior managers, technicians and graduate recruits, just to attract and
retain key staff. The CBI estimates that the average cost per employee-move,
even without bridging finance, is Pounds 13,000.
It has been estimated that the cost to a company of fully subsidising a move
could be as high as Pounds 30,000 if bridging interest, loss of value and
other costs such as maintenance repair and insurance payments are taken into
account. On 20 properties with an average value of Pounds 150,000, the
annual cost would be Pounds 500,000.
In rehousing staff, Nationwide Relocation claims that by using an agency,
savings of up to a third can be made, compared with companies which attempt
their own housing relocation, (see page 8: motives for moving).
Given the difficulties and expense of managing moves, particularly in the
present property market, some companies are choosing to use the services of
relocation specialists.
Britannic Assurance dealt with relocation in-house until 1989. It provided
relocating employees with interest-free bridging finance, freeing them from
the need to synchronise sale and purchase, but leaving all marketing and
selling of properties to employees to arrange.
Empty houses, vacated but unsold, incurred mounting costs. Employees were
unable to oversee the selling of their old home and the company was unable
to control the marketing of the property in a volatile property market.
Britannic consulted the CBI's employee relocation council, and enlisted the
services of two specialists relocation bureaux.
A relocation scheme was introduced for all staff from assistant managers
upwards. Empty homes - 'orphans' - which had been receiving bridging finance
for 12 months, were reviewed at the end of that period and considered for
inclusion in the scheme.
'The management and disposal of orphan cases was a major factor in our
decision to use specialist assistance,' says Glenn Hanson, Britannic's
assistant agency manager. 'There was the obvious cost of bridging finance,
but there was also the issue of control. Before deciding to use a bureau we
had limited control; now we have total control.'
After a 12-month trial between two relocation specialists, Britannic
appointed PHH Homequity as sole provider.
'Establishing a good working relationship with the bureau was particularly
important, as the scheme meant changes in an area which had traditionally
been managed in-house. An additional critical factor was PHH's willingness
to provide a relocation package tailored to our needs. There has been a
significant reduction in the number of relocation homes on our books, saving
substantially on the costs of bridging finance.'
A relocatee's house is assessed by at least two, often three, independent
professional valuers contracted to PHH, and a guaranteed offer made to the
relocatee.
This offer is the total bridging loan advance guaranteed by the employer to
the employee to enable him to purchase a new home, based on what the
property is realistically expected to fetch in the prevailing market
conditions.
If the relocatee rejects the guaranteed offer, the company will not provide
bridging finance. The guaranteed offer is effectively a minimum selling
price while the employee may actually achieve more.
PHH group companies manage 40,000 transactions worldwide each year. Of the
10,000 units currently managed by PHH in the UK, 4,000 are relocations, and
80 per cent of those are individual career moves, rather than wholesale
relocations. However, it is also tendering for three government department
moves.
'A house might fetch Pounds 105,000 if you hold out for seven months, but in
the meantime, it might require Pounds 2,000 of maintenance and incur seven
months' bridging interest. Or, it might sell for Pounds 98,000 in one month
and require Pounds 100 of maintenance.
'That is what we are managing, using our experience, local market
information, computer-modelling based on thousands and thousands of cases.
'If we find something in the valuation report which would make the house
unsaleable, then we advise the company not to purchase. We are risk
managers.'
'We were rather surprised at the number of houses which needed work done on
them before they could be marketed,' says Glenn Hanson. Early disclosure of
such problems has meant that the cost of remedial work can be reflected in
the guaranteed offer, or that the employee is asked to complete the work
before the offer is made.
PHH, which manages both bridged and unbridged home-sales, claims to achieve
prices in the range of 95 per cent and 105 per cent of open market value.
To ensure it is using the most reliable valuers, PHH compares valuations
with the eventual sale price - 'if the relocatee's home is valued at Pounds
100,000 and he is convinced its worth Pounds 20,000 more, then he might not
join the relocation scheme. With accurate valuations, the maximum number of
employees are likely to move,' says Mr Buckthorpe.
Through its network of independent search agents, PHH establishes the
requirements of the relocatee and his family for a new home, and these
agents then liaise with estate agents to find a suitable property.
'We can now move the employee quickly into his new area with minimum
disruption to him and his family, and he doesn't even have to worry about
his own home,' says Mr Hanson.

FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (1): The pattern has changed
 -Although business is still brisk for the relocation industry in the UK,
there are also signs that the pace of company moves is beginning to slow
down, as the recession takes its toll

<TEXT>
BUSINESS appears to be booming in the relocation industry, with 1991 marking
a new peak in moves out of central London. Yet a downturn in activity now
seems inevitable over the next few years, as the recession takes its toll.
A recent survey by estate agents Jones Lang Wootton demonstrates the
changing circumstances graphically. Last year saw 36 organisations and
companies moving almost 14,000 employees out of the centre of London - the
highest level recorded since monitoring began in 1964.
But the survey also found that the number of moves in the pipeline was
falling. Only 14 organisations had announced a decision to relocate in 1991,
compared with 36 such announcements in 1990 and 42 in 1989.
At the time the survey was completed, only 25 moves were scheduled for 1992
and just two for 1993. The period of growth in relocation away from the
capital appears to be grinding to a halt.
The fact that relocation activity continued to grow until quite recently
despite the recession reflects the delays inherent in the process of moving
companies.
'Any company moving out of the south-east over the past three years probably
took the decision some time in the mid-1980s,' says Susan Dugdale of Black
Horse Relocation, the UK's largest relocation agency.
'That sort of planning has been less common over the past two years, and the
pace of moves is therefore likely to slow down during the next few years.'
Certainly the recession has eased some of the pressures which encouraged
relocation moves. With unemployment rates rising faster in London and the
south-east than in the rest of the UK, recruitment in and around the capital
is no longer the nightmare that it was in the overheated 1980s. Staff
turnover, which often prompted employers to relocate to regions where they
could expect greater stability, is down as the jobs market freezes up.
And with millions of square feet of office space lying empty in London, it
is a buyers' market for companies looking to relocate within the capital.
Labour costs remain higher in the south-east: allowances paid to employees
working in central London have not fallen in the recession and can exceed
Pounds 3,000 a year. And other overheads such as rates and transport costs
can be higher. But the economic case for relocation  - in the short-term at
any rate - is now less clear cut.
However, the attractions of relocation are almost certain to re-assert
themselves once the green shoots of economic recovery break through. The old
problems of high rents, shortage of skilled employees, costly staff turnover
and the overheads imposed on working in the overcrowded and congested
south-east will soon emerge again. And technological developments continue
to offer considerable opportunities for service organisations to follow the
example of the banks and insurance companies in moving back offices to
lower-cost areas while maintaining a shop window in London and the
south-east.
Even local government can take advantage of these opportunities, as the
experience of Windsor and Maidenhead district council shows. Finding itself
competing for computer staff with the salaries offered by high-tech
companies in the M4 corridor, the council in 1988 relocated its computing
development centre to Telford in Shropshire.
The centre maintains direct communications links to the council's mainframe
computer at the council headquarters in Maidenhead.
The long-term benefits of relocation continue to be recognised by government
departments and other public bodies which are largely immune to the
short-term financial constraints of the recession. With 12,000 civil service
jobs already moved out of London and the south-east in the last three years,
another 18,000 are due to follow by mid-1994 - and a further 24,000 posts
are under review for relocation.
Many of these government moves are significant in scale. Customs and Excise,
for example, is moving 1,250 jobs out of the south-east by relocating its
VAT central unit from Southend to a brand-new building in Liverpool's
docklands in 1993. With 400 other head office jobs already moved to
Manchester, Customs will have moved more than 30 per cent of its
headquarters staff out of the south-east.
The Inland Revenue is moving many of its head office functions out London
and the south-east to a purpose-built headquarters in Nottingham; 1,800 jobs
will go to Nottingham, with another 400 London-based tax office staff moving
to Cardiff, Bootle, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In the short-term, however, companies in the private sector struggling for
survival in today's tougher business environment are less willing to incur
the costs of relocation.
Jean Crawford of Jones Lang Wootton estimates that moving an employee from
London to the Midlands might save Pounds 9,000 a year in running costs,
rent, rates and labour costs. But the bill up-front can average Pounds
14,500 per employee in the cost of visits to the new area, temporary
accommodation, removal expenses and disturbance allowances.
The collapse in the housing market has added to this cost still further
where the company offers to provide bridging loans to employees who move
with the job. Not only may many months of bridging finance be required
before a house can be sold; the sale is often thousands of pounds lower
after such a delay in a falling market.
This has offered new opportunities to the relocation companies, according to
Tad Zurlinden of the Edinburgh-based Association of Relocation Agents.
Dealing with 'orphans,' the unsold houses of relocated employees, is now at
least as important a part of their package as providing assistance to
employees in making their moves.
When the economy picks up, one question facing all those in the relocation
industry is whether the traditional pattern of company moves from London and
the south-east to the north and west will return.
Last year's decision by Pilkington, the St Helens-based glassmaker, to move
the headquarters of its core business of flat and safety glass to Brussels
has sent shivers down the spines of those who hope to attract companies to
areas north of Watford.
For St Helens, it meant the loss of 750 much-needed jobs, but the reasons
for the move were an even bigger blow to a town which has worked hard to
attract business relocations. For Pilkington was finding it increasingly
difficult to manage its continental factories in countries like Germany and
Sweden from a peripheral location on Merseyside.
While the opening of the channel tunnel in 1993 will improve communications
between the UK and the rest of the EC, it could be into the next century
before the British railways are properly linked into the high-speed rail
network now being completed between the leading European centres. The fear
is that larger companies with operations in more than one country may find
it preferable to relocate to mainland Europe to be closer to their markets
and local plants.
Similar considerations may also be influencing the location decisions being
made by investors from countries outside the European Community. While the
UK clearly retains its supremacy as a destination for Japanese investors,
there is some evidence that Japanese firms are now looking to make
investments in other EC member-states, especially Germany.
Ian Dodwell of estate agents Weatherall Green &amp; Smith has noticed a similar
tendency among US companies seeking an EC base.
'I detect a much greater consciousness of the European options,' he says.
'The tendency to see the UK as the place to go is weakening and Brussels is
increasingly seen as the place to be.'
Those who wish to attract new businesses to their areas - whether from other
parts of the UK or further afield - are going to have to work much harder
over the coming years if they are to achieve success.

FT  30 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris stands out in eventful
day's trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading was eventful on the continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was boosted to its highest close since June 1990 by options-related
buying. The CAC-40 index closed just off the day's high at 2,036.72, up
30.10, in heavy turnover of FFr3.8bn.
Paribas added another FFr10 to FFr429; after the close it announced the sale
of a 54.7 per cent stake in Ciments Francais to Italcementi for FFr3bn. Axa,
which owns less than 10 per cent of Paribas, jumped FFr43 to FFr1,017 with a
large 152,690 shares traded. Analysts said the stock was rising on hopes
that Equitable Life in the US would be able to proceed with its
demutualisation plans and on rumours that it was preparing for an ADR issue.
Eurotunnel bounced back FFr2.45 or 6.9 per cent to FFr37.90 in 1.6m shares
in the wake of its recent underperformance.
Schneider, which announced plans to buy in Merlin Gerin after the close on
Tuesday, eased FFr6 to FFr709.
FRANKFURT concentrated on the chemical and car sectors. There was some
satisfaction with the lower inflation figures for the state Hesse. The data
for western Germany are due today or Monday. The DAX index shed 0.4 to
1,735.91 while the FAZ index fell 3.24 at 703.09. Turnover rose to DM6bn
from DM5.4bn.
Bayer and Basf reported first quarter figures. Bayer rose DM6.20 or 2.2 per
cent to DM294.50 after announcing a 7 per cent fall in the first three
months. Basf added DM1 to DM249.30 after news of a 25 per cent decline in
the same period. Hoechst, ex-dividend, rose a net 90 pfg to DM246.20.
Daimler gained DM3.50 to DM785 after announcing that it was to increase its
dividend by DM1 to DM13, but it did not confirm a report of a 1991 EPS of
DM55, 10 per cent above previous forecasts.
Linotype-Hell closed DM4 higher at DM420 after rumours that Siemens was to
increase its 33 per cent stake.
MILAN was led lower by telecoms and banks. The Comit index fell 4.92 to
503.66 in turnover estimated at L80bn after Tuesday's L104.9bn.
Olivetti bucked the easier trend, adding L31 to L2,819, while pleasing 1991
results pushed Eridania up by L85 to L7,185.
Telecommunications continued to drop, though analysts were unable to give a
reason for the sector's recent decline. Stet eased L34 to L2,021. The
banking sector was depressed by news that Banca Commerciale might need a
capital increase next year. It fell L50 or 1.4 per cent to L3,420.
The suspension of Italmobiliare and Italcementi fanned speculation,
confirmed after the close, that the group was poised to buy all or part of
Paribas's stake in Ciments Francais. Analysts welcomed the deal, in spite of
Italcementi needing a capital increase to finance the deal, since it
elevated Italcementi to the world's second largest cement producer after
Holderbank of Switzerland.
ZURICH was lifted by Nestle after it announced a 10-for-one share split and
plans to convert its non-voting participation certificates into registered
shares next year. The SMI index rose 14.7 to 1,874.2.
Nestle bearers gained SFr180 or 1.8 per cent to SFr9,770, its registered
shares put on SFr160 to SFr9,740 and its certificates rose SFr60 to
SFr1,910.
STOCKHOLM firmed as late buying helped to reverse an early fall. The
Affarsvarlden general index added 1.3 to 980.9, in moderate turnover of
SKr430m after SKr496m.
Volvo, the session's most active stock, fell on fears of changes in the
proposed merger with Procordia. Volvo B shares fell SKr7 to SKr438 the A
share shed SKr10 to SKr435. But Procordia B jumped SKr5 to SKr193.
AMSTERDAM was firmer with the CBS Tendency index up 0.5 at 128.6.
Akzo gained Fl 4.90 or 3 per cent to Fl 161 after reporting a 7 per cent
increase in first quarter net profit. Philips, which launched its new
interactive CD player in the UK on Tuesday, put on 70 cents to Fl 37.90.
OSLO was boosted by first quarter results from Norsk Hydro and Elkem. The
all-share index rose 5.80 to 430.83 in turnover of NKr451m.
HELSINKI weakened in spite of news that stamp duty of 1 per cent on share
transactions would be removed from May 1. The HEX index fell 1.36 to 817.39.
ISTANBUL recovered slightly after closing at a seven-week low on Tuesday.
The index rose 11.86 to 3,691.81.

FT  30 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Turkey aims for higher success rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY IS taking steps to ensure a higher success rate in its privatisation
programme. In May, the government plans to offer to the public all or part
of its 49 per cent stake in Netas, the telecommunications company, and
further sales are expected over the summer.
Mr Ustun Sanver, chairman of the Prime Ministry Public Participation
Administration (PPA), told fund managers in London yesterday that the PPA
intends to avoid the supply/demand imbalances created by past privatisations
through the use of underwriters, and if necessary, by cancelling sales if
investor interest is too low.
In response to foreign investors' complaints of a lack of liquidity in
privatised stocks, as well as inadequate prospectuses, Mr Sanver said that
the PPA is prepared to provide stock directly to investors if none is
available in the stock market, and that documentation on future
privatisations will be upgraded.

FT  30 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong lower after
eight-day rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC RIM markets lacked direction yesterday as Tokyo was closed for a
public holiday. Australia finished at a two- month high.
HONG KONG had an eight-day rally brought to an end as the Hang Seng index
retreated 60.98, or 1.1 per cent, to 5,362.41. Turnover eased to HKDollars
2.93bn from HKDollars 3.16bn.
The index dropped 50 points in the first 15 minutes on rumours that HSBC
Holdings was to increase its Pounds 3.3bn bid for Midland Bank, of the UK,
in response to the rival offer by Lloyds Bank. HSBC finished 75 cents
cheaper at HKDollars 42.00.
Utilities relinquished some ground. China Light declined 75 cents to
HKDollars 33, Hong Kong Electric weakened 40 cents to HKDollars 16.70 and
Hong Kong Telecom slipped 10 cents to HKDollars 9.25.
Property shares were also depressed, with Hong Kong Land softening 10 cents
to HKDollars 10.60.
AUSTRALIA was boosted by lower than expected inflation figures. The All
Ordinaries index moved ahead 24.1 to 1,629.8 in turnover of ADollars 257.1m.
The data, which put annual inflation at 1.7 per cent, are expected to give
the government scope to cut interest rates next month.
Banks were strong, Westpac and ANZ rising 12 cents to ADollars 3.98 and
ADollars 4.36 respectively.
CRA put on 26 cents to ADollars 14.06 after announcing that 1992 profits
would match last year's. Western Mining gained 12 cents to ADollars 3.98 as
the end to an industrial dispute at one of its mines seemed in sight.
SEOUL strengthened, with large-capitalisation issues being actively traded.
The composite index climbed 15.48 to 612.72 in turnover of Won387.3bn, after
Won394.8bn.
Expectations of an improvement in economic relations between North and South
Korea gave a boost to Daewoo group subsidiaries, which stand to benefit.
Daewoo Corp and Daewoo Electronics both rose by Won600 to Won11,700 and
Won10,600 respectively.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to close mildly lower. The weighted index lost
10.76 at 4,513.19, after recording an intraday high of 4,557.93. Turnover
was TDollars 21.45bn, after TDollars 24.3bn.
Concern that the US would place Taiwan on its 'priority watch list' of
nations violating intellectual property laws depressed sentiment. The list
was due to be announced after the market closed.
MANILA gained ground. The composite index rose 16.76 to 1,228.24 in combined
turnover of 333.47m pesos.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone put on 25 pesos to 955 pesos, while
Philippine National Bank gained 2.50 pesos to 282.50 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR was quiet. The composite index edged forward 1.50 to 585.12 in
turnover of MDollars 85.4m.
Telekom Malaysia, Tanjong and Magnum firmed 10 cents apiece to MDollars
11.90, MDollars 11.50 and MDollars 5.85 respectively.
SINGAPORE rose afresh on bargain hunting. The Straits Times Industrial index
appreciated 10.32 to 1,436.96 in turnover of SDollars 135.1m, after SDollars
101m.
BANGKOK declined amid investor worries about political uncertainty. The SET
index lost 11.21 to 756.90 in turnover of Bt3.33bn.
Bangkok Bank shed Bt12 to Bt668 and Siam City Cement Bt2 to Bt118, but Siam
Cement gained Bt6 to Bt536.
BOMBAY fell for the second consecutive day. The BSE index finished 222.49,
or 5.71 per cent, weaker at 3,674.41, but was off the day's low of 3,611.11.
NEW ZEALAND closed lower. The NZSE-40 index slipped 11.39 to 1,435.76 in
turnover of NZDollars 21m.
Among blue chips, Telecom eased 4 cents to NZDollars 2.04, Carter Holt
Harvey was 2 cents down at NZDollars 2.52 and Brierley Investments lost 1
cent to 91 cents.

GOLD fell to fresh six-year lows in early trading on the London bullion
market before recovering on bargain hunting and short covering after Comex
opened. The Comex June gold futures contract was at midday holding above
lifetime lows struck earlier, but dealers said the market was still
vulnerable. New York analysts believe Dollars 335 a troy ounce is an
important support point for bullion, and peg next support at Dollars 333,
then Dollars 330. Should bullion fall below those levels nearby Comex gold
will drop to Dollars 320, they predict. Some see a fall to Dollars 300. Tame
inflation, the recession and a lack of investor interest continue to weigh
on sentiment. London COFFEE and COCOA ended another loss-laden day with
little sign of an imminent turnaround in the current bearish trend, traders
said. Cocoa ended near the day's lows, while coffee trimmed losses slightly
but showed no conviction to rally into the plus column. Origin sales,
particularly from the Ivory Coast, continued to be cited as the reasons
behind the current slide in both markets to historical lows. The nearby July
cocoa contract closed at Pounds 586 a tonne, down Pounds 12 on the day but
above the new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 581.

FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peace-time challenges for
Afghan farming - The agricultural devastation caused by 13 years of war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF PEACE finally returns to Afghanistan after 13 years of war, restoration
of the agricultural sector would be one of the most difficult challenges
faced by a new government.
According to United Nations estimates, the 1.3m hectares (3.2m acres) under
irrigation when the war began, have shrunk to less than 1m ha because of war
related devastation. Some 250,000 ha of forest have also disappeared,
creating shortages of firewood and timber for construction.
Among the principal causes of the Afghan tragedy are the estimated 10m mines
that have have been laid. According to a UN estimate, at least 500,000 farm
animals have been killed by the mines. Also the country's capacity to
increase its foodgrain production has been severely hampered by continuing
warfare and large-scale refugee movements. Now, in addition to the estimated
17m people living in Afghanistan, at least 5m live in refugee camps in
neighbouring Pakistan and Iran.
Mr Farooq Azam, former adviser on irrigation to the Afghan government before
the communist coup of 1978, says 'the land has become uneven because of
heavy bombing and mine blasts'. Now, the Authority for the Restoration of
Infrastructure in Afghanistan, the non-governmental organisation which he
heads, is trying to establish new projects for training of farmers and the
disabled to improve their skills for increasing crop yields. But, the task
is a difficult one. He quotes a retreating Soviet general who said in 1989
that 'they have made the land of Afghanistan such that it will fight its own
people for ten years', adding that this is the time-frame expected for the
completion of clearing operations.
The UN launched a worldwide appeal for the supply of 100,000 tonnes of wheat
in early April, to alleviate potentially severe food shortages. 'The silos
are empty, do we start digging cemeteries?' said Mr Benon Sevan, the UN
secretary general's special envoy for Afghanistan, when he launched the
appeal. So far, among the major donors, Pakistan and the US have committed
themselves to sending 40,000 tonnes and 10,000 tonnes respectively while
additional pledges may come from European countries, officials and diplomats
say.
They are not very hopeful, however, that any large scale international
effort will be mounted for reconstruction and rehabilitation in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani government is now revising estimates for reconstruction from a
1989 assessment. The new figures are expected to be provided to the UN
secretary general within the next two to three weeks and may be used for
launching a fresh international appeal.
At a time of economic pressures in Western economies and more interest in
giving assistance to the newly-independent republics of the former Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe, donors are less likely to make major commitments
to Afghanistan, officials say. Further pressure has resulted from
uncertainty about the future of a commitment of USDollars 600m made by the
Soviet Union after its troops withdrew from Afghanistan.
'We don't know if Moscow still wants to keep up with its commitment or not,'
says a senior government official.
A newly-installed government in Kabul is now expected to appeal for
assistance from donors. The twin factors of expected luke-warm response and
fears of infighting between rival mujahideen groups are likely to go against
them, but Mr Azam remains hopeful that 'there are still good people out
there' who will come to Afghanistan's help once again in its hour of need.

FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers optimistic ahead of
rubber talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAJOR RUBBER producers are guardedly optimistic that consumer countries will
agree to amend the International Natural Rubber Agreement to make it more
effective for boosting weak prices of the commodity, reports Reuter from
Chiangmai, Thailand.
A ministerial meeting of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing
Countries, started here yesterday with delegates saying they hoped
consumers, led by the US, would respond positively to their demand for more
active market intervention to lift rubber prices. But consumers have not yet
given any such indications.
'It is not in the long-term interest of consumers and producers to leave
prices at their current lows,' said Mr Soedradjad Djiwandono, the Indonesian
junior trade minister.
Rubber prices have been declining for the past two years, falling to their
lowest since 1986 in December. They have recovered only slightly since.
Producers have sought to negotiate with consumers a new pact to replace the
International Natural Rubber Agreement before it expires in December 1993.
Inra is administered by the International Natural Rubber Organisation, which
groups major producers with 20 consumers. The UN-sponsored agreement will be
extended automatically for two years if its members failed to agree on a new
pact.
Producers, led by Malaysia, have complained that the five-year agreement has
succeeded only in stabilising prices at levels that were unremunerative to
them.
They say the Inro buffer stock manager, given broad discretionary power, has
not been sufficiently active in his buying intervention to shore up prices.
The two-day ANRPC meeting is being held here ahead of an Inro session
starting in Kuala Lumpur on May 19 at which producers hope they can persuade
consumers to agree to open talks on pact improvements.
The ANRPC groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Singapore
and Thailand, which between them account for about 82 per cent of world
supply of natural rubber.
Mr Warothai Pinyasart, the Thai deputy agriculture minister, said Thailand
supported an ANRPC resolution last year that called on four of its members
to prepare for activating their 1976 agreement to stabilise prices through
supply rationalisation if consumers refused to start negotiations by next
month.
But the Indonesian junior trade minister said both producers and consumers
should go to the negotiating table in a non-confrontational spirit.

relief package

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROLL-over of Dollars 276m in debt and CrDollars 240b (Dollars 102m) in new
financing for the 1992-93 crop are the centrepieces of a government package
to boost the Brazilian coffee sector. The measures await approval by the
National Monetary Council, which is scheduled to meet today.
The length of debt refinancing will depend on the nature and source of the
original loan. For some, payments may be extended for up to five years.
New credit will be awarded on the basis of productivity and will favour
those who did not receive loans for the 1991-92 harvest. Growers who did not
receive credit last season and who produce fewer than 45 bags (60 kg each)
per hectare will have access to financing of CrDollars 11,000 per bag; those
whose production is between 45 and 90 bags will be able to borrow up to
CrDollars 13,000 per bag, and those who harvest more than 90 bags per
hectare can obtain funding of up to CrDollars 15,000 per bag.
Mr Suelly Evandro Amarante, president of the National Coffee Council (CNC),
a producers association, hailed the measures as 'highly positive' and 'an
important beginning' for a recuperation of the sector. However, he believes
the amount of new credit is insufficient. The CNC is also lobbying for
additional measures, including tax reductions and port reforms to ease
exports.
Mr Amarante stressed that domestic measures alone could not solve the
problems of Brazilian coffee producers.

FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Deal reached on 7-day working
at Kambalda

<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group, yesterday said
that it had reached agreement with the Australian Workers' Union on
continuous mining at its troubled Kambalda nickel operations in Western
Australia.
The group said the deal would lead to the revival of an ADollars 105m
expansion plan for Kambalda, and the re-employment of 150 workers made
redundant when the plan was abandoned during an industrial dispute in
November.
The union said that it had agreed to switch to seven-day mining in
continuous shifts from five-day operation after WMC agreed to reduce the
duration of shifts from eight hours to seven and a half hours. However, the
agreement cannot be implemented until the Western Australian state
government implements an undertaking to amend the state's Mines Regulation
Act to allow continuous working.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, said the company and the union had
jointly requested the government to expedite the amendment, which would
bring Western Australia into line with other Australian states.
WMC said last week that production at Kambalda had been seriously affected
by industrial action over the continuous mining dispute in the nine months
to the end of March.
The group said said ore treated at Kambalda fell to 763,000 tonnes over the
first nine months of the current financial year, compared to 910,024 tonnes
in the comparable period of the previous year.
WMC's expansion plan for Kambalda would increase deep mining at several
mines in the area, where WMC produces about 35,000 tonnes of nickel a year.
The project is part of a ADollars 400m spending programme intended to
increase the group's nickel output to 65,000 tonnes a year from 53,000.
WMC shares rose 12 cents to ADollars 3.98 on the Australian Stock Exchange
as news of the possible solution to the Kambalda problem filtered through.

Australian sales were resumed this week after the Easter recess and prices
were generally unchanged or a little easier. The Wool corporation's market
indicator slipped 4 cents from its pre-Easter close of 590 cents a kg. on
the first day, and another 4 cents on the second day. Although these are
small movements they do not encourage the placing of new orders but firms in
the trade who can manage to wait to do so. The Australian stockpile, still
over 4 million bales, is a factor in all market calculations, present policy
means that disposal is continuing at a very slow rate.

with Iran

<TEXT>
IN AN effort to wean itself away from dependence on Russian oil and gas
newly-independent Ukraine is building on its partnership with Iran. A visit
last weekend to Tehran by a high level Ukrainian delegation headed by Mr
Leonid Kruvchek, the Ukrainian president, yielded two new commercial
agreements that form part of a new Ukrainian orientation towards the Middle
East.
Mr Mykola Havrylenko, chairman of the Ukrainian state commission on geology
and natural resources, signed a protocol permitting Ukrainian teams to
explore for oil and natural gas in Iran and receive payment in kind.
Although Ukraine has few oilfields of its own it has vast expertise in the
oil industry learned on the Siberian steppes.
Mr Havrylenko signed a separate agreement for the purchase of current metals
from Iran. These deals are part of an agreement whereby Iran is to provide
Ukraine with 4m tonnes of oil in 1992 in exchange for Ukrainian machine
parts and building materials.
Together with Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Iran have also previously agreed to
build a pipeline from Iran to western Europe, passing through Ukraine, in
which Ukrainian officials say Germany, France, and Italy have all expressed
interest.
The agreements are an implicit rebuke for Russia, which regularly threatens
Ukraine with the prospect of paying world prices for Russian oil. Ukrainian
authorities said that it was a pleasure to do business with Iran because
unlike Ukraine's other partners it did not change prices every two months or
alter contracts on the whim of its leaders.
Mr Kravchuk shrugged off the suggestion that the West might be displeased
with the developing relationship between Ukraine and Iran. 'We will no
longer pursue the servile policies, instead we will pursue the policies of
independence,' he said.
Turkish oil officials, touring Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union
with Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, said they were prepared in
principle to buy crude from Uzbekistan in exchange for refined products,
reports Reuter from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.
'We import Dollars 4bn to Dollars 4.5bn worth of crude a year, mostly from
the Middle East,' said Mr Mustafa Aytac, general manager of the state-owned
Petrol Ofisi.
'If the price is right, we will import from Uzbekistan.' But Mr Aytac said
the problems of transporting the oil by rail to Ukraine's Black Sea port of
Odessa and then by ship to the western Turkish port of Izmit might render a
deal unworkable in the short term.
He said he had offered to help set up a chain of petrol stations. Uzbek oil
officials will visit Turkey next month to discuss the proposal in detail, he
said.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Reuters launches foreign
exchange dealing system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS' long-awaited foreign exchange dealing system, Dealing 2000-2, was
finally launched yesterday, although with fewer banks ready to participate
than had been planned.
The UK-based information group said yesterday that 18 banks were ready to
use terminals in 22 sites in London and New York. Coming after a lengthy
development process and a hefty, though undisclosed, investment, the launch
puts Reuters ahead of two rival groups which plan to launch similar products
in the coming months.
One bank using the system said yesterday it had experienced no problems, and
had completed a number of transactions. 'It's going well. We're trading on
it,' a dealer said.
However, several banks were not ready for yesterday's launch. The IRA bomb
that devastated the St Mary Axe area of the City of London this month has
prevented some banks from joining the system at the beginning, while delays
in installing lines to some US banks had also kept others away. Also, a
dealer in one London dealing room said his bank had been unable to start
trading since internal technical developments had not been completed.
Reuters said, though, that the 18 banks ready on day one represented a
successful launch. 'The more people who are using it, the better it will be.
But we wouldn't have launched it if we didn't think there were enough banks
ready,' a spokesman said.
The system initially allows banks to trade three currencies against the
Dollars - D-Marks, sterling and yen.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Bonds: French 20-year offering makes
impressive debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAISSE Autonome de Refinancement, the French government-owned agency, made
an impressive debut in the Eurobond market yesterday, when its FFr2.5bn
offering of 20-year bonds, the longest maturity tested in the sector, was
heavily over-subscribed.
The deal, arranged by Paribas, successfully tapped both domestic and
international demand, in an area of the yield curve which had previously
received little attention. Although the French government issues 30-year
debt, outside the government bond market the longest duration available
prior to the CAR deal was 15 years in the domestic market and 13 years in
the Eurobond market.
Dealers reported strong demand from both domestic and international
institutional investors, particularly insurance companies, which like to
match assets to long-dated liabilities.
The deal had been marketed ahead of launch to international investors, many
of whom were not familiar with the borrower. The CAR is owned by the Caisse
des Depots et des Consignations (CDC), the French government-owned bank. CAR
refinances loans, mainly government-guaranteed, granted by CDC for public
housing projects.
The deal was not swapped, since the borrower was keen to lock in fixed-rate
funding.
The size of the issue is likely to be increased in the future by fungible
tranches.
The yield curve in the French bond market is virtually flat from 10 to 30
years, but the long-dated paper commanded some rarity value, and the launch
spread of 45 basis points above the 20-year French government bond yield was
considered attractive. Although there is no paper of comparable maturity,
debt issued by government-owned borrowers such as Societe Nationale des
Chemins de Fer Francais, the national railway and Electricite de France, the
electricity utility, trades at 35 basis points to 40 basis points over the
10-year area of yield curve.
The deal closed at 97.95 bid, above its fixed price reoffer of 97.75.
In the sterling sector, the Republic of Finland added Pounds 150m of bonds
to an existing Pounds 200m issue due 1998, which was quoted at a premium to
its par value. The fixed re-offer price of 102 1/2 for the new bonds detered
some investors, who do not like to buy bonds priced above par. Some dealers
said it would have been preferable to add to a more recent Pounds 250m issue
due 1997, which was trading below par and at a tighter spread.
However, lead manager Baring Brothers said the 1997 issue, launched in
February, was not sufficiently seasoned, adding that the spreads of both
deals had been taken into account for the pricing of the new bonds, which
yield 23 basis points more than the comparable gilt, and offer a pick-up
over both outstanding deals.
The deal, which was structured as a block trade, widened to 28 basis points
when the gilts market rallied after the 25-year auction, but tightened when
the gilts market fell.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: New market in Ecu-denominated
equities considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE outline of a possible new market in Ecu-denominated equities was
sketched yesterday by a senior figure from the London Stock Exchange, the
first time such a possibility has been raised publicly by the exchange which
already dominates cross-border share dealing in Europe.
The market would involve the creation of 'European Depositary Receipts,'
similar in many ways to American Depository Receipts.
Shares in leading European companies would be placed with depository banks
and reissued in Ecu form.
Speaking at a conference in London on the implications of a single European
currency, Mr Martin Hall, who is head of public policy at the exchange, said
that the advantages of such a market would be considerable.
These included 'seamless trading in all the major European stocks; easy
'basket trading', on the basis of a single 'basket EDR' enabling Japanese or
US investors to 'buy Europe' in a single transaction; (and) the creation of
readily workable European indices and derivative products'.
Novelty, and the difficulty of attracting enough investors to the market,
were the main obstacles to the idea, said Mr Hall, adding that the
development of such a market was unlikely until the outcome of planned
monetary union in the EC became clearer.
Investors generally react positively in principle to the idea of a single,
Ecu-denominated share market.
Mr Mike Payne, head of international equity investment at Legal &amp; General,
the UK insurance company, said yesterday: 'What's annoying about European
investment is that you have to deal with so many currencies.'
However, the Ecu has yet to develop a strong enough backing to make it an
attractive currency for investors.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Curtain finally comes down on
Greek drama - Kerin Hope finds the state celebrating the sale of Heracles,
its biggest cement group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the new owners of Heracles Cement arrive at the company's offices this
week, Greece's privatisation team will feel its most arduous task has been
accomplished.
Heracles, Europe's largest cement exporter, was sold last month to
Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of Italy's Ferruzzi group, in a joint
venture with the state-owned National Bank of Greece. Calcestruzzi is now
responsible for Heracles' day-to-day management.
'Heracles survived surprisingly well under state control, retaining its
corporate culture. But at this point, some strategic decisions must be
taken,' says Mr Stelios Stavridis, the outgoing chairman.
Heracles was the key component of a privatisation programme launched two
years ago by the Industrial Reconstruction Organisation (IRO), the state
holding group for about 40 companies nationalised in the early 1980s.
With a local market share of 44 per cent and exports of 3.5m tonnes a year,
it is easily the biggest of Greece's four cement producers. Its two plants
in central Greece are close to company-owned quarries and deep-water loading
facilities, which means reduced export overheads in comparison with European
rivals.
As well as operating its own fleet of bulk carriers, Heracles controls a
dozen diversified subsidiaries, encompassing packaging, computer software
and insurance. Group net profits for 1991 totalled Dr6.39bn (Dollars 33m) on
turnover of Dr56bn.
The privatisation team at IRO faced a serious problem in disposing of its
69.8 per cent shareholding in Heracles. This stemmed from a legal dispute
over the way the company was nationalised, with some Dr27bn in debt
compulsorily capitalised in violation of European Community company law.
Whoever acquired Heracles stood to lose the entire investment if the debt
capitalisation was reversed, making IRO's equity invalid. Moreover,
prospective buyers were not encouraged by the Greek government's offer of a
guaranteed refund of the purchase price plus interest if the European Court,
which is to consider the case, ruled against the IRO.
At this point, the National Bank came into the picture with a scheme under
which it would join forces with the strongest bidder for IRO's stake in
Heracles. It was an attractive offer. If the 1986 debt capitalisation were
reversed, National Bank would revert to being Heracles' largest shareholder
with 25 per cent.
Calcestruzzi - which had acquired 17 per cent of Heracles through the Athens
stock market - and National Bank then submitted a joint bid of Dr107bn for
the IRO holding. It turned out to be the only firm offer received.
Italcementi, the only other short-listed contender following the withdrawal
of Holderbank of Switzerland, pulled out at the last minute, claiming that
the unannounced alliance between Calcestruzzi and National Bank violated
transparency procedures in the sale.
However, Italcementi later indicated it was prepared to offer Dr120bn if
National Bank changed sides. Instead, Calcestruzzi and the bank raised their
offer to Dr124bn. This was just above the value placed on Heracles by Morgan
Stanley, acting as IRO's financial adviser on the sale.
Calcestruzzi, a ready-mix concrete producer controlling over 1,000 regional
construction companies in Italy, is the country's largest customer for
cement. It has been trying for years to acquire a large cement producer to
ensure a steady source of supply. Its earnings for 1990, the latest figures
available, totalled L45bn (Dollars 36m) on sales of L1,178bn.
Calnat, the joint venture formed to acquire Heracles, is 52.5 per cent-owned
by Calcestruzzi and 47.5 per cent by National Bank. Calcestruzzi has an
option to buy out National Bank's stake over the next four years.
Calcestruzzi, listed on the Milan stock exchange, is financing its Dr65.1bn
share of the deal through bank borrowing, and by selling off some smaller
companies under its control.

</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASF profits slumped in the first three months of this year and the German
chemical concern said it saw no real signs of improvement in the world
economy, despite some positive indications from the US.
BASF's pre-tax figure of DM473m (Dollars 286.6m) was 25 per cent lower than
that of the first quarter of 1991, putting it roughly in line with the poor
performance of Hoechst which reported a 26 per cent fall. Bayer's
first-quarter decline was a much gentler 8 per cent.
In common with its rivals, BASF managed a slight rise in turnover, which was
4 per cent higher at DM11.9bn.
However, it said that this was mainly due to higher oil taxes in Germany -
BASF has a large energy operation - as well as the inclusion of new
activities. The company said stiffer competition had led to large profit
declines in some sectors; these could not be offset by cost-cutting measures
and restructuring.
BASF said business was weak in plastics and fibres, with profits held back
by low prices and the starting up of new plant, although volumes were
higher.

<TEXT>
OMV Group, the Austrian-based oil company, expects to make a first-quarter
loss of around Sch300m (Dollars 25.8m) following deteriorating conditions in
its plastics and chemicals divisions.
However Mr Siefried Meysel, chairman, said the company would stick to its
dividend policy and increase last year's payout by 1 percentage point to 20
per cent of equity capital of Sch2.4bn.
The company saw pre-tax profit slip to Sch1.72bn last year from Sch1.85bn in
1990. However a reduction in its tax liabilities led to a 75 per cent rise
in after-tax profits, to Sch1.42bn from Sch810m.
OMV, which has interests in oil refining, gas marketing, chemicals and
plastics, saw increased sales in all sectors. Turnover rose 6.5 per cent to
Sch82.9bn from Sch77.87bn.
The company is making a push into eastern Europe; last year it opened 13
filling stations in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It has just signed a
contract to open 60 petrol stations in Slovenia and is looking at expansion
into Bavaria and northern Italy.

<TEXT>
BAYER, the German chemical group, yesterday announced a drop of 8 per cent,
to DM812m (Dollars 492m), in pre-tax profits for the first quarter. It
expressed little hope of any marked improvement this year.
The results showed a much flatter decline than those of its domestic rivals,
however. Hoechst's pre-tax result was down 26 per cent in the first three
months, while BASF suffered a 25 per cent slide. Bayer's stronger
performance reflected its greater involvement in the non-cyclical
pharmaceuticals sector, accounting for half of profits.
It said its operations in the US and parts of western Europe had experienced
initial signs of economic revival. Group turnover was 4 per cent higher at
DM11.2bn, but eased by 2 per cent in Europe to DM7.5bn. In North America,
however, there was a 17 per cent increase to DM2.3bn, helped by the stronger
dollar.
The company said trends in the consumer and industrial sectors were
different. This year, its hopes were concentrated on consumer-related
products such as cosmetics, while its expectations on the industrial side
weren't as positive. Health care products were buoyant in the first quarter,
with a 14 per cent jump in sales to DM2.3bn.
Industrial chemicals showed a 6 per cent turnover improvement to DM2bn. The
agricultural division also improved.

NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, swung back to
profit in the 1992 first quarter, after a net loss of NKr498m (Dollars
77.3m) for the whole of 1991. Last year's result followed a restructuring.
However, first quarter earnings, at NKr201m, were half the year-ago figure
of NKr410m. Hydro blamed this on the inflationary effects of the Gulf war.
Group operating revenue for the 1992 first quarter decreased by NKr265m to
NKr15.96bn, as operating costs rose by NKr395m to NKr13.55bn. Group
operating income was reduced by NKr766m to NKr1.04bn.
Mr Egil Myklebust, president, said although first-quarter results were
unsatisfactory, they were a clear improvement over last year's fourth
quarter.
Hydro explained that net income was influenced by the effects of a stronger
dollar. The realised and unrealised effects of foreign exchange movements
meant a loss of NKr470m, compared with a loss of NKr450m last year.
The agriculture division saw operating income fall NKr331m to NKr195m, as
operating revenue dipped NKr33m to NKr7.24bn. Hydro said European fertiliser
prices increased along with sales volume.
The oil and gas division reduced operating income by NKr27m to NKr738m, as
operating revenue advanced NKr200m to NKr3.31bn. Oil and gas production rose
to 2.2m tonnes of oil equivalent from 1.9m, but average crude oil prices per
barrel fell.
Light metals suffered a NKr313m plunge in operating income, to NKr89m, as
operating revenue was cut NKr459m to NKr4.14bn. Hydro said the effect of the
decline was partly offset by lower raw materials prices and higher smelter
productivity. Petrochemicals saw operating income fall NKr106m to NKr96m due
to lower prices.

<TEXT>
PETROBRAS, the Brazilian state oil monopoly, is to sign a contract next week
to begin exploration in Cuba. Mr Ernesto Weber, the company's president,
said yesterday the decision was part of a new policy to increase its
international operations, resulting from this month's government reshuffle.
According to Mr Weber the company's aim was no longer to be self-sufficient
in oil but to produce at competitive cost. 'Investments should be made in
terms of return and we will import or explore overseas rather than produce
domestically at high cost.'
The company was maintaining its heavy investment programme of Dollars 15.8bn
over the next four years, with the aim of lifting production from 600,000 to
1m barrels per day mainly through deep sea drilling, he said. Brazil's
consumption is 1.15m barrels per day.
Petrobras, one of the largest companies in Latin America with revenues last
year of Dollars 13bn, is under police investigation over an alleged network
of manipulation of awarding contracts and misuse of the company's pension
fund.
The Brazilian Congress is due to vote this year on a constitutional
amendment to end the state monopoly over production and exploration.

SOME OF the uncertainty surrounding Taiwan Aerospace's plan to buy up to 40
per cent of McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft business was dispelled
yesterday. Mr Vincent Siew, economics minister, announced to the parliament
that the deal had the full support of his ministry.
The uncertainty resulted from the fact that Taiwan Aerospace, 29 per cent
government-owned, would not be able to finance the deal without outside
backing. Although it was clear government funds would be needed, no
assurance of help was forthcoming.
However, the government faces mounting criticism from legislators, who say
pouring up to Dollars 2bn into a financially stretched company is no way to
make a start in the aerospace industry.
The government's attempts to distance itself from the deal culminated in the
resignation two weeks ago of Mr David Huang, Taiwan Aerospace chairman, who
was known to have official and military ties.
Taiwan Aerospace has not begun production although talks are continuing with
France's Aerospatiale over a proposed joint venture to manufacture
helicopters.
If the deal with McDonnell Douglas goes ahead, wing and fuselage parts for
the new MD-12 wide-bodied jet will be made on the island.
Mr Siew said yesterday the government would be offering carrots to private
investors in the form of low-interest loans and tax incentives, and would
seek to finance the deal through state-owned enterprises, such as the Bank
of Communications. However, direct investment by the government is likely to
be unavoidable.
Mr Earle Ho, Taiwan Aerospace's new chairman, says he hopes the government's
initial investment will make up 49 per cent of the total, in order to
improve confidence. 'They could always reduce that proportion at a later
date.'
Mr Ho, well-known in the local business world, is treading a fine line
between the dissenters and the government. His appointment was intended to
give Taiwan Aerospace credibility as a private company, motivated by profit
rather than ideals of national glory.
He was the first to debunk the idea that the Dollars 2bn figure is written
in stone, questioning that McDonnell Douglas is worth Dollars 5bn, as the
price implies.
Before the deal can go ahead it must be approved by the legislature, and its
progress, even in the face of criticism, should benefit from the
government's more clearly defined role.

EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest maker of photographic equipment, reported
a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter net earnings on sales that were
essentially flat.
The company, in the midst of its fifth restructuring since 1983, had warned
in March it would have a difficult first quarter and its recovery would be
only gradual.
Net income was Dollars 145m, or 45 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 4.41bn
compared with earnings of Dollars 178m, or 55 cents, on sales of Dollars
4.42bn a year earlier.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, said the results were hardly
satisfying. 'Respectable margins in health and chemicals were accompanied by
poor rates of return in imaging and information, where problem areas are
being vigorously addressed.'
He said earnings were hurt by higher costs, unfavourable currency
translations, lower selling prices and higher spending on research.
He added: 'We look forward to better results with the expectation that sales
will continue to recover, particularly in the second half, and that earnings
will benefit from actions to restore operating margins to more satisfactory
levels.'
CHEVRON, leading US energy group, reported a 45 per cent drop in
first-quarter net profit to Dollars 304m, writes Alan Friedman.
Earnings per share declined to 88 cents from Dollars 1.59 in the first three
months of 1992. Total revenues were down by 10.2 per cent to Dollars 9.7bn.

FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, lifted net
income by 20.5 per cent to R187.8m (Dollars 65.2m) in the six months to the
end of March on the back of asset growth of 18 per cent.
The bank recorded a 26.9 per cent increase in net interest income, to
R920.6m, and a 21.8 per cent rise in the bad debt charge, to R160.5m.
Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said the interest performance was the
result of the bank's focus on profitable business. The 27 per cent increase
in net interest income came from a 20.6 per cent increase in advances.
Mr Swart said bad debts had risen more than anticipated - the bank forecast
an overall drop for the year to September 1992 - but attributed this to an
unforeseen double-dip recession and the impact of the severe drought.
Although FNB has a large market share in agricultural lending, Mr Swart said
that less than 10 per cent of total loans went to the agricultural sector.
Other operating income was 21 per cent higher at R645.4m, but this was
overshadowed by a 23.1 per cent increase in other operating expenses.
Assets increased by 18 per cent to R39.5bn. Mr Swart said FNB wanted to
continue to be aggressive in increasing its assets, and most of the R550m
raised in a rights issue earlier this year would be used for this purpose.
Earnings per share rose by 20.4 per cent to 257.7 cents and the dividend was
lifted by 11.1 per cent to 50 cents per share.

<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Cross Airlines Holdings, the probable purchaser of Australia's
grounded Compass Airlines, yesterday said it expected to lose ADollars 7.5m
(USDollars 5.68m) in its first year of ownership, but would make a profit of
ADollars 11.3m in 1993-94.
Mr Douglas Reid, deputy chairman, said Compass would be relaunched on July 1
if a ADollars 50m offer for the airline by Southern Cross was completed.
He said Compass would offer fares up to 40 per cent below those of its main
competitors, the government-owned Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia,
jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation.
Mr Reid added that the airline would cut prices by a further 15 per cent if
necessary. However, he said, Southern Cross would aim for a market share of
only 5 per cent, significantly less than that targeted by Compass before it
went into liquidation in December.
Mr Reid said Compass would be relaunched with five MD-82 aircraft providing
services between Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Townsville and
Cairns. Southern Cross intended to expand the network later by adding two
extra aircraft to serve Perth and Coolangatta, on Queensland's Gold Coast.
Southern Cross has a binding agreement with Mr Ian Ferrier, the liquidator,
which guarantees it the right to purchase Compass if it can raise sufficient
finance.
Mr Reid said he was 'very confident' that a proposed share issue to raise
ADollars 50m would be well supported. He added that some of the financial
institutions which invested in the initial Compass flotation in 1990 have
expressed interest in the flotation.
A rival bid for Compass by the Republic of Nauru and Austfin, an Australian
merchant bank, has been rejected by the liquidator but remains open.

DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company that last week agreed to buy the
nylon business of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday
disclosed an 18.3 per cent slump in its first-quarter net profit, to Dollars
482m.
The decline, which translates into 71 cents per share, against 88 cents a
year ago, was struck on revenues 5.2 per cent lower at Dollars 9.2bn.
The company blamed the sales drop on lower worldwide prices for crude oil
and refined products, and to the exclusion of sales from its coal business -
now part of a joint venture. Nonetheless it decided to boost the dividend
from 42 to 44 cents a share.
Mr Edgar Wollard, chairman, said he was encouraged by indications of a
broader economic improvement, as reflected in stronger earnings for
non-petroleum businesses such as fibres and polymers. The petroleum
division's earnings slumped 63 per cent.
Fibre division earnings were 45 per cent higher while polymer earnings were
56 per cent up on 1991's depressed level.
Chemical earnings fell by 25 per cent, because of lower sales of
intermediates and higher costs associated with the company's expansion of
its white pigment capacity in the US.
Diversified business earnings were 29 per cent higher.

USF&amp;G, the large but troubled Baltimore-based insurer, reported
first-quarter after-tax profits of Dollars 4m, against a net loss of Dollars
55m a year earlier.
Net realised losses on investments totalled Dollars 300,000, compared with
gains of Dollars 400,000 in the first quarter of 1991.
The company said a 'measurable positive trend' was emerging and attributed
the rise in operating earnings to a better performance in its
property-casualty business.
The company, which has pulled out of some insurance lines and pruned costs
fairly drastically, had already predicted a small net profit for the
quarter.

FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse flotation deferred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS HOLDING has deferred the flotation of part of Credit Suisse,
Switzerland's third largest bank, because better-than-expected profits in
1991 will enable it to meet the country's stringent bank capital
requirements.
The group's net profit rose to SFr980m (Dollars 649m) in 1991 from SFr149m
the previous year, giving consolidated earnings per bearer share of
SFr225.10 against SFr34.70.
The result would allow the group enough retained profit to meet Swiss
capital requirements, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said in London.
This was in spite of a ruling 18 months ago by Switzerland's Supreme Court
that the requirements should apply to CS First Boston, its investment bank,
on the same basis as if it were a commercial bank.
CS Holding had planned to respond by selling part of Credit Suisse on the
stock exchange, but Mr Gut said the holding company was in no hurry to do so
when Swiss bank stocks were selling at below net asset value.
'We have to make sure we are not diluting our earnings,' he said.
In the longer run, it might be interested in a sale to generate capital for
expansion into other markets, but the matter would not be considered again
before the start of next year.
Meanwhile, group capital will be strengthened by about SFr300m by paying
part of this year's dividend in share warrants. Each SFr120 dividend will
include a warrant worth the equivalent of SFr45, compared with SFr110 and
SFr35 respectively last year.
CS Holding will also seek shareholder approval to issue SFr250m in
contingent capital which could be used to back equity-linked debt issues.
Mr Gut said this would create scope to raise about SFr1bn in new equity,
though it would not need to do so to meet the capital requirements.
The sharp rise in profits reflected both an already announced 57 per cent
increase in net earnings at Credit Suisse and a swing from loss of Dollars
475m to net income of Dollars 216m at CS First Boston.

AKZO, the Dutch chemicals company, saw a 5 per cent rise in net profit in
the 1992 first quarter. All four of its core businesses reported higher
results after a difficult year in 1991.
Net profit increased to Fl 205.8m (Dollars 111.2m) from Fl 192.2m in the
weak first quarter of 1991. Operating profit showed an even bigger rise,
climbing 17.5 per cent to Fl 348.6m. Sales were up 5 per cent at Fl 4.43bn.
The company's shares responded strongly to the recovery, rising more than 3
per cent to close up Fl 4.90 at Fl 161.00 on the Amsterdam bourse. Akzo, the
first big Dutch company to release 1992 figures, posted a 13 per cent
decline in net profit in 1991.
In spite of the first-quarter improvement, Akzo said it was unable to make a
forecast for the full year because of continuing economic uncertainty in
Europe and the US.
As in 1991, Akzo's health care product group made the single biggest
contribution to operating profit, accounting for slightly more than one
third of the total. Unlike the previous year, however, the other product
groups also recorded higher operating results.

<TEXT>
ITALCEMENTI, Italy's largest cement company, has expanded its international
operations by buying control of one of its chief competitors, Ciments
Francais, from Poliet, the French building materials group, for FFr6bn
(Dollars 1.07bn).
The deal is the latest twist in the saga of Ciments Francais, which was
taken over by Poliet, part of Paribas, the powerful French financial group,
only last year. It also reflects the consolidation of ownership within the
European construction industry, which is under intense pressure because of
the economic slowdown.
As part of the deal, Ciments Francais will stage a FFr5bn capital increase
to be underwritten by Paribas and Mediobanca, the Italian bank advising
Italcementi. This will leave Italcementi with a direct holding of 30 per
cent in Ciments Francais. It will also have a two-thirds interest in an
additional 15 per cent held with Poliet, which will directly hold 15 per
cent. Mediobanca will own 5 per cent of the shares with the remaining 35 per
cent in public issue.
Italcementi is launching a L648bn (Dollars 520.48m) rights issue to help
finance the purchase. Shareholders will be offered one new ordinary or
savings share, priced at L5,000, for every two of the respective category
currently held, raising L335bn.
A further L313bn will come from options on new non-convertible savings
shares to be issued as warrants linked to a Mediobanca bond for the company.
The balance of the total purchase price of around L1,660bn will come from
Italcementi's existing liquidity, which was L854bn at the end of 1991.
Ciments Francais, like other building material businesses, has had a tough
year. It recently announced a 59 per cent fall in 1991 net profits to
FFr401m, on sales up 6.5 per cent to FFr16.5bn. Italcementi, which announced
1991 results yesterday, raised group sales by almost 6 per cent to L1,649bn.
However, net parent company profits fell 10 per cent to L145.8bn.
The combination of Ciments Francais with Italcementi, which dominates its
domestic market, will create one of the world's largest cement groups, with
a combined workforce of 24,000 and joint output of 38m tonnes of cement.
The two are largely complementary. Ciments Francais has expanded outside
France to establish a presence around the Mediterranean, notably in Spain
and North Africa. Italcementi has expanded through investments in Cyprus,
Czechoslovakia and the US.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATRA, the French elec-tronics and defence group, has cut its dividend from
FFr8 in 1990 to FFr5.5 for 1991 after a sharp fall in profits.
Net profits fell from FFr606m (Dollars 108.60m) in 1990 to FFr252m in 1991,
after a decline in operating profits from FFr1.3bn to FFr965bn. Turnover
rose 6 per cent to FFr22.7bn.
Matra, which is chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, attributed the fall in
profits to tough trading conditions, and to its 17 per cent increase in
research and development costs, to FFr3.2bn, during 1991. However it said it
expected 1992 to be a better year.
The decline in profits comes at a sensitive time for Matra, which is
orchestrating a merger with Hachette, the heavily-indebted publishing group
also run by Mr Lagardere. Hachette recently announced it was trying to
recapitalise after making hefty provisions on its losses in La Cinq, the
French TV station which folded earlier this year.
The French government has given the go-ahead to the long standing plan for
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), one of France's largest state-controlled
banks, to swap up to 10 per cent of its equity with Dresdner Bank of
Germany.

DAIMLER-BENZ, the German motor, aerospace and electronics group, will raise
its dividend for the first time in six years after an 8 per cent rise in net
profits in 1991, to DM1.9bn (Dollars 1.15bn).
Analysts said the decision to increase the payment by DM1 to DM13 a share at
a time of threatened industrial unrest over pay claims reflected the group's
desire to made a favourable impact on the stock market ahead of a DM2bn
rights issue later this year. Daimler indicated last year that profits would
justify a higher dividend. The rise in profits came despite costs of more
than DM500m at its AEG electronics subsidiary for the closure of its
loss-making Wilhelmshaven office equipment plant. However, sales of the new
S-class executive car, priced higher than its predecessor, have been
favourable, and the truck market has been buoyant after German unification.
At the same time, concern over high German costs, especially for labour, has
prompted the group's Mercedes-Benz vehicle subsidiary to announce job cuts
of some 20,000 in the next few years, although it wants to avoid
redundancies.

HERSHEY Foods, one of America's biggest chocolate producers, is to acquire
an 18.6 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, the leading Scandinavian
confectionery group, for NKr1.16bn (Dollars 179.56m). The holding is being
bought from Orkla, the diversified Norwegian group.
The deal represents a significant expansion of the US group's European
operations which at present comprise a chocolate manufacturing operation in
Germany. Orkla was forced to dispose of the interest by an ownership
regulation in Norway following its merger last year with Nora Industrier.
In last year's annual report, Orkla valued the Freia Marabou shareholding at
NKr685m. The deal is expected to be completed by May.
Orkla's 'A' shares closed NKr4 up to NKr181 on the news, while Freia
Marabou's 'B' shares jumped NKr12.50 to close at NKr290.
Hershey Foods is no stranger to Freia Marabou, having co-operated with the
company for more than a decade. Hershey previously held a 17 per cent
shareholding in Marabou, and occupied a seat on its board, before it merged
with Freia two years ago. In 1990 Hershey sold the Marabou stake to Orkla
for Dollars 78m.
'The purchase of these shares will represent both a financial and strategic
investment for Hershey Foods. While we are confident that the purchase of
this interest will in itself be a good investment, we are hopeful that we
can build on it over time,' said Mr Richard A. Zimmerman, Hershey chairman.
Last year Freia Marabou boosted profit, before extraordinary items, by 16
per cent to NKr512m.
Hershey lifted 1991 net income to Dollars 219.52m from Dollars 215.88m. It
said its 1991 activities represented a significant step toward its goal of
increasing worldwide confectionery market share.

NESTLE, the world's largest food group, expects net profits to grow by about
9 or 10 per cent this year from last year's SFr2.47bn (Dollars 164m), Mr
Helmut Maucher, the chairman, said.
Nestle also revealed it plans to split its registered shares 10 for one
later this year and to convert its participation certificates into
registered shares next year.
In the wake of its recent takeover of Source Perrier, the group intends to
establish a headquarters in France for its global mineral water business,
with Mr Serge Milhaud, a long-serving group executive, and a French
national, in charge.
Mr Reto Domeniconi, finance director, said Nestle and its bidding ally,
Banque Indosuez, had more than 80 per cent of the capital of Perrier
following the closing of their offer last Thursday.
He said the net cost of the purchase to Nestle, once the Volvic mineral
water and Caves de Roquefort cheese businesses had been sold, would be just
over SFr2bn.
No new capital needed to be raised to pay for it.
The group's net debt stood at SFr4.5bn at the end of last year, representing
only 26.9 per cent of shareholders' equity, he explained. Also, profits from
the Perrier business were expected to cover the interest costs involved from
the July 1 takeover date.
The addition of Perrier's mineral water assets to Nestle's existing brands
would make the group the largest mineral water supplier in the world with
annual sales of 1bn litres, worth SFr3bn.
Mineral water would then account for about 6 per cent of group sales.
Mr Domeniconi said the group's handling of the takeover would not be
affected by the outcome of the investigation being carried out by the
European Commission's cartel office and due to be completed late in July.
Nestle is taking advantage of a new Swiss law enabling it to split its
shares. The Nestle registered shares now trade at about SFr9,600 each, so
the split would make them more affordable for small investors.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Vauxhall best performer in UK in spite of
45% fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US,
fell by about 45 per cent last year under the impact of the deep recession
in the UK new car market.
The company is expected to reveal today pre-tax profits for 1991 of about
Pounds 133m, against Pounds 239.1m in 1990.
Despite the profit decline, the company achieved the strongest financial
performance of any UK car maker last year.
Ford of Britain, the market leader, suffered a record loss in 1991 of Pounds
470m on ordinary activities excluding Jaguar, while Rover fell to pre-tax
losses of Pounds 83m.
Vauxhall, which is in second place in the UK new car market after overtaking
Rover in 1989, suffered a fall in market share last year to 15.6 per cent
(16.1 per cent). Its sales fell by 23 per cent - against a decline in the
overall market of 20.7 per cent - to 248,704 (323,054).
In the first quarter of this year Vauxhall increased its UK new car market
share from 17.2 per cent to 18 per cent.
Group Lotus, the specialist UK sports car maker and automotive engineering
group which is owned by GM, has disclosed pre-tax losses for 1990 of Pounds
12.7m, compared with losses of Pounds 4.4m a year earlier.
GM has been forced to pump new capital into Group Lotus, where pre-tax
losses have grown rapidly from Pounds 2.1m in 1988.
According to the Group Lotus 1990 accounts filed at Companies House, GM
injected Pounds 13m of additional finance in 1991, some Pounds 6.5m in
equity and the remainder as loans.
Group Lotus turnover in 1990 amounted to Pounds 74.8m (Pounds 63.1m). The
company has suffered heavy losses as it expanded rapidly for the launch of
the new Elan sports car range in 1990.
It then had to contract sharply in the face of recession and the failure of
the Elan to meet expected sales targets.
Group Lotus has not yet disclosed its results for 1991.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Express group, the inter-city coach operator, returned to profit in
the 24 weeks to December 31.
The privately-owned company, which was acquired last year by a consortium of
investors after the 1988 management buy-out from the National Bus Company
lapsed into losses, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.58m from sales of
Pounds 56.1m.
The figures were not comparable to previous periods because of restructuring
undertaken since the consortium gained control.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Haemocell, the USM-quoted maker of medical and surgical equipment,
attributed its increased first-half loss of Pounds 783,000 to the costs of
preparing for the launch of a new drug, S350, in the US.
Absence of US regulatory approval had delayed the launch by at least three
months. The outcome for the second half would be influenced by the timing of
approval.
Turnover in the six months to February 29 rose 63 per cent to Pounds
305,000. In the comparable period a loss of Pounds 608,000 was reported on
sales of Pounds 187,000.
This time administration and other expenses took Pounds 866,000 (Pounds
694,000) and interest payable was Pounds 21,000 against Pounds 3,000
receivable.

options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony Tennant, chairman of Guinness, the drinks group, made a profit of
Pounds 2.87m last year by exercising options on about 900,000 shares granted
to him after he took over the chair in 1987.
Mr Tennant, who is to retire at the end of this year, sold most of the
shares at about 500p each, having been granted the options at prices ranging
from 150p to 180p.
The group's annual report, published on Tuesday, showed that he still holds
145,838 shares and has options on a further 312,090, which must be exercised
within 12 months of leaving the company.
Mr Tennant, who has taken Guinness from a market capitalisation of Pounds
3bn to Pounds 11.5bn and raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 408m to Pounds
956m during the past five years, was paid a total of Pounds 781,000 in
salary and performance-related bonus last year, a rise of 19 per cent in
line with the rise in group profits.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pentland to source for LA Gear in Far East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTLAND Group, the sporting goods distributor, has been appointed sourcing
agent in the Far East for LA Gear, the US sports shoe and clothing maker.
Pentland, best known for its investment in Reebok, which it sold last year,
has also paid Dollars 14m (Pounds 7.9m) for a 6 per cent stake in LA Gear,
the former glamour stock now under new management following losses.
Pentland will source LA Gear mainly from Korea, Taiwan and China.
The agreement lasts until December 1995 and will then continue on a six
month rolling extension basis. Previously, the US company sourced its own
products.
Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said he expected Pentland to source more
than Dollars 300m of business each year for LA Gear. This will partly
replace about Dollars 800m of business lost when Reebok stopped using
Pentland as sourcing agent last December.
'We have been looking for replacements for Reebok, and this is a significant
step,' he said.
Pentland raised about Pounds 389m from the sale of its 32 per cent stake in
Reebok.
It has used the cash to buy Pony shoes, a 20 per cent stake in Adidas and
the worldwide rights to Speedo, the swimwear brand. The company now holds
net cash of about Pounds 265m.
The LA Gear stake was bought at Dollars 11.25 per share, equal to Monday's
closing price. Pentland also has a three-year option to increase the holding
to 7.75 per cent but has agreed not to lift its stake beyond 9.9 per cent.
Earlier this month LA Gear reported a first quarter net loss of Dollars
8.2m, compared with a Dollars 12.5m loss a year earlier.
The company is being reshaped after Trefoil Capital Investors, a fund led by
Mr Roy Disney, vice chairman of the entertainment empire, took a 30 per cent
holding for Pounds 100m.
Mr Farrant said Pentland's stake was opportunistic, as it believed LA Gear
had 'bottomed out'.
Pentland's shares gained 3p to 112p.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Property write-down cuts Hopkinsons to
Pounds 5.16m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profit declined 23 per cent at Hopkinsons Group in the year to
January 31.
After an exceptional item of Pounds 900,000 relating to write-down on
investment property the pre-tax figure came out at Pounds 5.16m (Pounds
6.72m).
Sales at the industrial valve and hydraulic equipment maker rose 24 per cent
from Pounds 47.8m to Pounds 59.4m, including Pounds 22m from the Carbo
industrial abrasives business acquired in October for about Pounds 31m.
The final dividend is maintained at 2.5p, for an unchanged total of 3.7p on
earnings of 4.57p (8.01p).
Mr Tom Weatherby, in his first report as chairman, said shareholders' funds
rose during the year to Pounds 30.3m, after writing off goodwill of Pounds
9.2m on the acquisition. Net borrowings stood at Pounds 9.2m.
Lower orders, mainly on exports, together with the disruption of the
reorganisation, had affected performance at Bryan Donkin, Mr Weatherby said.
Turnover in the drinks dispenser business fell significantly and the
continued improved profits at England-Worthside offset a disappointing
performance at Thermal Refrigeration. The abrasives business continued to be
affected by the recession. Action had been taken to cut costs.

RECESSION in its sector notwithstanding, Brixton Estate achieved a 16 per
cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 27.4m in the year to December
31.
The final dividend is lifted to a proposed 5.2p (4.55p) for a total of 8.1p
(7.1p), a rise of 14 per cent.
The pre-tax result, up from Pounds 23.6m, was struck after higher
administration costs of Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.73m) and an advance in
interest payable on developed properties of Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 17.5m). Net
rental income increased to Pounds 50.7m (Pounds 43.3m).
At the year-end investment properties totalled Pounds 724m (Pounds 702m) and
net assets were Pounds 373m, giving net asset value of 226p, down 8.1 per
cent from the 1990 year-end. By December 31 1991, gearing had grown from 66
per cent to almost 87 per cent.
Retained profits for the year came to Pounds 7.46m (Pounds 6.07m) and
earnings worked through at 12.64p (10.79p) per share.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: N Brown advances 12% to Pounds 15.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
N BROWN, the Manchester- based mail order group which specialises in
womenswear, lifted annual pre-tax profits by 12 per cent as it began to
benefit from a Pounds 20m investment in central warehousing.
However, Sir David Alliance, chairman, said the past year had been the most
challenging he could remember during his business career. Although cautious
about prospects for the current year, he said sales were running ahead of
the previous 12 months.
In the year to February 29, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 14m to Pounds
15.7m, struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 939,000 relating to the
closure of old warehouse sites and retraining of staff. Sales increased by 9
per cent to Pounds 152.6m (Pounds 140.2m).
The three catalogues launched last year contributed Pounds 5m to turnover. A
further Pounds 3.3m in sales was added through the creation of Langley
House, which sells speciality products through newspaper advertisements.
Odhams, the video and CD mail order group bought from the receivers,
contributed Pounds 1.2m to sales in the three months it was included.
Directors said they were aiming to make similar in-fill acquisitions as
opportunities arose.
The operating margin fell from 14.9 per cent to 14.4 per cent as the company
absorbed higher marketing costs but is expected to firm again with the
improved efficiencies from the new warehouse.
Dunlop Heywood, the poorly-performing consultant property surveyors, opened
an additional office during the year and helped improve the profit
contribution from the financial and property services division from Pounds
100,000 to Pounds 400,000.
Following the inflow of Pounds 16.5m cash from last May's rights issue,
interest charges were reduced from Pounds 5.65m to Pounds 4.05m. Brown's
shareholding in Coats Viyella earned Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 205,000).
Earnings fell from 15.67p to 15.1p as the dilutive effects of a one-off
issue of shares to an Employee Share-Ownership Trust (Esot) took their toll.
A recommended final dividend of 4.25p brings the total to 6p (5.65p).
COMMENT
A pygmy in a world of mail order giants, N Brown is able to eke out a
profitable existence by providing niche catalogues to narrow groups of
shoppers. This is a hard task to get right but the company appears to have
developed the concept to a fine art. Although it only accounts for 4 per
cent of the total home shopping market it commands an impressive 21 per cent
of the direct order sector and can now expect to benefit from further
operational efficiencies from substantial investments in distribution and
information systems. Pre-tax profits are expected to rise to about Pounds
19m this year putting the company on a prospective multiple of 16. Some
analysts used the strength of this performance to return the company to
their buy lists. That suggests the shares may be in for a bit of a run and
are certainly worth tucking away when opportunities arise.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Austmin launches rescue plan for Europa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for management control of Europa Minerals, the UK mining finance
house, being waged between Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur,
and Austmin Gold, an Australian exploration company, entered a new phase
yesterday when Austmin gave details of its own rescue plan for Europa.
Austmin said it had prepared a fully underwritten rights issue for Europa on
terms it believed would be better than those recently proposed by the Europa
board.
The Australian group, which is Europa's biggest shareholder with 14.3 per
cent, said institutions which together accounted for more than 40 per cent
of Europa's capital had indicated they would support the proposal.
Henry Ansbacher would act as lead underwriter for a 9-for-4 rights issue at
5p a share. Mr Guido Staltari, Austmin's managing director, said this would
raise Pounds 4.25m gross against the Pounds 3.4m under the board's scheme.
There would also be about 20 per cent less dilution for shareholders not
taking up their rights.
Also, control of Europa would remain with existing shareholders and
'potential domination' by GPG and Mid-East Minerals, two companies in Sir
Ron's orbit, would be avoided.
Austmin's rights issue depends on the outcome of a special meeting on May 7
when the Australian company hopes shareholders will vote to remove all four
of Europa's non-executive directors and put two Austmin representatives on
the board.
Austmin would retain Europa's oil and gas assets and would not dispose of
the Preston colliery.
Mr Staltari pointed out Austmin would limit its shareholding to 19.9 per
cent after the rights issue and was not not seeking to control the board.
Abbey Life, with 9.79 per cent of Europa, said yesterday it would support
the Austmin proposals if they were put. M&amp;G, with 10 per cent, said it was
'supportive' of the Austmin proposals but was still talking to both sides
and had made no final decision about its vote at the special meeting.
Standard Life, a 9 per cent holder, said it had not not made its position
clear to either side.

SEDGWICK Group, the second largest UK insurance broker, has formed a
joint-venture with Ceska Pojistovna, the formerly state-owned Czech insurer
and reinsurer whose privatisation will be completed next week.
Prague-based Ceska Sedgwick Risk Services will oper ate as an independent
company, selling risk manage ment and broking services to domestic Czech
businesses and international companies seeking to invest in Czechoslovakia.
Three local investment funds owned by Czechoslovak banks are expected to own
two thirds of the new privatised company's share capital of Kcs1.64m, over
which local investors will have complete control.
The companies will subsequently seek to place a substantial minority of the
new company with a foreign investor.
Dr Petr Zaruba, director of Ceska's foreign insurance and reinsurance
section, who will be deputy chairman of the new operation, said that this is
an ideal time to be investing in the Czech market which is opening up to
foreign insurers at the end of May.
Ceska has more than 15m policyholders paying premiums in 1990 of Dollars
586m and 8,000 employees in more than 200 offices.
Mr Denville Reed, deputy managing director of the risk services division of
Sedgwick James, part of the retail arm of Sedgwick, has been appointed
managing director of the new company, and Mr Adrian Platt, a director of
Sedgwick, is to be deputy chairman.
Sedgwick has also set up offices in Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow, and a
representative in Romania.

FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins declines to Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED property sales failed to prevent pre-tax profits falling by almost
a third from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 14m in 1991 at Travis Perkins, the UK's
fifth largest builders merchants.
The group, which derives 70 per cent of sales from house construction,
repair, maintenance and improvements, blamed the decline on the deep
recession in residential and commercial property markets.
Mr Tony Travis, chairman, warned that this year was likely to be just as
difficult. He said: 'We have not seen any improvement in output and we are
continuing to make every effort to reduce our cost base.'
Sales by volume during the first three months of this year had fallen by
nearly 2 per cent over a very depressed first quarter last year. Net margins
had fallen by about 1 per cent during the first three months.
Group sales for 1991 fell by 11 per cent from Pounds 348m to Pounds 310m. Mr
Travis said that the fall in pre-tax profits would have been even greater
but for a 70 per cent increase in profits from property sales from Pounds
3.4m to Pounds 5.8m.
Earnings fell to 10.8p (13.8p) just covering a maintained dividend of 8p
after a same again final dividend of 5.5p.
The number of workers employed by the company was reduced last year by 13
per cent to 3,429 as the company moved to reduce costs in the face of
declining sales.
Mr Travis said that bad debts had increased as result of the recession to
1.4 per cent (about Pounds 3.5m) of credit sales. This was about three times
higher than the group would expect in a normal market.
COMMENT
Travis Perkins can find no evidence of a recovery in Britain's depressed
construction sector. Sales and margins remain under pressure despite reports
that UK house sales may be starting to pick up after the election. According
to Mr Travis it can take up to six months for an improvement in the housing
market to work through to increased sales at builders merchants. It will be
sometime after that before prices recover. It therefore looks like being
another tough year for the company along with other British building
material producers and suppliers. Travis, in its favour, has a strong
balance sheet, with net debt currently under 5 per cent of shareholders'
funds. Pre-tax profits this year, assuming lower property sales, could be
around Pounds 14m which would put the group on prospective p/e of more than
20. Too expensive to merit a buy but worth holding for its strong defensive
qualities.

phone service

<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Electric, the privatised regional electricity group, is one of
several new investors in Ionica, a private company planning a new national
telephone service.
Ionica aims to provide a service by putting telephone aerials on roofs and
linking them to the exchange by radio. It hopes to undercut the traditional
wire-line service provided by BT, the UK's largest telecommunications group.
Mr Nigel Playford, Ionica's managing director, said the equity supplied by
new investors was a 'significant' step in the company's establishment, but
refused to say how much had been raised. Yorkshire was similarly
circumspect, saying simply that it had taken a 'modest' stake.
Other investors include Ivory &amp; Sime and Robert Fleming Investment Trust,
the financial institutions, and investors introduced by Fox-Pitt, Kelton,
the Anglo-American banking specialists.
Mr Playford said Yorkshire Electric would co-operate in setting up Ionica's
service as well as providing funds.
Mr Playford said he expected to announce a second 'industrial' partner in
about two months, and that there would be further rounds of financing.
Ionica has also been talking to Mercury Communications, BT's main rival,
about linking up with Mercury's long-distance network.
Ionica has already received telecommunications and radio licences from the
government.

SOTHEBY'S Holdings, the auction house which is controlled by the
Detroit-based Taubman family but still quoted in London and New York, made a
Dollars 5.2m (Pounds 2.93m) loss in the first quarter of 1992.
Auction sales in the first three months of 1992 were Dollars 141.4m,
slightly higher than the Dollars 123.4m seen in the previous year.
The company claimed that the increase was 'consistent with an improving art
market", and that pre-tax earnings were up by over 35 per cent.
Notable sales in the first quarter, included the jewellery auction in St
Moritz which raised Dollars 16.1m, and the sale of Madame Schlumberger's
collection in Monaco, which brought in Dollars 5.2m. The auction house added
that February sales of Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art were 'more
positive' than last year, being 83 per cent sold.

FT  30 APR 92 / Institutions demand fair shares for all: An unusual flexing
of shareholder muscle at Worcester Group's annual meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Worcester Group will meet today and display an unusual
flexing of institutional muscle. They will decide whether to challenge the
sale of the company to Robert Bosch, the privately held German conglomerate.
The case raises critical questions about corporate governance and the extent
to which boards of directors must treat all shareholders equally, even to
the detriment of their own interests.
The Association of British Insurers, the powerful trade body representing
some of the aggrieved shareholders, has also expressed concern about the
issue.
Investors holding at least 25 per cent of Worcester's shares are expected
today to vote to ask the Takeover Panel to review a decision different terms
to management and outside shareholders.
Worcester's management and its families control 38 per cent of the company,
giving them an unusually high degree of influence over the company's fate.
This has allowed them, say some shareholders, to obtain terms which breach
the first principle of the Takeover Code, that all shareholders be treated
similarly by a bidder.
The dissident shareholders are unhappy with two aspects of the deal.
First, they feel the cash price of 225p is too low, with 300p a more
realistic price.
Second, they object to the separate deal being offered to management, who
will have a 32 per cent stake in the merged business, and receive dividends
on their shares. There is a formula to buy them out in 1996 at a price
between 100p and 393 1/2 p depending on the earnings achieved by Worcester
up to then.
'Preserving the interests of non-management shareholders is a very critical
issue,' said one member of the Takeover Panel.
Even if Worcester shareholders fail to press their case, therefore, the
Takeover Panel is likely to take the matter up at one of its quarterly
meetings, the member added.
With cross-border mergers on the rise, the issue is unlikely to die with the
culmination of the Worcester deal.
Continental takeovers are usually agreed deals with management; complaints
by shareholders are rare.
These companies have yet to come to terms with the emerging assertiveness of
UK institutional investors.
In this case, Bosch insisted on obtaining irrevocable commitments from
shareholders totalling more than 50 per cent of the company before its bid
became public.
None of the dissenting shareholders argue against the deal in terms of
industrial logic.
The merger of Bosch's Junkers boiler business with Worcester, the UK's
largest manufacturer of combination boilers, would give a leading position
in two main European markets and a platform from which to dominate the rest
of Europe.
But industrial logic matters little to outside shareholders since they are
being offered cash, not a continuing interest in the merged business.
Mr Cecil Duckworth, chairman and chief executive of Worcester, remains
convinced that the deal with Bosch offers the best future for the company
and its employees.
He acknowledges there is a conflict of interest between 'getting it right
industrially and looking after outside shareholders'.
Originally, he had hoped to negotiate a deal with Bosch under which the
German group would take a 20 or 25 per cent stake initially. But he realised
that it would be 'a bit much to ask Bosch to pay up' to buy the rest of the
group after the benefits of the alliance began to flow through.
The only way forward was a full bid, he says.
He says the 225p offer looked a good premium over the shares' 168p price at
the time terms were struck. But the post-election stock market surge reduced
that premium.
Mr Duckworth points out that at least three large institutional shareholders
considered the price attractive, so Bosch was able to tie up 51 per cent of
the votes.
He thinks that shareholders are only raising the issue of similar treatement
in order to induce Bosch to pay them more for their shares.
The price is considered 'fair and reasonable' by Mr Michael Davies,
Worcester's only independent director.
Mr Davies says he was involved in the negotiations of the 225p price, which
he agrees is 'at the bottom end of the bracket' of valuations. But he says
it is a fair and reasonable price, and his view is backed by Smith New
Court, Worcester's financial adviser. Mr Davies also believes that the
management deal is fair compared with the cash offer.
Dissenting shareholders acknowledge that they are fighting an uphill battle.
Should the Takeover Panel reject their arguments, they could collectively
decline to tender their shares. If holders of more than 25 per cent of the
shares stick together, they could keep the Stock Exchange quotation for the
shares and block any effort by Bosch to restructure its new subsidiary.
Eventually Bosch might have to buy them out at a higher price.
One recent precedent is discouraging for the dissident shareholders,
however. When DRG, the packaging group, was acquired through a Pounds 697m
leveraged bid by Pembridge Investments, unhappy shareholders met to discuss
action but their resistance fell apart when they failed to agree.
Thus, the message for shareholders is that effective activism stems from
collective efforts - a lesson UK institutions are still trying to learn.

FT  30 APR 92 / Williams Holdings sells 9.95% Racal stake for Pounds 81m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday sold the 9.95 per
cent stake in Racal Electronics that it was left owning after its failed
hostile bid last November.
The 139m shares were placed with institutions at 58.5p, netting Williams
Pounds 81m after expenses. Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, said the price
meant the company had 'more or less wiped its face after carrying cost'.
The sale cleans up the loose ends of Williams' third failed hostile bid in
four years and clears the way for other acquisitions, although the proceeds
will initially be used to pay debt.
Mr McGowan said it was unlikely Williams would attempt further hostile bids
in the short term but would concentrate on buying large businesses from
giant companies that are re-focusing on core businesses.
'From the bid point of view, there is not much value around in the London
market,' Mr McGowan said. 'Most of the obvious targets have the bid price
roughly in them.'
Williams is locked in at fixed rates for 10 years for most of its Pounds
130m of debt, so the company had an 'awful lot of flexibility' within its
balance sheet, he said.
The placing by Warburg Securities, joint brokers to Williams, was heavily
oversubscribed, underlining institutional confidence in the value of Racal
after last year's demerger of Vodafone, the cellular network operator.
Sir Ernest Harrison, Racal's chairman, is likely to announce the timing of
the last phase of the unbundling of Racal - the flotation of Chubb, its
security division - when it reports its preliminary results in June.
The flotation will probably take place in the autumn, before which the group
will have to decide how much of Racal's debt is to remain with the group and
how much will go with demerged Chubb.
Bid speculation surrounding Racal has subsided over recent weeks. Mr McGowan
said yesterday that no one had approached Williams about buying its stake in
preparation for a bid.
Instead Racal has derived support from a growing institutional confidence
that Williams' bid had galvanised a sleepy management in Racal's
non-Vodafone businesses.
Mr McGowan said there was no prospect of Williams going back for a second
bid at Racal.
Williams share price rose 7p to 352p on news of the placing while Racal's
was unchanged at 60.5p.

FT  30 APR 92 / Air France and Lufthansa merge luxury hotel chains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE and Lufthansa are to create one of the world's largest luxury and
business class hotel groups by merging their respective Meridien and
Kempinski chains.
The 80-hotel group, including the Hotel Kempinski in Berlin, will have
annual sales of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 565m) and 25,000 employees.
Meridien is already a large player in the business hotel market with 60
hotels worldwide and a strong presence in Asia, Africa and the Middle East
as well as Europe.
Kempinski is still strongest in its native German market, but has expanded
into Asia and North America.
Air France, the French state-owned airline, will be the majority shareholder
in the merged company, but the two airlines have yet to finalise other
details. The hotels will retain their own names.
The merger of the two chains marks another phase in the co-operative
agreement between Air France and Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, which
dates back to 1989. The two companies have since undertaken a number of
joint projects including the construction of a new passenger terminal at
Kennedy airport in New York.
The deal also forms part of the consolidation of the international hotel
industry, notably in the business sector.
It follows the Dollars 2.3bn acquisition of Inter-Continental hotels by
Saison, the Japanese retail and leisure group, and the Dollars 1bn takeover
of the Hilton chain by Ladbroke Group.
Meridien and Kempinski are joining forces at a sensitive time for the
business travel market which has not yet fully recovered from the
devastating effects of the Gulf war in the first quarter of last year.
The industry has since been haunted by the economic slowdown in Europe and
North America, which has affected both the business and leisure travel
markets.
It now faces the threat of a significant slowdown in demand from the
Japanese reflecting the problems of Japan's economy. These problems have
intensified the pressure on the international hotel groups to cut costs by
pooling resources.

FT  30 APR 92 / Rosehaugh cuts loss but warns of difficult year ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSEHAUGH, the ailing property developer, yesterday announced an interim
pre-tax loss of Pounds 31.93m and warned that trading conditions would
remain difficult throughout the year.
'The prospects for new lettings in the London office market have
deteriorated in recent months and the commercial property market as a whole
has continued to trade only at a low level,' it said.
The loss, for the six months to the end of 1991, compared with a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 49.66m the previous period. It reflected a deterioration in
the company's trading position, tempered by fewer provisions against falling
property values.
The company made a loss before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 27.8m,
compared with a profit of Pounds 3.44m a year earlier. Its turnover fell
from Pounds 89.37m to Pounds 23.13m and its interest charge increased from
Pounds 10.32m to Pounds 16.19m. The provisions, which related to the
write-down of stocks in subsidiaries and investments in associates, totalled
Pounds 4.1m, compared with Pounds 53.1m a year earlier.
Rosehaugh said that although trading conditions were difficult, there had
been signs of renewed activity in the residential markets. 'We are pleased
to have the support of our bankers and continue to make every effort to
progress property realisations in an orderly fashion, to contain overhead
and other expenditure wherever possible, and to progress the core actives
for the long-term benefit of the group,' said Mr Leonard Kingshott,
chairman.
Administrative costs fell from Pounds 7.95m to Pounds 7.76m. A further 90
staff have left the group since June 30.
The group realised Pounds 95m from trading and other sales, including the
sale of Rosehaugh Copartnership Developments and a 40.3 per cent
shareholding in its former associate Rosehaugh Greycoat Estates Holdings.
Rosehaugh said that discussions were taking place with potential tenants at
the office complex at Ludgate that is being built by Rosehaugh Stanhope
Development, its joint venture. It has already let 80,000 sq ft.
The loss per share fell from 38.84p to 25.07p. No dividend was proposed.

FT  30 APR 92 / Bank of Scotland profits rise 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF SCOTLAND yesterday reported annual pre-tax profits 5 per cent ahead,
from Pounds 134.1m to Pounds 140.7m, and said it was continuing to increase
its share of the UK banking market.
Operating profit rose 16 per cent to Pounds 393.3m from Pounds 339.4m -
reflecting success in increasing core business - but this was reduced by a
rise from Pounds 202.3m to Pounds 256.8m in provisions for bad and doubtful
debts.
The result for the year to February 29 matched market expectations but the
shares eased 1p to 117p. An analyst said the bank was 'doing better than
other clearers but not better than expected'.
The withdrawal of some capacity from the banking market which reduced excess
competition meant improved margins on new lending and leasing, and higher
fees and commissions.
Earnings per share dipped to 6.4p from 7.56p. The final dividend is 2.65p to
give a total 7.1 per cent ahead at 4.35p.
Operating profit was Pounds 247.9m, up 10 per cent 'against a backcloth of
very difficult trading conditions'. Pre-tax profit was Pounds 99.2m, a 16
per cent rise.
Lending to customers rose 10 per cent to Pounds 12.3bn. About half the
bank's UK lending stemmed from England and Wales.
Mortgage lending on residential property rose from Pounds 3.8bn to Pounds
4.5bn, the largest component of the bank's lending portfolio. Bad-debt
provisions on mortgages rose as a percentage of total mortgages but were not
significant because of the geographical spread of lending and the use of
mortgage indemnity insurance.
Among its subsidiaries, NWS Bank, the finance house, raised pre-tax profits
15 per cent to Pounds 55.1m. However, British Linen Bank, the merchant bank,
moved from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6m to a loss of Pounds 8.9m reflecting
property-related provisions in banking.
Countrywide Banking Corporation of New Zealand saw pre-tax profits fall to
NZDollars 17m (Pounds 5.1m) for the year to June 30 1991 from NZDollars
20.7m, though they rose from NZDollars 6.7m to NZDollars 8m in the first
half.
Group operating expenses rose 13 per cent compared with 17 per cent in 1991,
and the bank shed 335 jobs. Its cost-income ratio was 54 per cent. It is
committed to cutting the ratio to 50 per cent within the next few years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland's results may pass unremarked by a market obsessed by
developments at Midland. Its cost performance bears scrutiny all the same.
Though high by the standards of other clearers, a 13 per cent increase in
costs seems more reasonable when set against a 12 per cent increase in
assets, not to mention a 26 per cent increase in other operating income. The
cost/income ratio fell slightly to 54 per cent and would have been just 48
per cent without the loss of Pounds 108m in interest on non-performing
loans.
How does Bank of Scotland manage to stay in a different league? Given the
debate over rationalisation in banking, the answer is instructive. It relies
heavily on electronic delivery of services and has eschewed the temptation
to develop an extensive branch network south of the border where its loan
book has been growing strongest.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the first quarter figures from the big three German chemical companies
are a guide, investors should not expect too much from ICI's results today.
None of the three holds out much hope of an upturn in trading. All suffered
a bigger percentage fall in profits this quarter than last year as a whole.
With luck, ICI should do a little better. Its restructuring started earlier
and is perhaps more determined. The German companies also suffer by
comparison with a first quarter last year in which the domestic economy was
still enjoying the stimulus of unification. All the same, the message from
Continental producers is uniform and slightly depressing. Germany is down,
the US recovery is patchy and the Far East is getting worse. Bulk chemicals
are still taking a hammering. If, as the market expects, ICI's quarterly
profits are broadly unchanged, it will have its non-cyclical pharmaceuticals
business to thank.

FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Rosehaugh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Serious investors have long since abandoned Rosehaugh to the banks. But
yesterday's comment from the company that prospects for new letting in the
London office market have deteriorated in recent months may still send a
chill down the odd spine. Property shares, after all, have outperformed the
FT-A All-Share by 7 per cent over the last two weeks in the grim hope that
the worst may finally be over.
A touch of realism is certainly overdue from Rosehaugh, but given its new
masters it has no reason to overstate the problems. The fact that the
company managed a Pounds 28m loss before exceptional items in the last six
months of 1992 is a vivid enough illustration of the dismal level of
activity. Shareholders, though, may be more concerned that just 2 per cent
was knocked off staff and administrative costs over the period. To be fair
to Rosehaugh, the company differs from most of its peers in running a large
number of small projects, while its annualised staff and admin total is now
running at a little over Pounds 10m, against Pounds 17.7m for the full year
to 1991. If nothing else, it all goes to show that operational gearing is
not a concept easily applied to the property sector.

FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: CS Holding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding is obviously more optimistic about the prospects for Swiss banks
than the Zurich stock market. Its decision to defer flotation of 20 per cent
of Credit Suisse reflects not just the fact that the move is no longer
necessary to satisfy the country's strict capital requirements. Having
recently brought Mexican banks to the market at 3.5 times net asset value,
it is also reluctant to part with its own assets at less than book.
In fact, the outlook for the larger Swiss banks is not as bad as is
suggested by a weak domestic economy, high interest rates and a depressed
property market. The worst knocks have been taken by regional banks. Because
the domestic rules require capital backing which is high by international
standards, the larger banks have capacity to pick up high margin
international busi-ness as Japanese banks withdraw.
Perhaps yesterday's slight drop in CS Holding's share price was a mark of
investor disappointment that it is not going to return Credit Suisse to them
on the cheap. Some may also be disappointed that part of the dividend is
again to be paid in equity warrants as a means of stocking up further
capital. They might take some consolation, however, from the speed with
which CS First Boston has bounced back from its 1990 losses, as well as from
strong performance from the derivatives business. That said, it would be
dangerous to be beguiled by a 12.4 per cent return on shareholders' equity.
It looks high compared with the likes of UBS and Swiss Bank Corporation. But
compared to them, CS Holding's equity base is still relatively low.

FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: A statement of intent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest salvo from the Accounting Standards Board is not quite as radical
as usual, in that the changes proposed are not strictly compulsory. But it
will do to be getting on with. The new operating review which UK companies
are to include in their annual reports should discuss such novel matters as
cash flow by operating segment and the effect on earnings of inflation. The
financial review should cover peak borrowing requirements and confirmation
that the company can cover them without breaching covenants: or if not, it
should give details of the covenants. It should also specify any
restrictions on moving cash from one part of the group to another, which in
the case of a company like Lonrho might make interesting reading.
The snag is the lack of an enforcing mechanism. Since the proposed statement
does not form part of the accounts, it does not strictly fall within the
remit of the auditors. Without that sanction, the risk is that those very
companies whose statements would be most revealing will fail to produce
them. One answer would be for the Stock Exchange to make statements
compulsory: but the Exchange has not been notably valiant in such causes in
the past. With luck, there would be pressure from the market, which would
take note of the absence of a statement and price the risk accordingly. But
in one or two companies one can think of, lack of information has been in
the price for years without any noticeable effect on management thinking.

FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: Taurus role in cutting cost of share registration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J S WATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter (April 16), Mr Nunnenely, the chairman of the
Institutional Fund Managers' Association, makes the point that to designate
individual investors' holdings within a fund manager's nominee would add to
the cost and complication of administration. He is, of course, correct and I
would suggest that he is somewhat understating the case.
The introduction next year of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's new system for
transferring and registering shares, will significantly simplify and
automate the registration process. It will be perfectly possible and
preferable for fund managers to maintain separate accounts for each investor
so that individual holdings are recorded and visible on the company
register.
The Stock Exchange has already indicated that it may wish to go further once
the Taurus system is in place and make statutory enquiries on any remaining
nominee holdings easier and replies faster.
In the meantime, while we grapple with the existing paper-based system, I
wonder if fund managers could go some way towards relieving the fears of
investors whose holdings are maintained in nominee accounts.
Company registrars must, by law, make the register of shareholders available
to the public for inspection. Fund managers could, voluntarily, make the
underlying investor detail of a nominee company available on request to
clients or their auditors.
Such an offer would allay many fears and would make it clear that nominees
are currently used to ease the administrative burden and are not there to
hide impropriety.
The nominee system is a well-established means of reducing the already vast
amount of paper involved in transferring and registering shares; until
Taurus removes all the paper from the system, it is unreasonable to expect a
big change.
A voluntary disclosure of underlying shareholders would enable a swift
transition to Taurus without having to multiply the paper handling costs in
the interim.

FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: Rate cut is the cure for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFFREY GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If economists will disregard textbook theory and look at the empirical
evidence they will realise that high interest rates are causing the big
increase in the money supply in Germany, not curing it.
It appears that the endowment effect is particularly strong in Germany and
increased interest rates have caused bank profits to leap. Profits attract
capital, and capital provides the base for the expansion of credit. One
German bank has already announced a huge rights issue and the effect of that
is inevitable.
No doubt intensive marketing of credit will overcome any borrower resistance
that higher rates of interest might engender.
We have seen this process occur several times in Britain. One example is
enough: the huge Barclays Bank rights issue in 1988 was used as a base to
increase the credit supply by Pounds 41bn by the end of 1989.
If the credit explosion gets out of hand, the result is bankruptcies and
recession as we in Britain well know. Excessive increases in bank capital
wherever they take place bring nearer the likelihood of a 1929-style
calamity.
Textbook theorists claim that it was the lowering of interest rates in May
1988 that precipitated the credit explosion. The evidence suggests
otherwise. Lending for acquisitions and mergers - the main cause of the
asset price inflation - was at its highest in the third quarter of 1989 when
base rates were 14 per cent.
The Bundesbank will save Germany and the world a lot of grief if it sharply
reduces its discount rate.

FT  30 APR 92 / Personal View: The new utopias that threaten Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUES CALVET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Marxism already been replaced as a political and economic utopia, so
soon after its demise?
One would think so, to see the influence of liberalism and federalism in
shaping tomorrow's Europe. These new ideals have fostered new utopias which
pose a serious threat to the European Community's future, both economic and
political.
On the economic front, the dangers are threefold: competition policy, free
trade and monetarism. Of these, competition policy is the most significant.
Liberal influence underlies most of the European Commission's powers to deal
with trusts, abuses of dominant positions and government subsidies.
Although administered with the greatest restraint until the economic
expansion of the 1980s, competition policy was given disproportionate
importance by two energetic, opinionated competition commissioners, Mr Peter
Sutherland and then Sir Leon Brittan, relegating the Treaty of Rome's other
policies to secondary roles. Recently, its reach has even extended to
regulating industrial concentration, a master stroke of the French
presidency which rebounded on it in the De Havilland affair, when the
Commission outlawed the planned takeover of the Canadian aircraft company by
Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
At the same time, the Commission launched a witch-hunt against state
subsidies, which seriously harmed several EC-owned companies, but did not
touch the European subsidiaries of their US and Japanese competitors.
European - and especially French - businesses thus find themselves hamstrung
on their home turf.
The second false utopia is free trade, consecrated in late 1985 by the
signing of the Single Act. Although the vast new market, with its
elimination of internal borders, was supposed to be a giant step forward for
Europe, it was nothing new for large corporations, for which these frontiers
had long been merely symbolic. The policy would not have been so bad if a
common border to separate the EC from the outside world had been
established. But Europe unilaterally disarmed without anything in exchange.
In the auto industry, Europe had to beg Tokyo for an agreement that will
offer Europe's car market to the Japanese on a silver platter. Since then,
European carmakers have all announced redundancies, some of which will be
huge.
Even including the jobs that will be created by transplants, the European
car industry will lose 70,000 employees by 1996. The Japanese car industry
will gain 50,000 jobs over the same period. The European policy that creates
this situation has to be strange.
The third and most recent false utopia is monetarist economics, which
emerged with force in Maastricht. The proposed economic and monetary union
uses solely monetarist criteria - inflation rates, enforced parities,
long-term interest rates and balanced budgets - to arrive at a single
European currency.
Those who drew up the treaty forgot to organise any co-ordination of
national economic policies, without which union can never occur. So the
treaty needlessly sacrifices the state's essential rights, and does nothing
to solve the real problem: the Ecu's parities with the dollar and the yen.
We therefore urgently need to return to reality, and thus to business, which
was largely ignored by the Treaty of Rome and which today is threatened by
the treaty's blind application. Economic success will never come from an
ideology, whether it be protectionist or free trade. On the other hand,
economies that really work, like Japan or Germany, owe their success to
something else: the primacy of business, and the marshalling of all the
nation's vital forces to serve it. Europe must therefore return to three
economic truths:
Europe is not a marketplace inhabited only by consumers. Establishing a
central European authority does not mean creating a power that decides
between good and evil, but one that has the best interests of business at
heart. Europe does not care about a competition policy; it needs an
industrial policy. Concentration must be facilitated, not condemned, and
alliances encouraged, as long as they are forged between Europeans.
Subsidies must be authorised, as long as they are granted equally and within
the framework of a European development policy.
A market economy's freedom of action cannot be organised through coercion
and intimidation. There must be a political body that sets rules that are
clear-cut, stable and the same for everybody, and these rules must favour
European companies. Lastly, Europe must stop being afraid of itself. The
so-called 'global economy' is merely a smokescreen for European
faint-heartedness and US and Japanese ambition. Europe will never be the
leading industrial power unless it defends its interests and takes up the
same arms as its rivals.
If we do not come back to these simple principles, we must realise that the
current utopias will bring the downfall of our businesses and the
disappearance of our states.
The return of economic utopias goes hand in hand with the resurgence of a
political utopia: federalism.
The centralisation of power leads away from democracy. National parliaments
are incapable of keeping track of the twists and turns of decisions of a
handful of experts. Day in and day out, these technocrats alter economic
realities that none of them understands or cares about.
But since Maastricht, federalism has become the official doctrine, even if
the term itself was deleted at the last minute at the UK's request. This is
particularly disturbing at a time when federal systems are falling apart all
over the world, as we can see in Russia, Lebanon, Belgium, Canada and, more
tragically, Yugoslavia.
Moreover, federalism in Europe is incapable of coping with two important
challenges. The first is German expansion. Each day Mitteleuropa is becoming
a more powerful reality. It takes an unusual Lilliputian complex to believe
that the ties of federalism will lessen the giant's strength. Federalism is
based on fear.
The EC - and this is the second challenge - is a victim of its own success.
Candidates from all sides are flocking to join. Considering the Community
already works poorly with 12 members, would it be manageable with 19 or 25?
It is imperative that the Community's executive branch be inter-governmental
in nature. While it would be tempting to introduce majority rule for the
sake of efficiency, this is unacceptable when essential interests are at
stake.
Furthermore, states must delegate only the minimum authority to Brussels.
And we must restore the power of national parliaments, rather than
strengthen a European Parliament that so far has failed to be convincing.
Today Europe has come to the moment of truth. It will not find salvation in
naive or outdated doctrines. What we need is neither 'more Europe' nor 'less
Europe' but rather 'another Europe'.
