FT  23 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bad news from financials hits market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of bad news from the banking and insurance sectors plus
disappointment with the latest official figures on bank and building society
lending put paid to early hopes that London's equity market could build on
some big early gains yesterday.
The effects of recent earnings downgrades for some of the UK's biggest
companies added to the gloom. By the close the market was on its heels, and
suffering from successive bouts of profit-taking.
The FT-SE 100-share Index ended a busy session at the day's low point,
closing a net 18 points off at 2,607.8.
One of the few encouraging signs was an upturn in the level of business.
Turnover expanded to 617.4m shares, well ahead of Tuesday's 420m shares when
the value of customer business fell to Pounds 867m, compared with last week
when figures above Pounds 1bn were recorded on each trading day.
Turnover was boosted considerably by at least five programme trades executed
yesterday, with the majority said to have been weighted to the sell side.
The market got off to an excellent start, as the Footsie index posted a 15.4
points rise during the first hour of trading, on buying stimulated by a
strong pound which in turn prompted more talk of a cut in domestic interest
rates. The Footsie future also provided comfort for the cash market,
maintaining a good premium throughout the day.
Downside pressure began to emerge, however, in mid-morning with the impact
of two programme trades, plus gloomy news from Abbey National and Legal &amp;
General. Shortly afterwards the market was unsettled by the Pounds 500m
decline in bank and building society lending during March, compared with
market expectations of a rise of about Pounds 2bn.
Ensuing selling pressure, although never more than light, was sufficient to
lower the Footsie for the rest of the day, with sentiment additionally
weakened by a weak opening on Wall Street.
Senior traders were not unduly perturbed by the market's latest decline,
pointing out that the long three-week account ends on Friday and a period of
consolidation was needed after the 250-point rise that followed the Tory
election victory. 'The market may be looking ragged but the underlying firm
tone remains intact,' said one dealer.
New business figures from insurance group Legal &amp; General were viewed as
disappointing and triggered a wholesale retreat throughout the life and
composite insurance sectors, which provided six of the market's worst ten
performers yesterday. The gloomy message from Abbey National's annual
meeting led to a round of profits downgrades and a flurry of selling of
Abbey shares.
On the other hand, there were good gains from the utilities sector, notably
the Scottish generators ahead of the 70p-a-share call on the stock which has
to be paid by May 5.
Takeover rumours continued to surround Dowty Group, the
aerospace/engineering group, with TI Group said to be a potential predator.
The market took seriously stories that Hanson was about to unload its 2.8
per cent stake in ICI to help fund another takeover move.

FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Car stocks feature in quiet
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CAR-RELATED stocks feat-ured in quiet Continental trading, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw some activity in Volkswagen but otherwise trading was dull as
traders extended their Easter holidays. The DAX index gained 6.80 to
1,753.30 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 2.4 to 713.88.
Turnover increased to DM5.5bn from DM3.8bn.
Volkswagen advanced DM8.10 to DM381.80 on strong US interest following a
positive report by Morgan Stanley, which was published just before Easter.
Other car shares were mixed, with BMW putting on DM2 to DM586 while Porsche
eased DM1 to DM548.
Banks remained firm. Deutsche Bank appreciated DM5.60 to DM722.90, while
Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank moved up DM1 apiece to DM267.80 and DM358
respectively. James Capel recommended switching out of Dresdner into the
other two banks, because it did not expect Dresdner's earnings performance
for this year to be above-average.
PARIS was quietly firmer ahead of the close of the April trading account
today. The CAC-40 index closed 3.32 higher at 1,983.68, down from the day's
peak of 1,993.77, in modest turnover of FFr2.4bn.
The auto sector was active, with Peugeot gaining FFr19 to FFr730, while
Michelin rose FFr4.70 to FFr193.70 in heavy volume of 1.2m shares. Both
issued 1991 results last week.
Pechiney CIPs jumped FFr11.90 or 3.3 per cent to FFr377.90 while Pechiney
International rose FFr1.80 to FFr205.20 ahead of its 1991 results due this
morning. The company is also expected to give details of its restructuring,
whereby the aluminium and trade activities will be transfered to the parent.
MILAN got some support from Fiat and Pirelli but official trading was over
by 12.30 pm due to a lack of interest. Dealers were depressed by the fall in
daily volume on Tuesday to its lowest level since April 1985, which they
blamed on the delay in forming a new government. The Comit index added 0.81
at 507.14 in turnover estimated at L40bn, after Tuesday's L36.7bn.
Fiat eased L16 to L4,800 at the official fixing but rose to L4,875 after Mr
Paolo Canterella, Fiat Auto's managing director, said the subsidiary would
make a profit this year and that the model range would be completely renewed
by 1996.
Pirelli attracted interest from London, rising L21 to L1,296 at the fixing
and reaching L1,318 after hours.
STOCKHOLM closed broadly lower in heavy trade. The Affarsvarlden general
index fell 2.6 to 980.0 as turnover rose to SKr491m from SKr239m.
The decline was led by Astra, whose B free share tumbled SKr13 or 2.4 per
cent to SKr527. Some analysts attributed the fall to a general switching out
of pharmaceutical into cyclical stocks, as well as the company's recent
decision not to open up more of Astra's share capital to foreigners.
BRUSSELS rose on the last day of the forward market account. The Bel-20
index advanced 3.76 to 1,199.19 in high turnover of BFr1.10bn.
Petrofina and Electrabel were the most heavily traded stocks, with the
former rising BFr50 to BFr10,700 and the latter dipping BFr10 to BFr4,905.
ZURICH was firmer, the SMI index gaining 14.2 to 1,874.7.
The chemical sector improved after Ciba-Geigy forecast strong growth in
1992. Its registered shares put on SFr30 to SFr3,520 and its bearers were
SFr20 stronger at SFr3,480. Roche certificates were up SFr20 at SFr3,170.
AMSTERDAM rose in moderate volume. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.7 at
126.9 in turnover of Fl 572.4m.
Nedlloyd was the main feature after reporting a return to profit in 1991,
although some analysts noted that the results were boosted by sales of
non-core divisions. The stock closed 60 cents down at Fl 54.60. Pakhoed and
Daf both improved Fl 1 to Fl 42.90 and Fl 24.70 respectively.
MADRID's general index receded 1.43 to 251.41. Telefonica lost Pta35 to
Pta1,090 after delaying a planned increase in domestic tariffs.
OSLO slipped, although the shipping index remained firm. The all-share index
fell 2.49 to 421.03 in NKr273.59m turnover.

FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow little changed in two-way
activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were little changed in strong two-way trading yesterday,
which suggested that investors remained divided about the outlook for
corporate earnings and stock market values, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 4.48 down at 3,338.77. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.45 to 409.81, but the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks edged 3.18 higher to 578.23. Turnover on the New
York SE was a brisk 219m shares, and declines narrowly led rises by 870 to
837.
For the second day, trading was hampered by uncertainty about the near-term
direction of share prices. After last week's big gains, achieved in the wake
of better than expected first-quarter corporate results, some investors
appeared concerned that the market might have overreached itself, while
others seemed confident that a further improvement in earnings over the next
three quarters justified continued buying.
First-quarter results flooded in, moving a variety of stocks. Transamerica
forged ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 46 1/2 after the insurance and financial
services group reported a record first-quarter operating income of Dollars
80.7m.
Also reporting record first-quarter profits was Anheuser Busch, the
country's biggest brewer, which nevertheless lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52
7/8 after news of an 11.5 per cent improvement in net income to Dollars
224m.
Other stocks higher on earnings news included Harley-Davidson, up Dollars
3/4 at Dollars 57 1/2 , the publishing group Times Mirror, Dollars  3/8
higher at Dollars 36 3/8 , and Caterpillar, which rose Dollars 2 to Dollars
56 3/4 after reporting a Dollars 132m loss, smaller than forecast.
Citicorp, which revealed higher profits on Tuesday, climbed a further
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 19 1/2 after PaineWebber, the broking house,
upgraded its rating on the bank's stock from 'unattractive' to 'neutral'.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, which recently led other domestic carriers
with a dramatic overhaul of its fare structure, fell Dollars 2 3/4 to
Dollars 65 3/4 after British Aerospace said AMR would buy 15 of BAe's
Jetstream planes.
Ralston Purina firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/4 after the company said
it was spinning off its Continental Banking division.
Dow Chemical firmed  1/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 in spite of a 32 per cent fall in
first-quarter operating income to Dollars 531m, while Bristol-Myers Squibb
shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 72 5/8 after predicting that 1992 full-year
income would rise by between 15 to 17 per cent.
On the Nasdaq market, Intel rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 in turnover
of 1.9m shares after announcing plans to reduce prices on its 'flash'
microchips in what may herald a price-cutting war among makers of memory
chips and disk drives.
Amgen dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 55 in spite of first-quarter net
income of 43 cents a share, up from 26 cents a year ago.
Canada
THE Canadian dollar again took centre stage on the Toronto stock market as
equities partially recovered from a fresh early fall after the currency
showed some revival later in the day. The currency was sold off on Tuesday
and early yesterday due to concern over Olympia &amp; York.
The composite index picked up from a day's low of 3,361.6 to close a net 13
points down at 3,367.7. Declines outpaced advances by 325 to 229 after
volume of 26.3m shares.
Nine of 14 stock groups closed lower, led by the real estate group, which
fell a further 3.7 per cent.

FT  23 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling put firmly in spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAVE of overnight buying put sterling firmly in the spotlight on currency
markets yesterday, writes James Blitz.
Having closed at DM2.9140 the previous night, the currency opened in London
at DM2.9310 yesterday and closed at DM2.9308. It also strengthened against a
lifeless dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.7630, compared with Dollars 1.7480
previously. In New York it ended at Dollars 1.7625.
By the end of the day, sterling had clambered above the French franc in the
ERM grid for the first time since it joined the system in October 1990,
reaching its best levels for nearly a year.
Traders said overnight buying of sterling, estimated to be around Pounds
400m, came from a number of sources, including Singapore and another Far
East Asian state.
One trader explained the pound's popularity as a reaction to better news
about the UK economic recovery. He also said that foreign investors had been
short in sterling assets. There were claims, too, that investors were
gambling on the possibility that sterling would soon enter the narrow band
of the EMS.
By contrast, the D-Mark had a bad day, ending weaker against most
currencies. According to Mr Julian Simmonds of Citibank, uncertainty about
the German currency may be linked to the run-up to this weekend's G7 meeting
in Washington. 'There is a feeling that the G7 will push for lower interest
rates in Germany to promote growth throughout Europe,' he said. 'That is why
the Mark is being sold.'
The D-Mark dropped to its lowest level for a year against the French franc,
closing at FFr3.3773 from FFr3.3795. Fears of a strike by German public
sector workers also unsettled the currency.
The French unit was at its highest level in a year against the D-Mark on a
combination of corporate demand and investor confidence that the government
of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, will keep the French
franc strong.
In late Asian trading, the dollar ended steady against the yen and the
D-Mark on continued bullish sentiment. Earlier it reached a high of Y134.58,
after which strong resistance prompted dealers to take profits. The dollar
closed in Tokyo at Y134.25 and DM1.6701.
In London, the US currency continued to sag, slipping from DM1.6700 to
DM1.6635. Traders said operators saw no reason to buy dollars until they
have fresh information on the state of the US economy. The next pointers are
due today with the publication of US durable goods orders for March, and
latest weekly jobless claims.
In the US, the dollar was softer against most currencies at midday after
swaying delicately in narrow trading bands throughout the morning. The US
unit finished New York trading at Y134.20/27 and DM1.6620/25.

FT  23 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates stay firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JUMP in the value of sterling overnight fuelled early speculation of a
cut in base rates, although that enthusiasm was later dampened. This was the
chief factor in an otherwise quiet day of money market dealing.
The June short sterling contract opened higher at 89.84, having closed the
previous evening at 89.78. However, it ended the day unchanged on the
previous night's figure, indicating an implied interest rate of 10.22 per
cent.
The three-month Interbank rate, a key indicator of future base rate
movements stood at 10 1/2 - 7/16 per cent.
Overnight rates trod a similar course, peaking at 11 1/2 per cent before
finishing the day at 10 7/8 per cent. The main reason for that rise was the
larger than expected liquidity shortage forecast by the Bank of England in
the discount money market.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.3bn shortfall, some Pounds 500m
bigger than many in the market had been expecting.
One dealer said: 'We were slightly taken aback by the size of the shortage.
A lot of bills were sold last week to pay for gilt sales and people are
short of the sort of paper that they want to sell.'
The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.15bn.
In early operations the Bank of England found takers for a mere Pounds 100m
of a 15-day repurchase agreement at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent.
Later, the bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 56m sterling, of which
Pounds 26m were outright band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds
30m for resale to the market on May 11 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per
cent.
In afternoon trading the bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 725m and
provided further assistance of Pounds 25m.
German call money rose after the Bundesbank drained liquidity with this
week's repurchase tender, but experts did not see the rise as a sign of
tighter policy ahead of Thursday's central bank council meeting.
Money market dealers quoted call money at 9.70 per cent after Tuesday's
9.65/70 per cent. Dealers and economists saw the Bundesbank making no policy
changes, but expected it to keep call money very close to the 9.75 per cent
Lombard rate while waiting for signs of a slowdown in money supply growth
and Bonn government spending.

FT  23 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Dealers disappointed at investors'
response to auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN a quiet market, US Treasuries eased slightly yesterday after an afternoon
auction of two-year notes that left dealers mildly disappointed at the
response from investors.
In the absence of fresh economic reports, the attention of investors and
dealers was firmly focused on the Treasury's sale of Dollars 14.75bn in
two-year notes. The two-years were trading at 5.41 per cent in when-issued
form just before the auction, and the sale was completed soon after with an
average yield of 5.42 per cent, which suggested investors had approached the
new issue cautiously.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/32 at 99
1/2 , yielding 8.038 per cent, while at the short end of the market the
two-year note was  1/16 lower at 100 5/8 , yielding 5.386 per cent. Trading
activity was reported to be light.
THE UK government bond market marked time as investors digested news of the
latest Pounds 2.5bn auction, due to be launched next Wednesday. The 25-year
bonds were quoted yesterday in partly-paid form to yield around 9 per cent,
almost identical with yields on other benchmark gilt issues with maturities
stretching to 15 years and beyond.
Analysts expect a successful auction to provide gilts with another lift,
giving a new lease of life to the post-election rally which has run out of
steam this week. A lacklustre response, though, could point to a difficult
period ahead for the heavy UK borrowing programme.
Yesterday, sterling's strength on the foreign exchange market - widely
attributed to strong buying overnight in the Far East - helped gilts to get
off to a good start. Money supply figures for March, which showed weaker
growth than had been expected, added to the positive mood for the bond
market.
The figures were taken with a pinch of salt in some quarters, though, since
they related to the month ahead of the UK election, when uncertainty about
the outcome generally held back activity.
The 9 per cent gilts maturing in 2011 opened slightly firmer at 99 11/32 and
traded higher to end the day at around 99 19/32 , giving a yield of 9.04 per
cent. The 9 3/4 per cent gilts maturing in 2002, meanwhile, gained  3/32 to
end the day at 103 27/32 .
ELSEWHERE in Europe, government bond markets drifted up in thin trade. In
France, there were reports of switching out of 10-year and into five-year
bonds as some investors positioned themselves for a possible interest rate
cut, encouraged by a strong performance from the franc.
However, such flurries of activity are still widely seen as highly
speculative, given last autumn's failure to sustain a French interest rate
cut.
Yields on French 10-year bonds remained stubbornly over 70 basis points,
despite widespread expectations of a decline in the wake of the recent
government reshuffle. Fears of fiscal easing, and political concerns about
next year's national elections, continue to figure high in most investors'
minds.
German government bond prices edged up in listless trading as the market
continued to await a new direction for bunds. One possible source for such a
direction is the public sector pay dispute: with a strike ballot starting
yesterday, the market may not have to wait much longer for a resolution.
Technical trading helped the futures contract on Liffe to a gain on the day,
rising from its opening of 87.94 to end the day at 87.95.
AFTER their setbacks of recent days, Japanese government bonds marked time
yesterday. With a sombre mood still hanging over the market, the yield on
the benchmark bond no 129 rose on the day to 5.645 per cent, from 5.625 per
cent the day before.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Ralston may spin off baking
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RALSTON Purina, the consumer products company which last week acquired the
UK Ever Ready battery business from Hanson for Dollars 227m, announced
yesterday it is considering the spin-off of its baking subsidiary to
shareholders.
The subsidiary, Continental Baking Company, claims to be the nation's
largest wholesale baker of fresh delivered bread and sweet baked goods, and
makes about 250,000 direct sales calls and deliveries each day. Its brands
include the 'Wonder' bread products and 'Twinkies' cupcakes.
The bakery business was bought by Ralston in 1984 from ITT, the big
conglomerate. In the year to end-September, it had sales of around Dollars
1.97bn, and total assets of around Dollars 765m. Its operating profit was
around Dollars 140m, after environmental and restructuring charges of
Dollars 17m.
The 'demerger' plan will be reviewed by directors of Ralston, based in St
Louis, on May 28. Even if it is approved, tax clearances and other technical
matters will take sometime to resolve, and the transaction would probably
not take place for another nine to 12 months.
However, Ralston said the demerger, if completed, would probably involve a
dividend of up to Dollars 600m being paid from Continental Baking Company to
Ralston. The stock market immediately marked Ralston shares Dollars 1 1/4
higher, at Dollars 48 3/4 , while Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency,
affirmed its debt ratings.
Ralston's proposed moves come amid a modest spate of demergers in the US -
ranging from Union Carbide, with its industrial gases business, to Dial
Corporation with its financial services division.
Ralston said the aim of the move was 'to enhance shareholder value by
focusing more specifically on its other core businesses'. The bakery market
in the US - in common with the UK - is a mature industry, with total sales
of Dollars 7.4bn and static volumes in 1991. Continental saw lower volumes
in 1991, although higher margins meant operating profit was flat.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: JP Morgan set to lead manage
public offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. MORGAN is destined to become the first US commercial bank since the
1930s to lead manage a public offering of common stock when it underwrites
the forthcoming flotation of an 18 per cent stake in Riverwood
International, a paperboard and packing company.
The bank's role as lead underwriter was revealed on Tuesday in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. No date for the offering has been
set.
The underwriting will be the biggest step so far in the dismantling of the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which established a clear division between
securities and banking business after the 1929 stock market crash and the
Great Depression.
In recent years US financial regulators have gradually allowed commercial
banks to participate in securities and investment banking business. In
January 1989 the Federal Reserve granted banks the authority to underwrite
debt securities, and in September 1990 J. P. Morgan was allowed to
underwrite stock offerings.
Until now, however, no bank has lead underwritten a stock issue, although J.
P. Morgan and Bankers Trust have participated in offerings as co-managers.
Although securities companies have lobbied against attempts to dismantle
Glass-Steagal, they have failed to persuade regulators that J. P. Morgan, a
blue-chip name with one of the banking industry's strongest balance sheets,
should not be allowed to participate in equity underwriting.
Securities houses have been protective of their equity underwriting
franchise because lead managing an initial public offering is one of the
most profitable businesses.

SUN Microsystems, the leading US manufacturer of computer workstations,
yesterday unveiled a 5 per cent improvement in third-quarter net income to
Dollars 61.4m, or 60 cents a share, on revenues that rose 12 per cent to a
record Dollars 952.2m.
The company, based in Mountain View, California, had net income of Dollars
58.7m, or 56 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter, on revenues of
Dollars 848.3m.
On Wall Street, Sun Microsystems' shares have been volatile recently amid
concern that it would not be able to live up to expectations of tremendous
growth. The company has been one of the fastest-growing in the computer
industry.
The results were released after trading closed yesterday, but analysts said
the earnings had been better than expected. The stock closed Dollars  1/2
higher at Dollars 26 1/4 in active trading.
For the first nine months, Sun had net income of Dollars 135.6m, or Dollars
1.34, up 9 per cent from Dollars 123.9m, or Dollars 1.21, in the same period
of the 1991 fiscal year. Revenues advanced 15 per cent to Dollars 1.62bn.
Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer, said demand in the third quarter
had been particularly strong in the Pacific rim, especially in Japan. Growth
was more modest in the US and Europe.

earnings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INCO, the western world's biggest nickel producer, barely broke even in the
first quarter, as sagging metal prices, lower shipments and higher unit
costs slashed earnings from its mining operations.
Net earnings slid to USDollars 2.2m, or one cent a share, from Dollars
53.6m, or 50 cents.
Sales fell almost a fifth to Dollars 680m, while operating earnings in the
primary metal division slumped to Dollars 42m from Dollars 136m. The alloys
and engineered products division suffered a small operating loss.
First-quarter shipments of almost all metals were lower. Nickel deliveries
slipped to 121m lb from 136m lb. Copper shipments fell to 59m lb from 75m
lb, and platinum-group metals fell to 69,000oz from 86,000oz. Finished
nickel inventories rose to 60m lb on March 31, from 45m lb three months
earlier.
The average nickel price received by the company fell to Dollars 3.59 per lb
from Dollars 3.94 a year earlier. Refined copper prices slipped to 99 cents
from Dollars 1.10 per lb. Inco does not disclose unit production costs, but
these are understood to be around Dollars 2.50 per lb of nickel and Dollars
1.60 per lb of copper.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas slides 10%
after Dollars 80m loss provision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
10 per cent drop in first-quarter net earnings after taking an Dollars 80m
pre-tax provision for losses on the C-17 military transport aircraft it is
developing for the Pentagon.
The C-17 has been at the centre of a long-running controversy between the
company and certain Pentagon officials who have alleged that the fixed-price
programme has suffered from severe cost overruns. McDonnell Douglas has
repeatedly denied this and yesterday's provision is small relative to the
size of the Dollars 6.6bn programme.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 52m, or Dollars 1.34 a share,
compared with Dollars 58m, or Dollars 1.50, in the same period of last year,
after taking the provision. But it added that earnings would have been up 74
per cent without the charge, with an improved financial performance across
most aerospace programmes. Revenues were little changed at Dollars 4.15bn,
against Dollars 4.24bn.
Its commercial aircraft operations saw operating earnings rise Dollars 15m
to Dollars 43m and its missiles, space and electronics systems business
produced a Dollars 14m rise to Dollars 54m. The C-17 provision cut the
military aircraft segment's profits to Dollars 41m.
The figures were also helped by a Dollars 28m reduction in interest expense
on its aerospace side and Dollars 17m of pension income, thanks to a change
in actuarial assumptions.
The company said the C-17 loss was caused by estimated cost growth in the
portion of the programme which included research, development and the first
six production aircraft. This was now 90 per cent complete. Losses in this
area had been partly offset by performance on the four following production
aircraft.
The figures underlined the softened market for civilian aircraft. McDonnell
Douglas has substantially reduced its high level of indebtedness over the
past year but in this quarter the trend was reversed.
Aerospace debt at March 31 was Dollars 2.57bn, up from Dollars 2.39bn at the
end of December. The company said this was due primarily to reduced
commercial aircraft deliveries and lower bookings.

SHARES IN Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group,
bounced Dollars 3 higher to Dollars 46 1/2 at close of trade yesterday,
following news of sharply higher first-quarter profits.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 83.6m after tax, as against Dollars
57.2m (before an item to cover accounting changes) last year, with earnings
per share up from 70 cents to Dollars 1.04.
Transamerica's insurance operations turned in Dollars 55.8m, compared with
Dollars 77.6m in the same period last year.
This was primarily due to the US company's reduced stake in Sedgwick, the
UK-based insurance broker which now stands at 25 per cent, compared with 39
per cent a year earlier.
The life business reported earnings of Dollars 43.7m, up from Dollars 39.1m
in the first quarter of 1991.
On the finance side the commercial lending division moved into the black -
reporting a Dollars 3.1m profit, compared with a Dollars 24.4m loss last
time.
Consumer lending went ahead to Dollars 24.6m, against Dollars 22.9m the year
before.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Sharp decline at Dow Chemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOW CHEMICAL, the US chemicals group, yesterday turned in a 32 per cent
decline in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 531m, reflecting
sharply lower prices in 1992.
Dow's net income for the first three months of this year fell to Dollars
171m or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 578m or Dollars 2.13 the previous
year.
Last year's results include the benefits of a one-time gain from an initial
public offering of stock in Destec Energy, and higher prices linked to the
Gulf war.
Sales in the latest quarter slid 6 per cent to Dollars 4.64bn from Dollars
4.95bn.
The results continue to reflect the weak state of the US chemicals industry.
Dow's earnings have fallen steadily since 1989 when it turned in record
profits of Dollars 2.49bn or Dollars 9.20 a share.
Mr Frank Popoff, president and chief executive, said comparisons with last
year were very difficult 'because of the rapid escalation of prices during
the Gulf war.
'The good news is that pricing has become relatively stable over the past
six months, feedstock costs have declined and we have probably reached the
bottom of the economic cycle in the US.'
Dow's chemical and performance products division saw a 56 per cent drop in
first-quarter operating income to Dollars 95m, although product sales fell
only 9 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn.
Dow said that the decline was led by chlorinated solvents and softer demand
for caustic soda, although vinyl chloride showed signs of volume recovery.
The group's plastic products division also suffered a 56 per cent decline in
operating income to Dollars 95m on a 10 per cent fall in sales to Dollars
1.6bn.
Dow's hydrocarbons and energy business posted an operating loss of Dollars
30m, compared with operating income of Dollars 24m, while sales fell 30 per
cent to Dollars 385m.
The company's consumer specialties division - which brought in more than
half of Dow's total operating income of Dollars 1.7bn in 1991 - had
first-quarter operating income of Dollars 342m, up 17 per cent from the
previous year.
Sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn.
Mr Popoff said that the company remained optimistic it would have 'positive
earnings momentum during the second half of 1992', although the chemical
industry tends to lag any upward economic movement by as much as six months.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Mobil declines on fall in oil
and natural gas prices
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOBIL, the US oil and gas group, yesterday unveiled dramatically lower
first-quarter earnings, reflecting soft prices for natural gas and crude oil
and a charge to cover job cuts.
Net income for the first three months of 1992 dropped to Dollars 127m or 28
cents a share from Dollars 710m or Dollars 1.73 a share last year. Stripping
out Dollars 86m or restructuring costs in the latest quarter, Mobil's
operating income declined to Dollars 213m from Dollars 710m a year earlier.
During the latest quarter, Mobil said it would cut up to 1,000 jobs from US
exploration and production by the end of the year and took charges of
Dollars 105m to cover both the job reductions and an unproductive well in
Peru.
Mr Allen Murray, chairman, blamed the slow rate of economic growth worldwide
for the unsatisfactory first-quarter earnings. 'Our worldwide facilities
turned in a very good operating performance but oil and gas prices decreased
and downstream and chemical margins were squeezed.'
On Wall Street, shares in Mobil edged Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 61 3/4
at close of trading.
Mr Paul Mlotok, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he had expected a poor
first quarter and had not readjusted his full-year earnings estimate of
Dollars 3.30 a share, 'but my estimate is already below average'.
'We knew that refining and marketing earnings would be down because last
year's eastern hemisphere results were at record levels.'
Exploration and production also fell because oil prices have fallen by
around Dollars 3 a barrel and natural gas has fallen about 40 cents per
thousand cubic feet. Mobil's earnings from exploration and production fell
to Dollars 175m, including a one-time charge of Dollars 57m, against
earnings of Dollars 371m a year ago.
The company's earnings from marketing and refining tumbled to Dollars 52m
from Dollars 442m.
Looking to the second quarter Mr Murray said 'it is still too early for
substantial optimism'.
Analyst Mr Michael Young, of Smith Barney Harris Upham, said while the
overall results met his expectations, the drop in Mobil's operating segments
was disturbing. 'They made up the shortfall through lower corporate and
other costs, but I feel that Mobil's results were weaker than they should
have been, even give the poor industry conditions.'

<TEXT>
Capital Industries, the financial services and industrial group which came
to the market in July, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m for
1991.
When the group was part of Rutland Trust, the financial services and
property surveyor which retains a 37.4 per cent stake, it did not publish
separate accounts, making profit comparisons meaningless.
Most of the profit was generated from Capital Ventures, the financial
services division, which Mr Peter Underhill, chief executive, described as a
'cash cow' which he expects to generate annual profits of Pounds 1m.
Since the year-end, borrowings of Pounds 900,000 have been eliminated. Net
assets per share are 46.2p, with basic earnings per share of 9.2p and 10.9p
fully diluted. The final dividend is 2p.

Increased rental income, up from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 8.81m, and profit on

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Contracting side behind Freeman fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Results for 1991 from Freeman Group were dominated by the contracting
division, which incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.1m and, when sold in
February, threw up extraordinary charges of Pounds 3m.
That meant distributable reserves were eliminated, so there can be no final
dividend; the total, therefore, is 3p (8.5p) from losses per share of 0.6p
(earnings 21.6p). To overcome the problem directors propose a reduction in
the share premium account, and expect to resume payments in October.
Pre-tax profit of this insulation distribution specialist fell from Pounds
2m to Pounds 342,000.
Continuing activities accounted for Pounds 56m (Pounds 50.3m) of turnover
and Pounds 2.08m (Pounds 2.15m) of operating profit. A fall in the UK to
Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 904,000) was mainly the result of reduced margins and
an increase in bad debts. In France profit rose to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds
1.25m) despite an overall fall in construction activity.

BENTALLS, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of
England, saw pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 3.32m to Pounds 1.43m in the
year to February 1, as the expected upturn in trade over the last quarter
failed to materialise.
However, the dividend is maintained at 3.85p - with a final of 3.25p - as
the group looked forward to improved retail trading and to the increasing
stream of rental income from the Bentall Centre.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 71m, including the former Lewis's store in
Lakeside, Thurrock; the profit took account of a Pounds 346,000 start up
deficit there. Earnings per share came to 2.21p (4.87p).

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Provision increases TVS deficit to Pounds
27m - Agnew underlines 'total commitment' to oversee revival of company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUDOLF Agnew, chairman of TVS Entertainment, the ITV company which lost
its franchise, promised yesterday to try to raise the company 'phoenix-like
from the ashes.'
The former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields said yesterday that he saw
it as 'a very personal challenge' to stay on and try to rebuild TVS after it
goes off the air at the end of this year.
'Its a total commitment,' said Mr Agnew, who still feels bitter that the
company's bid of Pounds 59.75m a year was turned down by the Independent
Television Commission.
He faces a big challenge. The company yesterday announced that losses at the
pre-tax level jumped from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 26.7m in 1991. The figure
includes a further exceptional provision of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 25.1m)
against the programme stock of MTM, its US production subsidiary.
In addition there was an extraordinary provision of Pounds 24m (Pounds 4m)
flowing mainly from the loss of its licence. This included Pounds 18.8m for
the fall in the value of assets such as studios, Pounds 9.9m in redundancy
costs, and the Pounds 2.6m cost of the licence application. The provision
was partly offset by Exchequer Levy relief of Pounds 2.3m and a Pounds 5m
tax credit. There was a reduction of Pounds 20.9m in the revaluation
reserve.
TVS said the provisions were the main reason for the drop in net assets from
Pounds 111.6m to Pounds 47.4m. The policy of not paying a dividend will
continue. Net borrowing fell from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 25.4m and is now
closer to Pounds 15m.
The company's aim is to continue to service the debt which is mainly in the
US and accumulate cash in the UK in the last year of the franchise. Not
including the remaining debt, TVS could have between Pounds 30m and Pounds
40m in cash when the last 30 staff bow out.
Apart from keeping its Maidstone studios and its UK programme catalogue  -
three bids for 800 hours of programmes were all, at less than Pounds 2m,
unacceptably low - TVS will also retain MTM.
The outlook at MTM is a little brighter. Evening Shade, a comedy starring
Burt Reynolds, produced with CBS, has been renewed until the 1993-94
broadcast season. This means there are enough episodes to licence the series
to local TV stations. The Trials of Rosie O'Neill has also been renewed.
Apart from exploiting existing assets Mr Agnew said the company would be
seeking opportunities in the leisure and communications field.
The areas being studied included independent production, television services
and telecommunications. An attempt to return to broadcasting with partners
when the barriers to takeovers of ITV companies are removed at the beginning
of 1994 has not been ruled out.
The TVS chairman said that the company's two main French shareholders, Canal
Plus and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, were sticking with TVS.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Inishtech acquires florists supplier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inishtech, which has built up a portfolio of six companies in the paper,
print and packaging sectors, is diversifying with the acquisition of
Douthwaite Florists Sundries of Leeds.
The initial consideration is Pounds 7.13m. There are two tranches of up to
Pounds 2.36m and Pounds 6.4m in deferred consideration should profits reach
certain targets. If the entire deferred consideration was to become payable
then Douthwaite's pre-tax profits in 1996 would be some Pounds 6m.
In 1991 Douthwaite made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.61m from sales of
Pounds 14.4m.

FT  23 APR 92 / Purves warns on bid from Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank yesterday gave a preview of the battle it is
likely to fight to pursue its Pounds 3.3bn bid for control of Midland Bank,
if Lloyds decides to challenge the offer.
Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong Bank, warned that Midland could be
damaged if Lloyds made a bid - and that Midland's shareholders would be
better off accepting the Hongkong Bank offer rather than contemplating any
Lloyds proposals.
His argument is that a Lloyds bid could not be consummated for many months,
because any offer from Lloyds would almost certainly be vetted at length by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which assesses takeovers for their
effects on competition.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief executive, is concerned that the innate value
of the bank would be damaged if staff quit or lost enthusiasm.
Mr Purves admitted it was possible that Midland's shareholders might have
'more to gain' if their bank were taken over by a UK rival rather than by
Hongkong Bank. Lloyds estimates if it buys Midland it could make cost
savings greater than Pounds 500m.
However, leading institutional shareholders in Lloyds and Midland say they
want Lloyds to make an offer, because they believe there is strong
commercial logic for such a deal.
Lloyds will decide whether to bid at the end of the week. After its annual
meeting tomorrow, its board will meet over dinner to discuss whether to make
an offer. The following morning it will have a formal debate.
Hongkong Bank is aware that many of Midland's shareholders are disappointed
that the offer is not worth more and that they are being asked to take
Hongkong Bank shares and loan stock rather than cash. However, there were
indications from China yesterday that the government indicated it would be
unhappy if Hongkong Bank raised its offer.
The semi-official China News Service said it would be 'unfair' to Hongkong
Bank shareholders if it bettered its offer.

FT  23 APR 92 / Wace pays Pounds 425,000 to Clegg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WACE Group has paid Pounds 425,000 compensation to Mr John Michael Clegg,
33, who resigned as chief executive of the company he built into the world's
largest specialist in pre-press printing.
Mr Clegg resigned in February after market rumours linked Wace with the IRA.
It emerged that a brief police investigation had dismissed such suspicions,
but the Department of Trade and Industry is investigating share dealings in
the names of several of Mr Clegg's relatives.
Mr Clegg, who lives in Chicago, has said he never provided price-sensitive
information to anyone and promised to co-operate with the DTI inquiry.
Shares in Wace yesterday rose from 119p to 127p after the group reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.28m in the year to December 31.
Although this was 31 per cent down on the previous year, the figures were at
the top end of expectations and were coupled with a reassurance that
shareholders would face no more unpleasant surprises.
Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said: 'Although John Clegg's departure leaves a
personal void, his departure has had little effect on the day-to-day running
of the group's operations.'
He added: 'Wace was a well-managed company which was not dependent on any
one individual.' Mr ten Bos is acting as chief executive and said
headhunters were looking for a new chief executive. The company said it
welcomed the DTI inquiry 'because it will help repudiate recent speculative
coment and because Wace has nothing to fear from its findings.'

FT  23 APR 92 / Small players plug into telecom niches: UK deregulation will
result in a lively market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dozens of companies are starting to chip away at profitable niches of the
newly-deregulated UK telecommunications market.
But those who hoped last year's government white paper would launch a
head-on clash between British Telecom, which towers over the market, and new
competitors on the lines of Mercury Communications will be disappointed.
Instead, the emerging competitors are finding ways to use radio and
satellites for individual telecommunications services.
The white paper largely abolished the duopoly of BT and Mercury. Mr Peter
Lilley, then trade and industry secretary, said then that the new policy
would make Britain the most open telecommunications market in the world.
The policy has drawn a flurry of new competitors. Six companies have been
granted licences by the Department of Trade and Industry, more than 20
companies have lodged applications and another 30 have expressed interest in
doing so.
But of these, only Sprint, the US long-distance carrier, and National
Network, a private UK group, plan to build mainstream national and
international networks. Even then, the sums earmarked for investment -
between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m in Sprint's case - are small by the
standards of this capital intensive industry.
More substantial groups such as American Telephone and Telegraph, the US
telecommunications giant, British Rail and the regional electricity
companies - all of which had shown interest in competing against BT - have
so far failed to act.
As a result, BT's principal competitor will continue to be Mercury. So far
it has invested about Pounds 1.5bn and plans to boost investment by a
further Pounds 500m in each of the next three years.
This is still relatively small compared with the Pounds 2.5bn BT invests
every year. But Mercury is steadily increasing its market share and now has
just over 5 per cent of the Pounds 15bn-a-year market, concentrating mainly
on large business customers and long-distance traffic.
Potential competitors have feared that BT might unleash a price war if it
thought its market share were threatened. They have also been deterred by
regulatory delays: the UK government has yet to clarify whether carrying
international calls - the most lucrative part of the market - will be open
to competition beyond BT and Mercury. And companies have been reluctant to
commit themselves to heavy investment while the economy is weak.
Some of the same factors also affect companies planning to compete in
niches. But these are counting on new technologies to win their battles
against BT. The ideas include:
Radio tails. Ionica, a private UK group, and US-based Millicom want to put
telephone aerials on the roofs of homes and use radio signals rather than
copper wire to transmit phone calls to and from exchanges. They believe this
will be cheaper and faster than digging up the roads to lay cables.
Ionica's managing director, Mr Nigel Playford, says he aims to win at least
5 per cent of the residential market - about 1m customers - within 10 years.
Millicom plans to provide picture-phone and data communications as well.
Roof-to-roof communications by satellite. British Aerospace Communications
and Alpha Lyracom, a private US group, have been awarded international
satellite licences. They plan to provide businesses with private networks by
installing dishes on office roofs and bouncing the signals off satellites.
No roads need to be dug up, meaning services can be provided quickly and
cheaply. Such services are popular in the US where there are nearly 70,000
dishes installed. They are now expected to develop in Europe as tight
regulations are relaxed.
BAe has been granted satellite licences in France and Germany and is part of
a multinational consortium that plans to build the Dollars 500m Orion
satellite system in 1995. Alpha Lyracom owns the Pan American satellite and
has licences in the US, France and Germany.
Cable television. Large North American telephone companies - US West, Bell
Canada, Pacific Telesis, South Western Bell and Nynex - have built up stakes
in most of the UK's 133 local cable TV franchises. Costs can be kept down if
telephone and TV services are sold together because roads must only be dug
up once.
So far telephone service is available in six areas and 30,000 telephone
lines have been provided. The Cable Television Association expects the
number to increase to 100,000 by the end of the year.
Mobile communications. Of the two existing cellular services, Vodafone, with
700,000 customers, has been consistently more successful than Cellnet, which
is 60 per cent owned by BT and has 550,000 customers. Three groups -
Mercury, Hong Kong's Hutchison Telecom and Unitel, a consortium including US
West - have been licensed to form personal communications networks, a rival
type of service. Both Vodafone and Unitel have asked the government for
licences to provide fixed services to customers. Buying capacity on
international cables in bulk and using it to provide customers with a phone
service.
World Communications and ACC, which both act as resellers in North America,
want to set up as international resellers in the UK. WorldCom plans to
concentrate on UK-US traffic, while ACC would focus on UK-Canada traffic.
Resellers are able to make a profit because the price of bulk capacity is
relatively low, while charges for individual international calls are high.
Analysts estimate that resellers could cut the price of transatlantic calls
to 30c a minute from about Dollars 1 today.
The impact of any of these new niche players on its own is likely to be
small. None will come close to challenging BT's dominance. But, taken
together, the overall result of the emerging rivals will be a range of new
services, lower prices for some products and a more lively
telecommunications market.

FT  23 APR 92 / ICI to sell fibres unit to Du Pont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the British chemicals group, plans today to
announce the sale of its fibres operations to Du Pont of the US. It is
calling press conferences in London and Teesside to announce the deal.
If ICI sells Du Pont its entire fibres operations, the deal would have to be
cleared by the European Commission. The combined operations would have 55
per cent of the European market for staple fibres, used in carpets and
clothing, and more than 30 per cent of the filament market.
Analysts estimate the businesses, which had a turnover of about Pounds 675m
in 1990, the last year the company published their results independently,
could be worth as much as Pounds 350m. The operations are, however,
unprofitable.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, has said in the past that he no longer saw
fibres as one of its core businesses. He said he planned to develop
businesses which operated on a global basis or were highly profitable. The
fibres operations meet neither criterion. Their sales are concentrated in
Europe and the businesses do not have a sustained record of profitability.
ICI is facing chronic overcapacity and keen competition from Asia, problems
shared by all European and North American fibres manufacturers, said Mr
Stuart Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter.
Other fibres groups have already reacted to the poor market. In 1990,
Courtaulds, the UK specialty chemicals group, set up two joint ventures for
its acrylic fibres operations and acetate yarn business. Last month
Rhone-Poulenc of France and Snia of Italy merged their staple fibre and
polyamide carpet yarn operations.
ICI appeared to have turned its fibres operations around during the late
1980s by exiting the polyester business and concentrating on nylon. In 1988
its operations peaked with trading profits of Pounds 53m. However, profits
halved the following year. Fibres contributed to the materials division's
losses of Pounds 14m during the final quarter of last year.
ICI has already undertaken rationalisation at the fibres businesses. About
1,000 jobs were shed in 1991 and a further 800 are scheduled for this year.
The operation's Harrogate headquarters has been closed and a 20-staff
headquarters set up in Brussels.
However, in February Sir Denys said rationalisation at the fibres operations
had not created margins strong enough to produce satisfactory results. To
compete internationally against manufacturers in the Far East, Asia, ICI
would probably have to invest large sums in modern plant, believe analysts.
Further rationalisation of the European fibres industry appears inevitable,
warns Mr Wamsley. 'There may be further mergers or take-overs in the
man-made fibres industry, but none will mean anything unless capacity is
taken out,' he said.

FT  23 APR 92 / Abbey National sees gloomy year ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURIOUS trading in Abbey National shares followed a gloomy forecast by the
banking group's chairman, Sir Christopher Tugendhat.
The volume of transactions for the day, at 12m, was the highest since the
company was launched in July 1989. Having risen before the annual meeting,
shares ended down 11 1/2 p for the day at 299 1/2 p.
Sir Christopher said: '1992 is proving to be a difficult year for Abbey
National. During the first quarter there has been a significant increase in
the level of inquiries from prospective house purchasers, but the political
uncertainties have put a brake on turning those inquiries into confirmed
business. Arrears and repossessions are at a higher level than expected and
this in turn will mean a higher level of provisioning.'
Abbey's chief executive, Mr Peter Birch, had made a more positive assessment
last month. 'I think we are over the worst in the housing market,' he said.
Analysts disagreed on whether the market made a realistic reaction. Mr John
Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, described
the move as a 'thinly veiled profits warning', but added that the statement
had not affected his own profits forecast for the year, which remains at
Pounds 635m, compared with Pounds 618m last year. However, some analysts are
considering downgrading their forecasts from the Pounds 650m level to around
Pounds 620m.
Mr Chris Ellerton, analyst at SG Warburg, suspected the reaction was
overdone. He said the housing market had been widely forecast as a chief
victim of a hung parliament, and that the stock might have been 'a little
carried away' during post-election euphoria.
Stormy scenes punctuated the meeting, which was attended by around 1,400
shareholders. One shareholder attempted to move a motion not to increase the
final dividend, and to divert the money saved to mortgage rescue schemes.
Several shareholders complained about poor service or underperforming
accounts from the Abbey, and there was also an attack on its life assurance
questionnaires, which ask if applicants have been tested for the Aids
disease, but do not ask about smoking.

FT  23 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Pounds 500m eurobond from Hanson is a reminder that the
government is not alone in seeking to tap overseas demand for fixed rate
sterling paper. Together with the Pounds 650m of similar issues launched by
other British companies since the election, it suggests an accelerating
switch away from bank debt and into stable long-term bond finance. The trend
already carries significance for the broader economy. It involves amounts
large enough to distort the figures for bank lending to the private sector.
Add back bond finance, and credit demand appears less anaemic than the M4
data suggest.
The more immediate problem for finance directors, however, remains that of
deciding when fixed rates have fallen far enough to make refinancing
worthwhile. The size of the Hanson issue suggests certainty: the fact that
it is over only five years suggests the reverse. The situation may be
complicated by the absence of a long-term credit rating from either Moody's
or Standard &amp; Poor's, but Hanson could reasonably have expected to obtain a
longer maturity on a smaller issue. That would have left more room for
additional refinancing at even lower rates if, as investors believe, yields
are set to drop in the coming months.
Perhaps the company still feels it has plenty of scope, given its almost
Pounds 4bn in medium-term bank borrowing. However, yesterday's issue locks
it for five years into a borrowing cost of over 10 per cent. It is hard to
see the point of going all out for quantity on those terms, apart from the
satisfaction of producing the largest fixed-rate corporate eurobond on
record.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Pounds 149m rights issue from TransAtlantic Holdings, while
something of a one-off, served to remind the London equity market of the
notion that the UK election result has opened the door to a flood of cash
calls and takeovers. It might not do to count on it just yet. The UK
institutions have formidable claims on their cash flow, ranging from heavy
gilt issues to equity offerings from such as Wellcome and GPA. They are
likely to react badly to rescue rights issues, or indeed any issues not
designed for a specific acquisition. As to the liberating effect of the
election, it is worth recalling that Bowater and ECC got successful issues
away for specific projects just before the election was called.
As for the supposed flood of takeovers, it is certainly conceivable that
foreign purchasers will be influenced at the margin by the prospect of five
more years of UK political stability. But to the extent that they do not
have UK-style access to equity finance, they are faced with the old problem
of dear money and high asset prices. Meanwhile UK companies are still up
against the same difficulty which has hampered merger activity for many
months: the simple lack of clarity on their own prospects, let alone those
of a target company. If the market is looking to bids to keep it going, it
may have to wait awhile.

FT  23 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National managed to damp post-election spirits yesterday with its
statement that both repossessions and arrears had been worse than it
expected so far this year. The market's response in marking down Abbey
shares by 3 per cent - and those of leading insurance companies even more
sharply, on mortgage indemnity worries - still seems a touch overdone.
Electoral uncertainty meant it was never likely that the first quarter would
bring much comfort to the housing market. It will still take a month or two
to determine the shape of any recovery, though the overhang of unsold
properties means the best that can be expected is for some increase in
volume at stable prices.
That is hardly alarming news for the Abbey, though it does underline the
limited scope for higher profits this year. Provisions now look likely to be
little changed on last year's Pounds 155m. The likelihood of delay before
the government cuts interest rates reduces the scope for a further widening
of interest margins, while there is also not much room for the bank to
increase profits on its treasury business, which proved a mainstay of 1991.
Still, Abbey can easily afford the progressive dividend policy it promises,
even if earnings will not rebound as sharply as those of the other clearers
when recovery is finally established. Support for the shares may have been a
touch over-enthusiastic since the election, but there is not much reason for
them falling further.

FT  23 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Leaving sterling room
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2607.8 (-18.0)
The market's attitude towards sterling has undergone a significant shift in
recent days. The first reaction to the election result was to assume that
since sterling was so strong, interest rates would be cut. The argument is
now reversed: since rates are not apparently going to be cut, sterling
deserves to be stronger again. Yesterday, money market rates stood steady at
10.5 per cent while sterling rose above the French franc within the ERM for
the first time in a very long while. The market has switched to another
preoccupation: whether it is time for sterling to enter the ERM's narrow
bands.
The answer is probably not. First, it is too early to be sure whether the
post-election enthusiasm for sterling will last. Second, there is still the
outside chance of a further tightening in German monetary policy. Third,
there is no economic case for making the move in isolation without cutting
rates as well. And there is every reason for leaving rates alone until it
becomes clear what is going on in the domestic economy. Yesterday's Chambers
of Commerce survey depicted a slow and patchy recovery in March. But the
money supply figures showed bank lending in March falling on a seasonally
adjusted basis for the first time ever. Doubtless, there will be a
post-election boomlet to compensate. What happens then is anyone's guess.
As a political question, the move to narrow bands is a different matter.
There is an obvious appeal in the UK playing the good European as it assumes
the EC presidency in July. But speculating on the timing is scarcely worth
the market's while. It would be better advised to reflect that with sterling
less than two pfennigs away from its central rate, there is probably not
much more to go for.

FT  23 APR 92 / US-EC strategy agreed to break trade talks deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the European Community yesterday agreed on a new strategy to try
to break the deadlock over agriculture that is bedevilling completion of the
Uruguay trade round.
Having exchanged what were described as 'new ideas' at a meeting in the
White House yesterday, the two sides committed themselves to try to reach an
agreement on agricultural subsidies by the end of June. Neither would
disclose what the proposals were and both agreed that no dramatic
'breakthrough' had been achieved yesterday.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said it was obvious
that the US-EC impasse over agriculture was holding up a new global trade
liberalisation pact. There was, he said, 'too much at stake' in the talks -
within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) - to allow this
impasse to remain. The US and the EC, he declared, 'are not in a mood to
pull back'.
In particular, he said he had made clear to President George Bush that,
regardless of the Uruguay Round, the EC was committed to reform of the
common agricultural policy (CAP).
This would entail, he said, smaller financial subventions, lower farm
production, more farm imports and fewer farm exports. On this basis, the EC
could make further proposals, as long as they were matched by concessions
from the US.
Mr Bush responded that he was now convinced that the EC was ready to go for
an early settlement. Right up to the White House meeting, which also
included Mr Anabal Cavalco da Silva, prime minister of Portugal and
currently head of the EC council of ministers, US officials had publicly
doubted that Mr Delors had brought to Washington a European consensus.
Even afterwards, some US reservations were apparent. Mrs Carla Hills, the US
trade representative, said that, though she was 'more optimistic today than
yesterday', Mr Delors still 'wants us to move further and his side to move
less'.
The EC's apparent willingness to depart from the agreed Uruguay Round text,
drafted by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt secretary general, was a concern, she
added.
Mrs Hills was even reluctant to characterise anything the EC delegation had
proposed as 'new'. Asked specifically if the EC had again raised the
so-called 'blue box, safe box' scenario, which would allow certain EC farm
subsidies to continue for another six years prior to a phase-out, she
replied 'those are the parameters we have always discussed,' implying that
they had been re-stated.
Mr Delors, however, though insisting that it was 'still more my wish than my
prognosis', argued that an EC-US agreement on agriculture by the end of June
'means we can relaunch a discussion in Geneva on all the other subjects' in
the Uruguay Round draft.
It emerged that at the White House the trade discussions focused only on
agriculture. Other general topics covered included the situation in
Yugoslavia, aid to the former Soviet Union and the Middle East.

FT  23 APR 92 / Most of shadow cabinet back Smith: Labour MPs have until
Tuesday to decide on nominations for leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST MPs elected to the shadow cabinet support Mr John Smith in the Labour
party's leadership contest, his campaign manager Mr Robin Cook said
yesterday.
The Smith campaign rejected the suggestion that the show of support by 14 of
the 18 elected shadow cabinet members so far in advance of the voting on
July 18 reinforced the impression that the contest was a 'stitch-up'. It was
pointed out that MPs had to decide whose nominations to support by next
Tuesday.
The only elected shadow cabinet members not supporting Mr Smith are Mr
Michael Meacher, Ms Jo Richardson, Mr John Prescott, and Mr Bryan Gould, who
is standing against Mr Smith. Mr Meacher is supporting Mr Gould's candidacy,
and Mr Prescott is standing in the contest for the deputy leadership.
Beyond the 18 elected members, the shadow cabinet includes the party leader
and deputy leader and two senior spokesmen who are appointed by the leader.
Meanwhile, Ms Ann Clwyd, one of the shadow cabinet members supporting Mr
Smith, opened her campaign for the deputy leadership. She asked trade union
leaders not to vote in the leadership election unless they had balloted
their members.
It was, she said, 'frightening and insulting' to union members that the
support of some of the big unions should appear to be taken for granted
before they had been consulted.
Mr Smith has made it clear that he believes that trade unions should
undertake the widest possible consultations before casting their votes.
Ms Clwyd went further, saying: 'Even the idea of trade union leaders taking
soundings without balloting their members is open to abuse. Unless the
unions genuinely reflect the views of their members on the leadership - and
that means a ballot - then they should not vote in this election.'
The executive of the AEU engineering union has said that it will not hold a
ballot, citing time problems and cost.
Ms Clwyd's pro-proportional representation, pro-European platform also
includes a strong pitch for the party to broaden its appeal to women. She
said many women were put off by the 'macho images' the party was presenting.
'Women should no longer be seen as bit-part players in the political scene.'
She said it was essential that the deputy leader should be a woman. However,
she refused to call on her supporters to vote for Mrs Margaret Beckett if -
as is quite possible - she herself did not get the necessary 55 signatures
of Labour MPs to stand in the contest.

FT  23 APR 92 / EC threatens sanctions on Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community med-iators, on the eve of a hazardous mission to
Sarajevo, warned last night that sanctions might have to be imposed to try
to stop the fighting in newly independent Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The fresh warning - directed at Serbia and the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav
federal army - came from Lord Carrington, the former British foreign
secretary, and Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the foreign minister of Portugal,
which currently holds the EC presidency.
Both vowed, in TV interviews, to go ahead with a trip to the Bosnian capital
today, even though rival ethnic groups have stepped up street fighting.
They hope to meet leaders of the feuding Serb, Moslem and Croatian
communities at Sarajevo airport, considered one of safest locations in the
city. They plan to fly on to Belgrade for talks with the Serbian government
and then to Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
Lord Carrington said it appeared Serbia was trying to carve out a Serbian
enclave in Bosnia. If negotiations failed to halt the strife, 'I think that
you have to go down the road of some sort of sanctions whatever they may
be,' he said.
The Portuguese minister said the EC must take a tough line. Economic and
other sanctions must be applied if necessary.
Street-by-street fighting in Sarajevo yesterday was concentrated in the
Ilidza district, where Moslems launched an offensive against Serbs who had
taken control. Some reports said more than 20 people were killed in the city
yesterday and at least two elsewhere in Bosnia.
A hotel in Ilidza housing 60 EC ceasefire monitors was riddled with bullet
holes. Mr Colm Doyle, an EC official, said: 'This is mindless violence.
Using a hotel with the EC and journalists in it and a hospital with patients
as targets is not encouraging.'
Witnesses said the Moslem-dominated old town was still under bombardment by
Serb forces, but in some districts a few people ventured out after more than
a day in shelters. Most workers remained at home and schools were closed.
There were conflicting accounts of which side was prevailing in the
fighting. One witness said: 'By using street battles, Moslem forces appeared
to gain the upper hand on Serbs, who rely on heavy artillery on the hillside
above Sarajevo.'
Another witness said: 'It is chaos. It is not clear who is controlling the
situation.'
The federal army appeared to be staying out of the fray in the city of
525,000 inhabitants, 49 per cent of whom are Moslems. Bosnia's Serbs, who
make up 31 per cent of the 4.35m population, oppose the republic's
independence from Yugoslavia, while Moslems and Croats, making up nearly two
thirds of the population, support independence.

Sir, While I have not seen a copy of the paper produced by the Bristol
Business School at the recent BAA annual conference, I was surprised to read
Andrew Jack's report, 'City analysts 'largely ignore' annual reports (April
16) .
Through its examinations, the SIA is widely recognised as having led the way
in raising analytical standards in the investment community and the
interpretation of reports and accounts is certainly a focal point in its
examination syllabus.
It may also be noted that a recent Mori survey of City opinion confirmed
once again that analysts rely more on company reports and accounts than any
other material and this includes personal interviews and presentations etc.
What individual analysts may admittedly not be so well qualified to do is to
scrutinise accounts for so-called 'bad' accounting practice; however, this
is one of the reasons why, on their behalf, the society is making its
contribution to the work of those bodies committed to seeing an improvement.

Sir, The report, 'Words that spell business failure' (April 18), makes

Perhaps the researchers could now consider the implications of delays in the
publication of interim and annual company reports - in particular the period
of delay which should be regarded as critical - and the apparent sudden
decision of a company to extend its accounting period.

Oh, these back-biting management gurus] The evangelistic Tom Peters gets a
sharp nip from American organisational-politics expert Jeffrey Pfeffer in
his latest book, Managing with Power.
Apparently, when Peters was working on the mega-selling In Search of
Excellence a dozen years ago, he asked to borrow a previous book on
politicking by Pfeffer, who handed over his personal copy. When it came
back, he found that Peters had disagreed so strongly with some of its points
that he had scribbled in the margins.
In particular, against passages detailing the Machiavellian politics
executives get up to in companies, he'd written: 'Not in effective
organisations.'
Perhaps that explains why several of Peters's 'excellent' companies have
since proved otherwise, comments Pfeffer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared with Chernobyl, Chelyabinsk has the added disadvantage that its
nuclear disaster was kept hushed up by the ex-Soviet authorities. And the
fact that, over 30 years later, it is now receiving help owes much to Lady
Gillian Braithwaite, wife of British ambassador Sir Rodric, who returns with
him from Russia next month when he becomes foreign affairs adviser to the
prime minister.
Besides having stood up to be counted in the tank-ringed Russian parliament
building on the critical night of August 20, she recently joined Lady Ellen
Dahrendorf, Lady Valerie Solti and others in founding Bearr - the British
Emergency Aid in Russia and the Republics Trust.
It has already wheedled six tonnes of medicines out of UK-based
pharmaceutical companies and sent them to Chelyabinsk, still suffering from
the effects of severe irradiation. Indeed, its main hospital was within a
day or so of completely running out of medical supplies when the Bearr truck
arrived with enough to eke out another two months.
While the trust is working to send more, there seems no doubt that Russia
will lose a resourceful resident with Lady Braithwaite's departure. Still,
perhaps she'll henceforth be close enough to Britain's cabinet to give
off-stage help to the country she's leaving.

FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Bain's verdict
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, yesterday's letter in the FT on the same subject from Professor
Andrew Bain rang a bell. As an old Midland Bank hand - he was group economic
adviser - he could be expected to peddle the party line on how terrible a
Lloyds Bank takeover would be.
Nevertheless, as he has sat on both the Wilson committee on the City and the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, his views should still command respect.
Indeed, he resigned from the MMC after the Government over-ruled its
decision turning down Charter's bid for Anderson Strathclyde.
Bain is convinced that a Lloyds' bid would be referred to the MMC. The
Office of Fair Trading would lose all credibility if it wasn't. He's also
convinced that the MMC would turn it down.

FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Pitman's risk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's a touch ironic for the chairman of the Hongkong Bank to be warning
Lloyds Bank not to try to disrupt his cosy bid for the Midland. After all,
it wasn't long ago that his immediate predecessor, Sir Michael Sandberg,
upset the Bank of England by launching an unwelcome bid for the Royal Bank
of Scotland.
Had it not been for Sandberg's impetuous intervention, the Royal Bank would
now be happily married to Standard Chartered, and Britain's banking system
would be a much tidier place. The net result was that the Monopolies and
Mergers
Commission turned down both bids rather than risk snubbing the Old Lady's
governor by allowing Sandberg to win a hostile auction.
Although the days when a UK bank could look to the Bank of England to shoo
away an unwelcome predator are almost certainly over, personalities could
play just as big a role in the current shadow-boxing over Midland's future.
Lloyds' chief executive Brian Pitman is not cast in the same mould as the
headstrong Sandberg, who went on to advise Alan Bond and sit on the board of
Polly Peck after retiring from Hongkong and Shanghai.
True, Pitman is a bit of a maverick and normally gets what he wants. But he
is not in as powerful a position as Sandberg was at the time of the RBS bid.
Moreover, since he doesn't have the same dominance over his board, he'll
need to present his case very forcefully to convince a majority of the
non-executive directors led by Sir Jeremy Morse, one of the ablest bankers
around.
If Pitman fails to win the battle, will the firing squad be called?

FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Rocard's work ethic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's back to the drawing board for French ex-premier Michel Rocard. Eleven
months after being replaced by the ill-fated Edith Cresson, he can be found
at his old workplace, the Ministry of Finance, drawing up a report on the
implications for France of a single European currency.
It may seem odd that a former prime minister should need such humdrum
employment. But in France a premier leaving office keeps the salary (FFr
40,000 per month plus another FFr 17,000 in expenses) for only six months
longer, and gets no pension. Those six months expired last November, when
Rocard began work on the report.
Fortunately he, like many other leading politicians, is a senior civil
servant by origin, which provides a substantial safety net. He is an
Inspecteur General des Finances, which provides FFr 30,000 monthly.
According to his aides, he felt he couldn't accept the money without working
for it, and so spends several days a week in the office.
That's perhaps because he's a protestant. Not all France's erstwhile
Inspecteurs Generaux des Finances are as diligent.

FT  23 APR 92 / Leading Article: Lessons for bank lemmings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE worst over for hard-hit banks in the debt-laden English-speaking
economies? Certainly there is room for guarded optimism in the US, though
less on the basis of this week's buoyant first quarter earnings figures than
the improving state of the economy and the longer-term trend in credit
ratings. The restoration of bank profitability has long been an implicit
goal of Federal Reserve policy and the Fed has already reaped a partial
reward in the sense that the ratings of most big commercial banks have not
deteriorated further over the past year. Citicorp, admittedly, continues to
give the rating agencies the odd twinge. But the overall trend is healthy.
The outlook is far more cloudy in Britain, where membership of the exchange
rate mechanism means that monetary policy is singularly insensitive to the
problems of the banking system. The clearing banks have the advantage over
their US counterparts in a stronger initial capital position. But their
problems in property lending pose a growing threat - witness the troubles of
Olympia &amp; York, Heron International and Speyhawk, which emerged immediately
after provisions and write-offs had been struck for 1991.
Nor is it likely to end there. In the recessions of the mid-1970s and early
1980s, interest rates on property company debt were negative. This time they
are positive, which means that interest is often rolling up on debts that
now exceed depressed asset values. It thus becomes harder to bridge the gap
between debt and asset values over time. So the banks will be under far
greater pressure to foreclose; and the pressure will be further increased by
the knowledge that the big investment institutions are very reluctant
buyers, in contrast to the position in the second half of the 1970s.
Debt overhang
The overhang of Pounds 40bn of bank debt in property has been turning
progressively into equity over the past two years. Acknowledging that fact
implies a more substantial write-off, in a period of disinflation, than
would have been necessary in the two preceding recessions.
Mr John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, once described bank lending as
'information on the move'. The experience of banks across the globe in real
estate looks more like a case of lemmings on the move, despite all the
information. A more charitable explanation is a familiar one that bears
repeating. The rush into real estate was really the natural response of a
banking system that was required to become more competitive because of
deregulation at precisely the moment that its credit rating collapsed, after
the Mexican default of 1982.
Risky adventures
The banking system's best customers found that they could by-pass the banks
by raising money directly from the markets. Consequently the banks found
themselves short of good borrowers. They turned to real estate, leveraged
buy-outs and other high-risk adventures to plug that gap.
The disastrous outcome raises important questions about the nature of
banking and of banking regulation. It is striking, for example, that the
damage was far worse in those countries with sophisticated financial
systems. Clever risk pricing and asset management strategies provided little
protection against loss. Nor did the supervisory efforts of central bankers.
Nor, again, did capital. Dozens of New England savings and loans that turned
to the stock market for equity capital in the 1980s acquired equity-asset
ratios of more than 20 per cent. It did not protect them from disaster in
the real estate bubble. And the Anglo-Saxon countries that supposedly have
far greater accountability to shareholders appear to have suffered more than
those in continental Europe where such accountability is minimal.
That underlines the inherent tension within banking systems that are
required both to satisfy the demands of profit-maximisation and to play a
wider role in monetary policy and payments services. It also points to the
pressing need for more research into the problem of reconciling stability
with efficiency in the banking system. The English-speaking economies may
have felt the biggest shocks of deregulation, but that underlying conundrum
is a long way from being resolved.

FT  23 APR 92 / Arts: A Jovial Crew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the London theatres reopened in 1661, Samuel Pepys found the revival of
A Jovial Crew 'the most innocent play I ever saw.' Max Stafford-Clark's RSC
debut production is far from that, for A Jovial Crew makes a sharp, knowing
counterpart to the flaccid Beggar's Opera playing alongside it at the Swan.
Both plays are about the low life, and both were operettas in the 1730s.
This new production of A Jovial Crew transforms the relaxed original into a
robust evening's theatre.
Richard Brome (circa 1590 - 1652) wrote A Jovial Crew or The Merry Beggars
in 1641. He learned much from working with Ben Jonson, and this play
combines Jonson's realism (The Staple of News) and romance (The New Inn). It
has been extensively rewritten and modernised to good effect by Stephen
Jeffreys.
The improbable plot follows the devices and desires of Squire Oldrents'
steward Springlove, a man with an inborn desire of liberty who periodically
takes to the road with a band of itinerant beggars. When Springlove leaves
with a begging crew, Oldrents' flighty daughters, tired of Oldrents'
melancholia, follow him and take their respective suitors along. Another
couple, escaping from an enforced marriage, joins the crew.
Chases and confusions ensue. True to 17th-century form, a lost infant
reappears from Oldrents' past, and the naturally good turn out to be nobly
born. The moral?: 'They dream of happiness that live in state, But they
enjoy it that embrace their fate.'
The serious import of Brome's play is that possessions are at best a
responsibility and at worst a burden; that beggars are 'the only free men of
the commonwealth;' and that for beggars, 'tis not home merely that you leave
behind, But language, morals, certainty of mind.'
Behind it all lie the Elizabethan Poor Laws stacked up by William Cecil,
making each parish responsible for its needy; the laws remained largely
unchanged until 1834.
Brome jokes about the profession of beggary. He sets out the panhandler's
'Three Rs': Respect, Responsibility, Religion; an appeal to all of these
yields a gift. The wit comes from the moments when the gentry-class runaways
try begging for themselves: 'troubled times indeed when mendicants plead in
rhyming hexameters.' But the scope of Brome's joke extends not a titter
further.
The three-dozen cast are wonderfully manoeuvred around the stage by
Stafford-Clark. Paul Jesson as Oldrents and Roger Frost as a hang 'em, flog
'em Justice lead the troupe, with Ron Clark as Springlove, 'young in years
and ripe in goodness.' The hard-core of beggars, ably led by Lloyd
Hutchinson, deliver some wonderful ensemble scenes, including a high-energy
libidinous tribal dance. Other highlights are David Westhead's lugubrious
Yorkshire bailiff, Sophie Okonedo's runaway bride, and James Connolly's
beggar-actor. The excellent music (Ian Dury and Mickey Gallagher) shows how
robust rhythms can give momentum to an evening, and Wayne Dowdeswell's
lighting makes the most of a minimal set.

FT  23 APR 92 / Appointments: Brannen to head ILO in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Labour Organisation has appointed as director of its
London offices Peter Brannen, previously head of international relations at
the Department of Employment and a former member of ILO's governing body.
Described by colleagues as an unconventional civil servant with 'more time
for vision than systems', he is known for his energy and his tendency to end
up in the chair of any committee of which he is a member. His main
achievement at the employment department was co-ordinating technical
assistance to the new governments in central and eastern Europe.
Born in County Durham 50 years ago, Brannen tends to become a professional
Geordie when abroad, and indeed, at home - staff at the ILO can look forward
to his whisky-inspired, 3 am renditions of Keep Your Feet Still Geordie
Hinny, a local hymn to drinking.
All that remains of his early training as a priest is the joy he gets from
repentance - which is matched only by the joy of sinning in the first place.
He describes himself as 'in principle a saint but in practice a sinner' -
which explains why his vegetarianism is punctuated by the occasional large
steak.
The ILO, a UN agency which includes employers, unions and governments, has
criticised the UK government's industrial relations legislation. Brannen is
unlikely to be fazed by this aspect of his new role; he spent much of his
time at the employment department trying to reconcile UK policy with ILO
aims.

FT  23 APR 92 / Management: Mickey Mouse outfit suffers culture shock -
Michael Skapinker finds the lights off at Euro Disney / Marketing and
Advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a barrage of publicity which is unlikely to be matched when
astronauts set foot on Mars, Euro Disney, Europe's biggest leisure park, has
had a rocky start.
Attempts to impress financial analysts and journalists in the days leading
up to the opening earlier this month were bedevilled by technical failures
and long queues.
When it became clear that I would barely hear Jose Carreras and see no more
than his right ear, I decided to watch the gala opening of Euro Disney on
the television set in my hotel room rather than as one of 15,000 invited
guests.
Which is how I happened to be in Euro Disney's 1,100-room Newport Bay Club
hotel when the lights went out. The two-hour power failure was the
culmination of a weekend of computer problems which had made checking-in a
bad tempered scramble and meant there was no record of guests' phone calls.
The analysts, alarmed by high prices and rides that broke down, advised
clients to sell Euro Disney shares. Since the day of their visit the shares
have fallen 20 per cent on the Paris stock exchange.
Mark Feary, Euro Disney's vice president for marketing, acknowledges that
now the park is open, the task of selling it changes. The pre-opening
publicity included a Dollars 10m Europe-wide television advertising campaign
and a two-hour live TV special broadcast to 30 countries.
While the company will continue to advertise on television and in magazines,
the primary task now is to ensure paying visitors are more impressed than
analysts and journalists.
Apart from telling their friends and neighbours how marvellous the park is,
the company also wants those visitors to come back. Repeat business is an
essential part of Disney's success in the US. Feary says that more than 90
per cent of customers filing through the gates of Disney's American parks
have been there before.
Euro Disney says it is unreasonable to expect a project of this size to
escape technical mishaps. 'You don't get it right the second you start,'
says Timothy Wolf, senior vice president for human resources and
administration. This would be true of any other organisation opening its
doors on a FFr22bn (Pounds 2.2bn) project. Disney's problem is that it
competes against its own reputation for getting things right.
The technical difficulties can be overcome. Whether Euro Disney's staff can
achieve the ever-smiling, endlessly helpful standards set by their US
counterparts is open to question.
The 14,000 'cast members' taken on to work at Euro Disney are, mostly, nice
enough. 'Mostly', because even on opening weekend some clearly couldn't care
less. My suggestion to one staff member that she investigate why I had
received a mild electric shock from a barrier in one of the park's
restaurants was greeted with derision.
My overwhelming impression of the other employees was that they were out of
their depth. There is much more to being a cast member than endlessly saying
'bonjour'. Apart from having a detailed knowledge of the site, Euro Disney
staff have the anxiety of not knowing in what language they are going to be
addressed. Although most of the staff are supposed to be proficient in
English and French, many were struggling.
One cast member, who has worked for the company in the US, candidly
volunteered that service at Euro Disney falls way short of the standards at
the American parks.
In fairness, some of the difficulties hampering Euro Disney staff are
probably temporary. The most serious of these is that many cannot find
accommodation near the site and are commuting for up to two hours to and
from work every day. Wolf believes that nearly 4,000 staff have
accommodation problems. By building its own flats and renting rooms in local
homes, Wolf, who admits the housing problem keeps him awake at night, says
the company is providing new accommodation at the rate of 100 beds a week.
Housing for employees, he says, was one area where communication with the
otherwise co-operative French government broke down.
A less severe difficulty is the problem of the disappearing name badges. All
cast members have to wear a Mickey Mouse name badge. Several have lost
theirs and borrowed one from a colleague, so that you meet Irish cast
members called Jean-Luc and Germans called Juan. (Jean-Luc and Juan are not
their real false names. In a company where you can be dismissed for failing
to maintain 'an appropriate weight and size', wearing the wrong name tag is
probably punishable with confinement in Sleeping Beauty's castle with only
Goofy for company.)
The employees might grow into their jobs but Disney executives say staff
turnover at theme parks is high. The Disney style of service is one with
which Americans have grown up. There are several styles of service (or lack
of it) in Europe; unbridled enthusiasm is not a marked feature of them.
Robert from Brighton is at least civil. He is too busy for me to ask him
where he worked before Euro Disney. But given the practiced air with which
he explains that service on Peter Pan's Flight has been suspended, British
Rail seems a likely candidate. One would marvel at Euro Disney's attention
to this detail of British life, were Robert not kitted out for an afternoon
of yodelling. 'It's Tyrolean,' he says of his costume.
Euro Disney has been at pains to point out how European it is. Roy Disney,
founder Walt's nephew, told the opening ceremony that the d'Isigny family
had lived in France until as recently as the Norman invasion of England - a
revelation greeted with regrettable levity by some of the audience.
Fantasyland, one of five 'themed' areas, is largely devoted to European
tales: Snow White, Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan.
In Adventureland, Katherine from Birmingham is wearing an even more curious
creation: a long black and white robe with some sort of shawl. 'It's
Tahitian, or something like that,' she explains. Adventureland is a bit of
the east, some African-style curios, ship-wrecked Swiss Family Robinson's
home and Pirates of the Caribbean. This, clearly, is Disney's collection of
exotica.
But domes and minarets are a common feature of European cities. Many
residents of Europe trace their roots to Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.
Perhaps only the high-minded will find Adventureland and Fantasyland
insulting. But the unabashedly American nature of areas such as Frontierland
and Main Street USA means they are easier to recall.
The cultural promiscuity evident in Tyrolean Robert's supervision of Peter
Pan's flight and The Chant of the Tom-Toms alongside Egyptian perfume
bottles renders this set of attractions curiously unmemorable.

FT  23 APR 92 / Technology: Making tracks - Andrew Baxter explains how
ancient and modern techniques are used in the construction of tanks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past few weeks, workers at the Vickers Defence Systems tank factory
at Newcastle upon Tyne have had to walk round a large hole that has opened
up in the middle of the shopfloor.
The hole might suggest that Vickers has started test firing its tank guns
indoors, but there is a more innocent explanation. It is to provide
foundations for a new Pounds 500,000 computer-controlled machining centre
being supplied by Halifax-based Butler Newall.
The machine will replace three 30-year-old Giddings &amp; Lewis horizontal
boring machines, and will do all their machining work on the tank hulls in
one setting.
For Bill McGawley, divisional operations director, the new machine is an
investment in new technology that is worth making because of the time saved
and the contribution to increased competitiveness.
A walk through the 543m-long plant - armoured plate in at one end, completed
tank out from the other end - is a history lesson in the machine tool
industry. Names long gone, such as Kendall &amp; Gent of the UK, rub shoulders
with the Mori Seikis of the modern era.
In between are venerable machines that have been given a new lease of life.
Vickers spent Pounds 90,000 last year restoring a 600-ton press, made in
Birmingham in 1936 and used for straightening thick plate after welding.
McGawley is keen to dispel the impression that the British Army's 140 new
Challenger tanks, to be built at Newcastle and its sister plant in Leeds,
will be the products of old-fashioned manufacturing technology.
But the mixture of old and new is deliberate, and intended to answer the
challenge of manufacturing tanks competitively, and profitably, in the
modern era. Vickers is the only company in the world to have been
continuously producing tanks since they were introduced in 1916, and wants
to remain so.
The critical manufacturing issue, for a low-volume product in a market where
margins have fallen and competition is now more open and international, is
reducing break-even to a minimum.
Expenditure on new machine tools is an important part of the equation.
Buying elegant machinery that shaves a few seconds or minutes off machining
times may make sense for a high-volume manufacturer, says McGawley, as the
cost of the machine can be spread over thousands of products.
In tank production, with many large pieces requiring long set-up times for
machining, a few minutes saved while the metal is cut may not be that
critical. And highly specialised machinery could reduce flexibility when the
production line switches to a new model.
For McGawley, therefore, the key question is not 'How much time can we
save?' but 'How much money can we make over time by making that part?'
This approach to manufacturing lies behind the transformation in Vickers'
tank production business over the past decade. Ancient, sprawling
manufacturing plants with long chains of command and five different levels
of dining room have been swept away, first at Newcastle in 1983 and then in
Leeds three years later.
The company now has two identical plants, each of which can produce a
complete tank - allowing for the fact that 60 per cent of each tank's
content is sourced externally.
The strategy, masterminded by Gerry Boxall, Vickers Defence Systems chairman
and chief executive, flies in the face of modern manufacturing convention,
which calls for the elimination of duplication and concentration of
different stages of manufacturing in separate plants. But Vickers does not
want to go down this route, says McGawley. Strategically, it would make the
company vulnerable to the consequences of 'upsizing and downsizing' of order
flows, and competition between the two plants can be constructive and
beneficial if properly controlled.
The result of the upheavals at the company, and its innovative approach to
manufacturing technology, is that each factory can break even on two to
three tanks a month, yet can expand to ten a month simply by adding shifts.
The wisdom of McGawley's approach to manufacturing options is illustrated by
some of its recent experiences with new equipment.
On the one hand, it has had no trouble assimilating some of the new
techniques in manufacturing developed for high-volume production such as car
manufacturing. It has bought CNC lathes and a CAD system virtually off the
shelf.
But a recent episode with robotics was another story. With financial backing
from the UK government, McGawley bought a robot to weld turrets which
Vickers makes for armoured fighting vehicles.
The robot had no trouble welding armoured plate, despite certain
metallurgical challenges, in half the time that a human welder would
require. The problem was integrating the robot and its software to ensure
that the welding torch moved to the right place. Along with difficulties
setting up large castings for the robot to work on, this made it difficult
to achieve the repeatability which is normally one of the main benefits of
robotics.
Three years after purchasing the robot, and after spending about Pounds 1m,
McGawley says it is now performing well and he looks forward to extending
the use of robots. But manual craft skills will still be required for
welding in difficult positions and, as with other parts of the manufacturing
process, old and new will complement each other.
Much of the Pounds 1m investment in manufacturing equipment at Newcastle
over the past year is linked to preparation for fulfilling the Pounds 500m
Challenger 2 order.
Building tanks is a lengthy affair, but the philosophy at Vickers, which has
brought design and manufacturing teams closer together physically and
metaphorically, has had a profound impact on product development times.
The first CRARVV (Challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle) rolled
off the production line in autumn 1990, five years after Vickers began
concept work, and went straight to the Gulf. Formerly, says McGawley, the
project would have taken eight to nine years.
Management schools would no doubt applaud Vickers' new co-ordinated approach
to tank manufacture as a classic example of the teamwork element in
simultaneous or concurrent engineering. McGawley will have none of that,
preferring instead to call it 'sheer bloody common sense'.
'My wife in the kitchen doesn't have the kettle on one table, the tea on
another and the sugar in a different room. They are all in reach,' he says.
'Why should that have a special title in engineering?'

FT  23 APR 92 / Improvement in service sector heralds recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY SIGNS of recovery heralded by the British Chambers of Commerce
yesterday were confined mainly to service industries.
For the manufacturing sector the outlook remained gloomy. Companies saw
orders in the first quarter of this year fall for the eighth consecutive
quarter, albeit at a slower rate. Yet the chambers were confident that
manufacturing industries would soon follow the service sector out of
recession.
'As manufacturing accounts for around a quarter of GDP it is clear that
recession, as measured by orders in the UK, is almost over,' says the
report. 'If these trends continue a return to growing sales deliveries in
both manufacturing and services is expected during the second quarter of
1992.'
The service sector, which went into recession later than the manufacturing
sector and suffered a more shallow decline in output, resumed growth for the
first time since mid 1990 in the first quarter of the year.
According to the survey of 8,810 companies, slightly more than half of which
were service providers, domestic demand for services was beginning to
improve after more than a year of contraction.
The report says the growth was almost entirely due to a remarkably strong
performance by small companies, while bigger service providers - those with
more than 20 employees - were still suffering a decline in orders.
Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the chambers, said: 'This suggests
that the more nimble small companies are better able to take the initiative
and make the most of the increase in demand.'
While exports in both the manufacturing and service sector continued to
grow, a worrying trend was a slowing in the rate of growth in service-sector
exports. Mr Brown said the slowdown could be ascribed to difficult global
trading conditions. 'You can't keep up the rate of growth if all your
markets are slowing down. There are still very strong markets in the Far
East and Middle East, but Europe seems to be slowing down,' he said.
Low investment remained a problem for both sectors. The report notes that
investment plans in both sectors continued to be revised downwards.
While many investment decisions were probably delayed because of electoral
uncertainties, the chambers said falling investment in the manufacturing
sector raised the question of whether British industry would be able to
sustain growth at this point in the recovery without the foundations of
solid investment.
Lower interest rates remained the factor most likely to improve company
prospects in both sectors, with a balance of 80 per cent of manufacturers
and more than a third of service providers saying interest rates were their
main concern.
The number of manufacturing companies working at full capacity fell to its
lowest level with just 19 per cent of those surveyed operating at full
capacity. In the service sector there was a small fall in the number of
companies working at full capacity.
Employment continued to fall. Nationally, a balance of more than a quarter
of large manufacturers and more than a fifth of service-sector employers
expected to reduce their workforces.
Job prospects were most buoyant in Northern Ireland and north-east England.
In manufacturing, only Merseyside employers recorded growth in jobs - almost
entirely due to a few large companies - but this was outweighed by a big
reduction in service-sector employment in the region.
Recruitment across the country remained low, but skilled manual,
professional and managerial staff remained the hardest to recruit. The
easiest region for skilled manual workers to find jobs in manufacturing was
south-west England followed by the north-east where recruitment difficulties
were the highest.
After a sharp fall in business confidence at the end of last year,
expectations remained broadly unchanged in the first three months of the
year, the report concludes. 'Continuing high levels of insolvency and
unemployment, coupled with a sustained decline in the housing market, will
have done little to boost consumer confidence or demand.'

FT  23 APR 92 / Repayments to banks higher than their lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LACK of significant recovery in the economy prior to the general
election was underlined yesterday by figures indicating weak demand for
credit last month.
The Bank of England said companies and individuals repaid loans worth a net
Pounds 500m to banks and building societies last month.
The seasonally-adjusted figure for so-called M4 sterling lending marks the
first time since records began in 1982 that repayments on such lending
outstripped new loans. M4, or broad money, is cash plus bank and building
society deposits.
However, financial markets shrugged off the statistics, arguing that their
relevance had been diminished by the Conservatives' victory in the general
election.
Many in the City believe that the election result sets the scene for an
increase in business and consumer confidence that could aid a sustained
revival.
Private-sector economists had expected a small net increase in M4 lending
last month of about Pounds 1.5bn. That had been on the back of cautious
indications about an economic upturn in the first quarter.
News of the weak demand for credit coincided with other figures pointing to
sluggish growth in the money supply.
Narrow money or M0, which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation
and represents underlying demand pressures, rose 0.1 per cent during March
to give a 2.2 per cent increase for the year. In the 12 months to February,
M0 growth was also 2.2 per cent, while in the year to January it was a
revised 2.1 per cent.
M4 rose by 0.2 per cent during March. The growth for the 12 months to March
was a weak 5.6 per cent, after 6 per cent in February and 6.3 per cent in
January.
The message behind the figures was supported by the British Bankers'
Association, a trade body for Britain's nine biggest commercial banks, which
said its members gained repayments from borrowers last month of Pounds
1.7bn.
That came after a net increase in loans in February of Pounds 1.7bn.
The association said there were no signs that the sharp decline in bank
lending during the recession had ended.

FT  23 APR 92 / British Chambers of Commerce Survey: Upturn in regions may
be fragile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AREAS OF weakness across the regions could cast doubt on the sustainability
of the UK's apparent recovery, the British Chambers of Commerce said
yesterday.
Growth in domestic manufacturing in north-east England - the region leading
the country out of recession with the strongest growth rate - faltered in
the first quarter of this year.
A similar slowdown in East Anglia, a further region where growth last year
was more encouraging than elsewhere, prompted the chambers to question the
sustainability of growth in some areas.
'In the cases of the north-east and East Anglia, we are looking at the
inability of two regions to sustain growth, given that there is no growth in
the regions around them,' said Mr Richard Brown, director of policy.
In spite of the easing in the north-east, growth in the domestic market of
its manufacturing sector remained the highest in the country.
The fragility of the recovery was further highlighted by a slowdown of
growth in the service sectors of the same regions.
In the north-east service-sector growth fell back slightly while service
providers in East Anglia suffered a strong fall with more companies
suffering lower sales than in the fourth quarter of last year.
Merseyside's economy was the weakest of all the regions. The chambers said
the area's economy seemed to be 'swinging back and forward'.
Impressive growth in service-sector exports in the last quarter of last year
was followed by a sharp decline in exports.
However, in the same quarter manufacturers began to see a recovery in export
orders. Investment plans in the region fell to a 'drastically low level'.
London saw a turnaround in manufacturing for the domestic and export markets
at the start of the year. In the last quarter of last year more companies in
London reported that sales were decreasing rather than increasing. This
trend was sharply reversed in the first quarter of this year.

FT  23 APR 92 / Scots business optimism rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS optimism increased in several parts of the Scottish economy in the
first quarter of this year, although demand continued to decline in most
sectors.
The Scottish business survey, conducted by chambers of commerce and analysed
by the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Glasgow,
found an improvement in optimism in manufacturing, retailing and tourism.
But business confidence was falling in construction and wholesaling.
The quarterly survey showed manufacturers reporting a continuing fall in
orders and sales, although the decline was slower than in the fourth quarter
of last year. Orders and sales to all principal markets were in decline
except for the Scottish market, where a small margin of companies reported
an upturn. In construction, orders continued to fall at the same rate as in
the fourth quarter of last year. But demand experienced by retailers
appeared to be rising.
The level of wage increases continued to fall in manufacturing, retail and
finance, but increases were reported in construction and leisure. Demand for
staff was generally weak, although the rate of decline in employment levels
fell in the first quarter. Fewer companies were seeking to recruit and fewer
were having difficulties recruiting.

FT  23 APR 92 / US pollution fears hit Lloyd's syndicates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTIES OVER the size of insurance claims from pollution and
asbestosis in the US have prevented two more syndicates - 190 and 868 - at
the troubled Lloyd's of London insurance market from closing their accounts
for the 1989 underwriting year.
To close their accounts, syndicate managers would have needed to build up
substantial reserves against possible future claims. This would have
involved heavy losses for Names - the individuals whose assets back
underwriting at Lloyd's.
Both syndicates are among a number of insurers which may have to meet many
billion-dollar claims as a result of federal and state-ordered clean-ups of
polluted sites.
Insurers are contesting their liability in the US courts and there is doubt
about the amounts that will be paid.
'To ask Names for a lot of money is not correct at this stage. We felt we
should wait until the problem is clearer,' said Mr John Wetherell, the
underwriter of 190, which is managed by the Cater Allen agency and is one of
the biggest syndicates on the market.
As well as leaving its 1989 year open, Mr Wetherell also said that he was
expecting to post a loss of Pounds 25.2m compared with stamp capacity (the
syndicate's capital base) of Pounds 157.4m.
It has also emerged that syndicate 868, managed by AJ Archer, is to leave
its 1989 year open.
Archer made the decision in spite of increasing its reserves against losses
from asbestosis, pollution and errors and omissions business.
Losses will amount to Pounds 13.6m, equivalent to 46 per cent of capacity,
and more than five times the amount forecast in January.
The decisions are in line with the recommendation of the Rowland task force,
which completed an exhaustive study of business practices at Lloyd's in
January and suggested that 'open years are the only practical way of dealing
with uncertainty' surrounding 'the size and timing of latent liability
claims'.
Another large syndicate, 932, said last month that it intended to leave its
1989 year open. Syndicate 932 is managed by Janson, Green.
Mr Wetherell was confident about the pattern of future pollution
settlements. In a key ruling earlier this month, the US Court of Appeal said
that Diamond Shamrock, a company making herbicides, could not claim on its
insurance policies for clearing waste at a site in Newark, New Jersey.
The number of Lloyd's agency groups continues to contract and Hiscox Group
is to acquire the RM Pateman Underwriting Agencies.
Hiscox's members' agency - which acquired the Pateman members' agency last
year - provides about 15 per cent of the Names of marine syndicate 52, the
biggest of two syndicates managed by Pateman.
Last year syndicate 52 suffered a sharp decline in support from members'
agents, its stamp capacity falling from Pounds 73m to Pounds 49m.
Syndicate 1034 has a stamp capacity of Pounds 16m and could eventually be
merged with syndicate 1139 - which has a capacity of Pounds 15.8m.
Hiscox now manages six syndicates which have a total capacity for this year
of more than Pounds 300m.

FT  23 APR 92 / BBC probe condemns current affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENT affairs programmes on the BBC have been condemned as inappropriate,
flat and dull in a document submitted to the corporation's governors and top
management by an internal task force.
An appendix to its report on the BBC as an information provider says
overlapping specialist programmes have prevented the corporation from
explaining fully central issues such as the future of the National Health
Service or European monetary union.
The task force is one of 15 looking at every aspect of the BBC's future in
advance of renegotiation of its Royal Charter, which will run out at the end
of 1996.
The report, BBC Current Affairs Television - A Strategy for the Nineties,
criticises the division of current affairs into four specialist areas -
politics, foreign affairs, social affairs and business and economics. In
reality, the anonymous author argues, issues overlap. Overall, the task
force believes the BBC does not provide appropriate current-affairs coverage
to fulfil its role as national broadcaster. 'Resources are devoted to
addressing what is assumed to be an interested minority, and the BBC's duty
to speak to everyone comes second,' says the report.
The craft standards of the programmes are said to be high 'but their
perspective is narrow'. The report adds: 'So, the overall effect, as many
witnesses have remarked, is dull and flat.' It also says that the
convergence of specialist programmes has undermined Panorama, the BBC's
current-affairs flagship, and that Panorama's distinctiveness is being
irreparably reduced.
The comments are broadly supported by other members of the task force, which
is chaired by Ms Glynwyn Benson, the new editor of Panorama. The comments
implicitly criticise the policies of Mr John Birt, the BBC deputy
director-general and director-general-elect, who was responsible for setting
up the new specialist programmes.
The report calls for a current affairs portfolio to include:
A primary role for Panorama in explaining the main issues.
A popular early evening issues show dealing with everything from sexual
harassment to dangerous dogs.
A more topical Question Time with relevant politicians.
Time Bomb, a new BBC2 programme to reveal the 'clouds on the horizon we all
need to know about'.
Only if there was money left over would there be a specialist secondary
current affairs portfolio, which would include programmes such as BBC2's The
Money Programme and in-depth political interviews.

FT  23 APR 92 / Class divide still rules some company canteens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE OUT of 10 companies with canteens still divide workers from bosses at
mealtimes, according to a survey published today.
It is called the 'multi-status dining operation' in the catering trade
although others might describe it as another example of the British
obsession with class. Companies offer traditional canteen fare in basic
surroundings for the manual workers; staff restaurants for white-collar
workers; and dining rooms for the high-ups.
Trade journal Caterer and Hotelkeeper - which commissioned the study along
with Touche Ross, the management consultants - believes the practice is
quintessentially British. In most Japanese or American companies, all
employees eat in one room, the study points out.
The survey, which criticises the multi-status operation, examined the
catering policies of 200 of the UK's largest companies and talked to 2,000
employees. It says: 'As well as being more expensive, multi-status is
frowned upon by management philosophies as being at the root of the 'them
and us' syndrome.'
However, the survey finds common ground between the classes in the food
consumed. There is a continuing attachment to chips across all divisions,
with 80 per cent of employees saying they should remain on the menu. Healthy
eating seems to be making some impact on desserts: fresh fruit salad and
yoghurt are popular, although syrup sponge has a strong following.
Most employers expect to subsidise catering or at the least break even -
although 16 per cent make a profit out of the operation. There is little
sign that companies are cutting catering expenditure because of the
recession.
The study concludes: 'Perhaps the reasons for the survival of staff
restaurants virtually intact is that parent companies want to maintain
workforce morale during periods of redundancies or other severe money-saving
schemes. Many firms take the view it is better to keep those unaffected by
redundancies sweet and maintain their subsidised employee-feeding package.'

FT  23 APR 92 / Teachers call for set levels of staffing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL regime for funding and staffing state schools in England and
Wales was demanded yesterday by the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers'
union.
If implemented, the reform would in effect entail abolition of the financial
role of local education authorities in England and Wales. It also would curb
the powers being conferred on head teachers and governing bodies through the
local management of schools.
NASUWT leaders told the union's annual conference yesterday that the change
was an inevitable consequence of government policies on the opting out of
schools and on capping of local authority spending.
Declaring the general election 'a watershed in the administration and
organisation of the state education service', delegates carried a motion
calling for 'all schools to be staffed on an agreed national model'.
Funding of teachers' salaries would then be 'a direct charge on the
Exchequer', with terms and conditions settled by the profession's
independent review body in conjunction with a new national forum
representing employers, unions and the government.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'This is a challenge to
the government to take their own national curriculum and pupil-testing
seriously.
'At the moment we have the nonsensical situation that teachers are being
made redundant because their pay award is not properly funded by some local
authorities whose spending is capped by the government.'
The conference, meeting in Scarborough, also urged the establishment of 'a
collegiate and collaborative' structure in schools, with an end to the
existing differentiated salary structure and performance pay for
individuals.
At a press conference later, Mr de Gruchy condemned moves by opted-out
schools not to recognise teachers' unions.
He said the refusal of Wilson's School in Sutton, south-west London, to
negotiate with NASUWT representatives over proposed redundancies would be
'vigorously resisted' and could lead to a strike.
Grant-maintained schools are not obliged by law to recognise unions, and
they are not bound to follow the recommendations of the teachers' pay review
body.
However, Mr de Gruchy urged staff in grant-maintained schools to press for
them to do so, even if pay increases larger than the national award were on
offer.
Mr de Gruchy said: 'This is the not-too-hidden agenda of the Tory right  -
breaking the teacher unions.'

THE UK venture capital industry invested 17 per cent less money last year in
what it said was 'the most hostile environment for investment in unquoted
companies for many years'.
Venture capitalists spent Pounds 1.15bn last year on 1,386 companies, a
decline of 11 per cent on the number of company investments in 1990,
according to the annual report of the British Venture Capital Association.
The industry put 86 per cent of its money into British companies compared
with just 79 per cent in 1990, and halved the percentage of funds going to
continental Europe to 8 per cent.
The 110 venture capital companies which responded to the survey - out of 114
association members - invested Pounds 989m in nearly 1,200 UK companies.
This represented a fall of 11 per cent in the amount invested and a 2 per
cent fall in the number of companies backed compared with 1990.
Start-up and early-stage financings accounted for just under a quarter of UK
deals and for 6 per cent of money invested. This was lower than in 1990 when
they accounted for just over a quarter of deals and 12 per cent of funds
invested.
Consumer-related business continued to dominate investments by sector, the
report notes, attracting 33 per cent of the total amount invested.
In spite of a sharp fall in the amount of money raised for venture capital
investments last year to Pounds 368m from about Pounds 830m in 1990, the UK
venture capital industry still has an uninvested pool of funds worth about
Pounds 2bn.

FT  23 APR 92 / Annual reports marked 'could do better'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL reports of British companies vary widely in their ability to
communicate information, according to an analysis by Meridian Design
Associates, a consultancy firm.
It says the typical report is 56 pages long, printed on A4 paper; contains a
vacuous 'vision statement'; has five sub-standard photographs; and a reader
needs 75 seconds to pick out the five most important facts about the
company.
Allied Lyons, Tesco and Tate &amp; Lyle rated highest among the top 100 quoted
companies on a scale assessing the financial information, illustrations and
lay-out of their annual reports for 1990 or last year.
The survey contains valuable lessons for businesses hoping to improve the
presentation of information provided to shareholders. 'Most companies could
easily do a better job of conveying basic information,' it concludes.
Meridian argues that annual reports have become 'big business', particularly
as a result of expanded share ownership. It estimates that 25m copies of
annual reports were produced last year. It says reports should have two main
tasks: to provide comprehensive and accurate information and to convey a
company image.
The firm concedes that annual report designers are often accused of
preferring pictures to words and graphics to information content.
'Fundamentally unsound companies often employ fancy devices to distract
attention from the unpalatable realities,' it says.
As a result, it attempted to produce an objective index by which to judge
annual reports, based on three criteria:
Financial information: the number of seconds (ideally no more than 100) in
which a busy analyst could find earnings per share, net asset value, and
three other facts which give a feel of the company and could be used to
support a buy, sell or hold recommendation.
Clarity: marks were awarded for signposts to help the reader, including a
contents page (Reed International did not have one), an index (only six
reports had them), a corporate profile and a vision statement (55 per cent
had one of the two), and a direc-tory of main subsidiaries with contact
phone numbers. Visuals: an assessment of the use of photographs and
graphics, with points deducted from a base score of 20 for poor quality and
irrelevant or confusing pictures.
Too often report pages present 'a jumble of different images' with too many
illustrations, Meridian says. Photographs are frequently blurred, badly lit
or have the appearance of being taken in photo booths. Sun Alliance, the
insurance company, and P&amp;O, the shipping and property group, were the only
reports which had no photographs at all.
Privatisation appears to have had little impact on the quality of reports.
The electricity companies generally had few comments on prospects as well as
poor photographs. Water company reports suffered from 'dull pictures,
tedious text and no real signposting'.

FT  23 APR 92 / Prince warns on population increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCE CHARLES warned in London yesterday that environmental improvement and
alleviation of Third World poverty would be jeopardised by the predicted
doubling of the world's population to 10bn by the year 2050.
He said that some delegations to the forthcoming Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro were blocking discussion on the need to reduce the growth in world
population.
The prince did not name the delegations which he said were determined to
prevent discussion of the issue. But they are understood to include the
Vatican, the Philippines and Latin American countries. The UK strongly
favours having the population issue on the agenda of the summit, to be held
in June.
'I don't in all logic see how any society can hope to improve its lot when
population growth regularly exceeds economic growth,' he said.
'We will not protect the environment until we address the issue of
population growth and poverty in the same breath. I wish that these simple
and incontestable truths could find greater prominence on the Rio agenda.'
The prince was addressing a session of the World Commission on Environment
and Development which will issue a statement tomorrow giving its views on
the Earth Summit. The commission was formed in 1984 by the United Nations to
draw up a global environmental agenda.
The prince said that unless a far-sighted agenda for action was worked out
'we will be sacrificing the survival or our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren for short-term gain'.
Negotiations for the summit have been marked by differences between
industrialised and developing countries. But the prince asked why resources
could not be pooled to 'tackle the unfolding crisis together'.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister - who heads the
commission - warned that the summit could fail unless the 'watering down' of
proposals during preparatory talks was reversed by pressure of public
opinion. 'We must enter a period of firm action,' she said.

FT  23 APR 92 / Accountants' salaries show sharp increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS' salaries have risen sharply in the past year in spite of the
recession, a survey by Hays Management Consultants showed yesterday.
Average base salaries rose by 10.3 per cent in the 12 months to February 1
this year, down slightly from an increase of 11.1 per cent in the previous
year.
The consultants listed pay by experience category and said that the average
salary for a first-year accountancy trainee early this year was Pounds
14,567. For a newly-qualified accountant it was Pounds 21,226, for someone
with four to five years' experience after qualifying Pounds 27,627 and for
someone having worked nine to 12 years after qualification Pounds 43,836.
The only salary increase which was larger this year than last was for
accountants who had qualified four to five years earlier, for which the
figure grew by 11 per cent compared with 10 per cent last year.
Pay for tax professionals was up 8.1 per cent, compared with 9.6 per cent in
the previous 12 months. Average base salaries under the experience
categories were Pounds 15,950, Pounds 24,711, Pounds 32,915 and Pounds
45,207.
For industrial and service-sector companies, the average base salary was
Pounds 14,303 for first-year trainees, Pounds 20,924 for newly-qualified
staff, Pounds 27,121 for those four to five years after qualifying, and
Pounds 42,244 for those qualified for nine to 12 years.
In the public sector, salaries in the same categories were Pounds 14,146,
Pounds 19,965, Pounds 25,461 and Pounds 40,965. In finance, they were Pounds
16,346, Pounds 23,971, Pounds 31,792 and Pounds 53,335 respectively. The
salaries paid to those in private practice were within these ranges.
The seventh annual Hays survey covered accountants from 522 organisations
and tax professionals from 127. The survey also covered a range of benefits
offered to the employees. Only 7 per cent of organisations did not provide
company cars. The average list price of cars provided for a newly qualified
accountant was Pounds 12,000, rising to about Pounds 19,000 for someone with
nine to 12 years' service after qualifying.
Pensions and company cars were the most common benefits offered, although a
growing number of organisations was reviewing changes in the provision of
these benefits. The usual number of holidays was 25 days per year.
The largest growth in accountants' salaries came in the oil industry, with
that for newly-qualified staff rising 27.4 per cent on last year and 24.2
per cent for those four to five years after qualifying.

FT  23 APR 92 / City workers accused of complacency on security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and BETHAM HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLACENCY among companies and workers about security in the City of London
was criticised yesterday. The comments followed an IRA bomb 10 days ago
which killed three people and caused extensive damage.
Mr John Wyatt, a security and bomb-disposal expert, said: 'Some companies
feel they are faced with a situation they cannot understand and are
incapable of taking any measures that will help them.'
Police said the scale of damage caused by the St Mary Axe bomb had made
companies take the possibility of terrorist attack seriously but employees
were less concerned. Two meetings for company representatives had attracted
300 managers, while only three people had attended a well-advertised police
meeting on Tuesday for the public.
As the city continued clearing up, getting back to business appeared to take
priority over tightening security.
At Commercial Union, whose head offices on 10 floors of the 23-storey CU
tower took the full force of the blast contractors are concentrating on
making the building weatherproof. envisage extra security precautions. It is
expected to move its HQ into the Cutlers Exchange building on the eastern
edge of the City.
Companies which have moved into temporary offices such as Sanwa, the
Japanese bank, said the main priority had been to ensure that dealing rooms
could operate normally again. Mr Noboshi Kamei, Sanwa's deputy managing
director, said: 'It is impossible to prevent a bomb disaster from
happening.'
Chief Inspector Peter Moore of the City Police said: 'Businesses have begun
to realise the necessity to have back-up systems for the retention of
computer data, financial information or whatever.' The lack of interest in
Tuesday's meeting had been partly because the incident had gone from the
headlines.
The judge in the Birmingham Six case last night admitted he felt unhappy
about the verdict which sentenced the men to 16 years in prison before they
were freed on appeal. Lord Bridge said on Thames Television's This Week
programme that the judiciary should take a 'share of the responsibility' for
injustices. He was unhappy, but did not feel guilty about the Birmingham
Six.

A ROW over the leaking of a secret Scotland Yard report on the IRA to the
Irish Times intensified yesterday with allegations that M15, the British
intelligence service may have been responsible.
Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow said it was 'more than likely' that
M15 was responsible.
The row follows the sending to the prime minister of a Home Office report
which discusses the possibility of M15 taking control of intelligence
gathering from the police.
Scotland Yard last night would not confirm a report that senior officers
were convinced that the document leaked to the Irish Times formed part of an
M15 'dirty tricks' campaign. It has set up an internal inquiry. The document
sugggests the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist squad had 'little'
intelligence on the IRA members responsible for some 17 killings in more
than four attacks on the mainland since 1988.

FT  23 APR 92 / English school-leavers prefer employment to study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH school-leavers would rather get a job than train for qualifications,
unlike their German counterparts, according to a study by the Anglo-German
Foundation.
A research project funded by the foundation compared the career routes of
160 young people aged 16 to 19 in Bremen and Paderborn, Germany, with their
peers in Liverpool and Swindon.
The Germans, whether they had left education or not, saw themselves as
students or apprentices and postponed entry into jobs at least two years
later than their English counterparts. The English saw Youth Training, the
training scheme for 16 to 18-year-olds, as a poor alternative to a job and
placed little value on vocational qualifications. 'Jobs in England paid, on
average, twice the YT allowance, so there was little incentive to complete
training once a job became available,' said Professor John Bynner of City
University in the foundation's newsletter. 'There was much movement in and
out of jobs, unemployment and training schemes, especially in Swindon, where
jobs were plentiful.'
In contrast the Germans knew it was necessary to complete an apprenticeship
because entry to a trade was impossible without qualifications.
The English expressed more confidence in their ability to get jobs and
retain them, even if that meant moving away from home. Germans felt more
uncertain about their future.
Prof Bynner said reform and improvement was needed in both countries. The
German system needed to be more flexible to give young people a wider range
of occupational experience and the English system needed to regulate entry
into employment more effectively and build more educational and general
training experience into employment.

BIFU, the banking union, was yesterday considering legal action against
Royal Bank of Scotland for allegedly breaching agreed procedures for

The dispute over pay has developed into a wrangle on whether staff are
entitled to withdraw from overtime they normally work.
Last night the two sides disputed the number of staff on suspension. Bifu
said more than 40 staff, including some in Edinburgh, had been told to stay
away from work. The bank said 26 staff were still refusing to work overtime
and that the action was restricted to central Glasgow.

which to talk to the union'.
The union called a ballot of Yorkshire's 13,000 miners after British Coal

MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, said yesterday that campaigners for a
referendum on Scotland's political future were 'scurrying around like
headless chickens, seeking a re-run of the general election in the hope of
getting a different result', James Buxton writes.
Since the election there has been growing pressure for a multi-option
referendum on Scotland's constitutional future. On Tuesday the Scottish
Trades Union Congress called for a referendum. The Scottish National party
is also seeking one.
Mr Lang dismissed a call for 'civil disobedience within the law'. The call
was issued on Tuesday by Mr Charles Gray, Labour leader of Strathclyde
Regional Council, Scotland's largest local authority, as part of the
campaign to win constitutional change in Scotland. Mr Lang said it was a
case of 'post-election rhetoric' as well as a contradiction in terms.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday that the case for
a referendum was 'unanswerable'. Refusal would cause 'bitterness and
frustration', he told the Scottish TUC annual conference in Perth.

FT  23 APR 92 / Chances of US rescue for Ravenscraig appear slim: Martin
Dickson assesses the significance of a visit by steelmaker Nucor to the
Scottish plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFLICKER of hope for saving the doomed Ravenscraig steelworks sparked in
Scotland this week at the news that a team from Nucor, arguably the most
successful US steel company of the past two decades, has been casting an eye
over the complex.
Nucor, which has pioneered the use of a cost-effective new steel-making
technology called thin-stab casting, is one of the lowest cost manufacturers
of steel in the world. It is the leader of the US 'mini-mills' - producers
which have undercut the large, integrated steel manufacturers in many
markets through the use of scrap metal and electric-arc furnace technology.
But while its trip to Scotland demonstrates the company's interest in
international expansion, the chances of a deal to save Ravenscraig seem
slim.
The team has been saying little, as have British Steel and Scottish
Enterprise, the government agency entrusted with marketing the Ravenscraig
site. But Mr Ken Iverson, chairman of Nucor, said the aim was to see whether
Ravenscraig might provide a suitable site for a new thin-slab plant,
producing sheet steel for both the British and Continental markets.
He added that if Nucor did decide such a project were feasible, it would
want to find some other partner to take a majority stake. Nucor would have a
minority role, although it would be substantially involved in both training
and technology transfer.
Industry analysts say the company has been looking at ways of expanding
outside the US. But Mr Christopher Plummer of Wefa, a Philadelphia-based
forecasting group, says: 'Asia-Pacific is probably top of their list, and
even there the strategy appears to involve minority stakes in joint
ventures, with Nucor pro-viding technical assistance.' Thin-slab casting
involves forming molten steel into slabs just two inches thick, using a new
type of tunnel mould. The slabs are then immediately compressed into even
thinner finished steel.
The process is much quicker and less capital-intensive than traditional
steel-making. However steel now made with the new technique is more suitable
for the lower-grade end of the sheet market, and not for more demanding
areas such as car-body panels. Mr Plummer estimates that Nucor's costs of
steelmaking using the technique are up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) lower
than those of the integrated US manufacturers.
The technique is starting to be introduced to Europe. An Italian mini-mill
group opened the Europe's first thin-slab mill last year, and Dutch and
German companies may follow suit. But construction of a facility at
Ravenscraig would face obstacles. They include:
Opposition from British Steel, which is unlikely to relish competition from
a low-cost rival in its own backyard. Nucor would also find British Steel
and other efficient European manufacturers tougher competition than it has
faced so far in the US, adds Mr Plummer. 'In the UK, Nucor would have a very
marginal cost advantage over British Steel,' he says. Problems in finding
suitable investors for a new facility. Since Nucor would have a minority
role in any new company, a well-financed joint-venture partner, presumably
with substantial experience of the steel industry, would have to step into
the breach.
The capital costs of a new plant. Thin-slab technology may be cheaper than
traditional integrated facilities, but the sums involved are still large for
a cash-strapped industry such as steel. Energy and raw materials costs. For
the thin-slab process to work in the most cost-effective way, it needs to be
fed with relatively inexpensive supplies of molten metal. That in turn
depends on the local electricity costs and the price and availability
locally of scrap metal.
If scrap were not readily available for Ravenscraig, Nucor might be able to
get raw material using a new method which eliminates the need for costly
blast furnaces, although this would push up the capital costs and would be
dependent on the price of gas.
All this adds up to an extremely complex set of financial and political
hurdles. Unless the Nucor team decides immediately that the project is not
feasible, it will take some time, and much intricate negotiation, for
Ravenscraig to discover whether there might yet be life after death.
SENIOR executives of Nucor yesterday completed their two-day visit to
British Steel's complex at Ravenscraig, near Motherwell, where they are
exploring the possibility of establishing a steel-production operation when
British Steel closes the plant in September, James Buxton writes.
Yesterday, after meeting union leaders at Ravenscraig, the Nucor team
travelled to Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde to inspect British Steel's
ore-handling terminal. The Nucor team is expected to remain in Britain until
Sunday.
The visit is at the invitation of Scottish Enterprise, the government
development body, following an initiative by Mr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for
Motherwell South. The visit has been played down by Nucor to avoid unduly
raising hopes of a reprieve for at least some of the 1,200 jobs due to be
lost by the plant's closure.

FT  23 APR 92 / World Trade News: Bush senses new ideas in trade's
atmospherics - Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne on contrasting views of
yesterday's Gatt talks in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL may have been sweetness and light on the White House lawn after the EC
lunch yesterday. But before the president could host an evening barbecue for
the Washington Redskins football team, US and European officials were
putting conspicuously different spin on what had actually been agreed.
On the US side, the Bush presidential campaign, which drives the agenda
these days in Washington, had decreed this to be Trade Week, of which the
meeting with the EC delegation along with the ever flickering hopes of
rescuing the Uruguay Round were to be the centrepiece.
In the event of total failure, US officials had carefully depressed
expectations, blaming the impasse in Gatt, the president's highest trade
priority, on the EC's inability to fit its internal farm reforms into the
world-wide agriculture trade rules proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt
director general.
President Bush was thus able to squeeze some drama and good news out of the
2 1/2 hour meeting with the announcement that 'new ideas', presented by both
sides, had convinced him that the EC was determined on an early settlement.
In sum, this could be dressed up as a solid day's presidential work, looking
after the affairs of the nation.
The substance, however, was still seen by some in the administration to be a
little wanting. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, pronounced
herself 'more optimistic' than before - but only because 'the atmospherics
were good'.
But she admitted that after three years of wrangling over farm products
there was not much new to be said. 'If you have variables, you can mix
around, so it's an alternate way to proceed, I suppose that can be seen as a
new idea,' she said. 'Several alternatives were suggested. I have thought of
these ideas in the past and I will continue to think about them, and other
combinations.'
She stuck to the Dunkel text, which the EC is hoping to see modified, and
said that if the EC cannot accept it, it must find some formula for
achieving something equivalent.
Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, on the other hand, really
did seem to ooze confidence that something significant had been achieved, or
at least attempted. Even his own Washington-based delegation, which had
known little of his plans before his arrival, confessed to being surprised.
At breakfast, Mr Delors had characterised what he would say to Mr Bush as
'modest'. If Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a far more important
personage, had been able to achieve no breakthrough at Camp David in March,
he could hardly be anything other than modest, he said.
By mid-afternoon, mere modesty had been translated into 'new ideas' and then
into a 'commitment' (not the words of the EC president, but of Mr Bush
himself). Thus emboldened, Mr Delors was able to foresee the time when, the
agricultural impasse with the US out of the way, everything in the Uruguay
Round could then fall into place and be signed, sealed and delivered.
To one close observer of Mr Delors, he has undergone something of a
Damascene conversion in recent months. He now not only really does believe
that a failure in the Uruguay Round would grievously harm the global economy
but also that the Common Agricultural Policy, which blocks the agreement,
needs total transformation.
Thus, on this interpretation, he really did have something new to say to Mr
Bush and apparently succeeded in impressing the president. However, actual
negotiations, now that the political will has been established, will return
to the murky worlds of 'blue boxes', 'green lights', 'peace clauses' and
other obfuscations of the reality of the need to cut farm subsidies.
Presidents, of Europe or the US, rarely get that deep into the negotiating
woodwork.

MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, warned yesterday that a Pacific
trading group might emerge to counter European and North American blocs if
Gatt's Uruguay Round trade talks fail.
Speaking on the second day of his official visit to Indonesia, Mr Keating
blamed the 'indifferent progress' of trade negotiations on 'a lack of
determination on the part of the Europeans to make the Gatt round succeed'.
He characterised the EC as 'very much a United States of Europe'. In
response to the EC and the development of the North American Free Trade Area
(Nafta) grouping the US, Canada and Mexico, a third trade area in the
Pacific might emerge, he warned.
A Pacific trade bloc would not be in the interests of Australia, Mr Keating
said. To prevent its occurrence, he called on the US in particular to review
its policy towards Asia.
'It is important that the US plays a role beyond its continental boundaries
in trade in Asia,' he said.
'The policy of the United States should be broader, deeper, wider than
simply the strategic policy of the US defence department or the US navy.'
Mr Keating suggested that the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group
(Apec) should be used as a forum where 'the two largest economies (the US
and Japan) can resolve some of their differences'.
Japan and the US are important trading partners for Australia, Mr Keating
said, and 'we don't want our (Australia's) loyalties tested between these
two friendly countries'.
Australia is likely to find resistance amongst some Asian countries to
giving Apec an enhanced role, especially if it were to undermine existing
trade groups such as the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).
Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister, said his government saw
'validity' in Mr Keating's proposal but wished 'to mull it over some more
 .and see when the best time would be to initiate this idea'.
The two countries yesterday signed economic and political agreements on
fisheries, double taxation and extradition. They represented evidence of
Australia's determination to look towards Asia for its economic future, Mr
Keating said,
Both countries sought to defuse any 'misunderstanding' over East Timor
following statements by President Suharto the previous night that Indonesia
would not accept foreign interference in its domestic affairs.
Earlier, at a meeting with Mr Alatas, Mr Keating had suggested that East
Timor, the former Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976, should
be given special territory status. He also expressed concern at the
prosecution of East Timorese nationalists.
Mr Alatas said yesterday that President Suharto's remarks had been
misinterpreted.
'What he (President Suharto) was trying to say was: 'Don't misunderstand
us.' We do accept criticism, we do accept friendly advice.'
Mr Keating told the Indonesian Foreign Policy Forum yesterday that East
Timor had received 'disproportionate attention'.

FT  23 APR 92 / World Trade News: Nissan will bear brunt of cuts in car
sales to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second largest car maker, appears set to bear the brunt of
the self-imposed 'voluntary' cut in direct car exports to the US agreed last
month by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti).
The company's import quota for this year will fall by at least 44 per cent
to below 300,000, from a quota of 532,276 and actual exports of 324,132 last
year, according to Japanese industry sources quoted by Reuter.
The cut compares with an overall reduction of 28.2 per cent, to 1.65m from
2.3m vehicles, set as an informal imports ceiling by Miti in March because
of growing friction with Washington.
Exports to the US from Japan last year are estimated at only 1.73m vehicles,
against 1.85m in 1990. But Miti's lower ceiling has been derided by the US
motor industry, with Ford's chairman and chief executive, Mr Harold Poling,
saying Japan has 'learned nothing' about the need to balance its trade with
the US.
According to Japanese motor industry insiders, Toyota's quota will be just
above 480,000, down 21.2 per cent from 1991 and just 6 per cent in terms of
actual 1991 exports of 510,489.
Honda's quota is under 320,000, down 24.5 per cent from its 1991 quota and 6
per cent from its actual exports Mitsubishi's quota will be above 150,000,
down from 193,658 and actual exports of 165,284, and Mazda below 200,000,
down from 226,116 and exports of 210,208
Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru) will be above 70,000, down from 106,805 and
exports of 51,158. Isuzu will be above 100,000, down from 124,210 and up
from actual exports of 93,100 last year. Suzuki will be above 30,000, down
from 64,552, and actual exports of 30,236. Daihatsu, with a 20,000 quota
last year, is pulling out.

<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday said it had signed a
semiconductor cross-licence agreement with Samsung, a leading South Korean
electronics company.
It is the first broad cross-licensing agreement for semi-conductors between
Japan and Korea to be publicly confirmed, and symbolises growing Japanese
acceptance that the South Korean industry has come of age.
The companies would not comment on details of the agreement. But a report in
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese economic daily, said Samsung would
pay Fujitsu about Y4bn (Pounds 17.4m) to compensate Fujitsu for use of its
advanced technology.
The newspaper said the agreement would run for five years and would cover
technologies patented in Japan, the US and in Europe.
The agreement is another step towards normalising business relations between
the Japanese and South Korean semiconductor industries.
Other such agreements between Japanese and South Korean companies are
likely.
The Japanese industry has been concerned about the impact of emerging South
Korean producers on the market, and is an ironic mirror image of US industry
concern over the expansion of the Japanese industry.
Samsung's sales of 4 megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, in
particular, have proved a headache for the Japanese industry since they have
been priced below similar Japanese devices. The worldwide semiconductor
industry has been depressed, and manufacturers are losing money on the 4M
DRAM chips.
The Fujitsu-Samsung agreement provides a legal framework for the companies
to use each other's technologies and for payment of royalties.

<TEXT>
THE Korean subsidiary of Coca-Cola has filed a trademark infringement suit
against Lotte Chilsung Beverage over its marketing of a soft drink similar
to Coca-Cola's Sprite, John Burton reports from Seoul.
Korea Coca-Cola launched Sprite in February. Lotte introduced a similar
beverage two weeks later under the brand name Sprint with a package design
resembling the Sprite product. Lotte has rejected the suit as 'groundless',
claiming companies in the competitive Korean soft drink market often imitate
each other's products.
Lotte said Sprint was the latest development in its soda pop series. But in
an apparent response to the Coca-Cola suit, Lotte has recently changed the
name of the controversial drink to Sprinter. Coca-Cola claims Sprite is
outselling Sprinter. Coca-Cola has complained about Lotte's marketing. It
introduced its Hi-C orange juice into the Korean market in 1982. Lotte then
sold a similar drink known as Heil-7. Coca-Cola did not contest that case. A
decision on Sprite is due this week.

a minimal response.
He complained yesterday he had been kept off the ballot in many states.
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Paul Tsongas, still
second to Mr Bill Clinton in accumulating Democratic party delegates,
suffered a previously unrevealed recurrence of cancer in 1987. Mr Tsongas
had made much of his recovery from the disease during his campaign.

FT  23 APR 92 / Mexican explosions kill at least 129
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 129 people were killed yesterday when a series of gas explosions
tore through the Mexican city of Guadalajara, agencies report from Mexico
City. The Mexican Red Cross said up to 600 people had been injured.
Hospitals were filled after a series of at least nine blasts rocked the
eastern part of the city, Mexico's second-largest with a population of about
3m.
Residents of the affected area had complained the day before of gases
escaping from sewer ducts.
A statement by Pemex, Mexico's state oil monopoly, said the gases came from
a privately owned cooking oil factory and leaked into the sewage system. It
blamed the explosion on hexane gas, which is used in extracting edible oils
from seeds.
However, the city's fire chief said the explosions were caused by petrol.
The blasts damaged offices and residences, many heavily, within a 12-block
radius.  Officials estimate as many as 1,000 buildings have been affected.
About 700 police and rescue workers frantically dug through the wreckage of
collapsed buildings.
The federal government declared a national emergency and began moving field
hospitals, rescue workers, medical helicopters and other equipment into the
city, 350 miles north-west of Mexico City. The governor of Guadalajara
ordered the state university to be opened to provide emergency housing for
victims.
Doctors and health workers said sewage was leaking from some of the blasted
sewer lines, posing a health threat.
The city, famed for its Spanish colonial architecture, has a large community
of American retirees as well as foreign medical students.

FT  23 APR 92 / Ex-Soviet states must 'learn frombold E Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union could face a
further economic downturn as they cope with the transition to a market
economy and the disruption of their traditional trading relations with each
other, the International Monetary Fund warns.
Output in the two regions has dropped by an estimated 20 per cent in the
last two years, the IMF says in its latest World Economic Outlook. In some
countries this has fallen by as much as 35 per cent.
While the Outlook says this contraction is not surprising, given the extent
of the economic transformation undertaken in the regions, the extent of the
drop has been greater than expected.
The decline appears to have begun to bottom out in some countries but
further output losses may yet be in store, especially in the republics of
the former Soviet Union, where the process of economic reform has barely
started.
'Compared with the eastern European countries, the starting point of the
republics of the former USSR is much less favourable,' the IMF says. While
Russia introduced an economic reform programme in February, most of the
other republics have yet to elaborate a comprehensive strategy, it notes.
The Fund argues that the republics should learn from the eastern European
experience the need for 'bold and comprehensive reform so as to put in place
all the main elements of a free-market system from the outset'.
Output over the last two years appears to have varied widely between
different republics, with Georgia and Armenia suffering the sharpest
contractions as a result of the earthquake in 1990 and the blockade by
Azerbaijan in 1991.
In Russia, the largest republic, the IMF estimates that real gross domestic
product fell 9 per cent last year after growing a scant 0.4 per cent in
1990. In Ukraine, net material product may have dropped by 9.6 per cent in
1991 after a decline of 3.4 per cent a year earlier.
Based on official estimates, however, output may have fallen only slightly
or not at all in 1991 in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
All the republics share the problem of inflation.
The IMF warns that credit control is effectively non-existent in many
republics as real interest rates remain strongly negative and governments
and state-controlled enterprises continue to enjoy virtually unlimited
access to credit from central banks.
The breakdown of monetary control has further eroded the role of the rouble
as a medium of exchange in the former Soviet Union, leading to an increase
in barter deals between republics.
It is unclear whether other republics have established the conditions
necessary for setting up separate currencies.
'At least in the short run, maintaining the rouble for some, if not all, of
the republics could help safeguard a common economic space and avert a
further decline in inter-republic trade.'
Some republics, the report warns, are vulnerable to the trade shock that can
be expected as energy prices are liberalised and rise to world market
levels.
Only Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan have positive balances in energy
trade with the other republics.
The damage caused to the economies of east Europe by the collapse in
intra-regional trade underlines the importance of safeguarding trading links
between republics of the former Soviet Union.
The IMF has agreed membership terms with Azerbaijan, the last former Soviet
republic to complete negotiations to join the organisation.
THE republics of the former Soviet Union have been warned to take urgent
action to stop the flight of capital, which is draining away foreign
exchange badly needed to make debt repayments and finance investment, writes
George Graham.
The IMF warned yesterday that the role of the rouble within the former
Soviet Union had been rapidly eroded, and that the currency system was
distorted by multiple exchange rates, varying with differing transaction.
Enterprises have been driven to keep their foreign exchange earnings outside
the country, to avoid surrendering them at highly overvalued exchange rates,
the Fund says. This aggravates the shortage.
Mr Horst Schulman, managing director of the Institute of International
Finance, yesterday estimated capital flight from the former Soviet Union at
about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) last year, and said foreign exchange was
probably still leaving at a rate exceeding Dollars 1bn a month.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru has announced a 12-month timetable for
the restoration of democracy, in an attempt to avert international economic
sanctions against his military-backed government.
Mr Fujimori, who closed Congress and suspended the judiciary on April 5,
said parliamentary elections would be held next February. In his speech the
president said he would hold a referendum on July 5 to obtain an endorsement
for his 'emergency government'.
Constitutional amendments would be announced at the end of August, and these
would be put to another vote in November. Mr Fujimori said it was not his
intention to install a dictatorship, but to build a 'more efficient
democracy'.
There was no immediate reaction from a delegation of the Organisation of
American States (OAS) that arrived in Lima this week to press Mr Fujimori to
restore constitutional rule. But the president's speech was clearly timed to
impress the visiting diplomats.
At home, Mr Fujimori is struggling to maintain business confidence following
the resignation of Mr Carlos Bolona, the finance minister.
The Lima stock exchange plunged on news of the resignation. Mr Augusto
Blacker Miller, the current foreign minister, is expected to take over the
finance portfolio.

FT  23 APR 92 / Developing-country reformscould bolster performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries could be facing a decade of sustainable growth after 10
years of stagnation and falling living standards, the International Monetary
Fund believes.
'The developing world would appear to be at a critical juncture,' the IMF
says in its latest World Economic Outlook. 'If reforms take hold, and the
external environment is favourable, the rest of the decade could see
sustainable growth in per-capita gross domestic product; on the other hand,
if reforms are not sustained, and if stabilisation policies are relaxed
prematurely, growth is likely to remain elusive.'
The IMF expects the economies of developing countries, excluding eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, to grow by an average of 6.7 per cent
this year. They shrugged off the economic slowdown in industrialised
countries and achieved relatively strong average growth of 3.5 and 3.3 per
cent in 1990 and 1991 respectively.
This resilient performance reflected the adoption of structural reform
policies in many countries and the reduction of macro-economic imbalances,
such as high fiscal deficits and high inflation.
While the prosperity of the industrialised world is still important for the
welfare of developing nations, the IMF says it has become increasingly
evident in recent years that developing nations' own structural and
financial policies are the most decisive determinants of their performance.
It says that the successful newly industrialising economies of Asia - Hong
Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand -
have pursued generally cautious fiscal and monetary policies and encouraged
private-sector activity and export-oriented development.
Similar policies are being adopted elsewhere and have resulted in improved
economic performance in countries as diverse as Mexico, Chile, Ghana,
Mauritius, Morocco and Tunisia.
The IMF says the 1980s taught a painful lesson that sustained growth could
not be achieved in an environment of high and variable inflation. High
inflation hampered investment, in particular.
Another IMF finding is that very high military spending in some developing
countries has contributed to unsustainable budget deficits and debt
servicing difficulties.
The Fund says that military spending in the developing world remains
excessive at an average of 4.5 per cent of GDP. With lower spending on arms,
many countries would be able to increase capital formation and output and
improve living standards.

suffering go on

FUELLED by support from Libya and Iran, the Sudanese army is waging its
biggest and most successful offensive in the nine-year war against southern
rebels, forcing hundreds of thousands of starving women and children to flee
their homes. Experts say that the offensive is bent on destroying rebel
forces at any cost and could provoke southern Sudan's worse humanitarian
crisis.
Aid officials working around the clock in Nairobi to ferry food into
southern Sudan said yesterday that soldiers of the fundamentalist Islamic
government of General Omar Hassan al Bashir were continuing their fierce
battle against the remaining strongholds of the mainly Christian Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
Further emboldened by a damaging internal split in the rebel movement, the
Sudanese army has made unprecedented territorial gains in its lightning
six-week offensive. Moving by road, and by barge along the Nile, supported
with bombing raids by Libyan-supplied MiG jet fighters, Sudanese soldiers
advancing in four columns have captured the key towns of Bor, Pochala,
Kongor and Yirol. And now, allegedly with Iranian military advisers, they
are pushing east towards Akobo on the border with Ethiopia and south to
relieve Juba, the besieged southern capital which has long been encircled by
rebel forces.
The success of the campaign, described by one analyst yesterday as 'nothing
short of a jihad (holy war) to crush the south,' has been helped not only by
the Libyan and Iranian training but by Chinese-made heavy weapons and
road-building equipment. The government has also attempted to starve out the
civilian population supporting the rebels by imposing a six-week ban on
critical United Nations relief flights (the ban was lifted on Sunday after
intense international pressure).
It is not possible to know how many people have died from starvation because
most of southern Sudan is cut off, but aid workers say at least several
hundred people have died during the past six weeks in the few areas with
which they are in contact, and that hundreds of thousands of women and
children are malnourished and in severe need of food, oral rehydration
therapies and medicines in the sun-baked wilds of one of Africa's most
inhospitable regions.
Moreover, after the years of rugged bush warfare between the Arab north and
black African south, which has reduced southern Sudan to a primitive
wasteland, there appears less chance than ever of a resolution to the
conflict.
Peace talks, which are apparently being brokered by President Daniel arap
Moi of Kenya and Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of the Lonrho trading
conglomerate, appear unlikely to make any progress. Southern fears of
Arab-Moslem domination have intensified to the point where many Christians
in the south believe that the intention of the north is genocide.
The government of Gen Bashir, which seized power in 1989, has continued to
build an oppressive Islamic state, and Amnesty International, the
international human rights group, said last week that the government's
denials of grossly violating human rights had no credibility.
Torture, brutal beatings and short-term detention, the organisation said,
were the government's standard reaction to dissent: 'Prisoners have been
shackled and suspended from their cell walls, sometimes upside down, others
have had their testicles crushed with pliers.'
The US has expressed fear that Iran is establishing a 'beach-head' to export
Islamic revolution across Africa and provide a base from which terrorist
groups can operate. Last Thursday, Sudan's military-appointed assembly
declared its support for Col Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, and
denounced UN sanctions against Libya as an 'international crime'.
The rebels, for their part, are divided into two factions, one based at
Nasir, the other at Kapoeta and Torit, after a split emerged last August in
the high command over allegations of gross human rights violations against
Dr John Garang, the SPLA leader. Both factions, partly based on tribal
lines, have spent much of the past four months attacking each other's forces
and trading insults through press releases and propaganda sheets printed in
Nairobi.

FT  23 APR 92 / Threat to Kabul dismissed: Afghan leaders seek to isolate
Hezb-i-Islam fundamentalists

<DATELINE>
   CHARIKAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFGHAN guerrilla and military leaders yesterday expressed confidence that
they could ward off a threatened attack on Kabul by the Islamic
fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islam movement.
Speaking at Charikar, some 50 kms north of Kabul, Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, the
mujahideen commander whose alliance controls the north of the country,
confirmed that units of the Hezb were advancing towards Kabul through Loghar
province to the south. He said they were about 25kms from the city.
But he was dismissive of the ability of the forces led by Mr Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar to launch a successful attack on the capital. He condemned Mr
Hekmatyar - who has threatened to begin an offensive against Kabul on Sunday
if an Islamic interim government has not been established by then - as a
'warmongerer' . Mr Masood, a gaunt, self-confident guerrilla leader, was
speaking before talks here yesterday with Mr Benon Sevan, the UN special
envoy on Afghanistan.
Mr Masood said he did not think the forces were large. He said: 'If Mr
Hekmatyar had the forces to come into Kabul he would have done so by now.'
As we drove back from Charikar across the plain to the north of Kabul,
several hundred of Mr Masood's Jamiat-i-Islam guerrillas were marching
towards the capital. They appeared to have been sent to reinforce security
around the city. Around Charikar tanks and armoured personnel carriers were
being kept in a state of readiness - apparently to move on Kabul if
necessary.
None the less the strategy of Mr Masood, of the military government in
Kabul, of the UN and of Pakistan seems to be to attempt to neutralise the
Hezb so as to avoid a fight for the city.
Mr Sevan went out of his way to praise Mr Masood for not so far marching on
Kabul himself and for seeking talks with other mujahideen leaders to
establish an interim mujahideen government to administer the country. He
said: 'I welcome the fact that he has taken a very judicious step in
deciding not to march into Kabul except peacefully.'
Mr Masood, while dismissing the original UN concept of a neutral interim
government, said 'we want to talk with others' over the setting up of a
transitional Islamic administration.
On the two-hour drive to Charikar, there was virtually no sign of army or
paramilitary forces - confirming the complete mujahideen domination of the
north of the country. Until 10 days ago this road - which climbs through the
Salang pass to the Russian border - was officially controlled by government
forces which banned it to foreigners.
We drove through numerous checkpoints manned by both the Jamiat-i-Islam of
Mr Masood and by Hezb guerrillas. On either side of the road villages had
been flattened by Russian bombing. The small town of Serai Khoja -
surrounded in the bright spring sunlight by pink and white apple and almond
blossom - looked like Dresden after the second world war.
Mr Masood, who seems certain to play a dominant role in postwar Afghan
politics, was alert and nimble in his replies to questions. Educated at the
Lycee Istiklal in Kabul, he spoke good basic French - but said he had not
used it for years. He was adamant that former President Najibullah should
stand: 'His head belongs to the people of Afghanistan.'
Mr Rashid Dostan, the powerful Uzbeck militia commander and an ally of
Masood's told Mr Sevan on Tuesday that there was no question of Mr
Najibullah being released. Mr Dostan's troops control Kabul airport and are
manning the southern defences of the capital.
Mr Jan Karlsson, an Icelandic Red Cross nurse, was shot dead in Maydan
Shahr, 30km south of Kabul, yesterday. A man in a crowd of onlookers shot Mr
Karlsson as he and two Swiss colleagues were evacuating two wounded men from
the town.
UN special envoy Benon Sevan and mujahideen leader Ahmad Shah Massood before
their talks yesterday on forming an interim government
Mr Benon Sevan, UN special envoy for Afghanistan, yesterday asked Pakistan
for help in providing transit for Mr Najibullah, the former Afghan
president, into exile - probably in India - according to a senior government
official, Farhan Bokhari reports. Mr Najibullah is believed to be hiding in
a UN office in Kabul. The request came only a day after earlier reports that
Mr Sevan had failed in his efforts to secure safe passage for Mr Najibullah
during his meetings with mujahideen. Mr Najibullah's hiding place has
affected the UN's credibility in the eyes of the Mujahideen, diplomats say.

ALGERIA'S Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), with its leaders and thousands of
militant supporters locked up, has made its first appeal to Algerians to
'take to the gun', Reuter reports.
The banned fundamentalist movement is widely blamed for the killing of
nearly 50 members of the security forces in ambushes and isolated attacks
since early February.
'After the vain appeals for dialogue, the people must move from the word to
the gun,' the FIS said in a weekly letter circulating yesterday in mosques
and markets in the capital, Algiers.
Up to now, the FIS has skirted the issue of armed struggle, saying only that
thwarting the 'people's will' - a reference to a cancelled election the
party was set to win - could force Algerians to use 'other methods'.
The authorities scrapped the poll in January, saying that the FIS did not
have a mandate to destroy democracy.
The head of the country's five-man presidency, Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, said
yesterday that ending the poll was an urgent need in the terrible crisis
Algeria faced.
'After 100 days we have been able to banish the spectre of fitna (war
between Moslems), violence and the splintering of Algeria,' he told an
inaugural session of a 60-member national consultative council.
The council, which he called 'the true silent majority'is to help the
leaders in the absence of the dissolved parliament.
Algiers radio on Tuesday quoted an FIS communique saying: 'The people will
remember the names of the consultative council members and inscribe them on
the list of accomplices of the oppressors.'
An Algiers court last month ordered the FIS dissolved on the grounds that it
was guilty of 'multiple violations of the law'.

FT  23 APR 92 / Israeli army accused of using 'death squads'

THE Israeli army has become embroiled in allegations that it is operating a
'shoot-to-kill' policy against Palestinian activists in the occupied
territories following a recent spate of killings by army squads working
undercover in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In a dispute similar to a controversy in Northern Ireland in the 1980s over
police killings of IRA suspects, Palestinian leaders accuse Israel of
deliberately executing street-level activists of the four-year intifada, or
uprising against Israeli rule.
Of 31 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops this year, at least 17 have been
shot by undercover squads. Last year about 30 per cent of the 109
Palestinians killed were shot by the squads, a higher proportion than the
previous year.
The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) freely acknowledge the existence of the
squads. But it strongly denies any 'shoot-to-kill' brief, saying the
intention is to arrest suspects often accused in the murders of Palestinian
'collaborators'. It says some of those killed were armed and all ignored
warnings before being shot.
However, the army's insistence that its rules are strictly adhered to has
come under severe question this week. An Israeli couple visiting Arab
friends in the West Bank village of Dura, near Hebron, say they witnessed
the shooting and wounding of two men painting intifada slogans by an army
squad. Their story was prominently reported by Israeli media.
'We were sitting on the porch having dinner and then we saw three masked
young men with pots of paint in their hands. Suddenly a civilian car with
(West Bank) licence plates arrived,' Mr David Elimelech told the newspaper
Ha'aretz. 'Several people got out of the car and shot bursts at the young
men from a distance of two or three metres. They shot without warning. They
shot without saying a word.'
Mr Elimelech and his wife Aviva said when they realised the gunmen were
soldiers, they protested, but were forced inside their friend's house at
gunpoint, struck and sworn at. Their host said soldiers came to his house
the next day, beat him and threatened his family if he complained.
The IDF said the two Palestinians, who were not killed, were 'armed with
chains' and had ignored warnings to surrender. It denied the Elimelech's
were struck and accused them of obstructing and threatening the soldiers.
The Elimelech's story nevertheless had a striking resemblance to the
testimony of Palestinian witnesses in many other incidents involving
shootings by undercover squads.
It has highlighted the way army tactics against the intifada have
increasingly concentrated on targeting what the IDF sees as a hardcore of
several thousand activists.
Palestinian gunmen yesterday killed a West Bank Arab doctor accused of
collaborating with Israeli authorities, while in the Gaza Strip masked men
shot to death an alleged drug dealer in unrelated attacks, AP reports from
Jerusalem.

FT  23 APR 92 / French prepare for Maastricht debate
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S Socialist government yesterday adopted a draft law to revise the
constitution, a critical step towards ratifying the Maastricht treaty on
European union.
The draft was immediately sent to the National Assembly for debate; the
government said it hoped revision and ratification could be completed before
the summer holidays.
However, the constitutional changes will be the object of a political
barrage from the Socialist government's conservative opponents, even those
who in principle support Maastricht objectives.
Mr Francois Bayrou, secretary general of the centre-right UDF umbrella
grouping, while declaring that 'there is no other possible destination for
France than Maastricht', said his party would demand and obtain amendments.
The main aspects of the treaty dealt with in the new constitution law but
disputed by the opposition are plans for a single currency and the provision
for residents from other EC countries to vote and be elected in local
elections.
The government's problem is that the Socialist party does not command an
absolute majority in the National Assembly. The Communists are hostile to
the treaty and, on the right, the Gaullists are hostile to the government.
The government should make good the shortfall with the help of the centrists
and UDF members, most of whom support the EC. But the UDF, together with the
RPR Gaullist party, plans to set conditions for its agreement in parliament,
which could create uncertainties for the parliamentary arithmetic.
President Franc,ois Mitterrand has made clear he wants the constitutional
revision enacted in a purely parliamentary process. In the first phase, the
two houses would pass the legislation by a simple majority. In the second,
the two houses sitting together in Versailles in a so-called Congress would
pass the same revision by a three-fifths majority.
As an alternative second phase, the government can put the constitutional
revision to a referendum.
In either case, the second phase could be risky for the government. If the
Gaullists mobilise additional support for restrictive conditions, they could
prevent a three-fifths majority in Congress. But if the government opts for
a referendum, it would put on the line not just the treaty but also the
position of President Mitterrand, whose popularity is at a record low.
In the last resort, the Gaullist party will be reluctant to take
responsibility for bringing down the Maastricht treaty. Mr Jacques Chirac,
Gaullist leader, has this week started to back away from his demand for a
referendum.
If the constitutional revision does go through, parliamentary ratification
is likely to become a foregone conclusion.
Reuter adds from Luxembourg: The government yesterday urged the Grand
Duchy's parliament to approve the treaty without a referendum. Mr Jacques
Santer, prime minister, said the referendum as demanded by the main
opposition group could turn into a vote against the 113,000 foreigners
living in Luxembourg.
As in France, debate in Luxembourg centres on the clause allowing residents
from other EC states to stand and vote in local elections. Recent polls show
support for European union in Luxembourg dwindled from 83 per cent to 35 per
cent in the year to March.

FT  23 APR 92 / Benefits revolt brings blow for Solchaga

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S conservative finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, is facing an
embarrassing political reversal following a rebellion in the ruling
Socialist party against unemployment benefit cuts he hurriedly decreed
earlier this month.
Faced with mounting trade union threats against the measures, which are part
of a five-year convergence plan designed by Mr Solchaga to cut public
spending ahead of European Community economic and monetary union (Emu), the
Socialist party executive on Tuesday evening decided not to rubber stamp an
enabling decree gazetted two weeks ago when it reaches parliament on
Thursday next week.
Even though the eventual changes may be minor, the Socialists have
effectively decided to submit the decree to a lengthy parliamentary
legislative process - which Mr Solchaga hoped to avoid - as a prelude to
changing the planned cuts. In addition, the party has invited the two main
trade unions, the socialist UGT and the communist CCOO, to discuss the
decree, threatening Mr Solchaga's insistence that the convergence plan could
not be negotiated.
Mr Rodrigo Rato, parliamentary leader of the main opposition party, the
conservative Partido Popular, said Mr Solchaga would have to resign if his
non-negotiable plan was to be altered. 'The decree was passed to lend a
sense of urgency to the cuts,' he said, 'and if the minister now finds his
own party is not backing him he loses all credibility. If he cannot make a
decree stick, why should anyone believe the rest of the plan?'
The role of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez in the party's decision remained
unclear.
The party, still largely controlled by its left wing, has been horrified at
union threats to mobilise opinion against the measures. The UGT has been
threatening a general strike.
The credibility of the convergence plan is crucial to Madrid because it is
designed to impress upon Spain's EC partners that it is serious about
trimming its budget deficits ahead of Emu and as a lever with which to wrest
so-called cohesion funds from the EC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN Italian parliamentary report yesterday blamed US bankers for a scandal
involving the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro (BNL) which
helped finance Iraq's arms programme before the Gulf war, Reuter reports
from Rome.
By August 1989 the US branch had made unauthorised loans totalling Dollars
4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) to Baghdad. The report quoted former Iraqi foreign
minister Tariq Aziz as saying one reason Baghdad invaded Kuwait in August
1990 was that the loans on which Iraq depended, through BNL's Atlanta
branch, had dried up a year before.
The 84-page report said it was clear the US branch of the Italian bank had
played a key role in an American-led campaign to help Iraq defeat Iran in
their 1980-87 war. 'A large part of the financial resources - which were
managed by the United States - came from BNL,' it said.
The report was adopted by a committee of inquiry set up by the Senate (upper
house). The committee blamed BNL Atlanta's auditors for failing to detect
any wrongdoing and said the Georgia State Banking Department was also at
fault, as well as the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. But it ruled out
the possibility that the Atlanta branch manager had acted alone and strongly
criticised BNL's management.

FT  23 APR 92 / Russia hopes for Dollars 4bn credit: Accord with IMF next
month would unlock Dollars 24bn pledged by G7

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government hopes to agree a stand-by credit with the
International Monetary Fund for Dollars 4bn by the second half of May, Mr
Konstantin Kagalovsky, Russia's chief negotiator with the international
financial institutions, said yesterday.
It would allow the government to stabilise the rouble, and unlock the
Dollars 24bn agreed by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries.
The IMF arrangement, along with Russia's own economic reform package, will
be discussed when Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, visits
Washington during meetings of the interim committee of the IMF and World
Bank and G7 this weekend.
Following discussions with IMF officials in Moscow this week, the government
is looking to agree the terms of a stand-by credit during a subsequent visit
by the Fund starting on May 10. It hopes IMF board approval would follow
shortly after.
Of the total Dollars 4bn, three tranches of Dollars 1bn each would be
disbursed simultaneously this year, officials say.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said last week that a delegation
from his organisation would return to Moscow in May with a view to
negotiating an economic programme to support a standby financing facility.
He was cautious on when the latter might become available, suggesting that
funds might not start flowing until July.
The Russian government hopes to receive Dollars 24bn from western
governments and institutions this year, of which Dollars 4.5bn will come
from the international financial institutions - Dollars 3bn from the IMF,
and Dollars 1.5bn from the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. It is also seeking a Dollars 1bn loan from
the World Bank aimed at supporting crucial imports.
Mr Kagalovsky said Russia would have to gain control over monetary policy in
the rouble area before the currency could be stabilised. Russia, which
inherited the rouble from the former Soviet Union, then intends to stabilise
it through establishing sole responsibility for issuing it and controlling
its exchange rate.
He explained that the countries of the former Soviet Union would have access
to the rouble through the Russian central bank, which would be the sole body
responsible for issuing the currency.
Conditions of access to the rouble by the other republics, or replacement of
the rouble by those republics that intended to introduce their own
currencies, would have to be negotiated, he said. Agreement betweeen Russia
and the republics had to be reached before the rouble could be stabilised.
Russia will print a new Rbs5,000 note, the first without Lenin's likeness
and the official stamp of the defunct Soviet State Bank, the Russian central
bank said yesterday, AP-DJ reports. The note, to be issued this summer, will
be the highest denomination note in circulation.
New coins featuring the Russian imperial double-headed eagle will also be
issued.
MR YEGOR GAIDAR, the architect of Russia's radical economic reforms, was
back at his desk yesterday after being taken to hospital suffering from high
blood pressure on Tuesday night, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Colleagues blamed the punishing work schedule of the 36-year-old first
deputy prime minister in his relentless pursuit of rapid market reforms. Mr
Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said he was trying to persuade Mr
Gaidar to get some rest before his trip this weekend to Washington, where he
will join the Group of Seven ministers for part of their talks and will also
complete discussions on Russian membership of the IMF.
'But even rest is difficult to organise,' said Mr Chubais, who shares with
his other colleagues a non-stop diet of work, frequent travel, little sleep,
and lots of small administrative problems which are spared their colleagues
in the west.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday gave preliminary approval to sweeping
powers of self-government for the breakaway Crimean republic in a last-ditch
effort to hold on to the region.
Ukrainian lawmakers hope that the bill, which passed a first reading after a
tense, late-night debate, will halt the drive to hold a referendum on
independence in Crimea.
The law, which has already been ratified by the Crimean parliament, grants
Crimea control over land and natural resources, the pace of economic reform,
migration and education, and gives Crimea a say in all military movements in
the region.
The lush Crimean peninsula, transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, has
become a lightning rod for escalating hostilities between the two Slavic
republics. Russia's parliament has tabled a motion declaring the transfer
illegal and many Crimean separatist leaders view independence as a first
step toward reunification with Russia.
Nearly 10 per cent of Crimea's 2.5m inhabitants signed a petition calling
for a referendum but the Crimean parliament has not yet given the necessary
endorsement.
On the defence front, tension between Ukraine and Russia appeared to calm
down, when Marshal General Konstantin Morozov, the Ukrainian defence
minister, reiterated earlier promises to recommence shipping tactical
nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling. Reuter adds: Ukraine's
parliament yesterday failed to approve the government's latest draft budget,
despite warnings that western aid could be put in jeopardy.
Deputies signalled their acceptance of the need for a tight budget by voting
to limit this year's deficit to no more than 2 per cent of gross national
product. But opposition centred on the proposed 28 per cent VAT level.

FT  23 APR 92 / Sterling surges on recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG SUPPORT for sterling from Japanese and German investors and growing
hopes of a UK economic recovery yesterday pushed the pound to its highest
close against the D-Mark in London for more than seven months.
The pound gained 1 1/2 pfennigs against a weaker German currency to close in
London at DM2.9325, opening up the possibility that the government could
safely cut borrowing rates from their current 10.5 per cent.
Sterling's continued strength - it has overtaken both the Danish krone and
the French franc in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) since the
election - coincided with publication of two surveys pointing to an economic
recovery, albeit a slow one.
A quarterly survey of 8,000 companies by the British Chambers of Commerce
showed that in the first quarter the service sector resumed growth for the
first time since mid-1990, while the rate of decline in manufacturing
slowed.
This message was reinforced in Washington by the International Monetary Fund
which said the UK economy was about to move into recovery. It warned that
Britain would have the slowest growth rate this year among the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries.
Indications of brighter prospects for the UK after the recession which
started around mid-1990 persuaded more international investors to switch
funds into sterling.
But there are still no signs that either the Treasury or the Bank of
England, through its money market operations, are in a hurry to cut base
rates, unchanged since September.
Widespread support for the pound, particularly from overseas investors,
started after the Conservative election victory on April 9. Another factor
behind the more positive sentiment towards the UK by many overseas investors
appears to be the clear-cut nature of the win and the prospect of a
relatively long period of political stability.
Yesterday, sterling climbed to within 2 pfennigs of its central DM2.95 rate
in the ERM, while it gained 1.5 cents against the dollar to Dollars 1.7630.
Sterling's strength in London - it later eased a touch in New York to
DM2.93115 and Dollars 1.7625 - boosted prices in government gilt-edged
securities by up to a quarter of a point.
The mood of optimism was not shared by investors on the London stock market,
where the FT-SE 100 index closed 18 lower at 2,607.8.
The feeling that any recovery will be fragile was underlined by the British
Chambers of Commerce report which warned that employment prospects remained
gloomy. It said the jobless total could climb from 2.65m to 3m by the end of
the year.
In addition, rapidly falling factory investment during the recession could
lead to manufacturers lagging behind their overseas rivals, once the
recovery gathered pace. However, export orders continued to grow in both
manufacturing and services, although the service sector was unable to
sustain recent strong levels of growth.
Another reminder of the weak state of demand in the UK in the first three
months came from Bank of England figures on the money supply.
These showed that banks and building societies last month received a net
repayment of Pounds 500m on sterling loans by companies and individuals.
This was the first time since records began in 1982 that monthly lending had
failed to show a net rise.

FT  23 APR 92 / IMF urges Germany tospeed cuts in fiscal deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund yesterday urged Germany, in unusually
forthright language, to act more quickly to cut its fiscal deficits and so
enable European interest rates to fall.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth in the European
Community slowed considerably last year and - at 1.8 per cent  - is expected
to remain subdued in 1992.
The IMF estimated the German general government deficit would grow from 3.3
per cent of gross national product in 1991 to 3.6 per cent this year before
falling to 3.1 per cent in 1993. It said the tight monetary stance of the
Bundesbank - which in December raised its interest rates to the highest
levels since the 1930s to combat inflationary pressures - was a 'recent
restraining factor' on European growth.
'The prospects for lower interest rates in Europe would be enhanced if
Germany's fiscal consolidation plans were implemented more rapidly than
currently envisaged,' the IMF said. In addition to accelerating existing
plans for fiscal consolidation, it said there seemed to be scope for an
early announcement of more deficit-cutting measures.
The IMF report, which was circulated among governments before publication
yesterday, may encourage Germany's partners in the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries to push for faster fiscal action from Bonn at Sunday's
meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington.
The report caused dismay among German monetary officials, who contrasted the
stern advice to Germany with the IMF's much milder strictures against the
higher and more persistent US deficits.
The US has been critical for some time of the mix of high interest rates and
large fiscal deficits in Germany, which it feels has contributed to the
slowdown in world economic growth.
US officials appear anxious, however, to avoid turning Sunday's G7 meeting
into a concerted attack on German economic policies.
The IMF report predicted that world output would grow by 1.4 per cent this
year after declining by 0.3 per cent in 1991. The Fund's latest growth
forecast for this year is 1.3 percentage points lower than its projection
for 1992 which was published in October last year.
However, the IMF said it expected global growth would quicken to 3.6 per
cent in 1993.
Although this recovery would be subdued compared with previous upturns, the
Fund urged governments to act cautiously. 'Barring evidence that growth
continues to falter, a further significant reduction in interest rates does
not seem warranted in the US, Canada or Japan,' it said.
The IMF said monetary authorities should stand ready to tighten policy
promptly in response to signs of inflationary pressures.

OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S hopes of receiving Canadian government support in its
attempts to reconstruct its CDollars 14.3bn (Pounds 6.8bn) debt encountered
a potentially serious hitch yesterday because of political concerns.
However, representatives of the world's biggest property developer emerged
from a crucial meeting with 11 banks in London saying they were confident
O&amp;Y would avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.
A spokesman for Canadian finance minister Mr Donald Mazankowski said the
government had political concerns about providing financial support to O&amp;Y's
efforts to raise funds through the Dollars 300m sale-and-leaseback of a
Toronto office building, the Exchange Tower.
O&amp;Y had been counting on this support as a vital element in its plans to pay
back holders of commercial paper, or short-term securities, which have
fallen due for redemption.
Mr Steve Miller, in charge of O&amp;Y's debt restructuring negotiations, said:
'It would be a problem if the Canadian government did not come through.'
He insisted, however, that the government had indicated a willingness to
help in the form of a short-term guarantee for the sale of the tower.
However the finance ministry spokesman said: 'We remain to be convinced that
we are needed, and we hesitate to put the taxpayers at risk'.
Mr Miller was speaking shortly after attending a 90-minute crisis meeting
with 11 banks, including Citicorp of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland,
Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Barclays of the UK
and its rival Lloyds.
The banks were in private session from 11.30am to late afternoon in the City
offices of solicitor Allen &amp; Overy.
They were deciding whether to provide O&amp;Y with the Pounds 110m it needs to
continue working on Canary Wharf over the next 90 days.
Mr Miller, a partner of US investment bank James D. Wolfensohn Inc, said he
had 'such a degree of confidence' that they would provide these funds that
he had not contemplated what the company would do if the banks refused to
provide the money.
He confirmed that O&amp;Y had taken advice from the New York firm of lawyers,
Weil Gotshal and Manges, on bankruptcy filing procedures but he insisted
this was a routine procedure carried out by all companies in the process of
a financial reconstruction.
He said he had provided 100 pages of information to the 11 banks on the
company's plans for financing Canary Wharf over the coming five years.
In giving the banks estimates of Canary Wharf's value, O&amp;Y is assuming
completion of the Jubilee Line Underground link to central London.
However, Mr Miller said the Pounds 110m needed from the banks did not
include provision for a Pounds 40m payment which O&amp;Y had promised as a first
instalment on its Pounds 400m contribution to the Jubilee Line construction
costs.
He said O&amp;Y would be holding talks with the UK government on changing the
terms of its Jubilee Line contribution.
Mr Miller did not rule out an attempt by O&amp;Y to reduce its contribution.
Most bankers believe, however, that any change in the terms would involve
rescheduling O&amp;Y's payments to the government to the late 1990s.

FT  23 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull in Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONGLOMERATE Hanson held up well in the face of a reassessment of its
prospects by its own broker. It was boosted generally by a belief that it is
well placed to benefit from an economic upturn and specifically by hopes of
an acquisition. The shares closed only 2 off at 234 1/2 p with 12m traded.
Broker Hoare Govett trimmed its profits estimate for the year ending in
September to Pounds 1.13bn and for the following year by Pounds 80m to
Pounds 1.275bn.
Acquisition hopes have been fired by strengthening rumours that Hanson will
sell its stake in ICI, by the recent disposal of Ever Ready and by a Pounds
500m Eurobond issue yesterday. Mr Geoff Alum, a conglomerates analyst with
County NatWest, said that, discounting the Eurobond issue and the ICI stake,
Hanson already had Pounds 7.8bn in cash.
ICI, which has risen strongly on the stake sale talk, as well as a belief
that an announcement about the sale of its fibres division is imminent,
closed 12 ahead at 1366p.
Analysts have seen 1325p as the price Lord Hanson would need for his 20m ICI
shares if the sale was to be worthwhile. That would imply a discount of
about 3 per cent to the current price, and some commentators argue that the
discount will have to be nearer 5 per cent, suggesting a market share price
of around 1400p.
Dowty bid talk
Strong bid speculation returned to Dowty Group, the aerospace components
manufacturer, sending the stock racing ahead by 11 to 145p in heavy volume
of 4.7m shares. Talk of a bid started early in the session following two
sizeable agency crosses at the 138p level, with Smiths Industries and TI the
two names in the frame.
Smiths is thought to have been eyeing Dowty for some time but is said to be
unwilling to pay a high take-out price. The speculation eventually settled
around TI as the most likely bidder, with a cash offer price of 155p to 160p
a share mentioned, and a higher paper alternative. There were even whispers
of an agreed bid. TI weakened 19 to 716p and Smiths eased a penny to 314p.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'We have been here before but the
heavy volume and the rise in the price suggest that the market is coming to
the view that a bid is imminent.'
Abbey retreats
Building society turned high street bank Abbey National fell on record
turnover after a profits warning prompted analysts to lower their forecasts.
The shares lost 11 1/2 to 299 1/2 p and the turnover of 13.5m shares was the
heaviest since the bank was floated nearly two years ago.
Nomura Research, the securities house with the most optimistic view of
Abbey, knocked Pounds 40m off its 1992 estimate to Pounds 640m, but Mr Mike
Fesemeyer, the house's banking analyst, said the fundamentals were still in
place and the position was not as bad as many thought.
County NatWest's Mr John Aitken, who had been at the bottom of the range of
predictions with Pounds 620m, commented: 'I might be tempted to knock
another Pounds 20m off the forecast because the statement does seem to
indicate a bigger increase in provisions.'
Insurance gloom
The insurance sector suffered the most pain in the London market yesterday
as investors reacted to disappointing figures from Legal &amp; General.
L &amp; G dropped 24 to 366p, the biggest percentage fall among the FT-SE 100
constituents, after announcing that its worldwide life and pensions new
annual premium figures for the first quarter of 1992 were down by 16 per
cent to Pounds 46.7m.
Analysts said the group, along with the rest of the sector, was due for a
correction following a good run after the general election.
There was in addition an emotional impact from Abbey National's profits
warning, although some observers felt that the bank had probably not taken
out massive mortgage insurance.
Prudential, which has very little exposure to mortgage problems, lost 13 1/2
to 241 1/2 p, Sun Alliance, already badly hit, fell a further 10 to 271p,
General Accident slid 16 to 452p and Guardian Royal Exchange declined 5 to
135p.
Scottish generators remained very active, with Scottish Power gaining 3 to
97p on turnover of 19m shares and Scottish Hydro-Electric also adding 3 at
102p on volume of 8.2m. The high level of activity reflected an approaching
second payment of 70p on the partly-paid stocks.
Scottish Power is believed to have around 1m small shareholders and
Hydro-Electric about 600,000, who must sell their shares by the close of
business on Friday if they wish to avoid making this payment. A third and
final payment is due a year later.
Analysts were generally bullish, believing the shares will perform well once
the second payment is out of the way.
Wellcome fell 25 to 1092p, reflecting general weakness in the drugs sector,
led by recent falls on Wall Street.
Troubled chemicals group MTM recovered 6 to 39p after announcing that the
banks had extended their grace period until the end of May.
Boots lost 17 to 472p on US selling.
Disappointing results from clothing retailer Austin Reed pushed the 'A'
shares down 18 to 260p.
Continued optimism over the prospect of a cut in interest rates boosted
housebuilders. Wimpey advanced 9 to 85p. Property groups basked in similar
surrounds, Hammerson 'A' climbing 6 to 375p.
Securities house SG Warburg upgraded Granada after a meeting with the group.
The shares put on 4 to 275p in busy volume of 3.7m.
The house has lifted its forecast slightly to Pounds 115m for this year and
by Pounds 9m to Pounds 145m for 1993.

FT  23 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG initial opening petered out in a dull afternoon session in stock
index futures, with volume once again low, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE started the session strongly at a premium of
47 to the underlying cash market. But a shopping spree by independent
traders early in the session led to a squeeze by 9am, sending June climbing
to reach 2,697, which proved to be the high of the day.
A bout of profit-taking thereafter caused June to relinquish earlier gains.
With little in the way of participation from the large institutions,
independent traders' attempts to drive June higher in mid-afternoon met with
little interest, and it was undermined further by a weak opening on Wall
Street.
June closed at 2,649, down 19 on the previous session and about 17 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover at
5,453 lots was poor.
The day in traded options was characterised by large trades in the April
expiry stock options. Total volume reached 41,547, with the FT-SE option
recording 7,596 contracts. BP was the top traded stock option at 3,363 lots
and was followed by Marks and Spencer at 2,898 contracts.

FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stays below
17,000 for second day
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average remained below 17,000 for the second consecutive day but
was lifted from the day's low by bargain hunting, writes Neil Weinberg in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally a modest 51.79 up at 16,839.12 after a
day's high of 16,930.75 and low of 16,572.46, its worst level since 1986.
Volume was again light, totalling 230m shares. The Topix index of all first
section shares ended 2.83 better at 1,283.03, but declines still led gains
at the close by 556 to 380, with 174 issues unchanged. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.75 to 1,044.54.
Index-linked activity continued to dominate trading, with some bargain
hunting and buying interest in electricals and other issues which stand to
benefit from an economic recovery in the US. Sony climbed Y80 to Y4,230 and
Pioneer Electronic Y30 to Y3,760.
Banks also fared well, with Industrial Bank of Japan rallying Y80 to Y1,750.
However, overall buying interest remained light, with investors remaining
cautious after the Ministry of Finance said it was delaying its May bond
auction, which had been scheduled for yesterday. Some analysts said there is
concern that the ministry will proceed with the issue when the stock market
improves, which could depress share prices further.
Investors are also reluctant to carry open positions overnight with New York
poised for a correction and volume in Tokyo likely to remain thin before
next week's Golden Week holidays, said Mr Daniel Kerrigan of County NatWest
Securities.
Drug makers and securities firms lost ground, with Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical
finishing Y60 cheaper at Y2,490 and Yamaichi slipping Y10 to Y530.
Department stores declined on slack sales and earnings. Takashimaya
retreated Y30 to Y1,120 after announcing a 35 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 78.50 lower at 19,135.03 in volume of 9.6m
shares.
Roundup
AN all-time high established by the Hong Kong market featured an overall
mixed performance by the Pacific Rim region yesterday.
HONG KONG rose on strong overseas demand for blue chips. The Hang Seng Index
gained 95.94 or 1.9 per cent to 5,189.03. Turnover was HKDollars 2.85bn, up
from HKDollars 2.45bn.
HSBC Holdings was the most active stock, rising 25 cents to HKDollars 40.50,
while Cheung Kong gained 70 cents to HKDollars 21.50 and Pacific Concord
advanced 25 cents to HKDollars 3.02. Jardine Matheson climbed HKDollars 1.75
to HKDollars 49.50 and Swire Pacific added 40 cents at HKDollars 31.
AUSTRALIA rose in anticipation of some positive economic forecasts. The All
Ordinaries index gained 11.0 to 1,599.0 in turnover of ADollars 165.4m.
Analysts expect next week's release of the first-quarter CPI to show a
smaller than expected increase.
BHP put on 20 cents to ADollars 13.72 after announcing a rise in domestic
and export steel shipments for last month. Coles Myer rose 32 cents to
ADollars 11.60 and Brambles 22 cents to ADollars 16.04.
NEW ZEALAND closed at its highest since March 24. The NZSE-40 index gained
16.77 to 1,428.31 in NZDollars 20.97m turnover.
TAIWAN weakened in nervous trading as opposition parties continued their
demonstration to demand direct presidential elections. The weighted index
relinquished 51.02 to 4,505.07 in turnover of TDollars 14.3bn, against
TDollars 16.1bn.
KUALA LUMPUR improved on bargain hunting. The composite index gained 1.38 to
573.97 in turnover of MDollars 69.2m, after MDollars 57.2m. Pilecon firmed 4
cents to MDollars 2.63 after Magnum Corp and Dunlop Estates said they had
acquired a joint 23 per cent stake in the construction group.
SINGAPORE was little changed. The Straits Times Industrial index edged up
0.45 to 1,403.10 in volume of 25.1m shares, after 24.8m.
MANILA eased on profit-taking. The composite index shed 7.15 to 1,164.39 in
combined turnover of 218.2m pesos, compared with 191.9m pesos.
SEOUL was weaker as manufacturing issues declined. The composite index
dipped 4.29 to 584.22 in turnover of Won386.23bn. Hyundai Construction and
Engineering fell Won600 to Won17,000.
BANGKOK's SET index rose a modest 1.84 to 786.93 in turnover of Bt4.1bn.

</DATELINE>

SHARE prices jumped in Bombay yesterday as trading resumed after a three-day
boycott by brokers to protest against the Securities and Exchange Board of
India's (SEBI) registration fees. The BSE index climbed 304.30 to 4,467.32.
Last weekend, the SEBI, the new market watchdog, was forced to halve the
fees, originally set at Rs500,000 for leading exchanges and Rs100,000 for
small exchanges.
Some observers said the strike illustrated the stockbroking community's
resistance to the government's capital market reforms.
The SEBI has the difficult task of purging vested interests, which include
six-week settlement periods, a lack of regulation of intermediaries,
unbridled speculation and insider trading.

FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Present negatives and past positives
equal uncertainty - Pakistani stocks are slipping, says Farhan Bokhari
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani stocks have entered an uncertain period, after a spectacular rise
of 160 per cent in dollar terms last year. A series of negative factors at
home and political uncertainty in neighbouring Afghanistan have prompted a
fall of just over 20 per cent on the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) so far
this year.
For some brokers, a technical correction in the market was necessary after
its rise to what they saw as unrealistically high levels last December. 'We
consider this to be a temporary phase, not a crash at all, and we are
looking for signs of recovery,' says one leading broker in Karachi.
Earlier this year, the KSE was harmed by investigations by the Corporate Law
Authority, the government's regulatory body, against at least 21 brokers for
speculative buying. Since the investigations are continuing, other brokers
have been deterred from the speculative activity which had fuelled the share
price rises last year.
The KSE's rally in 1991 was also helped by the launching of Pakistani
country funds by Citicorp and Credit Lyonnais - these gave fresh
international exposure to the market. However, there are few indications
that any more foreign funds will be issued this year.
A worldwide decline in cotton prices has also weighed on the stock market,
since textile shares account for approximately one third of the 542
companies listed on the KSE.
Pakistan's privatisation programme has fallen behind schedule and some
investors are worried that plans for opening up the economy may not meet the
government's targets. Compared with an initial goal of privatising 115
companies by the end of 1991, deals for roughly one third were finalised
within that period, and the government is now trying to privatise the rest.
Brokers say that investors are unwilling to enter the stock market for the
time being, since their funds have been earmarked for further privatisation
issues.
Investors are waiting to see how the stock market will react to Pakistan's
annual budget, which is due to be announced in the middle of May. Many
businessmen expect the government to introduce new taxes in order to narrow
its budget deficit.
Another factor keeping investors on the sidelines is the possibility that
Pakistani banks and other financial institutions may have to stop
interest-based activities from June 30, if a federal Islamic court's ruling
comes into effect. The ruling, handed down last December, requires all banks
to eliminate pre-determined interest or usury, known as 'Riba', which is
considered to be unlawful under Islamic codes.
Banks have appealed to Pakistan's supreme court, and the government's
lawyers are examining the case to see if there are grounds for an appeal,
which would give it more time to make the necessary changes.
On the political front, the KSE was unsettled by instability in Sindh
province, of which Karachi is the capital. Reports that Mr Jam Sadiq Ali,
the chief minister of Sindh, was suffering from a chronic illness and was
not expected to live for long, discouraged some investors. Mr Ali
subsequently died in March and a change of government in the province
briefly re-established some confidence in the market.
But investors are now monitoring events in Afghanistan, as the future of
that country will determine Pakistan's success in establishing a land route
for the exchange of goods with the newly independent central Asian
republics.
Mr Arif Habib, the president of the KSE, remains optimistic about the
market. He says it should be buoyed by new listings since January worth
Rs3.7bn (Pounds 85.7m). 'New issues meant that money moved from the
secondary to the primary market. Now it is gradually moving back to the
second market again,' he adds.

London COCOA prices sunk to their lowest for around nine months, depressed
by a combination of trade selling and a dearth of buyers. New York cocoa
futures were also down at midday, with active July at a new life of contract
low of Dollars 940 a tonne. New York traders said the fall was partly down
to morning news that the ICCO had downwardly revised its estimate for the
1991-92 production deficit to 115,000 tonnes from 140,000 tonnes. London
dealers said there was some talk of further sales of new crop cocoa by the
Ivory Coast. In the short-term there appeared little reason why the market
should not continue downwards. Some psychological support is expected around
Pounds 600 a tonne but the next major objective looks to be Pounds 588, last
year's second position low. Manufacturers continued to show little sign of
supporting the market and some were even emerging as light sellers. London
robusta COFFEE futures also came under pressure with prices finally breaking
out of their recent range on the downside. Dealers said the fall was
initially driven by stale long liquidation in thin conditions. Sell-stops
were triggered as the downward move gathered momentum.

FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm problem taxes Pakistani
politicians - Farhan Bokhari on the opposing claims of the economy and the
agricultural sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTANI FARMERS are quietly confident that they will retain their freedom
from direct taxation when the country's annual budget is announced next
month. But with economic problems deepening and recession-hit aid donors
looking more critically at the recipients of their largesse, the
agricultural sector's privileged position is far from secure.
Agriculturure is one of the biggest earners in the Pakistani economy but the
feudal landlords, who have a strong representation among the country's elite
and ruling politicians, have so far successfully resisted attempts to
encircle them in the tax net.
According to government statistics, agriculture accounts for 26 per cent of
Pakistan's gross domestic product. In human terms it is even more important.
At least half of the country's work-force is employed in farming while
almost three-quarters of its 110m people live in villages, relying directly
or indirectly on this sector.
On the issue of introducing agricultural income tax, Mr Sartaj Aziz, the
finance minister, was recently quoted as saying that 'income tax is
impossible to impose on agricultural incomes because of difficulties in
measurements, and no other feasible proposal for some alternate tax has yet
come up for taxing agricultural sector'.
Only four years ago, Mr Aziz was the chairman of a high-powered government
commission, that recommended a fixed tax on ownership of agricultural land,
as part of a more effective system. But recently, he said that it was up to
local councils to introduce such a tax as part of a more practical system.
Officials concede privately, however, that the issue continues to be a
difficult one to deal with. The country needs to widen its tax base, to
raise more revenue for narrowing its budgetary deficit. Pakistan is expected
to seek USDollars 2.4bn at the aid consortium meeting that begins in Paris
today and western economists in Islamabad say that the worldwide recession
and the resultant pressure on aid budgets, has forced many donors to look
closely at recipient countries' own performances in raising revenues and
restricting waste domestically. In Pakistan's case, says one expert, 'the
issue of agricultural tax is one such concern'.
He also says, however, that despite these concerns development planners
recognise that the agricultural sector has suffered this year, mainly in the
cotton sector, which suffered from a drop in prices on the world market. As
a result, 'new aid pledges may not be affected, though we'd want to see if
the government has any plans to deal with this in future'. One senior
official says that even if such a tax is introduced, concerns will remain
about how it will be collected and what effect it will have on the poorest
among the poor.
The country's taxation system is ridden with corruption, which leads to
large-scale evasion. As a result, there are no clear estimates of the extent
of new revenues that could be generated through agriculture. Among the
social consequences, one concern is that the poorest farmers may suffer from
wage cuts or reduced crop shares if their employers are made to pay taxes.

FT  23 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are no wool sales to test auction demand and price changes before the
Easter recess gave no entirely definate lead on market direction. Most
international observers seem to think that competition for available
supplies will be sufficient to feep prices rising for the remainder of the
season, until the end of June. Demand from China has been good this season
and is believed likely to remain so for the rest of the season, helping to
offset severe problems in the old Soviet Union and Eastern European areas.

FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis expected to resist
further Opec cuts - Deborah Hargreaves on the issues that will face oil
ministers at tomorrow's meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' last meeting in
February broke up with a lukewarm agreement on an oil production cut, an
immediate slide in oil prices gave rise to fears of a looming market
debacle.
But this proved to be a knee-jerk reaction which was later reversed. The
fact that oil prices have now recovered and are slightly higher than their
February level is partly to the credit of Saudi Arabia, which moved swiftly
to lead other producers in cutting output. It owes as much though, to
renewed tension in the Middle East, in particular, the imposition by the
United Nations of sanctions on Libya - although they do not cover oil.
Traders have nervously pushed the price of North Sea Brent crude oil for
June delivery up above Dollars 19 a barrel in recent days - the price
slipped yesterday to Dollars 18.70.
In addition, there are glimmers of an upturn in oil demand which are
heartening to some market-watchers. But most agree that oil prices are
unlikely to move up significantly, much less to approach the Opec target
price of Dollars 21 a barrel for its basket of crudes, in the next couple of
months.
When Opec ministers meet again in Vienna tomorrow to review the state of the
market they will hear renewed calls from smaller members for further cuts to
be instituted in order to squeeze prices higher - the Opec basket price is
at present about Dollars 17 a barrel.
Ministers have been posturing in the run-up to the meeting: Mr Nordine Ait
Laoussine, the Algerian oil minister, would have preferred deeper cuts to be
agreed at the last meeting. He now says Opec should not be lulled into a
false sense of security by the firmness in oil prices over the past two
weeks.
Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister, has said the producers' club
needs to make further cuts in output to achieve its Dollars 21 target price.
He also wanted a lower production ceiling to be adopted in February, when
producers agreed to cutback by about 1m barrels a day to 23m b/d. Mr
Aqazadeh pushed for a cut to 22m or 22.5m b/d, but was resisted by Saudi
Arabia.
The kingdom remains reluctant to trim its flow of oil beyond the 8m b/d mark
and Gulf oil officials stress that it is highly unlikely to agree further
cuts at Friday's meeting. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister,
is likely to press Iran to show its commitment to the last agreement and
complete its own cutbacks.
Iranian deliveries to the market slowed in February and March, but that was
chiefly because bad weather shut its Kharg Island export terminal for
several weeks. A survey by the Reuters news agency indicates Iranian
production at 3.39m b/d in March, compared with its allocation of 3.184m b/d
under the Opec agreement.
At the same time, Kuwait's production has increased more rapidly than
foreseen in February. It now stands at 900,000 b/d - and is still rising -
compared with the emirate's informal quota of 812,000 b/d.
'There should be a lot of discussion about who's sticking to the agreement,'
said Mr Joe Stanislaw at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an industry
consulting group, 'but they are unlikely to find any consensus for further
cuts.'
One issue that Opec ministers must address is the action they plan to take
once Iraq stages a return to the export market. Baghdad is currently barred
from exporting oil by UN sanctions, but remains in discussion with the UN on
a plan that would allow sales worth Dollars 1.6bn.
'The return of Iraq to the market is a key variable in the outlook for Opec
later this year,' said Mr Ken Miller, market analyst at Purvin and Gertz,
the US consultants, 'if they don't come back at all, rising demand will push
Opec producers towards their maximum again, which has implications for
firming the market.'
Mr Miller is predicting demand for Opec oil of 24.5m b/d in the third
quarter of this year followed by 24.8m b/d in the fourth quarter (both
figures include some 400,000 b/d of condensate). Rising demand -
particularly if the US economy picks up - towards the end of the year would
make it easier for Opec to accommodate Iraq's return without other producers
having to make painful cuts in output.
Mr Miller sees US oil demand rising to 17.1m b/d in the third quarter - up
just 1 per cent from the same period last year. He is confident demand will
continue to rise in the second half of this year and early next.
The International Energy Agency, the west's oil industry monitoring agency,
is forecasting a rise in world demand to 66.8m b/d this year - an increase
of 400,000 b/d.
The focus for future policy will be on Opec's full summer conference on May
20 when ministers must make decisions about the second half of the year.
Opec policy is currently evolving away from basing output levels on
historical production quotas towards a system that relates production much
more closely to capacity. But this leaves room for much debate about actual
capacity levels.
Rising demand and prices later this year could save the organisation from
any difficult decisions. Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil market analyst at Kleinwort
Benson in London, believes that Brent crude prices will top Dollars 20 by
the end of September and possibly peak at Dollars 21 to Dollars 22 a barrel.

FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US dairy lobby smells victory
in cheese row
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dairy lobby appears to have succeeded in heading off the threat of
cheap cheese imports from Hungary.
Congressman Steve Gunderson, a Wisconsin Republican, says he has received
personal assurances from State Department officials that they no longer plan
to support a petition to add Hungarian Goya cheese to the list of duty-free
imports permitted under the US Generalised System of Preferences.
The GSP is designed to help developing countries by giving export advantage
to some of their products. However, it is not supposed to allow
de-stabilisation of US industries - particularly in an election year.
Goya cheese has already been rejected as a candidate for duty-free status,
but at the request of the Hungarian embassy a special interagency committee
which vets candidates for the GSP was asked to review the petition.
The State Department is not officially admitting an about-face. A department
official said the case was still being reviewed and the results would not be
known until they were announced from the White House on May 1.
'The department is interested in seeing that a significant number of
Hungary's petitions for GSP benefits are accepted,' he said. 'This is of
critical importance to supporting democracy in a market economy in Hungary.'
He added, however, that the Goya cheese petition was rejected in the first
place 'for sound reasons' which the chastened department apparently now
'understands and recognises'.
Congressman Gunderson, who could use an election year boost himself (he
appeared on the list of 'bad' cheque writers, in the latest Congressional
scandal surrounding the House bank) held a hearing with other dairy state
congressmen earlier this month where the impact of GSP status for Goya was
widely decried. It would open the floodgates for duty-free imports from
everyone, Mr Gunderson said, and particularly benefit Argentina and Uruguay.
The impact of duty-free Goya imports is unknown, with estimates ranging from
1,000 to 100,000 tonnes. It could displace sales of US products supported by
the government dairy programme, as well as add to US surpluses and programme
costs.

FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC urged to set up food subsidy
anti-fraud unit
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community should set up a new anti-fraud unit to keep tabs on
EC subsidies to international food exporters, according to a report from the
Court of Auditors, which has uncovered widespread fraud at two large
European companies.
The court has been monitoring the dairy product companies - which are not
named in its report - over the last two years as part of a wider inquiry
into the system of export 'refunds'. The two companies accounted for 10 per
cent of all EC refunds on milk product exports during the period. Such
refunds are paid to traders to bridge the gap between high guaranteed
European prices and the generally lower world market prices.
An in-depth audit of the two companies revealed that they had made false
claims worth millions of Ecus. Among other methods, they reclassified dairy
exports so that they were eligible for higher refunds. They also claimed
refunds on exports which turned out to be unfit for human consumption and
one of the companies added about Ecu40,000 Pounds 28,000) to its claim by
weighing the plastic wrapping as well as the cheese.
In response to the report, the European Commission claimed that a number of
measures had been adopted to tighten up on such fraud since the court
inquiry began. But Mr Jo Carey, the court's British representative, said
yesterday: 'We don't think any individual national body could do the sort of
work that we have been doing on an experimental basis'.
The Court now wants to use similar methods to look at export refunds paid to
beef and cereals companies. Together with milk products, the three sectors
accounted for more than 70 per cent of Ecu7.72bn of export refunds paid in
1990.

FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warning of animal drug black
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING black market in animal medicines throughout the single European
market was predicted yesterday by the UK's National Office of Animal Health
(Noah).
'There is a very grave danger that all that has been done to restore
consumer confidence in livestock produce and in the safety of medicines will
be shattered on January 1 1993,' said Mr George Gunn, chairman of Noah, the
trade association for UK animal medicine manufacturers.
An EC directive required all animal medicines to be reviewed to modern
standards. This should have led to a standard list of products available in
Europe, but had in fact resulted in 'a total shambles', Mr Gunn said.
In France 2,500 products had kept their licences after review, compared with
only 1,400 in the UK. 'Imagine this recipe repeated over and over again
between each of the 12 member states of the new European Community and you
will understand our concerns.' Different rates of value added tax further
complicated the picture, he said.
According to Noah, the 'extreme thoroughness' of the UK testing procedures
had led UK manufacturers to spend Pounds 60m in the past five years on
purely defensive testing. Some products had been withdrawn in the UK which
had stayed on the market in France. Useful products with a small turnover
had been lost to the veterinary armoury because the cost of reviewing them
was too high.

FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: British Gas reopens supply
talks with Norwegian committee
</HEADLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON supplies of Norwegian natural gas to Britain have been reopened by
British Gas with Norway's Gas Negotiating Committee (GFU), Statoil, a GFU
member, confirmed yesterday, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Negotiations between British Gas and GFU were broken off last November over
the price that Norway put on deliveries. But British Gas has said that there
will be a shortfall of domestic gas supply in the mid-1990s.
The British government cleared the way for foreign gas deliveries just after
talks ended between British Gas and GFU when it ratified a 15-year deal
between GFU and National Power thought to be worth about Pounds 150m. Under
that contract, Norway will supply 2.2bn cubic metres of gas annually.
According to Statoil, talks with BG were reopened in a meeting just before
the British elections. The starting point for a potential commercial deal is
5bn cu m of gas annually believed to be worth about NKr4bn (Pounds 350m).
The supply is equivalent to just under 10 per cent of current UK gas demand.
Statoil insists, however, that Norway has limited quantities available
before late-1996 when the giant Troll gas field is scheduled to come on
stream. 'Besides supplying a consortium of European buyers, Troll will serve
as a modulator, or a swing producer, allowing associated gas from fields
also containing oil to come on stream,' Mr Snorre Jensen, a Statoil
executive said. Statoil made clear, however, that talks were reopened on the
initiative of British Gas, and not because GFU is willing to reduce prices.
Mr Jensen said that several meetings were being planned for this year aimed
at restarting negotiations.
GFU also comprises Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum. But all three members
have their individual commercial interests to defend in recommending
possible sources of gas supply for approval by Norwegian energy authorities.
Saga Petroleum, for example, has pitched hard for the development of the
Midgard field in Haltenbanken, off the coast of mid-Norway in the northern
Norwegian Sea.

BANCO Santander, one of Spain's largest commercial banks, yesterday reported
a 32 per cent increase in operating profits to Pta29.08bn (Dollars 278m) for
the first quarter of 1992, citing a 26 per cent rise in its lending margins.
Santander, which owns 10 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland and 13 per cent
of First Fidelity Bancorp in the US, said its group net profit rose 19.35
per cent to Pta20.69bn in the first three months of 1991.
The bank said its interest-bearing current account - launched in the autumn
of 1989 - had made an important contribution to the improved lending margin.
These accounts originally cost most Spanish banks dear after they joined
battle with Santander but the high interest rates originally being offered
have since cooled considerably.
Despite Santander's good first quarter figures, banking analysts in Madrid
are still predicting a difficult year for local banks.

ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, has deepened its involvement
in Spain's capital markets by taking a 90 per cent direct stake in the
Madrid-based stockbroking firm Capital Markets Equities (CME).
The Spanish firm, which will be renamed ABN Amro SVB, is to expand the scope
of its activities to include investment funds, portfolio management, futures
and options, new issues and corporate finance services. Separately, Spanish
authorities have given permission for the firm to trade on the country's
capital markets on its own account, as well as for clients.
The Dutch bank's investment was made by raising its existing stake in CME's
parent company, C. M. Capital Markets Holding, to 49 per cent from 20 per
cent. This move, plus an equity injection, cost 'several tens of millions of
guilders,' ABN Amro said, without giving details. The Spanish firm will
continue to be run by local management.
ABN Amro, which is steadily building up a network of local investment
banking operations in Europe and the Far East, signed a letter of intent in
February to buy the European activities of Hoare Govett, the London-based
stockbroking arm of Security Pacific of the US. ABN Amro said it expected
the deal to be finalised in the second quarter of 1992.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Bonds: Hanson Pounds 500m fixed-rate issue
tests investor resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the UK industrial conglomerate, yesterday launched the largest
sterling fixed-rate Eurobond to date, a Pounds 500m offering via Credit
Suisse First Boston.
Although the five-year deal was fairly priced, the size was considered
extremely ambitious for corporate debt which is not rated by the leading
agencies.
The resounding success of Hanson's Pounds 500m convertible bond offering
last year was not to be repeated. But the deal performed well, despite some
scepticism about the size of the transaction.
'The market really needed to tap the broadest investor base possible in
order to absorb this sort of size,' one underwriter said. 'CSFB will have to
work very hard to make this deal work.'
Central banks, which would have been buyers of a large sovereign or
supranational bond offering, do not buy corporate paper, and some fund
managers cannot buy paper which is not rated by Moody's or Standard and
Poor's, the two leading US-based rating agencies. (They only rate Hanson's
short-term debt; however, Hanson's long-term debt is rated by IBCA, the
UK-based agency.)
However, CSFB stood firm, buying back some loose paper through brokers, and
managed to maintain confidence in the transaction.
By the end of trading, the deal was bid at 99.75, slightly above the fixed
price reoffer level, and the spread had tightened from 80 basis points above
the five-year US Treasury at launch to 78 basis points. Signs that the deal
is set to tighten further, against a steady gilts market, could well bring
in further demand in the next few days to mop up any remaining paper.
In the longer term, the existence of such a large corporate benchmark is a
positive step for the sterling bond market. Alongside last year's Pounds
350m 10-year deal for British Gas, the growing availability of liquid
corporate paper is likely to broaden the market's appeal.
The return of continental European investors, whose worries about currency
weakness have been allayed by the rally in sterling following the election
victory of the ruling Conservative party, helped boost distribution of the
paper.
The deal was unswapped, as Hanson took advantage of the lower rates
available in the sterling bond market following the post-election rally in
the gilts market.
Other UK companies continue to eye the sector, but may decide to await a
further interest rate cut before tapping the market.
Hanson will use the proceeds of the issue to refinance bank debt, so
lengthening the maturity of its debt profile. Hanson currently has up to
Pounds 8bn of bank debt, according to a company official. Another aim is 'to
widen the type of security available to investors in the international
markets', said Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive.
Attractive swap opportunities in the Canadian dollar market prompted two
more offerings totalling CDollars 500m, despite generally thin demand. The
swap activity generated by these two transactions appeared to weaken
interest on the paying side of the market, reducing further opportunities.
A CDollars 300m 10-year deal for Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the German
agency, met firm demand, particularly in the Far East. The attractive
pricing of the deal, at a spread of 45 basis points over the comparable
government bond yield, prompted steady buying, even though paper from
previous deals remains unsold.
A CDollars 200m five-year deal for the Osterreichische Kontrollbank,
guaranteed by the Republic of Austria, was priced at a spread of 32 basis
above the comparable government bond yield.
In the dollar sector, a Dollars 200m 10-year deal for the
government-guaranteed Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises,
known as JFM, was well received. The deal was priced to yield 30 basis
points above the 10-year Treasury, and was swiftly sold out to investors in
Europe and the Far East. The deal was bid around its fixed reoffer level of
99.95.
Unibanco, the privately-owned Brazilian Bank, tapped the dollar sector for
the second time in two months, raising a further Dollars 100m. The
three-year deal was prompted by excess demand for Unibanco's previous
two-year deal, according to arranger Citicorp.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BID by the Republic of Nauru and an Australian merchant bank for Compass
Airlines will remain open in spite of its rejection by the liquidator, the
government's joint venture partner said yesterday.
Mr Duke Minks, managing director of Austfin, an Australian merchant bank,
said he was confident the ADollars 54.7m (Dollars 41.9m) bid for the airline
would be accepted next week.
Mr Ian Ferrier, the Compass liquidator, has signed a binding agreement to
accept a rival offer of ADollars 50m for 75 per cent of Compass from
Southern Cross Airlines, an Australian company seeking to enter the aviation
market.
However, Mr Minks said he believed Southern Cross might be unable to raise
sufficient funds to finance the deal, leaving the field clear for the
Nauru/Austfin offer.
'If we were given the go-ahead next week, we could start up 90 to 120 days
after (reaching) a binding agreement,' he said.
Mr Minks said the government of Nauru, a tiny Pacific island state, was keen
to break into the Australian aviation market even if the liquidator
continued to refuse to accept the offer.
Under the joint venture proposals, the government of Nauru would own 75 per
cent of Compass, with the balance being acquired by Austfin.
Compass shareholders would receive ADollars 4.28m in cash, plus a 10 per
cent discount on tickets for three years. Creditors would be given ticket
vouchers worth ADollars 21.5m, and a further ADollars 29m in vouchers would
be provided for customers holding unused tickets.
Compass collapsed amid financial and customer confusion in December.
Mr John Hutchinson, provisional liquidator of AAA Airlines, another putative
entrant to the Australian market, said he would ask a New South Wales court
today to adjourn winding-up proceedings for eight weeks.

KAO Corp, the Tokyo-based soap, cosmetics and chemicals manufacturer,
yesterday announced a 3 per cent rise in parent net profits to Y22.7bn
(Dollars 169m) for the year to March on a 3.8 per cent advance in sales to
Y591.8bn.
Consolidated sales rose 10.3 per cent to Y729.9bn and consolidated net
profits edged ahead 0.2 per cent to Y20.0bn. The company said emphasis on
enhanced product quality enabled it to increase sales, despite slower
domestic economic growth.
Non-consolidated household product sales grew 3.9 per cent to Y512.3bn, with
the largest gain of 5.0 per cent to Y203.7bn for personal care and cosmetic
items. Chemical sales grew 3 per cent to Y79.5bn.
The largest increase of 8.3 per cent to Y25.7bn was for fatty chemicals.
Aggressive marketing activities led to strong gains in fatty alcohol and
glycerin sales.
Parent company sales for the current year are forecast to rise 4 per cent to
Y615bn and net income by the same amount to Y23.5bn.
Kao expects consolidated sales to rise 4 per cent to Y760bn and consolidated
net profits by 12.5 per cent to Y22.5bn. The dividend is being increased to
Y5 per share, up from Y4.1.

first quarter

<TEXT>
COMALCO, the Australian aluminium producer, yesterday said profits fell by
about 60 per cent in the first quarter to the end of March, compared with
the year-ago first quarter.
However, Mr John Ralph, chairman, said the result was 'a significant
recovery' from the last quarter of 1991, when Comalco reported an operating
loss.
Mr Ralph told the annual meeting that the result was better than
anticipated, mainly because of an unexpected improvement in metal prices.
Aluminium is currently quoted at about 62 US cents a pound on the London
Metal Exchange - the highest since May last year.
Mr Ralph said world aluminium production had remained fairly flat in the
first two months of the year, but inventory levels had climbed. As a result,
prices were likely to weaken in the absence of a notable increase in
consumption or further cuts in production.
The board does not expect the level of first-quarter profits to be
maintained, implying a fall in full-year operating profits, Mr Ralph said.
Comalco reported an operating profit of ADollars 21.5m (USDollars 16.5m) in
1991, down 85 per cent on the previous year. The group reported a loss of
ADollars 72m after taking account of extraordinary losses of ADollars 94m.

BANGKOK Bank, Thailand's largest bank, yesterday reported sharply higher
first quarter net profits as the sector continued to benefit from the
differential between the fast falling cost of deposits and slowly declining
lending rates.
Net profit rose to Bt2.42bn (Dollars 93.7m), or Bt24.25 per share, from
Bt1.32bn, or Bt17.03, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter was Bt19.0bn,
up from Bt17.7bn last year but lower than in the previous two quarters.
Assets at the end of March rose to Bt610.1bn from Bt531.8bn a year earlier.
The Thai Farmers Bank said its net profit in the quarter rose to Bt1.05bn
from Bt601.3m, with earnings per share up to Bt15.04 from Bt12.03. Revenue
rose to Bt10bn from Bt9.6bn, and assets were Bt320.3bn against Bt280.1bn.
The Bank of Asia and the Bangkok Bank of Commerce also announced improved
profits.
Thai banks have been pushing down deposit rates much faster than lending
rates, although important clients can use their clout to get more favourable
treatment at the expense of smaller companies and individuals. 'The bank
deposit cartel is functioning again,' commented one broker, noting that
mortgage rates of around 16 per cent contrasted starkly with the banks'
costs of about 7 per cent.
Brokers are generally bullish about the larger Thai banks, whose shares
continue to trade at modest earnings multiples in an economy growing at an
estimated 8 per cent a year. Although the banks may lose market share to
non-bank financing as the local financial services industry develops, their
shares will also benefit from the reduced need for capital after repeated
calls on the market in recent years.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Fairfax adds detail to
prospectus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group, yesterday issued a
supplementary prospectus for the flotation of 25 per cent of its shares in
response to a claim for damages of ADollars 175m (USDollars 134m) from
Independent Newspapers (INP), the Irish group controlled by Mr Tony
O'Reilly.
Mr Neville Miles, the Sydney stockbroker who is advising Fairfax on the
flotation, said the board considered it would be 'prudent' to ensure
investors were fully aware of INP's action.
INP lost a bidding battle for Fairfax in December, when the group was
acquired by a consortium led by the Daily Telegraph, the UK newspaper group
controlled by Mr Conrad Black.
Fairfax says the action launched by INP is without foundation, and claims it
is intended to disrupt the flotation, under which 173.25m shares are being
offered for sale at ADollars 1.20, capitalising the group at about ADollars
830m.
The supplementary prospectus says the extent of the damages claimed by INP
had not been quantified when the prospectus for the flotation was issued
last month. INP's solicitors now estimate the claim at ADollars 175m on the
basis that ADollars 1.30 per share would constitute fair value for Fairfax
shares.
The flotation is the last stage in the Fairfax group's recovery from a 1988
buy-out of the former family shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax, then 28.
The group was placed in receivership by its banks in 1990.
The prospectus forecasts net profit of ADollars 57m for the year to June
1993, on revenue of ADollars 782m. Pre-tax profit is forecast to be ADollars
123m in the current year, and ADollars 165m in 1992-1993.
Fairfax publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age in Melbourne, the
Australian Financial Review and a number of other magazines and regional
newspapers. It is the main competitor to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation, Australia's largest newspaper publishing group.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Hyundai close to default on bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A SIGN of growing financial pressure on the Hyundai group, the
conglomerate's construction subsidiary yesterday said it nearly defaulted on
a commercial bill this week.
South Korea's second biggest conglomerate has encountered problems obtaining
credit in recent weeks due to a feud with the government over the political
ambitions of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the group's founder. The Hyundai group needs
a constant flow of credit to service its large debt.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction was unable to pay Won9.5bn (Dollars
12.2m) due on Monday on a commercial bill issued by the Korean Exchange Bank
(KEB), its main creditor bank, because it had difficulty raising a loan on
the secondary financial market to repay the debt. However, it cleared the
debt the next day after the KEB made an emergency loan.
Other Hyundai companies have also reported difficulties caused by the credit
squeeze. Hyundai Motors reported that it was cutting by 40 per cent this
year's planned Won700bn investment programme because of its inability to
obtain some industrial loans. It was therefore slashing spending on plant
and equipment to Won200bn from Won380bn, while cutting its research and
development budget to Won220bn from Won320bn.
The KEB has threatened to cut off industrial investment loans to five
Hyundai companies, including Hyundai Motors, for six months due to alleged
violations of the country's strict credit controls. Korean commercial banks
operate under close government supervision.
The state-run Korea Development Bank also said it would deny the group's
request for Won300bn in loans for plant facilities because it feared the
creditworthiness of the group would be damaged by its dispute with the
government.
Mr Chung recently said the Hyundai group is in danger of collapsing by the
end of the year if the credit squeeze continues.
But analysts believe Mr Chung is exaggerating the threat facing the group in
an effort to force the government to back down from its apparent pressure on
Hyundai.
The disclosure of the troubles affecting the construction and auto
subsidiaries may be part of this psychological campaign.
Mr Chung said the collapse of Hyundai could seriously harm the Korean
economy.

NOVA CORP has dropped plans to split its natural gas transmission and
petrochemicals operations into separate entities.
Mr Edward Newall, chairman, said Nova's international equity issue had
raised more than CDollars 300m (USDollars 254.2m) and will put the company's
balance-sheet 'in superb shape'.
There is no pressure to sell assets now, he added, denying reports that Nova
might sell its Ontario ethylene plant to Imperial Oil.
The company now expects to be profitable throughout 1992 following last
year's CDollars 675m special restructuring charge that wiped out profits.
Mr Newall said petrochemical prices had hit rock bottom, and Nova's
petrochemical operations would break even in 1992 after financial charges
and meeting CDollars 100m in capital outlays.
Nova has slowed its gas pipeline expansion programme as Canadian gas
producers have reduced demands for pipeline capacity.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, unveiled a 29 per cent drop in first-quarter net
income as lower figures from its industrial and hotels businesses more than
outweighed an improved performance from its financial operations.
The group had net income of Dollars 163m, or Dollars 1.20 a share fully
diluted, compared with Dollars 229m, or Dollars 1.70 a share, in the same
period of last year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 5.1bn, compared
with Dollars 5bn. The figures were roughly in line with market forecasts.
ITT Hartford, the group's large insurance business, saw an improvement in
earnings, from Dollars 165m to Dollars 181m, thanks to higher investment
income and a Dollars 10m pre-tax gain on the sale of a stake in securities
firm Piper Jaffray Hopwood. This was partly offset by the establishment of
reserves in domestic casualty operations and continued difficult market
conditions in the UK.
ITT Financial, which groups other financial service operations, also posted
higher operating results - Dollars 33m against Dollars 19m.
ITT Hartford and Financial together enjoyed portfolio gains of Dollars 84m,
or 63 cents a share, compared with Dollars 35m a year ago.
The group's Sheraton hotels business lost Dollars 16m, up from Dollars 3m a
year ago, which ITT said was due to 'significantly lower occupancy levels in
New York City, Miami and Toronto', where Sheraton has recently completed
large renovations.
The automotive, fluid technology, forest products and defence businesses
suffered lower profits, while components posted an operating loss.
Equity in earnings from Alcatel, the European telephone equipment business,
rose from Dollars 32m to Dollars 50m. ITT is in the process of selling its
30 per cent stake in this business to joint venture partner Alcatel Alsthom.

quarter

<TEXT>
AMOCO, one of the leading US oil companies, reported a 52 per cent drop in
first-quarter earnings due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices and
squeezed downstream margins.
The Chicago-based group reported earnings of Dollars 234m, or 47 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 492m, or 98 cents, in the same period last
year. Revenues fell to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 7.3bn.
The figures were helped by a Dollars 67m tax benefit and Dollars 20m due to
early debt retirement, partly offset by a Dollars 39m Norwegian tax charge.
Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman, said: 'The earnings decline reflects lower
crude oil and natural gas prices and continued weak margins and sales
volumes for chemicals and lower margins for refining, marketing and
transportation.'
The company, which previously announced a capital and exploration budget of
Dollars 3.7bn for the year, said it was re-evaluating this in view of the
'current adverse economic conditions affecting the industry'.
Domestic exploration and production earnings of Dollars 145m were down 33
per cent, while foreign activities incurred an Dollars 11m loss, compared
with earnings of Dollars 95m. Refining, marketing and transport made Dollars
65m, down from Dollars 214m, while chemicals earned Dollars 35m, compared
with Dollars 83m.

<TEXT>
UNION Carbide, the US chemicals company, reported an 8 per cent fall in
first-quarter profits to Dollars 72m after tax .
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.187bn, against a restated Dollars 1.32bn in the
first three months of 1991.
The company blamed the fall on declining prices. It added that the
first-quarter slip was smaller than expected, given the 14 per cent drop in
chemicals and selling prices year-on-year.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, noted that weak selling prices and further
downward pressures on margins were expected to affect the second quarter.
The first-quarter figures include profits of Dollars 33m from Union Carbide
Industrial Gases, up 22 per cent on the previous year.
This division, which was reported as a discontinued business, is due to be
spun off to Union Carbide shareholders by the end of the second quarter.
The profits figure came from sales of Dollars 653m.
Warner-Lambert and Schering-Plough, two large US drugs companies, reported
strong earnings gains in the first three months of 1992. Warner posted a 17
per cent improvement in after-tax profits, at Dollars 164m.
Total sales increased by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn.
Schering-Plough reported first-quarter after-tax profits of Dollars 193.3m.
This compared with Dollars 173.2m for the same period a year earlier. Sales
were up from Dollars 949.3m to Dollars 1.02bn.

<TEXT>
INCO, the western world's biggest nickel producer, barely broke even in the
first quarter, as sagging metal prices, lower shipments and higher unit
costs slashed earnings from its mining operations.
Net earnings slid to USDollars 2.2m, or one cent a share, from Dollars
53.6m, or 50 cents last year.
Sales were down almost one fifth to Dollars 680m, while operating earnings
in the primary metal division slumped to Dollars 42m from Dollars 136m. The
alloys and engineered products division suffered a small operating loss.
Shipments of almost all metals were lower in the first quarter. Nickel
deliveries slipped to 121m lb from 136m lb. Copper shipments declined to 59m
lb from 75m lb, and platinum-group metals fell to 69,000oz from 86,000oz.
Nonetheless, finished nickel inventories rose to 60m lb on March 31, from
45m lb three months earlier.
The average nickel price received by the company fell to Dollars 3.59 per lb
from Dollars 3.94 a year earlier. Refined copper prices slipped to 99 cents
from Dollars 1.10 per lb.
Inco does not disclose unit production costs, but these are understood to be
around Dollars 2.50 per lb of nickel and Dollars 1.60 per lb of copper.
The company said that the rise in first-quarter costs was due to higher
wages and benefits, and increased depreciation and amortisation charges.
These factors were partly offset by improved ore grades.
Total debt was slightly cut to Dollars 1.26bn on March 31.
TransCanada PipeLines, which operates the cross-Canada gas pipeline system,
earned CDollars 79.5m (USDollars 67m) or 39 cents a share in the first
quarter, up 36 per cent from a year earlier, mainly because of a jump in
export volume. Revenues were CDollars 926m, up 9 per cent.
Investors Group, Canada's biggest mutual fund distributor, and controlled by
Power Financial Corp, is raising CDollars 122.5m of new equity for
acquisition opportunities, writes Robert Gibbens.
PFC is not participating in the issue and its holding will drop from 74 to
66 per cent.
Investors earned CDollars 50.7m on revenues of CDollars 2.8bn last year, and
in the first quarter of 1992 revenues were up 45 per cent from a year
earlier.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Holders of O&amp;Y public bonds may
be paid

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOLDERS of publicly-traded bonds issued by Olympia &amp; York are in a stronger
position than many bank lenders in the restructuring of the cash-strapped
property developer's Dollars 12bn debt in what is a rare reversal of roles.
O&amp;Y has failed to make interest and principal payments on several bank loans
and private placements in the past month but holders of about Dollars 1.5bn
worth of bonds in O&amp;Y buildings in the US and Canada are likely to be paid
at least their interest on time, provided the individual properties continue
to generate sufficient cash flow.
'It would be very rare for an O&amp;Y bond or debenture holder to rank behind
the banks,' a Toronto real estate financier said yesterday.
Mr Jim Titus, vice-president at Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York rating
agency, adds that the bondholders will be protected even in the event of an
O&amp;Y bankruptcy. Trustees would take possession of income from the buildings
and, in a worst case scenario, could appoint new property managers.
Ironically, the strong position of the bond holders is largely due to the
secrecy which has enveloped O&amp;Y over the years. O&amp;Y's refusal to make its
financial statements public forced it to put other safeguards in place when
it tapped outside investors to refinance many of its North American
properties in the mid and late-1980s.
O&amp;Y provided financial statements to its main bankers, except for details of
the leases signed with tenants in its buildings. As a result, many of its
private placements and bank loans are at least partially secured by
corporate guarantees.
Only about Dollars 300m of O&amp;Y's debt is unsecured, but questions are bound
to be raised whether the banks were cautious enough in evaluating security
for many of their other loans.
The securitised buildings include First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey
Toronto flagship; 55 Water Street, a 53-storey tower in lower Manhattan;
another Manhattan building at 59 Maiden Lane; two large office buildings in
Calgary; and one in Ottawa.
To attract investors, O&amp;Y set up single-purpose companies for each building
with no recourse to the parent. Rental income is channelled into a specific
operating account from which only running expenses can be paid before debt
service obligations. In most cases, the bondholders have a first lien
against the assets.
O&amp;Y has been able to take cash out of these projects only by pledging
collateral. In the case of 55 Water Street and 59 Maiden Lane, for instance,
it has posted a blue-chip surety bond issued by Aetna Insurance.
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York credit-rating agencies, say this
collateral is likely to be sufficient to meet interest payments. Interest of
Dollars 35m is due to bondholders of the Water Street property on June 30.
No such escrow requirement exists on the Dollars 800m privately-placed
Eurobond secured by a building at the World Financial Centre, on which O&amp;Y
failed to make a Dollars 62m interest payment earlier this month.
Mr Larry Miller, vice-president at Moody's, said the single-purpose
companies 'were designed to be insulated from the insolvency of the parent'.
Investors continue to face a risk, however, from the weak North American
office rental market.
Banks have on at least one occasion already had to carry the cost of
safeguards given to public holders of O&amp;Y securities.
Five Canadian, US, and Japanese institutions as well as an Austrian bank
were required to retire a Dollars 160m commercial paper programme last year
secured by Gulf Canada Square, a Calgary office building. Investors were
reluctant to roll over their paper as prospects for the western Canadian oil
industry and property market soured.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON, which reported higher 1992 first-quarter results, said
worldwide demand for its motorcycles continued to outweigh supply, Reuter
reports.
The US motorcycle maker reported 1992 first-quarter earnings rose to Dollars
8.7m from Dollars 4.5m last time which lifted per share earnings to 48 cents
a share from 25 cents last year, reflecting the impact of a two-week strike
in the 1991 first quarter. The advance was achieved on sales which rose to
Dollars 247.4m from Dollars 196.2m in the 1991 first quarter.
The company said first-quarter motorcycle shipments were hurt by shipment of
about 3,000 units in the 1991 fourth quarter, which normally would have been
held in inventory until the first quarter.
It added that 3,000 motorcycles from year-end stocks were shipped in
December in response to dealer demand.
The company said its Holiday Rambler's Recreational Vehicle unit lifted
sales 37 per cent to Dollars 47.5m in the quarter.

ZENITH Electronics, the struggling US television manufacturer, suffered a
loss of Dollars 28.6m, or 98 cents per share for the first quarter. This
compares with a loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 85 cents per share, in the
year-ago period.
The company said the poor results reflected lower colour television sales
and prices, compared with those of last year and continuing recessionary
conditions for its other electronic products.
Television sales were affected by price cuts by competitors, causing Zenith
to slash its prices, and inventory decreases by several national retailers.
First-quarter results were also affected by launch costs for the company's
new larger screen and higher resolution video monitors.
Mr Jerry Pearlman, Zenith chairman, said the second quarter was expected to
continue to be difficult because of the slow US economic recovery.
He added that benefits from the company's cost reduction programmes were not
expected to be felt until the second half of the year.
The company's fortunes appear in the longer run to hang on the success of
its Digital Spectrum Compatible HDTV system, developed with AT&amp;T. Testing of
the system began in March and is expected to be completed in May.
The US Federal Communications Commission plans to adopt a new digital
broadcast system for HDTV in 1993.

reported a 9 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits, at Dollars 145m
after tax.
The core railroad operations saw earnings advance by 6 per cent to Dollars
136m, while operating profits were up by 11 per cent. The company said lower
fuel prices, productivity gains and stronger traffic volumes contributed to
the improvement.
Union Pacific's operating revenues overall were unchanged at Dollars 1.74bn.
Earnings per share were 71 cents, against 66 cents a year ago.

CONTROL DATA , the US computer products and services company, yesterday
reported higher-than-expected operating results for the first quarter.
Its net earnings were boosted by a gain from the formation of a joint
venture.
First-quarter net earnings amounted to Dollars 7.7m, or 18 cents per share,
up from Dollars 7m or 16 cents per share in the same period last year.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 365.7m, down sharply from Dollars
405.8m in the first quarter of 1991.
Of the latest first-quarter results earnings from operations totalled 6
cents per share, Control Data said.
There was a net gain of Dollars 5.2m, primarily the result of a cash payment
to Control Data by VNU Business Information Systems in connection with the
formation of a joint venture company.
Results for the same period in 1991 also included earnings from operations
of 6 cents per share and a net gain of Dollars 5.4m. The latter included the
proceeds of the sale of stock in Seagate, a disk-drive manufacturer, as well
as restructuring gains and losses as a result of the consolidation of
operations.
Explaining the decline in revenues, Control Data said that because of
accounting changes the 1991 first quarter included four months of operating
results from the international operations of two of its principle business
units: Computer Products and Government Systems.
Operating results for ongoing businesses, however, showed a modest gain in
the first quarter, the company added.
'The information services and government systems businesses performed
satisfactorily, but we believe they can do significantly better,' said Mr
Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive.
Computer Products' open systems revenues have been growing rapidly, but
revenues from proprietary computing continue to decline, Mr Perlman added.
'We are cautiously optimistic about Control Data's operating prospects in
1992.
'We need to be operating in a stronger economy for major improvement to
occur, but we are not biding our time and waiting for economic recovery.'
Control Data's banks have extended its credit and the waiver of the net
earnings conditions to the end of June, the company said.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Axa slips 28% to FFr2.4bn but
increases dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AXA, France's second largest insurance company which last summer emerged as
a significant shareholder in The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the US,
saw its net profits fall in 1991 by 28 per cent to FFr2.4bn (Dollars 426.2m)
from FFr3.35bn in 1990.
The group, chaired by Mr Claude Bebear, attributed the reduction in profits
to lower capital gains on sales of investments by the Axa holding company.
In spite of the decline in profits the board proposed a slight increase in
the dividend to FFr22 for the year to end-December, from FFr21.
Axa is among the first of the big French insurance groups to announce its
1991 figures. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled
company which is the largest player in the French insurance market, will
report today, followed on Monday by Groupes des Assurances Nationales (GAN),
another state-controlled company.
The announcement of the fall in Axa's profits comes at a sensitive time for
the French insurance sector, which is preparing for the proposed partial
privatisation of the state-controlled groups - including UAP and GAN -
probably later this year.
Axa was affected in 1991 not only by the fall in capital gains - which
helped to cut the contribution from the holding company from FFr1.8bn to
FFr1.1bn - but also from the poor performances of its property leasing
businesses and Compagnie Financiere Paribas.
Property leasing was hit by the general slowdown in the real estate market.
Paribas, one of France's most prestigious banking groups, recently reported
its first ever loss - of FFr184m - after being forced in 1991 to make hefty
provisions of FFr2.8bn.
Axa mustered a modest increase in insurance profits from FFr1.21bn to
FFr1.35bn, chiefly due to a strong performance from its reinsurance
activities which swung from a loss of FFr70m into a profit of FFr152m.

<TEXT>
PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco company, is poised to win the race to acquire
a strategic stake in the former tobacco monopoly of the Czech republic.
Approval from the government would give the US group 30 per cent of Tabak,
the tobacco company holding 80 per cent of the Czech republic's market. The
sale has attracted the attention of leading international tobacco companies
which are seeking to enter the profitable markets of eastern Europe. Tabak's
former monopoly situation in the Czech republic should allow Philip Morris
to operate practically unhindered by competition. On the national level, it
will compete with the smaller Slovak company, CSTP, which last week was
partially sold to Reemstma, the German tobacco company.
International tobacco companies involved in the race to win Tabak have
bitterly complained about the governmental decision not to break Tabak into
separate plants and allow for more international competition within the
country.
They have also claimed that Philip Morris, which already had a licensee
agreement and was openly favoured by management, had privileged access to
information. Czech officials have denied that the tender, monitored by
Nomura Securities, was not properly conducted.

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEDLLOYD, the Dutch trans-port group, made a strong swing back into profit
in 1991, due to gains produced by a series of divestments and, to a lesser
extent, to an improvement in operating results.
Net profit totalled Fl 145m (Dollars 77.5m) last year, reversing the
previous year's net loss of Fl 148m. In spite of the turnround, Nedlloyd is
to omit its dividend for the second year in a row because of the
'composition' of its profit.
Mr Henk Rootliep, chairman, acknowledged that the strong improvement in
results reflected the company's divestment programme but added: 'I am happy
nevertheless that we have been able to report a substantial, positive
result.'
Nedlloyd's shipping business moved out of the red in 1991 to produce an
operating profit of Fl 44m against a loss of Fl 78m in 1990. The group's
second core business - land-based transport and distribution in Europe - cut
operating losses to Fl 8m from Fl 45m.
Total operating results rose to Fl 80m from Fl 25m in 1990. The operating
figure includes Fl 35m from the sale of fixed assets such as ships. The year
before, Nedlloyd had raised Fl 111m at the operating profit level by selling
a liquefied natural gas tanker, some property in Japan and other assets.
The net result was boosted by extraordinary items of Fl 141m, of which more
than a third was generated by the sale of the energy division to DSM, the
Dutch chemicals group. Sales of minority shareholdings yielded another Fl
76m in book profits.
Nedlloyd's divestment programme, which has concentrated on non-core
businesses such as energy, aviation and electronics, produced cash proceeds
of Fl 700m in 1991.

PHILIPS, Europe's leading semiconductor group, yesterday finalised an accord
to develop advanced integrated circuits with SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian
venture which is Europe's third-largest chip maker.
The Dutch company is to provide 30 researchers for a team of 300 scientists
at a Dollars 200m research and development complex being built by
SGS-Thomson and the Cnet French telecommunications research institute at
Crolles, near Grenoble in the French Alps.
They will develop so-called dedicated logic circuits, designed for use in
specific products such as high definition televisions, mobile phones and
integrated services digital networks, in which voice, data and pictures are
sent down a single telecommunications line.
Such devices will represent as much as a third of the semiconductor market
by the end of the decade, predicted Mr Pasquale Pistorio, SGS-Thomson's
chief executive.
The deal brings to fruition an agreement in principle made by Philips and
SGS-Thomson last November.

TRANSATLANTIC, the holding company for the offshore interests of Liberty
Life, the South African insurance group, is to raise Pounds 149m (Dollars
259.2m) through a one-for-four rights issue, writes Philip Gawith in
Johannesburg.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of both companies, also announced yesterday that
Luxembourg-listed TransAtlantic would seek an 'early' listing in London -
since Sun Life, the UK insurer, is now its main investment and is itself no
longer listed.
A long-mooted UK listing for London-based TransAtlantic will make future
capital raising easier, not least by making for a more liquid market in its
shares.
TransAtlantic said that a listing would necessitate 'an acceptable spread of
shareholders' in TransAtlantic 'and some rationalisation' of the structure
of Capital &amp; Counties, its UK property subsidiary. TransAtlantic owns 82.6
per cent of Capital &amp; Counties' ordinary shares and 31.4 per cent of its
convertible preference shares.
Analysts believe a buy-out of minority shareholders is likely. Capital &amp;
Counties shares closed up 12p at 178p yesterday.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Caterpillar hit by 21% drop in
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, said that
a 21 per cent decline in sales during the first quarter had led to a net
loss of Dollars 132m, or Dollars 1.31 a share.
This was the company's fifth consecutive quarterly net loss, but the first
in which non-recurring charges, such a plant closures, did not account for
the biggest part of the decline. The result compares with losses of Dollars
32m, or 32 cents, in the first quarter of 1991.
The company denied that the five-month strike by the United Auto Workers
union had a significant impact on the results. Mr Ken Kuchan, director of
investor relations, said that the company had not lost sales to customers
because of the strike.
A majority of UAW strikers returned to work this week, though many workers
are bitter after the long work stoppage. Contract talks with the union are
expected to resume in the next week or so.
Sales were Dollars 2.09bn, down from Dollars 2.58bn a year ago. The biggest
drop came abroad, which accounted during the first quarter for 55 per cent
of company's total sales, down from 58 per cent last year. Sales outside the
US fell 24 per cent to Dollars 1.14bn, while domestic sales decreased just
12 per cent to Dollars 953m.
Mr Kuchan said the company continued to meet the demand of customers by
supplying machines from plants overseas or from facilities in the US which
continued to operate at low levels during the strike with staffing by
management and salaried workers.
He said that dealers, in an effort to keep customers satisfied, had
persuaded them to postpone their purchases or provided them with used
machines on a temporary basis.
While Mr Kuchan admitted that some sales had been delayed by the strike, he
asserted: 'We have not lost any share of market.'
The company expects that results will improve significantly during the
second quarter and that it will return to profitability during the second
half of the year.
Dealer inventories were lower than normal during the first quarter because
of weak demand, but sales were picking up in March. Dealers are expected to
begin restocking their inventories, particularly in the North America, where
economic conditions have begun to show signs of improvement.
It also said that its previously announced lift truck joint venture with
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would provide 'a significant gain' for the
company this year.
The outlook for the company was still unclear because of 'the uncertain
economic environment and the ongoing labour negotiations'.
Soured relations with its workforce are not expected to help Caterpillar in
its efforts to improve productivity.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Bouygues edges up to FFr635m for
year

BOUYGUES, one of the world's largest construction groups, yesterday
announced a modest increase of 1.4 per cent in net profits from FFr626m in
1990 to FFr635m (Dollars 112m) in 1991.
This means that Bouygues, which is also the managing shareholder in TF1,
France's biggest single television channel, has failed to meet the initial
estimate of net profits of FFr660m that it made in January when forecasting
the probable outcome for 1991.
Bouygues, like other European construction companies, was affected last year
not only by the slowdown in the property market but also by difficulties
with the Channel tunnel project. Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman, said Bouygues
had made a provision of FFr123m for its share of the losses on the project.
Trans Manche Link (TML), the consortium of Anglo-French contractors in which
Bouygues owns a 10 per cent stake, has been in dispute with Eurotunnel,
which is orchestrating the tunnel scheme, over payment for its work on the
project.
Despite the slowdown in European construction, Bouygues' overall turnover
rose by 13 per cent from FFr56.7bn in 1990 to FFr64.3bn in 1991. On a
strictly comparable basis the rate of sales growth was slightly lower at 8
per cent. Bouygues benefited from expansion in international interests,
which saw turnover rise by 43 per cent to FFr18.9bn.
The group envisages a slight fall in turnover to about FFr64bn in the
current year, mainly because of the weakness of the property market. Despite
this, the board proposed raising the dividend from FFr15 in 1990 to FFr16 a
share for 1991.
Clarins, the French skin care and cosmetics group, shrugged off the slowdown
in the international beauty industry last year with a 21 per cent increase
in net profits from FFr158m in 1990 to FFr192m in 1991.

FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Total takes control of Portugal
refiner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Portuguese government yesterday accepted a bid from a consortium led by
Total, the French state-controlled oil group, for control of the Petrogal
oil refiner, the state-owned oil refining company.
It is the largest in Portugal's three-year-old privatisation programme. The
bid values Petrogal, the country's largest company, at Es131bn (Dollars
916m).
The Total consortium was the only bidder, after Du Pont, the US chemicals
giant, dropped out of the race.
Petrogal holds more than half of the Portuguese market for refined products.
Its refining capacity of 290,000 barrels a day represents 20 per cent of the
combined capacity of Spain and Portugal, both of which are showing rapid
growth in demand for oil products, according to Total.
Total, with nine Portuguese financial investors, is to take a 51 per cent
stake in Petrogal; 25 per cent initially plus 26 per cent in the next three
years. Of the first tranche, 20 per cent will come from an issue of new
shares, expected to raise around Es20bn, with the remaining 5 per cent to
come from the sale of existing shares.
Petrogal's refineries were well-adapted for exports to Spain, Africa and
America, said the French group yesterday. The stake would give Total a sound
base to develop sales to Portuguese-speaking African countries such as
Mozambique and Angola, with which Petrogal has special relationships. This
also adds southern European exposure to Total's refining businesses, which
until now have been centred on north-western Europe.
Total has 48 per cent of the consortium and would accordingly contribute
'significantly' to the management of Petrogal, said the French group.
One condition of the sale is that Petrogal's new owners must modernise one
of its three refineries, at Sines, on Portugal's southern Atlantic coast, a
job expected to cost about Es60bn.

WALKER GREENBANK, the wallcoverings and fabrics group, produced a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 5.43m in the year to January 31, compared with Pounds 8.03m
previously.
Although the 1990 disposal programme and recession caused a decline in
turnover to Pounds 56.8m (Pounds 75.3m), sales in the core wallcoverings
business remained almost static at Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 47m) while its
operating profit rose 9 per cent to Pounds 6.8m. Brymor, acquired in
February 1991, contributed Pounds 3m turnover and Pounds 1.87m operating
profit.
Pre-tax profit was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 212,000,
comprising reorganisation and closure costs of Pounds 1.43m, less Pounds
1.16m profit on sale of properties and trade investments of Pounds 53,000.
There was still a surplus property portfolio, which would be sold as the
market reovered.
Earnings per share were 4.14p (5.63p). The proposed final dividend is held
at 1.9p for a same-again total of 3.1p.

GT MANAGEMENT, the investment management group which is owned by the Bank in
Liechtenstein, saw pre-tax profits fall by 7 per cent in 1991 despite strong
growth in its US mutual fund business.
Funds under management rose from Pounds 5.3bn to Pounds 6.6bn, but
commission and fee income rose only 4 per cent to Pounds 67.3m (Pounds
64.7m). That reflected a reduction in initial commission income (the charge
made when funds are purchased by retail investors) from the high levels
achieved in 1990.
In addition, the 1990 profit figure of Pounds 20.9m included an exceptional
item of Pounds 2.9m. If that item was excluded, the 1991 pre-tax figure of
Pounds 19.4m actually represented a 7 per cent rise.
The US mutual funds business, based in San Francisco, saw funds under
management rise 31 per cent to nearly Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn). US retail
funds now represent a third of assets under GT's management. Mr Peter
Stevens, chief executive, also said that the UK pension fund business grew
by 25 per cent last year.
GT has set up an operation in Dublin, where it intends to concentrate the
administration of its offshore funds, which are currently domiciled in a
wide range of locations - including the Cayman Islands and the Netherlands
Antilles.

Increased rental income, up from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 8.81m, and profit on
the sale of a Southend-on-Sea development were substantially offset by
losses in housebuilding and further write-offs in commercial and housing
land values. Earnings fell to 3.1p (7p).
After the Southend sale and a disposal in Norwich, bank borrowings stood at

costs
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTIN REED, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, yesterday reported an
11 per cent fall in profits and a cut in the final dividend after trading
was badly affected by the recession and the Gulf war.
Pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 fell from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds
3.2m on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 67.9m. This was after Pounds 800,000
of reorganisation and redundancy costs.
Earnings per share fell from 9.5p to 7.9p and the company is recommending a
3p (6.5p) final dividend, bringing the total for the year to 6p (9.5p). Mr
Barry Reed, chairman, said the dividend was cut to ensure dividends were at
least covered by earnings.
'I have not had to cut a dividend in 20 years,' Mr Reed said. Last year,
when the dividend was only just covered by earnings the company had thought
things would get better. Mr Reed now believed it would be a long haul out of
recession for the retail trade despite an election result that was
favourable for business.
'Profitability will continue to be under pressure until at least the second
half of the year', he said. 'Sixty per cent of our business is in London and
the south-east. Regent Street is up, but the three City stores are still
running behind last year and recession has gradually spread north to Leeds
and Scotland in the last year.'
The manufacturing business was also being hit by falling exports as
recession bit in continental Europe.
During the year the retailing division increased margins and reduced
overheads. Sales only fell 2.5 per cent from its 37 continuing retail
outlets.
The three manufacturing companies - Austin Reed International, Chester
Barrie and Stephens Brothers - were all hit by lower retail sales and
turnover fell 15 per cent.
Lower capital expenditure and falling interest rates helped reduce the
interest charge from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2.4m and gearing fell from 27 per
cent to 21 per cent.

HAVELOCK EUROPA, the storefitting group, reported a loss of Pounds 2.47m for
1991 blaming recession for what it called a 'very severe year'. The final
dividend is being passed.
Sir Lewis Robertson, the chairman who was installed by institutions in 1989,
said there were no signs of any real improvement in the group's markets
although the order position improved in the second half. Retailers had no
plans for creating substantial new shopping centres in 1992.
The group, which made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m in 1990, saw turnover
fall from Pounds 46.8m to Pounds 37.7m. The bulk of the pre-tax deficit was
incurred in the first half and included an exceptional loss of Pounds
458,000 due to redundancy costs.
During the year big cuts were made in operating costs and overheads. The
manufacturing plant at Inchinnan near Glasgow was closed to concentrate on
factories at Dalgety Bay, Fife, and at Nottingham. The workforce was cut by
240 to 831.
Sir Lewis said the group was building a strong base for the future by
establishing its pre-eminence in the design and development of shopfitting
equipment. It aimed to become a designated supplier of leading store chains
rather than being one of a number of contractors competing purely on price.
It had designed new fittings for Marks and Spencer and Boots, its main
customers, and had recently won its first big order from Safe-way.
Mr Hew Balfour, who Sir Lewis brought in as chief executive, said that
Havelock would probably have failed altogether be-cause of the abnormally
bad period in the storefitting business if it had not been restructured over
the past two years.
Sir Lewis said that distributable reserves did not justify paying a final
dividend, so the interim of 1.5p stands for the year. In 1990 the group paid
a total of 3.6p.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Benlox seeks approval of creditors for
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENLOX, the building and engineering company which formed the vehicle for an
abortive Pounds 2bn bid for the retail group Storehouse in 1987, has written
to shareholders seeking approval for a fundamental restructuring.
The group, which lost its Stock Exchange listing in November, will be
seeking the agreement of about 20 non-bank creditors - owed Pounds 4m - at a
meeting on May 8.
Agreement would enable Sheikh Amin Al-Dahlawi, who is one of the largest
non-royal traders in Saudi Arabia, to inject assets into the group in return
for Pounds 3m worth of shares. Shareholders will also be asked to authorise
the expansion of the capital base from Pounds 6m to Pounds 20m.
The group is not revealing what assets Sheikh Amin Al-Dahlawi is proposing
to inject into the group until it receives shareholder approval for the
restructuring.
It may then launch a rights issue to offer shareholders the chance to
participate in the company's expansion.
To mark the company's new start it is also proposing to change its name to
Keatway International.
The restructuring is being spearheaded by Mr Bob Hankes-Drielsma, chairman,
and Mr Paul Bloomfield, who joined Benlox in 1988 from Mountleigh, the
property company.
Mr Hankes-Drielsma said shareholder approval of the proposals would put the
group back on track.
It is currently working on possible transactions in eastern Europe.
Bank borrowings have been reduced from a high of Pounds 16m in November
1989, when Mr Hankes-Drielsma joined the board, to Pounds 200,000.
Trading in the company's shares may soon take place by way of Rule 535. Mr
Hankes-Drielsma said was not yet trying to get a listing.
Once the restructuring goes ahead the accounts for 1989, 1990 and 1991 will
be published.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Continuing pressure on margins leaves
Helene down at Pounds 2.61m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Helene, the womenswear group, recorded record sales for 1991 but continuing
pressure on margins cut the pre-tax profit by Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 2.61m.
Mr Michael Harris, chairman, said the increase in turnover to Pounds 73.5m
(Pounds 67.9m) was creditable in the face of the recession and the low level
of sales in high-street shops. Exports rose by 33 per cent to more than
Pounds 13m.
The second half showed some improvement over 1990's second half and the new
year had started well. Both sales and orders in hand currently showed an
increase over the same period of 1991.
Extraordinary charges were Pounds 737,000 (Pounds 198,000), which, broken
down, related to the cost of uncompleted acquisitions Pounds 254,000 (Pounds
84,000), the elimination of amounts owed under profit warranties Pounds
255,000 (Pounds 114,000), and closure costs of a subsidiary Pounds 228,000
(nil).
Earnings were 2.6p (3.7p) and the final dividend is again 1.36p to hold the
total at 2.01p.

talks

MTM, the troubled speciality chemicals group, yesterday announced that it
had extended the short-term credit facilities with its bankers until the end
of May. They were due to expire on April 30 after the company breached its
covenants.
The company said discussions were still continuing with a view to securing
longer term funding.
The two main syndicates are led by Chase Manhattan of the US and Standard
Chartered, the international UK-based bank. The company is believed to have
debts of about Pounds 70m.
Shareholders are still waiting for the company to announce its full-year
results. Publication was postponed after BDO Binder Hamlyn, the auditors,
refused to sign off the accounts in a dispute about asset values.
The company is obliged by Stock Exchange rules to publish the results by
June 1.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: CWS slips 11% to Pounds 23.1m but upbeat
about prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), which is the biggest commercial
farmer in the UK and a growing force in retailing, saw annual pre-tax
profits fall by 11 per cent as the company encountered very difficult
trading conditions in the 'deepest recession since the Second World War'.
But, Sir Dennis Landau, the chief executive who was presiding over his last
results presentation before his retirement in June, said the company had
maintained its investment programme through the downturn and was 'in better
shape than it has been for many years'.
Profits before tax and exceptional items slid from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds
23.1m as lower investment income and a higher interest charge took their
toll. But sales grew from Pounds 3.03bn to Pounds 3.14bn in the year to
January 11, and trading profits were Pounds 2.5m higher at Pounds 47.1m.
CWS is a substantial food manufacturer and continues to supply goods and
services to the 65 independent co-operative societies in the UK. Food
manufacturing activities contributed Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 12.7m) to trading
profits.
But CWS's retailing activities are becoming an increasingly important part
of the overall business and contributed profits of Pounds 8.6m (Pounds
7.2m).
The retail arm was further strengthened through mergers with the Milton
Keynes, Cumbrian, and Greater Nottingham societies.
A few of CWS's stores continued to trade on Sundays despite the group's
initial reluctance to trading seven days a week.
CWS's other interests - spanning milk delivery, travel agencies, opticians,
funeral directors, and engineering contractors - produced a mixed
performance. In particular, engineering and property suffered 'significant
set-backs' and were unlikely to return to their former prosperity for many
years, Sir Dennis said.
However, Sir Dennis, who has been chief executive for the past 12 years,
finished with an upbeat assessment of the company's future prospects.
He said there had been radical changes within the co-operative movement
which would ensure that CWS remained 'a relevant and successful organisation
for many years to come and a viable alternative to both the public and
private sectors of the economy.'
He said that although personally he did not favour the creation of a single
co-operative society by the end of the decade he would not be surprised if
one emerged.
A surplus of Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 23.2m) was shown for the year. But after
swallowing reduced losses of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 10.9m) at its banking arm,
the company transferred Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 12.3m) to reserves.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Toyota out of talks over R-R takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the leading Japanese car maker, yesterday ruled itself out of
further negotiations with Vickers for a possible takeover of the UK
engineering group's troubled Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota president, disclosed that Vickers, which holds
its annual meeting in London today, was concerned that talks between the two
companies should reach an early conclusion.
'Rolls-Royce asked Toyota to make a quick decision (on whether to acquire
the company). Toyota refused the offer as we did not have enough time to
consider (the acquisition),' he told a press conference in Osaka, Reuter
reported.
Mr Toyoda gave no further details of the talks.
Vickers has confirmed that it has been holding talks with a number of
international companies about the possible sale of its luxury car
subsidiary, which plunged into heavy losses last year.
It has refused to reveal the identity of potential buyers, although it is
understood that the most serious negotiations to date have been held with
BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, which already has some
limited technology links with the UK prestige car maker.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Advertising downturn in US and UK behind
31% drop at Wace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WACE GROUP, the printing services company, blamed the downturn in the London
and New York advertising markets for a 31 per cent drop, to Pounds 18.3m, in
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31.
Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said the group had 'produced a resolute
performance against an acute recessionary environment in both the UK and
US'. Turnover rose to Pounds 305m (Pounds 235m), reflecting the inclusion of
a full year from Parkway and Ripley Group.
The chairman said his 'main priority during 1991 was to rationalise and
integrate the acquisitions made by Wace in recent years'.
The group shed 500 jobs during the year, about 9 per cent of the worldwide
total, and a further 190 jobs had gone since the year-end.
Wace said the difficult property market had caused it to write down its
portfolio of investment properties by Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 10.8m).
The property write-down, together with a Pounds 16.4m write-off of goodwill
associated with earn-outs in the year, decreased the group's net assets to
Pounds 78.7m (Pounds 95.5m). This, along with a rise in net borrowings to
Pounds 82.4m (Pounds 53.4m), had caused gearing to rise to 105 per cent.
However in December, a private placement of Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.8m)
senior loan notes had improved the profile of the group's debt with Pounds
78m being repayable after more than two years.
Mr ten Bos said it was the board's firm intention to reduce borrowings to a
more acceptable level, though this might be difficult to accomplish fully in
the short term.
'Although the first half is traditionally quiet for Wace, the first three
months of 1992 have given the group a sound start to the year,' he said.
'Currently, the European operations are performing strongly; certain aspects
of the UK market remain difficult, but with competition still being removed
through closures and liquidations, the outlook for 1992 is optimistic; and
the US market is begining to show signs of improvement.'
Earnings per share fell to 12.6p (25.5p) after the payment of a full year's
preference dividend. The final dividend is held at 6p, giving an unchanged
total of 8.25p. Mr ten Bos said the maintained dividend - covered 1.5 times
by earnings - reflected the board's confidence in the future.
COMMENT
No more skeletons appear to be lurking in the Wace cupboard - named Clegg or
anything else. That was the key message which the group sought to convey to
the City yesterday, and it seems to have succeeded. Gearing is high and is
unlikely to fall until Wace can make some significant property disposals.
However, the other ratios - dividend and interest cover - look fairly
comfortable. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the house broker, is forecasting a
cautious Pounds 23m, which puts the shares on a modest prospective multiple
of 7.7. Although the shares rose from 119p to 127p, the question must be why
they did not regain more of the ground lost since last year's peak of 284p.
Doubtless the thought of the DTI inquiries casts a shadow over the company,
but the shares look oversold at this level - and could attract a predator.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: China urges HSBC not to raise Midland bid
</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday re-entered the debate on Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's bid
for Midland Bank, urging it not to increase its offer for the UK clearer.
The semi-official China News Service (CNS) said it would be 'unfair' to
Hongkong Bank shareholders if it bettered the terms of its offer for
Midland. It said Midland's shareholders would be the losers if the bid did
not go though on Hongkong Bank's terms.
It is unclear what prompted CNS to make these comments but they coincide
with reports that Lloyds Bank would consider making an offer for Midland
when its board meets today. If this happens the Hongkong Bank might be
forced to increase its offer.
That said, yesterday's comments on the Midland bid were, by implication, the
most positive a mainland Chinese organ has made on Hongkong Bank's offer in
that they suggested China was comfortable with the deal as proposed.
The news service, however, questioned whether Hongkong Bank should use its
inner reserves to pay for the takeover of Midland. It asserted that the
bank's inner reserves should have been HKDollars 30.6bn (Pounds 2.25bn),
instead of the HKDollars 25.3bn it declared in its offer documents.
But CNS misunderstood the Hongkong Bank's offer document. The bank declared
its reserves gross of Pounds 190m merger costs and an estimated Pounds 200m
tax liability. These remain contingent on the bid's acceptance and are
conservative estimates of what it might have to pay.

189,000

<TEXT>
Jessups, the Essex-based motor dealer, returned to profit with Pounds
189,000 pre-tax for the six months to February 29, compared with a Pounds
189,000 loss last time.
Mr John Ganney, finance director, said the swing into the black had been
achieved through cost-cutting and a reduction in interest charges.
The decline in base rates and a fall in turnover, resulting in fewer leasing
obligations, helped to cut interest charges from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds
978,000. Debt was reduced from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 15m.
Sales fell from Pounds 45m to Pounds 38.3m, and Mr Ganney warned that the
figures continued to be depressed.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ross at Pounds 1.3m in first results since
full listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSS GROUP, the rapidly growing packaging and electronics company, yesterday
unveiled profits of Pounds 1.26m in its first full set of annual results
since coming to the main market through last year's reverse takeover of
Whittington Group, the giftware company.
Mr Noel Hayes, group managing director, said the results were not comparable
with the Pounds 647,000 loss reported in 1990, as that year's figures
represented only Whittington's performance.
All of Whittington's businesses had been sold since the takeover, resulting
in a below-the-line gain of Pounds 3.5m, he said.
Comparing the businesses before Whittington with the current Ross Group,
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 rose from Pounds 989,000. This
year's result had been depressed by offsetting the Pounds 400,000 costs of
closing Whittington's head office against the operating profits.
Mr Hayes said the group had increased its market share in both the packaging
and consumer electronics divisions. The introduction of new products, such
as camcorder batteries, had boosted consumer electronics, while 'hard work'
and new contracts had helped packaging.
The acquisition of Traveller International in April had contributed about
Pounds 150,000 to profits, Mr Hayes said.
Stellar, the seventh company acquired by Ross in the last 18 months, had
made a marginal contribution to profits as it was included for just one
month.
Stellar's loss-making Brighouse site - which produces battery chargers and
electrical plugs and accounted for about Pounds 2m in losses last year -
made a marginal deficit in the first quarter, Mr Hayes said.
Net debt stood at Pounds 4.5m, representing about 28 per cent of
shareholders' funds.
The final dividend is 0.3p, making a total of 0.45p. Earnings per share were
1.5p.

FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Davies &amp; Newman warns of downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVIES &amp; NEWMAN, the holding company for Dan-Air, the UK-based airline,
yesterday warned of a 'material reduction' in 1992 profits compared to
forecasts made during the company's refinancing last October.
Mr David James, the company doctor who became chairman in 1990 when D&amp;N came
close to collapse, said market conditions in the first quarter this year
were disappointing.
He blamed continuing recession and uncertainty caused by the election, which
reduced business travel especially. However, he reported a 'dramatic upturn'
in passengers and forward bookings since the election result.
Forecasts made during the refinancing of Pounds 22m profits this year are
now unattainable. 'Nonetheless, we believe it is still feasible to see a
return to profit in 1992, subject to a market recovery at the levels we
anticipate,' he said.
D&amp;N announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 35.5m in the year to December 31, in
line with forecast losses of Pounds 35m and ahead of 1990 losses of Pounds
38.7m. Turnover of Pounds 317.8m was slightly ahead of forecasts of Pounds
312.1m, but below 1990's Pounds 365.2m. The shares fell 11p to 90p.
Only two of four Boeing 727-200s due for disposal were sold during the
period, raising a surplus of Pounds 1.31m. However, a third aircraft has
since been sold.
The interest charge fell to Pounds 7.23m (Pounds 9.74m) as proceeds of the
Pounds 49.3m placing reduced borrowings and brought gearing down to 67 per
cent, from 518 per cent a year earlier.
Exceptional items totalled Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 4.15m), which included a
Pounds 7.5m special fee to Lloyds Bank and others for extending banking
facilities. The closure of the airline's charter base in Berlin cost a
further Pounds 1.1m.
Extraordinary profits of Pounds 7.39m, compared to forecasts of Pounds 7.1m,
came from the sale of Dan-Air Engineering.
The company is not paying a dividend.
There was a retained loss of Pounds 13m. But after accounting for expanded
share capital, shareholders' funds increased to Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 15.1m).
Mr James said changes promised during the refinancing were all under way.
Licences for seven new scheduled routes had won approval from the Civil
Aviation Authority, although two routes, Cairo and Istanbul, were pending
approval from their respective governments.
The fleet's average age has been reduced to 12.1 years (14.5 years) and the
1995 target remains 5.4 years.
Mr James said he would stay with the company for up to one more year. This
follows the appointment earlier this month as group chief executive of Mr
John Olsen, who joined from Cathay Pacific.
COMMENT
Should yesterday's warning on 1992 profits be seen as an inevitable reaction
to grim markets, or as an admission that last October's forecasts were
unrealistic? Certainly the assumption of a 7 per cent increase in European
passenger yields for this year now looks optimistic, after yields have
already been undercut by static business travellers in the first few months.
The problem for investors, and for Mr James, is judging whether the strong
pick up since the election is sustainable or another false dawn. Those who
do not yet quite buy D&amp;N's recovery potential may prefer to wait until the
annual meeting for a clearer update. Until then, City forecasts for this
year of Pounds 5m profits put the shares on a multiple of more than 20,
suggesting the market has already discounted the upside.

FT  23 APR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Plenty of headroom in the UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the recent British election campaign, there was a recondite form of
activity indulged in by many in the City of London. This was to make shock
horror predictions of the state of the British economy which either party
would inherit. If I single out Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, it is not because
it was more alarmist than others, but because it took the trouble to spell
out its forebodings in The Fiscal Reality Gap (March 1992).
Coopers' shock horror scenario was that by 1996, a Conservative government
would have to raise income tax by 13p in the pound, on the illustrative
assumption that the Conservatives intended to return to a balanced budget by
1996. If this pessimism had been based on worries about public spending, it
would have been understandable. For not all the very large deficit reflects
the automatic effects of recession.
But Coopers did not make public spending its central concern. Indeed, its
pessimism was almost entirely based on the charge that the Treasury had
overestimated likely economic growth. On the contrary, I think it has
underestimated it, not necessarily for this year or next, but over the
1990s.
The besetting sin of would-be down-to-earth types is that they always
project the present and the recent past and forget that the economy moves in
cycles of varying lengths, and that therefore neither booms nor slumps go on
forever.
Next week, we will have a new Confederation of British Industry Quarterly
Trends Survey which contains the question: 'Is your present level of output
below capacity?' The last survey showed 70 per cent below capacity on this
criterion. Yet despite this slack, the Treasury projections show output
rising only slowly off the bottom of the tramlines, with only a gradual
reduction in the amount of slack. This projection may be right or wrong: but
it hardly shows much over-optimism. The implication is also that
unemployment will continue to rise, if at a slower speed until, say, this
winter, and will thereafter improve at a snail's pace.
The adjoining back-of-the-envelope table accepts the official assumption
that the trend growth of real gross domestic product is now some 2 1/2 per
cent a year. Indeed, excluding the North Sea contribution, it is 2 3/4 per
cent. The estimate looks plausible in view of the average 2 per cent a year
rise achieved in the first Thatcher decade and the signs that there was some
underlying improvement in the course of the period.
Another assumption in the table is that the economy was working at a
sustainable or equilibrium rate around the final quarter of 1990. The amount
of slack has had to increase temporarily in order to get the inflation rate
down.
The table plots the Treasury's output projections alongside the implicit
path of capacity. It shows a large margin of slack persisting throughout
much of the 1990s. It is not until 1994 that there is substantially less
unused capacity than today; and even by 1996 there is still some excess
slack. It is worth remembering that a margin of slack of 5 per cent of GDP
amounts to Pounds 30bn a year of lost output and a corresponding number of
unemployed or discouraged workers.
What is there to be cheerful about in this outlook, which might represent a
platform from which Bryan Gould could launch his attack on the crossbench
consensus on macro-economic policy?
The optimism lies in the headroom that is provided for non-inflationary
growth. There is ample room for the economy to grow by even more than the 3
to 3 1/2 per cent rates projected by the Treasury from 1993 onwards, while
still maintaining some downward pressure on inflation and without running
into capacity barriers. It is a much better base both politically and
fiscally than starting at the top of a boom.
What could prevent reasonably rapid growth from being attained? The cliche
answer is that the UK has been running a current payments deficit in a
recession, which is supposed to be very naughty. The gloomsters have for the
most part not noticed that the Central Statistical Office has revised the
1991 current deficit downwards to Pounds 4.4bn, or well under 1 per cent of
GDP. And while the world economic slowdown came too late to blame for the UK
recession, it can certainly be blamed for the failure of exports to offset
more than a modest amount of the turndown in demand at home.
The extremely low interest rate differential between Britain and Germany
does not suggest either expected currency depreciation or any expected
difficulty in financing the payments deficit - if there is one. As Mr
Gladstone realised, if the government's own Budget is in order, the
chancellor does not need to know what the balance of payments is.
The real cause for concern is not the state of the British economy, but
worldwide worries about credit retrenchment, the state of the banking
system, and so on. The centre of these worries is not Britain, nor even the
US, but now Japan, the country we were all told to emulate. But it really is
too parochial to regard this syndrome of problems as a weakness for the
British economy, which suffers from them less than many others do.
Indeed, with a low and declining inflation rate, a much improved underlying
productivity trend and a strong currency, Britain is in a reasonable
position to ride out storms and take advantage of opportunities. In this
connection, Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers has performed a service by
showing that an upward blip is likely in the RPI which may only just miss 5
per cent this May. The blip will also affect the so-called underlying rate.
But the true core rate, which omits a larger number of erratic items, will
continue to fall - perhaps towards 2 per cent next year.
* * *
I would (as an ERM supporter who would like to see an eventual single
European currency) shelve any attempt to narrow the UK's ERM bands from 6
per cent to the normal 2 1/4 per cent this year. There is obviously more
scope for Britain to have moderately different interest rates from Germany's
with wide bands than with narrow ones, provided that there is a general
atmosphere of confidence in the currency, which is more likely after the
election.
With narrow bands, either the UK has to stick with German-type interest
rates; or it has to do something very dramatic, such as leave the ERM, or at
the other extreme, try to replace Germany as the anchor country of the
system. With wider margins, these choices can be postponed and more time
provided for Germany to overcome its unification problems and restore more
normal interest rates.

FT  23 APR 92 / Letter: Co-operative money system better for world economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From HEATHER GIBSON and EUCLID TSAKALOTOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The leader writers of the Financial Times nowadays are clearly not
economic historians. And we do not mean 19th-century economic history but
that of the 1980s. The leader 'Chilly spring in Washington' (April 22)
rejoiced in the end of the exchange rate co-ordinating role of the G7
summits, arguing that a healthy world economic system requires merely that
all the participating countries put their own houses in order.
Had the G7 taken your advice in the second half of the 1980s, it is very
likely that the world economy would be even more on a 'knife-edge' than it
is already. In brief, a rapidly depreciating dollar could have led to high
interest rates and deflation in the US which could have got out of control
given the precarious position of the financial system and the existence of a
highly-leveraged corporate sector - the so-called 'hard-landing scenario'.
In general, we have many examples where a co-operative international
monetary system, or one that has been happy to follow a hegemonic leader,
has been an important ingredient in a prosperous and dynamic world economy.
We also have evidence of the 1930s and the period 1974-85 when, many
economists consider, the lack of such co-operation was an important
ingredient in poor economic performance. A little economic history can go a
long way.

FT  23 APR 92 / Letter: View of Baltic Exchange bombing aftermath 'callous'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER K SPENCER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Observer column story ('Home thoughts', April 16) dealing with the
Baltic Exchange bomb outrage is noteworthy only for its callousness and
ignorance.
First, there has been far more 'fuss' about an employee of the exchange who
was murdered while serving what you refer to as a hangover establishment,
and another member of the exchange who is lying in hospital with horrific
injuries, than about the building itself.
If Observer had any knowledge at all about the Baltic he would be aware that
the industry based around it is primarily concerned with invisible exports
and nothing at all to do with Britain ruling anything.
The personal contacts and disciplinary codes of a trading floor are what
makes the exchange unique and help it maintain its position as the most
important shipping centre in the world. A telephone and computer alone
contribute nothing to the confidence and trust among individuals that enable
the Baltic to keep international business in London that would otherwise go
elsewhere.

Sir, I am sorry that Barrie Bain (Letters, April 18) had difficulty with
city telephone dialling codes for the former Soviet Union. But if he had
telephoned Mercury's international directory assistance service (available
to Mercury customers by dialling 153), help and advice would have been
readily available.
Mercury now carries more than one-third of the UK's telephone traffic to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, including all the area codes established
under the former Soviet Union. To help satisfy the rapidly growing demand
and improve the erratic quality of their international telephone service,
the Russian republic is introducing competition, a move which we at Mercury
enthusiastically support. This has resulted in some extra area codes being
allocated to newly licenced carriers. Mercury is opening service with these
organisations as they become operational.
One of these new carriers is Metropolitan Communications, in which Mercury's
parent company, Cable and Wireless, has a significant interest (FT Companies
and Markets: 'C&amp;W in joint venture to provide Russian networks', April 15).
You may rest assured that the Cable and Wireless Group is taking CIS
communications very seriously indeed.

THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION NOW
By Ferdinand Mount
Heinemann Pounds 18.50. 289 pages
If you like puzzles, study the following sentences and guess whose
passionate hand underlined the words printed in italics. Here goes: '. . .
an American can know that he has certain individual rights which stand above
ordinary laws, things that he cannot be made to submit to by any law . . .
It is the medieval doctrine over again, a supreme law that overrules the
law-making of men, but with the written word of the Constitution in place of
the uncertain theories of Natural Law.'
Not a clue? The extract is from Lord Radcliffe's 1951 Reith lectures,
entitled The Problem of Power. Radcliffe argued that power could be safe
only under certain conditions - conditions which were increasingly unlikely
to be found in Britain. A copy of the book was passed from its original
owner to Ferdinand Mount in the early 1980s. Now try this second extract.
Again, the italics represent underlined words. Alluding to the separation of
powers, Radcliffe argues that James Madison, one of the US constitution's
founding fathers, 'starts, of course, with the . . . assumption that the
very definition of tyranny consists in accumulating all powers in the same
hand . . .' Still no idea? One more: 'With . . . single-chamber government
and with executive and legislative combined, the security of what used to be
called constitutional rights is a frail thing.'
The underliner is, we are told, Mrs Margaret Thatcher. She gave the
paperback to the author, commending in particular the passages she had
marked. 'I mention all this,' writes Mr Mount, who served as head of Mrs
Thatcher's policy unit from 1982 to 1984, 'to demonstrate that the most
robust Tory of our times . . . was painfully aware of how vulnerable our
institutions were and of how the old checks and balances, rudimentary and
informal as they might have been, had been eroded and debased'. He might,
but does not, draw the contrast with the present public position of Mr John
Major, whose remarks during the recent election campaign gave the impression
that he finds every detail of Britain's constitution absolutely perfect.
Mr Major would do us a favour if he read this book. It is not a reformer's
rant. It is rooted in the conservative tradition. To put his mind at rest,
he may be assured that Mr Mount is deeply sceptical of proportional
representation, and rejects any grand settlement. He talks instead of a slow
aggregation of piecemeal improvements, spread over perhaps a decade or more.
As the prime minister might put it, the trick is to reach your century in
singles.
Mr Mount reviews the history of reform. He also debunks the notion of
absolute parliamentary sovereignty in a unitary state. This is inherent in
the works of the 'three great simplifiers' of modern British constitutional
theory - Walter Bagehot, A V Dicey and Sir Ivor Jennings. Their writings
inform those who defend the existing system, one of whom is the education
secretary, Mr John Patten. The author gives him short shrift: ''All power to
parliament' is thus Mr Patten's cry, faintly but unnervingly reminiscent of
Lenin's 'All power to the Soviets' - and not without the same fraudulence,
since both slogans mean in effect 'All power to the government or governing
party.' '
In truth, it is not quite so bad as that. Mr Mount's account of how power is
actually exercised tells a gentler story. He finds, against the conventional
wisdom, that the monarchy has a useful future constitutional role, if only
as a leader of opinion. The cabinet is not the source of all power; the
prime minister is not omnipotent. Government departments are baronial
estates; the administration is the product of baronial assertions of power,
overseen by a strong Downing Street.
As to the likely development of the constitution, Mr Mount distinguishes
between what is already on the way with what will probably come in the
middle and further distances. The judiciary, whose compliant acceptance of
the government's authority in my view helped to sustain the elective
dictatorship, is shown by Mr Mount to be coming back to life, at least as
protector of the individual. Within parliament, we see 'a gradual but still
timid peeping forth of backbenchers' confidence'; in consequence, select
committees, 'look increasingly like a fixture'. The latter's response to the
'ever growing bulk' of European legislation will determine parliament's
future as 'an effective critical forum'.
He sees as soon likely the incorporation into UK law of the European
convention on human rights and the establishment of a Scottish assembly 'on
minimalist lines'. In the longer term, he postulates a constitutional
entrenchment law, a supreme court and a fixed term of, say, four years for
future parliaments. Clearly, this is no revolutionary manifesto, but it
sounds more attainable than any such. It is written with light grace and
good humour. You do not have to be a nut about the constitution to enjoy
reading it. You may become one if you do.

FT  23 APR 92 / Final uphill push for the treaty: The EC should forge ahead
before Maastricht is ratified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The odds are that the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary
union will come into force on January 1 1993, if only because no country
will want to risk incurring the wrath of its 11 EC partners by bringing down
the whole temple.
But this year the treaty must run the gauntlet of ratification by each of
the 12 states. The ratification, which got under way yesterday when the
French cabinet adopted its draft revision of France's constitution, was
always going to be a tortuous business. But it has been made more tense by
the emergence of an anti-Maastricht backlash in countries such as Denmark
and Germany, and by the way the treaty's fortunes have become entangled with
extraneous domestic factors such as the political fate of President Francois
Mitterrand and the Socialists in France, and the ferocious abortion debate
in Ireland.
The change in mood from the euphoria of last December's Maastricht summit
stems not from second, but first, thoughts. Incredibly, many countries are
only now thinking through the implications of what their leaders agreed last
year. It is now too late to make modifications; in practical, if not legal,
terms, the only option for national parliaments is to vote the treaty up or
down, without amendment.
Mr Jacques Delors, the European commission president, had seemed perverse
when on several occasions in the long run-up to the Maastricht agreement he
pointedly praised the UK as the only country conducting a national debate
about the implications of political and monetary union. At the time, the UK
debate seemed to create only headaches for Brussels. In retrospect, Mr
Delors was right.
'It was far better to have done the arguing before, rather than after, the
treaty was signed,' said a Delors aide this week. The proof is that there
was hardly a whisper about Maastricht, or EC issues, during the UK election,
and that the UK, having won its Maastricht opt-outs on monetary and social
policy, is one of the few countries where the treaty's ratification seems
assured.
By contrast, many Germans are only now complaining about their hallowed
D-Mark being replaced by the ersatz Ecu. German touchiness on this was
farcically illustrated recently when the European Commission had to reprint
its German version of the Maastricht treaty. The initial print-run referred
to the 'Ecu' as a word, when Bonn and most other EC governments had wanted
their national language versions to refer to the 'ECU', making it clear that
this was only an acronym for European Currency Unit and not necessarily the
eventual name of the single currency.
In Germany, and to a lesser extent in Belgium, regional governments are
unhappy that Maastricht may detract from their powers. There is growing
unease, particularly in France and Luxembourg, about the Maastricht
provision giving all EC citizens the right to vote, and stand as candidates,
in local and European parliamentary elections across the Community. And, as
if Maastricht were not hard enough to get ratified on its own terms, Spain
is toying with the idea of making ratification conditional on the north's
agreeing to the Delors proposals for more 'cohesion' funding for the south.
Further complicating the picture are the losses that governing parties in
France, Italy, Germany and Belgium have suffered in recent elections. While
these may not in all cases endanger ratification, they may compromise the
treaty's implementation. Weak and unstable governments are not best placed
to impose the economic austerity needed to fit their countries for monetary
union. The bond markets have caught a whiff of this pessimism. The interest
rate gap between Ecu and D-Mark bonds, which had narrowed after the
Maastricht agreement, has widened again in the past month.
There are four big danger points: One of the highest hurdles is also the
first - the June 2 referendum on the treaty in Denmark, the result of which
will bind the Copenhagen parliament. After weeks of polls showing a majority
of Danes against Maastricht, the tide may be turning, with a Gallup poll
last Saturday showing a 37-32 per cent split in favour. A similar about-turn
in public opinion happened just before Denmark's 1986 referendum on the
Single European Act and, in contrast to six years ago, all the big political
parties and newspapers back the latest EC integration move. But the polls
also show many Danes undecided on, or opposed to, many aspects of Maastricht
 -its currency, defence, foreign and internal security provisions. As one
senior Commission official put it, the Danish debate on Maastricht 'is not
confined to any precise item that we could try to defuse'. In contrast, the
June 18 referendum in Ireland (the only other EC state set to put Maastricht
to a plebiscite) seems to turn on just one issue. Ireland put into the
Maastricht treaty a formal protocol, stating that nothing in it would negate
its constitutional ban on abortion. But a subsequent row over a 14-year-old
rape victim's wish for an abortion in the UK led a majority of Irish supreme
court judges to state that, in general, the rights of an unborn child took
precedence over the EC-enshrined right to travel.
To offset this ruling, Dublin wanted to add one sentence to the protocol,
upholding its citizens' right to travel and receive information on services
(ie, abortion) legally available elsewhere in the EC. Fearful of opening a
Pandora's Box of revisionist demands, Dublin's EC partners refused to allow
even this tiny tampering with the treaty, but have now agreed to an
interpretative 'declaration' saying the same thing. In addition, the Irish
government has promised a separate abortion referendum later this year.
France has the most complex procedure for revising its constitution, partly
because President Mitterrand has a choice. The revision can either be done
by a three-fifths majority of both chambers meeting in joint session at
Versailles, or by referendum (which Mr Mitterrand desperately wants to avoid
lest it pronounce a vote of no-confidence in himself).
Much of the French debate so far has centred on the provision of rights to
foreigners to vote in local, but not national, elections. France has a
problem in that its local officials also have a national executive and
electoral role; mayors in its smaller towns have a police function, which
has national implications, while regional councillors form part of the
electoral college that chooses its Senate. But Brussels officials believe
the problem is soluble. Maastricht gives the 12 states an extra year to
decide, by unanimity, on the exact form of the new voting rights, and there
is plenty of scope for exceptions, as the Commission proposed in a 1990
draft directive. This would, for instance, give special leeway to
Luxembourg, which has some communes where citizens from other EC states are
in a near-majority.
Germany's ratification decision will probably come last, around December,
and will be the most eagerly awaited, because of the country's central role
in monetary union. It looks as though Chancellor Helmut Kohl will eventually
get the co-operation from the SPD opposition that he needs, both to revise
the constitution (by two-thirds of both houses) and to ratify Maastricht
(requiring a simple majority, which he does not command in the
SPD-controlled Bundesrat).
But Mr Kohl will have to make concessions. These are likely to include
giving the 16 Lander that make up the Bundesrat a veto over any future
transfer of their powers elsewhere, whether to Brussels or to Bonn, and
promising a government report by 1996 on the fitness of countries to enter
monetary union.
It is a measure of how important Germany is to monetary union that Brussels
fears a non-binding report by Bonn in four years on monetary union more than
the British opt-out clause already enshrined in the Maastricht treaty.
'Letting the German parliament take a second look at monetary union could
remove the dynamism from the process,' moans one EC official.
This is because Maastricht still leaves much scope for argument about how
far member states have to bring their spending, debt and inflation to common
levels before they can enter monetary union, set for 1997 or at the latest
1999. States are supposed to show a 'substantial and continuous' decline in
their yearly public deficit to no more than 3 per cent of gross domestic
product, and a reduction in public debt 'at a satisfactory pace' to no more
than 60 per cent of GDP. Germany is likely to interpret 'substantial' and
'satisfactory' differently from many of its partners, particularly those
from among the weaker southern economies.
But that is an argument for the future. What is striking about the
'convergence' discussions among EC finance ministers this year is that they
seem to be taking the Maastricht criteria seriously, even before
ratification. 'What Maastricht does is establish a time frame of five to six
years in which member states have to make a real effort,' says Mr Henning
Christophersen, the EC economic affairs commissioner with responsibility for
shepherding countries down the convergence path. This may seem quite a long
time. But countries such as Greece or Portugal, with double-digit inflation,
or Ireland, Italy and Belgium, with debt that matches or exceeds their GDP,
cannot afford to delay action until they see whether Maastricht gets a final
thumbs up or down by the end of this year.
So, one by one governments are putting forward 'convergence' plans for
discussion with their EC partners in Brussels. The Ecofin (finance
ministers) Council discussed Italy's convergence plan last November,
Portugal's in December and Ireland's in February; it will probably discuss
Germany's next month, Spain's in June and the Netherlands' plan in July or
September. Britain's turn will come early next year, after its forthcoming
EC presidency. It is too early to know whether this form of peer pressure
influences governments, but it is not too early to try it, given the
rigorous goals and timetable set out in the Maastricht treaty.
The Community is having to forge ahead this summer with other items on its
post-Maastricht agenda, such as trying to agree a financial framework for
1993-97, drawing up a strategy for taking in new members and planning how to
operate the 'common foreign and security policy' that Maastricht has
committed it to. In part, this reflects a basic optimism that the treaty
will still be ratified. But in truth, Brussels and the member states have no
option but to act as though Maastricht has already been ratified, and to get
on with their crowded agenda.

FT  23 APR 92 / Leading Article: Teachers and their unions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTER is a depressing time of year for parents with children in state
schools - and indeed anyone concerned with the UK's education system. One by
one, the teachers' unions gather at seaside resorts to hold their annual
conferences. Their leaders strut the stage claiming that the education
system is in crisis and blaming the government. The delegates bellow from
the rostrum that their schools are in terminal decline. Bloodcurdling
resolutions are passed threatening strikes if change is not stopped in its
tracks.
This year has been no different. The National Union of Teachers has
reasserted its opposition to most of the education policies of the
Conservative government it must deal with for the next five years. The
president of the NASUWT urged his members to challenge the government's
education reforms which were bringing 'chaos' into the schools. It was left
to Mr Peter Smith of the moderate Assistant Masters and Mistresses
Association to observe that the 'opted-out' grant-maintained schools were
here to stay and should be made to work.
Much of these conference proceedings are posturing by activists who are
unrepresentative of the teaching profession. Last year's NUT conference, for
example, voted to boycott the national testing of seven-year-olds. A ballot
of the members who would have had to implement the boycott rejected it by
eight to one. A separate ballot of all NUT members also rejected a national
campaign against testing by six to one.
Lost sympathy
But the posturing invariably hits the headlines over a bank holiday weekend
when news is in short supply. Education is the loser, bad-mouthed by
representatives whose behaviour is guaranteed to lose teachers the sympathy
of those whose support is most vital - the parents.
A new entrant to the teaching profession might sensibly ask whether there is
any need for teaching unions. After all, the creation of an independent
teachers' pay review body has ended collective bargaining over pay (and
probably done more to improve the pay and status of teachers than any number
of resolutions passed in Blackpool or Scarborough). And union influence over
local education policy is weakening as more and more schools opt out of the
control of local education authorities which often worked in partnership
with the unions.
Yet there remains a role for union membership, to provide advice, benefits
and representation at work. Such mutual insurance may even be more helpful
in this period of flux, as schools increasingly become independent entities
managing their budgets under the leadership of the head teacher.
Alliance building
Nor need the benefits of union membership stop at the school gate. A
competent union will seek to influence the pay review body with well-argued
submissions on behalf of its members. It will lobby policymakers
intelligently through the sort of campaigning which has made the Royal
College of Nursing such a successful advocate of its members' interests.
Above all, it will seek to build an alliance with the parents to advance the
cause of education, not to alienate them through mindless militancy which
punishes only the children.
To achieve these objectives, teachers need to speak with one voice. The half
dozen unions which currently vie for members were founded for an education
system which has disappeared: the AMMA, for example, used to represent
grammar school teachers; the NASUWT was the union for teachers in secondary
moderns. Uniquely in the British trade union movement, there have been no
significant moves towards mergers of teaching unions. Yet a powerful and
authoritative organisation to represent Britain's teachers is sorely needed.
Now is an ideal time to create such a professional organisation, with a new
education secretary taking up office. Mr John Patten looks willing to open
the dialogue with teachers which has been missing during the recent spate of
necessary reforms. Sadly, the creation of a single voice scarcely features
on the unions' agendas. Teachers - and Britain's children - deserve better.

The scandalous treatment of remand prisoners in British gaols became clear
to me when a friend was remanded in Brixton. We were not allowed to give him
nail scissors (there was one pair for the whole wing), nor a gadget for
playing solo bridge (it contained playing card symbols, and cards were
banned). Visits were very limited but the staff could not or would not say
on the phone whether the quota was used up, so we had to travel all the way
to the prison every time on the off chance. All this with someone who was
innocent, given that British law considers everyone innocent until proved
guilty. A large number of remand prisoners are not found guilty and are
released. The invaluable series Taking Liberties is investigating this
disgraceful situation (8.00 BBC2). Today's True Stories documentary observes
methods used at the Cassel Hospital in south London where 50 or so mental
patients stay for up to a year, treated more with therapy than drugs. They
help with the running of the house and build up strong relationships. Best
comedy of the evening is almost certain to be the repeat of Porridge (9.30
BBC1).

<TEXT>
Krystian Zimerman, a superlatively fine pianist, is on the way to becoming
one of the world's master-recitalists. At the on Royal Festival Hall on
Tuesday his playing maintained a degree of poise and security, an
aristocratic finish, a combination of searching eloquence and simplicity, to
which very few of his generation (or, indeed, any other) could aspire.
More than this, he imparted to the music a quality of sound that one
recognised as utterly his own: lightly luminous yet deep-toned, with a
crystalline glitter in bravura passages that never went hard or vacuously
brilliant. It is a sound imbued with the spirit of musical seriousness,
which is why it absorbed the listener's attention instantly and completely.
On this occasion, though, his performances of Brahms and Chopin never quite
achieved that state of interpretative finality which brooks no argument -
the ability of a Richter or an Arrau to take controversial approaches to
tempo markings or details of texture and phrasing and establish them as
inevitable, impervious to criticism, at last while one listens.
Zimerman opened with the four early Brahms Ballades, op. 10, and took them
so gently and ruminatively that their narrative and picturesque elements
were diluted. ('Edward', the first of the set, particularly craves more
sense of forward movement.) All four pieces sounded wonderfully beautiful,
but a shade too 'private'.
Similarly, although Zimerman's four Chopin Scherzos were full of fiery
flashes, shining bursts of inspiration, limpidly lyrical turns of phrase,
the balance of passion and repose was never held absolutely steady. He
tended to sustain tone through the rest-markings - this was especially
noticeable in the first Scherzo - with the consequence that the music
sometimes felt rushed, and robbed of its full dramatic import. (A monster
with a flash-camera destroyed the build-up of no. 2.)
He was at his incomparable best in two of the three Szymanowski Masques (why
not, as advertised, all three?). In general, even where one quibbled, one
admired the pianist's deep thoughtfulness more than ever.

UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD (15) Lumiere
NAKED LUNCH (18) Cannon Shaftesbury Ave, Screen on the Green
REBECCA'S DAUGHTERS (12) Odeon Haymarket
THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE (15) Odeon West End
BROADWAY BOUND (PG) Screen on the Hill
It is Shakespeare's 428th birthday today. Something reminded me of the Bard
 -perhaps it was the sense of passing centuries - in Wim Wenders' long,
ambitious, awesomely picaresque Until The End Of The World. No, but there
was something else too. In the film's last half, desert-dwelling scientist
Max Von Sydow tries to help his blind wife Jeanne Moreau see with
quasi-magical video footage shot around the world (in the film's first half)
by their son William Hurt.
Though set in 1999, this section is in mood and essence a replay of the 1956
sci-fi film Forbidden Planet, itself a replay of Shakespeare's The Tempest.
The marooned and brooding wizard; the hubris of Man imitating God by
tinkering with human potential; the sense of a scholarly 'court' lost far
beyond time and place.
Two and a half hours' long, with a five hour director's version waiting
dauntingly in the wings, Until The End Of The World goes as far towards the
edge of the world and of movie possibility as a modern film could.
But in getting there it is terminally strained by the rigours of travel. The
first half, not to circumlocute, is a fiasco. Here are Hurt and his
girlfriend Solveig Dommartin (also Wenders's girlfriend, muse and co-writer)
tearing around six countries whirring their camera and becoming entangled
with a surfeit of subplots. A German detective, an Australian bounty hunter,
two French bank robbers, Solveig's ex-boyfriend Sam Neill. . . Siberia, San
Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo. . . no, stop the movie, I want to get off.
In a sense we do get off. The film suddenly stops dead, tipping us into the
red-earthed Australian desert. Here a movie Wenders has been nursing for 15
years begins at last to break free of abstraction. We sense the glimmer of
excitement in a fable about 'seeing' set in a landscape whose native people
aboriginally combine the hunter's outer eye with the dreamer's inner eye.
And we thrill to the plane's-eye views of a land whose time-worn splendour
dwarfs even the cityscapes we have gazed down on before, celestially
glimpsed mazes of microchip buildings and winking fibre-optic lights.
But even this promise does not last. Soon we are flung back upon the white
man's plot, ruled by the phrasebook dialogue and warring accents of an
'international' cast. In Wenders' best films - Alice In The Cities, Kings Of
The Road, Paris, Texas - human beings begin as blank enigmas and are
coloured in by experience and social-cultural exposure. In Until The End Of
The World, the characters begin as interchangeable co-production ciphers and
stay that way.
Even the film's climactic apocalypse of new technology - the swirling images
of the film-within-film shot on high-definition video - fails to blast into
life a film that is less like the intended fable about an image-sated world
re-learning to see, more like an overlong storytelling soiree at the United
Nations.
* * * The Naked Lunch also strives towards new horizons and fails to reach
them. Canadian shriek specialist David Cronenberg (The Fly, Dead Ringers),
adapting William Burroughs' cult novel, presents a fabulist futureworld no
more convincing, though more darkly playful, than Wenders'. Pest
exterminator Bill Lee, played by Peter 'Robocop' Weller with a deadpan croak
patterned on Burroughs himself, is haunted by giant bugs, talking
typewriters and hideous Mugwumps resembling skinned lambs.
This sounds like an average day in the life of a late 20th-century artist.
But Weller thinks he needs a trip and takes one to 'Interzone' - equals
Morocco - where he meets creepy Ian Holm, sultry Judy Davis (doubling as Mrs
Weller and Mrs Holm) and more talking typewriters. When Cronenberg's
shrinking budget prevented him from filming in Africa, he built the movie on
a soundstage. It looks like it: I felt I was in a TV adaptation of
Casablanca with special effects by the Muppets. The lighting is drab, the
creatures are silly and the plot momentum - well, there isn't any.
Burroughs's book had a point. It was a bad dream from the drug culture. It
mixed the rhythmic anarchy of Beat writing with a quivery persecution mania
out of Kafka via sci-fi. The book's shapelessness was its shape: it followed
the cresta runs of its narrator-hero's damaged mind.
Cronenberg's film is like a ski-run that never leaves the starting post. The
problem may be the wrong kind of snow, or then again the wrong kind of
director. Cronenberg's forte is for physical, as distinct from spiritual,
dissection. His best films are under-the-knife nightmares about the invasion
of the human body. But here visceral immediacy is supplanted by the tame
frissons of second-hand symbolism.
The only modern director who might do justice to Burroughs is David Lynch
(or Burroughs himself). Cronenberg's talent seems both overstretched and
underused. He cannot do justice to the free-associative delirium tremens of
the book, even when pixillating the text with details from Burroughs' own
life. At the same time he seems reduced by the need to make potentially
ravening monsters quaintly metaphorical.
* * * Peter O'Toole is a source of delight in Rebecca's Daughters. Wearing
false upper teeth, a rakish wig and a live cat around his neck, he plays a
dissolute landowner in 1843 Wales. Based on a Dylan Thomas original
screenplay, tidied up by Guy Jenkin and directed by Karl Francis (Giro
City), this agitprop romp allows O'Toole to behave like an absolute bounder
whenever he is allowed to upstage - allowed? who could stop him? - the
nominal hero and heroine played by Paul Rhys and Joely Richardson.
She is O'Toole's daughter, he the gallivanting social crusader who sweeps
her up in his struggle against the English tollgate laws. 'Rebecca's
daughters' is the Bible-culled name of his male army, who dress up in drag
to defend the peasant poor against the vicious tax wheezes of the rich.
But the rich, as represented by O'Toole, are so much more fun. The film is
footling whenever he is not on screen: like The Wicked Lady adapted by
Bertolt Brecht. When he is on screen it is still footling but somehow
inspirational. The drawling voice, the lolling gestures, the tipsy-staring
eyes, the fond regard for his daughter ('What she needs is a good man on top
of her]'): it is not so much that the Devil has the best tunes in this film
as that none but he can sing in tune.
Lastly, two from Tinseltown. In The Hand That Rocked The Cradle a vengeful
nanny (Rebecca De Mornay) frightens a married couple (Annabella Sciorra,
Matt McCoy) plus their tot. As Jean Renoir said, everyone has his reasons,
and Miss Mornay has hers. This is a nice girl with a good background who
simply likes to rig greenhouses so they slaughter people in a shower of
glass, to sabotage Miss Sciorra's asthma spray so she is left writhing on
the verandah, or to wield an axe as if trained at the Joan Crawford School
for Advanced Child Care. Good Gothic fun, scripted by Amanda Silver and
directed by Curtis Hanson.
If one could order one by catalogue, I would have called in an axe murderer
to liven up Broadway Bound. Here the cinema rounds off its stodgy adaptation
of Neil Simon's autobiographical stage trilogy. Like Brighton Beach Memoirs
this is set in a house in Brooklyn where the walls and furniture are all in
mouldering brown. The time is the 1940s. The young Simon brothers yatter
formative wisecracks; Grandad Hume Cronyn grouches; Ma Anne Bancroft
reminisces and knits (brown wool - is she knitting the set?); and husband
Jerry Orbach walks out. Lucky man. You, if foolish enough to have paid
admission, should follow.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Ayckbourn's new play is a discouraged comedy for sextet, or more
precisely (like a well-known piece by the composer Elliott Carter) for three
semi-detached duos. Those are the senior Strattons, Gerry and Laura; their
smooth-talking, unreliable son Glyn and his off-and-on wife Stephanie; and
the arty younger son Adam with his innocently punkish girl Maureen. There
are also some wild cards, a restaurateur and four of his waiters (all played
by a single actor), for everything happens in the Strattons' favourite local
restaurant.
The central occasion, the core of the play, is Laura's 54th birthday party.
In a sense, the play goes nowhere; instead it expands in ripples fore and
aft, but always returning to its base. Ayckbourn likes to play formal games,
and Time of My Life is highly regimented. Not only do all its events take
place at three different tables in that restaurant, but the Janus-faced
chronology - more complicated than Sondheim's in Merrily We Roll Along - is
strictly apportioned.
Adam and Maureen are traced backwards from the party through several dates
to their first accidental meeting; Glyn and Stephanie's uneasy lunches run
forward, through Laura's widowhood, to their inevitable split. Laura and
Gerry are seen only in 'real time', in successive moments of the party -
though we glimpse the beginning of that only at the end.
The writing leaves room for plenty of laughs (the Scarborough audience was
loyally forthcoming), and the cast secures them with sharp, sympathetic
playing. Yet there are scarcely any frank gags, nor anything like farcical
mechanics - deceptions, disguises, crucial misunderstandings - until the
first (final) encounter of the youngest pair, by which time a dash of farce
is welcome: the dying fall of the play has been somewhat protracted.
Heretofore, Ayckbourn's canny naturalism has usually taken off from some
bizarre or frenetic spring in the plot. This time everything is as
Northern-ordinary as can be, including the relevant adulterous bits, and
such little revelations as crop up surprise only the characters, not the
audience. But that is the point: to detached observers, there is never much
doubt about the paths these lives are taking. The 'time of your life', by
the way, is expressly identified as the time when you were happiest but
didn't know it. Whether or not that is a sentimental premise, it is a barbed
one for comedy. We watch the characters gently succumbing to wounds they
might have recognised but didn't: funnier for us than for them, of course,
but almost as painful too.
Yet there is also a pervasive sense that each of them does know pretty well
what he or she is doing, and what the others make of that ' as if they were
willing their own deserts while preferring not to admit it. Not the first
time in Ayckbourn's work that this fatalistic sub-text has surfaced: it is
what makes him something more than a comic playwright.
Richard Garnett's Glyn boasts almost as much well-lubricated charm and
confidence as he thinks he has, and Stephen Mapes is the picture of
flustered good intentions. Colette O'Neill's Laura is nicely ambiguous
between being toughly sensible and just brutally tough, and Sophie Heyman
brings more touching subtleties to poor Maureen than one would think the
role permitted. Terence Booth has a wonderful time with his Mediterranean
restaurant-personnel, all neatly differentiated ' and cleverly employed in
Ayckbourn's plot, too, not mere local colour.
The equally put-upon Gerry and Stephanie seemed to be in safe hands with
Russell Dixon and Karen Drury; but from seat no. D10, more often than not I
saw only the backs of their heads. With a play in which everyone is usually
facing someone else across a fixed table, there are bound to be geographical
problems in a theatre-in-the-round like the Stephen Joseph.
Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, in repertory until July 15.

FT  23 APR 92 / Business Law: Implications of Emu and the Ecu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH CLARK and RICHARD PARLOUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic and political issues arising from economic and monetary union
(Emu) are more readily apparent than the legal ones. This, and the fact that
in the run-up to Maastricht talks were conducted largely in secret, means
there has been little discussion of the legal implications of Emu.
There are various constitutional implications with respect to institutional
reconstruction and so on, but there are also practical banking and
commercial implications arising out of the use of the European Currency Unit
(Ecu).
The Ecu came into being in 1979, together with the European Monetary System
(EMS), with the intention that it should ultimately become the single
European currency in the monetary integration of the Community.
Within the EMS, the Ecu serves as a denominator for the exchange rate
mechanism, a basis for an indication of the divergence of the market rate
from the Ecu's central rate, a unit of account and also a means of
settlement. Although it is not clear whether the Ecu is a currency or not
under the laws of many member states, it has the economic attributes of a
currency.
In practice banks deal between themselves in Ecu as if it were a currency,
and have established a private clearing system in order to avoid having to
break down the Ecu into its constituent currencies. The Bank of England is
setting up a new Ecu payments clearing system for commercial banks. Many
companies use the Ecu for accounting and invoicing purposes, the Ecu is
quoted on exchanges around the world and derivatives have been created based
on the Ecu, Ecu bonds and Ecu interest rates. Many governments and
supranational bodies have now issued Ecu denominated debt. But is the Ecu
money?
The question is important in English law owing to the distinction between
monetary obligations or debt, and other obligations. For example, if a
party's obligation to pay in Ecu is a monetary obligation, a claim can be
made for the face value of that obligation, whereas, if it is not, then a
claim can only be made for the amount of loss proved and the claimant is
under a duty to reduce his loss.
The English courts can grant judgments in a foreign currency (which could
include the Ecu). However, in some cases the courts treat foreign currency
as a commodity and will not treat obligations in respect of it as monetary
obligations with voluntarily adverse consequences.
Similar problems have arisen in the laws of other EC states. Generally,
judicial thinking seems to be moving away from the requirement that legal
tender should be involved in the payment process and moving towards
accepting market practice. Clearly, if the legal tender requirement is
maintained, there is no chance of an obligation in Ecu without a payment
mechanism involving national currency being considered as a monetary
obligation, because the Ecu is not legal tender anywhere.
There is a vital distinction between the official and the private Ecu. The
official Ecu is used within the EMS and is the unit of account used by the
community institutions for payment of levies, duties, grants and other
funds. The official Ecu cannot be reconverted into the national currencies
of which it is composed. It is used for credits and debits between central
banks and for settlement between central banks. The official Ecu has many
characteristics of a currency but, owing to its limited circle of users,
should be considered a quasi-currency.
On the other hand, the private Ecu is a product of the official Ecu, and is
used in commercial transactions. As such, the status of the private Ecu
depends on the form of the contract that is made. The private Ecu can be
reconverted into currencies of EC states.
The ordinary law of contract is applicable to the use of the private Ecu. A
distinction between the two has to be maintained, as the Community has
neither created, nor does it guarantee, the private Ecu. Historically, the
private Ecu could not be used as a currency of payment and, instead, payment
had to be made in the component currencies of the Ecu or in a third
currency. Now, however, payment by bank transfer is rarely a problem.
There is no issuer of private Ecus, no lender of last resort. It is not
legal tender and its supply is not legally organised. Accordingly, the
private Ecu, like the official Ecu, is more a quasi-currency.
The distinction between the official and private Ecu has certain legal
implications. If the official Ecu were ever to be abolished, the private Ecu
would cease to exist in all contracts where the two have been linked.
Accordingly, most agreements specify an alternative currency to be used in
such an eventuality.
The private Ecu has not been issued by any national or international
authority and has no monetary law defining it, or its use. However, national
law cannot be ignored since that may still determine the rights and
obligations of the parties to the contract, including the use and status of
the Ecu.
An agreement expressed in Ecu may in certain circumstances be an exchange
contract, since the Ecu is not the national currency of any state, but a
basket of 12 national currencies. Thus contracts using the private Ecu must
never violate the exchange control regulations of any of the member states
whose currencies are involved.
Although the Ecu has the drawback of being a quasi-currency, this is not the
only stumbling block to its further use. The area of taxation is clearly
fundamental, tax rules requiring taxes to be stated and billed in a given
currency. Governments may not yet allow taxes to be paid in Ecu and there
may be huge problems in relation to capital tax reliefs being calculated in
Ecu.
Another barrier concerns company law. Can corporate capital be expressed and
paid in Ecu? Is borrowing in Ecu allowed? Such issues remain to be
investigated.
Many issues arise in relation to payment in Ecu. If debts are not expressed
in Ecu can creditors argue that they have not been paid, despite having been
paid in Ecu? Can bank notes be denominated in Ecu? Limitations may exist on
buying, holding or selling Ecu in national foreign exchange regulations and
these will have to be removed.
Can claims be made in Ecu, and can judgments be given in Ecu for debts, or
in actions for damages or compensation? If Ecu values have to be converted
into national currencies, questions arise as to which law determines the
conversion rate, which rate should be used and what date should be chosen
for conversion purposes.
The UK objected at Maastricht to the imposition of a single currency and
proposed an alternative evolutionary approach creating a 13th common
currency which would gradually replace the 12 national currencies of the EC.
The UK proposal was not supported by the other EC states, although parts of
it may find their way into the final overall plan.
The UK's denial of the target of the single currency, coupled with the large
divergence in economic performance between EC states, led several of them to
suggest that Emu could be achieved by a core of six or more EC countries
which have significant convergence between their economies. This proposal
would entail the remaining member states joining when they met certain
economic criteria.
This proposal could give rise to different types of Ecu for different
purposes, making a mockery of the idea of the adoption of a single currency
by a single Community.
Rather than Emu, the most likely outcome seems to be gradual monetary
integration. Although the inclusion of dates in the revised treaty is a
welcome gesture of political goodwill, business is still unable to plan in
detail for the changeover to the Ecu, since there is bound to be some
slippage in dates. Nevertheless, business is in a better position to
quantify the likely impact of Emu, and evaluate potential problems, after
Maastricht.

<TEXT>
This time last year, the unsalubrious Parisian suburb of Cergy was the scene
of a particularly nasty race riot, in which gangs of youths turned the town
centre into a battlefield. Yesterday, it became a battlefield of a different
kind when FNAC opened its newest store in the Cergy shopping centre.
FNAC is already France's biggest single record retailer and the Cergy store
forms part of its FFr1.3bn (Pounds 130m) expansion programme. The store is
also FNAC's latest weapon in its bitter battle against Virgin, the ambitious
British retailer which is now FNAC's closest competitor on its traditional
French terrain.
For decades, FNAC had enjoyed an apparently effortless dominance over the
French market for records, cassettes, videos and books, or 'cultural
retailing' as the French like to call it. But three years ago, Virgin
arrived in France and, far from shying away from a battle, showed every sign
of spoiling for a fight.
Virgin went straight for the jugular. It opened its first French megastore
in the heart of Paris, on the Champs Elysee. The store, set in a lavishly
renovated banking hall, was not only the world's biggest record shop but its
sales space was larger than all FNAC's Parisian stores put together.
The Champs Elysee store has been an undoubted success with sales of FFr500m
in its first year. Emboldened by its experience, Virgin ventured into the
French provinces in 1990 by opening two new megastores - in the same opulent
style as the Paris store - in Bordeaux and Marseilles.
FNAC has fought back. The French press, which has followed the fight with
even more than its usual bloodlust, is packed with accounts of the latest
spat between Jean-Louis Petriat, the bow-tied chairman of FNAC, and Patrick
Zelnick, his laid-back counterpart at Virgin France who, true to the Branson
tradition, does not wear a tie at all.
Petriat has stopped at nothing in the fight against Virgin from reputedly
putting pressure on its minority shareholders to withdraw their support, to
slashing prices - reportedly by as much as 30 per cent - at FNAC's Parisian
stores.
FNAC has also tried to play its competitor at its own game by opening its
own megastore, 'La Cathedrale', in the old Grand Bazar department store on
Avenue de Ternes to the north of the Champs Elysee. La Cathedrale, which
opened last November with a bill of FFr10m, is as opulent as anything Virgin
could conceive with its 8,000sq metres of sales space spread over five
floors around an 18 metre high post-industrial Colonne du Savoir, (column of
knowledge), bearing no fewer than 17 video screens.
La Cathedrale is the linchpin of the FFr1.3bn expansion plan with which FNAC
plans to double its French floorspace by the end of next year. There will be
nine store openings this year, of which Cergy was the first.
So far FNAC appears to have the advantage over Virgin. It is, after all, the
bigger of the two businesses with 36 stores to Virgin France's three and
turnover of FFr7.4bn in the last full financial year, compared with the
interloper's FFr840m. Moreover, although the cost of the expansion plan is
believed to be depressing FNAC's profits, Virgin, which has been far less
successful in the provinces than in Paris, is thought to be losing money in
France.
Virgin has, characteristically, turned this comparative weakness to its
advantage. Zelnick has been careful to cast his company as a groovy young
David and FNAC as a staid old Goliath. One of his most successful ploys has
been Virgin's campaign against France's strict Sunday trading laws. The
campaign has already cost Virgin several hundred thousand francs in fines,
but has also produced pages of free publicity and the prospect of a
government inquiry into the issue.
Moreover Virgin no longer looks quite so puny in its David guise. For a time
last autumn, it looked as though the Virgin group, which was under pressure
in other areas of activity, might have to give up the fight against FNAC.
Zelnick confirmed to the French press in November that he was considering
bringing in a new minority investor to provide additional capital. Petriat
smugly announced that FNAC might deign to invest.
Times have changed. Last month, Branson sold Virgin Music, his original
record company, to Thorn EMI for Pounds 510m. Most of the money will be
pumped into his airline, but there should be some left for his pugilistic
megastores in France. The battle between FNAC and Virgin seems set to go on
 -and on.

FT  23 APR 92 / Technology: Iranians build their own software house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN BARRACLOUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Islamic Republic of Iran is hardly the most natural setting for
cutting-edge computer software development. But if your language is rarely
spoken beyond native shores and the US has refused to trade openly with you
for a decade, you have little choice but to do the work yourself.
Pajoohesh, a systems design company in Teheran, has developed a
comprehensive Persian language environment to support any well-known word
processing or accounting package.
Four years' development has produced an impressive array of tools, from an
English-Persian dictionary with a choice of 20 different technical
vocabularies, to accounting and graphics programs. Each package comes with a
one-touch switch from English to Persian script and back.
While Iran's software industry is still embryonic, prospects for expansion
look good. Iran's private sector is overcoming its initial reluctance to
computerise and is showing interest in the new software. 'It's a very young
market but it has been growing steadily,' said Kaveh Salehi, technical
manager at the Teheran Computer Centre.
Five main operators compete in a country-wide market estimated at Rials 10bn
(Pounds 4m). Ebrahim Kojouri, of Pajoohesh, predicts the size of the market
will quadruple during this coming Iranian year (March 1992-March 1993). 'We
have so many orders that we may not be able to fill them all,' he said.
Prices of Pajoohesh's products range from Rials 80,000 (Pounds 32) for the
dictionary to a full English-Persian office organiser at Rials 250,000.
But the company's proudest achievement is a CD-Rom containing the entire
Koran in sight and sound. Using an IBM scanner and voice card, which the
company also sells, Pajoohesh has linked a taped rendition of the Koran sung
in Arabic with a full-colour graphic of the decorated text. By adding a
Persian translation with an authentic mullah's lilt, the user can choose a
chapter and verse from any part of the full 48 hours.
The company has also incorporated the voice card into its dictionary
package. Designed for Iranians doing business overseas, it will pronounce
(with an American accent) a word typed in English and give a full definition
in Persian. A facility is also available for word processing packages which
offers a Persian definition for any highlighted word.
The fledgling industry has so far been plagued by pirates. Iran has no
copyright laws and many packages are copied and distributed without licence
within a purchasing company.
Illicit operators also copy unprotected software, undercutting the
developers' costs and selling cheaply to the end-user.
Some companies have suggested a copyright law to the government but few
believe it could be effectively enforced.
At the moment the computer culture is almost non-existent in Iran. Imported
hardware is prohibitively expensive for private individuals, though
lucrative for importers who can exploit a healthy free market rate for the
Rial. The country's pri-vate sector is still experimenting with
computerisation and the biggest buyer by far is the Iranian government.
But Teheran-based Maskan Bank recently invested Rials 7m in Persian software
and other banks are likely to follow suit. Many young Iranians are exposed
to computers at university and most emerge computer literate. As they take
jobs in Iranian companies, they are expected to demand modern computer
facilities.
Most software researchers receive initial instruction abroad or at Teheran's
Institute of Technology but their research techniques are self-taught. While
Pajoohesh's research has been innovative, future development will be slow
without the resources of a foreign backer.
To complement its Persian-English software, the company is planning a
CD-format introduction to Iran aimed at foreign businessmen, combining
10,000 photographs with a spoken commentary.
Pajoohesh and other Iranian computer companies are on show until April 26 at
the second Electricity, Electronics, Computer and Communications Fair in
Teheran.

FT  23 APR 92 / Technology: Spotlight on flash memory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the launch today of a new generation of 'flash memory' chip products,
Intel, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, has delivered the first
serious challenge to the role of the magnetic disc drive as the standard
data storage medium for personal computers.
Flash memory retains stored information even when the power is turned off.
It can be rapidly erased and rewritten, hence the name 'flash'.
After five years of development efforts, Intel has come up with a flash chip
that rivals the data storage capacity of a computer 'hard drive' at a
comparable cost.
The new 8 Mbit flash memory chip quadruples the data storage capacity of
flash memory chips introduced just 16 months ago. Twenty of the chips,
packaged in a 'memory card' not much bigger than a credit card, provide a 20
Mbyte storage device that is much smaller, lighter, more rugged and faster
than a disc drive.
The flash memory card also consumes far less power, thus promising to extend
the battery life of portable computers. The 20 Mbyte card will sell for
Dollars 600, less than half the introductory price of Intel's 4 Mbyte flash
card in 1990.
In conjunction with the Intel announcement, Microsoft, the leading personal
computer software company, will announce an extension to its Dos operating
system to work with the new memory cards.
Intel expects to sell 500,000 to 700,000 of the 8 M bit flash memory chips
this year and claims to have more than 20 customers lined up, including some
of the largest US and Japanese portable personal computer manufacturers.
The market for flash memory chips is projected to grow from approximately
Dollars 130m today to nearly Dollars 1.5bn by 1995, according to Dataquest,
the US market researchers.
Intel currently holds an estimated 85 per cent share of the flash memory
market. Products incorporating the new flash memory cards, ranging from
hand-held 'pen computers' costing less than Dollars 1,000, to lightweight
two-pound notebook computers priced at around Dollars 1,500, are expected
from several computer manufacturers later this year.

FT  23 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Standards task force takes criticism on
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASNOST and perestroika have reached one of the more obscure outposts of
the Accounting Standards Board. After just over a year of operation, members
of its Urgent Issues Task Force - which interprets and clarifies existing
accounting standards - are responding to criticism of the way they conduct
business.
To those who have not heard of it, and particularly those who are familiar
with the cumbersome recent history of the development of accounting
standards, the concept of an urgent issues task force sounds like a
contradiction in terms.
To the growing number that do know it, the task force has been the subject
of considerable grumbling behind closed doors. Even its more benign critics
question whether either its operation is urgent, or whether the topics it
tackles are urgent issues.
The task force has its origins in the 1988 Dearing Report, the basis for the
new system of accounting regulation. It called for a 'capability of high
standing' to provide expert guidance when emerging accounting topics arise.
It would act more quickly than the process for setting new standards, and
its guidance would not have the same status. But it would have the support
of the professional bodies.
When it was finally launched in March 1991, its main role was defined as
seeking a 'consensus' on existing accounting standards or Companies Act
provisions that are subject to unsatisfactory or conflicting
interpretations. It may also advise the board on new developments in
financial reporting.
Four of the 16 task force members must be drawn from industry and commerce
and nine from accounting firms. (Five currently come from the private sector
outside the firms.) At least 11 of the members must be present for a quorum,
and only two can vote against and still allow the consensus to be passed.
The task force has produced three consensuses since its creation - dealing
with the treatment of supplemental interest or premium on convertible bonds,
the disclosure of restructuring costs, and goodwill on disposal of a
business.
It has also announced work on a further four issues now under discussion:
transfers from current to fixed assets, post-retirement benefits other than
pensions, presentation of long-term debtors in current assets, and low-start
finance. The first of these is likely to generate a consensus at the next
meeting in May.
As the pronouncements have emerged, so have the complaints. Most have come
from companies affected by the rulings, and relate to the short space of
time between the announcement of an issue, a decision by the task force and
its implementation date.
The final straw appears to have been the consensus on goodwill, published on
December 19 and, in effect, for accounting periods ending on or after
January 23. The deadline caused anguish among a number of businesses
preparing their year-end accounts, including Marks &amp; Spencer.
The first signs that the criticism of the task force had had some effect
came during March, with a new format 'information sheet' listing the dates
of future meetings and details of the issues to be discussed. A second sheet
just circulated lists the progress achieved in the March meeting, and
preliminary conclusions on its forthcoming asset transfers consensus.
It has also advertised in an effort to boost its mailing list - which
already numbers 3,000 and includes the finance directors of all listed
companies - to include others such as large private companies.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the task force as well as the Accounting
Standards Board, said last week that he had decided to introduce a greater
degree of democracy into the proceedings. In future, the task force will
make its rulings public, allow discussion and then ratify or modify the
consensus when it next meets.
'People have felt they haven't quite understood what's happening,' he says.
'This gives them a chance to comment, and to tell us if they think we're
going down the wrong track.'
Nevertheless, he rules out issuing formal exposure drafts which are opened
to wide-ranging consultation - the approach taken by the board as it draws
up its new financial reporting standards. 'We want to keep the urgency,' he
says.
Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of Prudential, and previously a critic
of the task force, welcomes the changes as a mark of its willingness to
respond to comments. 'The way they operated in the past, producing rabbits
out of hats, was not good,' he says. 'They cannot pretend to know it all.'
The accusations of excess haste have raised eyebrows among some members of
the task force, who see its discussions becoming more protracted in line
with those of the ASB. 'Moving too quickly?' says one. 'I think it's rather
slow. The ASB can't move at the pace necessary to really sort out people
playing fast and loose with the rules.'
On the other hand, a lawyer who has been following the task force says: 'If
a company is going to be taken to task, you've got to be sure you are on the
right ground, however august your membership. Where speed is of the essence,
you may miss something.'
So far, it is unclear whether any company has defied a task force consensus.
No case is believed to have been referred to the financial reporting review
panel for action. But the lawyer suggests that money is 'almost inevitably'
going to be spent in the courts at some stage. While a consensus has less
status than a new standard, task force rulings become part of accounting
practice and may be subject to challenge.
Judging from the references to pronouncements which are now appearing in
interim and finals statements, a number of companies are beginning to take
the task force seriously.
Not all are compliant. The second consensus - that restructuring costs
should normally be treated as exceptional items - has been ignored by ICI
and Unilever, which retained as extraordinary items provisions made in their
1990 accounts.
The two companies have not re-stated the amounts as exceptional in their
1991 accounts, although, in accordance with the guideline, Unilever has
provided additional information to justify its net Pounds 195m cost as
extraordinary, as part of a programme of one-off restructuring driven by the
requirements of the single European market.
The incident has highlighted the task force's inability to do anything more
than clarify current accounting standards. The existing ambiguities and
loopholes are not always being closed by its consensuses. Its next ruling -
on transfers from current to fixed assets - is likely to be an equally
important and controversial testing ground.
Even so, one technical partner in a big accountancy firm is unimpressed by
the changes taking place. He suggests that the ASB is holding on to the most
important accounting issues for itself, so stretching its agenda many years
into the future while leaving only the more obscure topics to the task
force. 'They tend to deal with issues they know they're going to get
consensus on,' he says. 'They are not exactly taking on the hot topics.'
It may a long time before a comprehensive framework of ASB standards has
been put in place. In the meantime, the task force still needs to prove
itself able to operate effectively, plugging the loopholes which emerge. Its
authority and ability to resist defiance may be tested rather more quickly.

THE NETHERLANDS deputy trade minister Yvonne van Rooy is due to arrive in
Vietnam today as head of the first high-level Dutch trade mission to visit
this south-east Asian nation, the government said yesterday, AP reports from
The Hague.
Ms Van Rooy takes with her representatives from about 50 companies in the
agricultural, construction, chemical and banking sectors, according to a
ministry statement.
The delegation will travel to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City during the
seven-day visit, the statement added.
'The aim of the mission is to intensify bilateral economic relations and
strengthen the position of Dutch trade and investment companies in Vietnam,'
it went on.
The Netherlands and other western countries have shown growing interest
recently in doing business in Vietnam as a consequence of Hanoi's free
market reforms and indications that the US trade embargo will be lifted
fairly soon.
In 1990, Vietnam, a nation of 64m people, relied on communist countries for
85 per cent of its imports.
The Dutch trade mission is being added on to the start of a visit to
Indonesia, a former Dutch colony, scheduled to begin April 30.
Ms Van Rooy has appointments with the Vietnamese ministers for trade and
tourism, transport and communications and agriculture.
A meeting is also planned with the chairmen of the state planning and
investment committees.

Russia has offered to sell South Korea advanced nuclear technology,

nuclear expert said yesterday, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'We can provide many advanced technologies for lower fees than the western
countries,' Mr Nikolai N. Ponomarev Stepnoi, president of the Russian
Nuclear Society, said. Mr Stepnoi was in Seoul as a guest speaker at the
seventh annual meeting of the Korea Atomic Industrial Forum and the Korea
Nuclear Society. He also met South Korean officials, including
Energy-Resources Minister Jin Nyum.
Mr Stepnoi said he had offered to sell technology or conduct joint research
with South Korea on certain projects, including extension of the life of
nuclear power plants, and that South Korean officials responded favourably.
'We can expect to make substantial achievements before long,' Mr Stepnoi
said.
South Korea relies heavily on nuclear power, obtaining nearly 50 per cent of
its electricity from nine nuclear power plants. Two more plants are being
built and several more are to be added by the year 2000. No Russian
technology has been used in any South Korean plants so far. Eight used US,
and the other three, French and Canadian technology.

This year, about Dollars 9bn of assets will be handed over to Czechs and
Slovaks against government-issued coupons, making some 8.5m citizens

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru has announced a 12-month timetable for
the restoration of democracy, in an attempt to stave off international
economic sanctions against his military-backed government.
Mr Fujimori, who closed Congress and suspended the judiciary on April 5,
said parliamentary elections would be held next February. In his speech,
broadcast on Tuesday night, the president said he would hold a referendum on
July 5 to obtain an endorsement for his 'emergency government'.
Amendments to the constitution would be announced at the end of August, and
these would be put to another vote in November.
Mr Fujimori said it was not his intention to install a dictatorship, but to
build a 'new, more efficient democracy'. He has pledged to rid Peru of
corruption and drug trafficking, and to end a 12-year guerrilla campaign
that has claimed more than 23,000 lives, mainly civilian.
There was no immediate reaction from a delegation of the Organisation of
American States (OAS) that arrived in Lima this week to press Mr Fujimori to
restore constitutional rule. But the president's speech was clearly timed to
impress the visiting diplomats.
At home, Mr Fujimori is now struggling to maintain business confidence
following the resignation of Mr Carlos Bolona, the finance minister.
Mr Bolona was regarded as the key cabinet minister who could have maintained
links between Peru and the international financial community.
The Lima stock exchange plunged on the news of the resignation. Mr Augusto
Blacker Miller, the foreign minister, is expected to take over the finance
portfolio.
Meanwhile, Mr Maximo San Roman, the former vice-president, has been sworn in
as president by the dismissed Congress. He said he would establish a new
government and asked for support. Mr San Roman claimed he had the backing of
high-ranking military leaders, but on Monday the armed forces issued a
communique reaffirming their allegiance to Mr Fujimori.
About 400 rival supporters of Mr Fujimori and Mr San Roman scuffled in front
of the hotel where the OAS delegation was meeting separately with government
and opposition representatives.

MR David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, yesterday abandoned his
quest for the Republican party's presidential nomination this year.
Mr Duke's campaign has effectively been moribund since the Super Tuesday
primaries early in March, when his appeal to white southerners produced only
a minimal response. In the primaries he had won no delegates.
He complained yesterday he had been kept off the ballot in many states,
which he said was more worthy of the former Soviet Union than the US.
Six months ago, after finishing a respectable second in the contest for the
governorship of his home state, Louisiana, Mr Duke was seen as a potentially
disruptive political force. In the event, having decided to run as a
Republican, the party's right wing preferred Mr Pat Buchanan, the
conservative polemicist, to Mr Duke's more explicit racist and
anti-homosexual arguments.
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Paul Tsongas, still
second to Mr Bill Clinton in accumulating Democratic party delegates,
suffered a previously unrevealed recurrence of cancer in 1987. Mr Tsongas
had retired as senator from Massachusetts because of cancer and in his
campaign had made much of his recovery from the disease.
He said he did not recall the results of a biopsy taken in 1987 beyond that
his doctors were divided over its outcome. Extra radiation treatments then
given were preventative, he added. Doctors interviewed by the newspaper were
divided over the dangers of a further recurrence over the next few years.

FT  23 APR 92 / IMF laces growth projections with caution: World Economic
Outlook warns governments of need to cut budget deficits after recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund's latest growth forecasts for the world
economy are laced with caution, as befits an organisation that has knocked
1.3 percentage points off the 1992 global growth forecast it made only last
October.
But the Fund believes there are several positive factors to justify its
projections of slow growth this year and accelerating activity in 1993 that
are detailed in the accompanying table.
Inflation has been generally low and falling, in contrast to the recessions
of 1974-75 and 1980-82. This has allowed a substantial reduction of
short-term interest rates in North America, the UK and Japan.
Large disturbances from the commodity markets have been notable by their
absence.
Factors that caused last year's weaker-than-expected activity are either no
longer at work or are diminishing. The economic effects of the Gulf war have
dissipated while households and businesses have reduced their high levels of
debt.
Developing countries are improving their economic performance.
On the other hand, the IMF acknowledges that the projected recovery in
industrial country growth to 1.8 per cent this year from 0.8 per cent in
1991 is lacklustre.
Growth has been held back by worsening consumer confidence in most
industrial countries; increased taxation and high interest rates in Germany,
which have resulted in high interest rates elsewhere in Europe; and reduced
spending on business investment in Japan. These negative factors continue to
cast doubt over the prospects for recovery.
approved of the way governments have allowed their budgets to move into
deficit to counter falling economic activity. Similarly, countries such as
Canada, the US and Britain, which have suffered recession, or Japan, where
activity has slowed, have been right to lower interest rates.
But its latest World Economic Outlook warns that governments must not lose
sight of their medium-term objectives of sustainable growth and price
stability. They must therefore be prepared to cut budget deficits when
growth recovers - and then keep tight control over government spending - and
be ready to tighten monetary policy in case inflationary pressures revive.
The need for governments to cut fiscal deficits is one of the main messages
of the Outlook. The IMF takes an especially tough line in the case of
Germany which, it says, should speed its fiscal consolidation plans.
The large fiscal deficit that emerged in the course of unification initially
provided considerable stimulus to activity in Germany and its partners, it
says. But growth in Europe is now being constrained by the high interest
rates required to deal with the resulting inflationary pressures in Germany.
The Fund is less harsh on the US, which has had a large budget deficit for
the past decade.
It regrets that the US and Italy failed to consolidate their budgetary
positions during the period of strong growth in the 1980s and urges the US
to use growth in the 1990s to cut its deficit. Any discretionary fiscal
action by the US should be limited to revenue-neutral tax and public
spending reforms that would increase efficiency.
In the case of Japan, which is expected to come under pressure from its
Group of Seven partners to bring forward public spending, the IMF says
'there is no evident case for a shift in fiscal policy'.
It is in the medium term that fiscal consolidation would yield most
benefits, the IMF believes.
In the case of the US, a credible package of measures to reduce the deficit
would boost confidence and demand.
The IMF also urges the industrialised countries to make greater efforts to
correct other important medium-term structural problems.
'In all the major countries, substantial steps are required to liberalise
agricultural trade and reduce domestic support,' it says.
In addition, tax policies, particularly in the US, should be overhauled to
improve the allocation of savings and investments.
Europe's high unemployment points to a need for labour-market reform. The
IMF says Japan requires further financial deregulation and reform of
competition policy and land management. Germany, meanwhile, must reduce
rigidities in its economy, particularly in the industrial and services
sectors, and make 'long overdue' cuts in subsidies.

THE International Finance Corporation, the private sector investment arm of
the World Bank, has overhauled its management structures to cope with the
arrival of members from the Eastern bloc, as well as with a Dollars 1bn
increase in its capital to Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.29bn), writes George
Graham.
Sir William Ryrie, executive vice-president, said the reorganised IFC would
include five restructured regional departments as well as new specialist
departments covering oil, gas and mining; chemicals and petrochemicals;
infrastructure investment; agribusiness; and corporate finance services.
The IFC specialises in providing equity and loan financing at market terms
to private-sector companies in developing countries.
Mr Richard Frank remains vice-president in charge of planning. Mr Daniel
Adams will be in charge of work on the financial sector.

FT  23 APR 92 / Grim prognosis on UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is expected to experience below average growth as it emerges from
recession, the International Monetary Fund reported yesterday, writes Peter
Norman.
The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook predicts that the UK will have the
slowest growth rate of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries this
year. The 0.8 per cent increase in GDP projected for 1992 compares with an
average growth of 1.8 per cent forecast for all industrialised countries and
the Treasury's March Budget forecast of 1 per cent growth in the UK.
Growth in Britain will quicken as the year progresses, with GDP projected to
be 2.1 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of this year, compared with the
final quarter of 1991. But the 3.1 per cent growth rate forecast by the IMF
for 1993 will also be below the 3.3 per cent average forecast for the
industrial nations next year.
Elaborating on the projections, Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's
research department, said that UK output growth in the opening quarter of
this year was close to zero and might have been 'slightly negative'. But a
modest recovery should be beginning 'right about now'.
He noted that high German interest rates effectively put a floor under UK
base rates at 10.5 per cent. But the UK government had allowed the automatic
fiscal stabilisers to work and had taken additional discretionary action in
last November's Autumn Statement and March Budget.
The IMF thought that these actions were 'probably appropriate' even though
it now expected the UK's general government deficit to expand to 5.7 per
cent of GDP by 1993, from 5.1 per cent in 1992 and 2.3 per cent last year.

FT  23 APR 92 / Iraq launches attack on rebels' marsh stronghold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ has launched a heavy offensive against Shia rebels in the country's
southern marshlands, Iraqi opposition groups claimed yesterday.
Troops backed by tanks and artillery have launched a three-pronged attack in
the marshes, killing or wounding hundreds, the Iran-based Supreme Council
for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said.
Iraqi opposition groups in London said three Iraqi divisions have been
employed in the offensive since April 15, the third attack reported by rebel
groups in the south since March.
Fighting is said to have centred on Basra, Amara and Nasiriyah - centres of
Shia Moslem revolt crushed by Iraqi troops a year ago.
The attack follows sporadic shelling of Kurdish towns in northern Iraq and
intensified concern in London, Washington and Paris about an Iraqi military
build up north of the protected 36th parallel.
Iraqi troops are reported to have begun draining large areas of marshland to
establish a presence there, after having airdropped leaflets to the
thousands of Shia sheltering in the marshes, offering them financial rewards
to come out of hiding.

FT  23 APR 92 / Assad seeks to retrieve Arab dignity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hafez al-Assad of Syria rarely strays far from his Damascus
citadel and is not an enthusiastic traveller. His tour of all six Gulf
Co-operation Council states this week was a measure therefore of his
apparent determination to assert leadership in dealing with the latest
crisis to befall the Arabs.
While initial reports suggested that Mr Assad was seeking to bolster Arab
support for Libya in its confrontation with the west, it seems that the wily
Syrian leader had a much broader purpose.
A western official in Damascus observed yesterday that Mr Assad's mission to
the Gulf was designed to deliver a message to his brother Arabs that Arab
dignity was being demeaned by the west's handling of the Libyan crisis, and
that only by presenting a united front would the Arabs salvage credit for
their future dealings with powerful western states.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syria has been obliged reluctantly to
accommodate itself to a so-called new world order and the reality of US
predominance in the Middle East, but Mr Assad is likely to have argued in
his talks with Gulf rulers that Arab solidarity was the best response to
western pressures.
In Cairo, where Mr Assad's tour of Gulf capitals is being observed with more
than passing interest, an Egyptian foreign ministry official said the Syrian
president's aim was to 'rally support' to try to ensure that the Arab
consensus as embodied in the resolutions of the Arab League would be
respected by the international community.
The Syrian leader is certain to have argued, with his eyes firmly on the
peace process, that Arab weakness and disarray was not a sound basis from
which to engage in delicate Arab-Israel negotiations.
Damascus, which has shunned multilateral talks involving Israel and the
Arabs including Gulf states, believes that simply by engaging in such talks
Arab states were handing Israel a diplomatic windfall without gaining
anything in return, since the Israeli government has given no sign it might
trade land for peace in bilateral negotiations with its neighbours.
Mr Assad's other goal, according to officials in Damascus, was to remind
Gulf rulers of their commitment to the Damascus Declaration signed in March,
1991 a few days after the end of the Gulf war. The Gulf states plus Egypt
and Syria agreed to co-operate in defence and other fields, but
implementation of the agreement has been stalled by Gulf hesitancy on the
issue of the stationing of Egypt and Syrian troops in the region to ensure
regional security.
Syria was extremely disappointed when a meeting of the Damascus Declaration
group scheduled for last month in Qatar was postponed until May.
Interestingly, Egypt has also been expressing frustration over delays. Its
foreign minister, Mr Amr Moussa, said yesterday: 'Egypt, which refuses any
amendments to the defence agreement, feels that the accord will become
extinct if it is not immediately implemented.'

FT  23 APR 92 / Pakistan to seek Dollars 2.4bn aid deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pakistani government will seek Dollars 2.4bn in fresh assistance from
members of Aid to Pakistan consortium, which begins its meeting in Paris
today.
Despite economic pressures caused by a drop in international prices for
cotton and yarn, and last year's rise in the oil import bill after the Gulf
War, Pakistan, in presenting its case, is expected to highlight signs of
economic growth.
According to official estimates, the projected growth rate for 1991/92 is
6.5 per cent, exports have risen by 13 per cent and inflation has declined
from 12.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent. Among the country's major liabilities
during the year ahead, debt servicing alone would account for Dollars 1.5bn
which would absorb a major portion of commitments made in Paris.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, who is leading the Pakistani
delegation, said before his departure there were good prospects of obtaining
this amount of aid. Pakistan would present plans for a social action
programme to improve the status of the poor, and a new environmental
strategy. 'The social action programme is the second wheel of our
development strategy, one being accelerated growth and investment through
privatisation and deregulation, the other being a very strong social action
programme,' added Mr Aziz.
Western economists and government sources say the programme has been
prepared in response to concerns from donors, some of whom want Pakistan to
double its spending in the social sectors from the current level of between
3 to 4 per cent of GDP. The environmental strategy has also come in response
to concerns over continued deforestation and soil erosion, resulting from an
annual population growth rate of 3.3 per cent and inadequate resource
allocations for these sectors.
Among other concerns, western donors are expected to examine the country's
large defence spending, which absorbs almost a third of the budget.
Officials say the issue remains sensitive, because of continuing tensions
with India, and due to resistance from the politically influential army.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA and Indonesia yesterday signed three economic and political
agreements and tried to play down a clash over East Timor.
The agreements on fisheries, double taxation and extradition were signed on
the second day of the visit to Indonesia by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian
prime minister. They represented, Mr Keating said, evidence of Australia's
determination to look towards Asia for its economic future.
Both countries sought to defuse any 'misunderstanding' about statements by
President Suharto at a banquet the previous night that Indonesia would not
accept foreign interference in its domestic affairs.
Earlier, at a meeting with Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister, Mr
Keating had suggested that East Timor, the former Portuguese territory
annexed by Indonesia in 1976, should be given special territory status. He
also expressed concern at the prosecution of East Timorese nationalists.
Mr Alatas said yesterday that President Suharto's remarks had been
misinterpreted. 'What he (President Suharto) was trying to say was, 'Don't
misunderstand us. We do accept criticism, we do accept friendly advice.'
Mr Keating told the Indonesian Foreign Policy Forum yesterday that said East
Timor had received 'disproportionate attention'. 'Australia is actively and
unequivocally committed to this region and to developing, in particular, a
relationship with Indonesia,' he said. Officials from the two countries
agreed, however, that their future relationship was unlikely to be smooth.
Mr Alatas said: 'Let's face it. We have differences .. in the political
system, economic system, differences in culture.' Pacific trade bloc, Page 8

FT  23 APR 92 / Hanoi offers all help in hunt for missing GIs: US derided
for movie-driven fixation with unknown fate of servicemen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DO MUOI, general secretary of Vietnam's ruling communist party, yesterday
issued a challenge which Washington will find hard to resist if it wishes to
avoid courting further international ridicule for its fixation with US
servicemen missing from the Vietnam war.
Vietnam, the communist party chief told a group of visiting US senators in
Hanoi, would provide whatever help was needed to assist the hunt. Pressing
home the point, he asked them three times to say precisely what they wanted
so it could not be said that Vietnam had failed to co-operate.
This week the six Americans staffing the MiA (missing in action) office in
Hanoi - up a staircase with a stained carpet in the Boss Hotel - were joined
in Vietnam by the five senators from a select committee on PoW/MiA affairs
and by 58 investigators who will conduct the latest in a series of
month-long searches for living US prisoners and the remains of US
servicemen.
The US also maintains offices in Hawaii, Bangkok, Phnom Penh and Vientiane
to conduct and co-ordinate the hunt. Vietnam, desperate to persuade
Washington to lift an economic embargo which deprives it of funds from the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank,
says it has spent half a million man hours on the hunt for MiAs in the past
four years.
Vietnamese officials and American businessmen anxious to start work in
Vietnam are unable to contain their frustration at the US administration's
refusal to lift the embargo. Few senior American officials believe there are
really any living US captives in Indochina, and they admit in private that
their policies are driven by popular fantasies stoked by the film industry
rather than by hard evidence.
Detailed investigations more than a decade ago found no proof that any
living Americans had been left behind after the war's end in 1975, one US
official involved in the search said, 'but the public perception has
changed, and public perception does drive government policy'.
Senator John Kerry, chairman of the select committee, said as much himself
this week when he told a news conference in Phnom Penh that 'politics is
perception' and cited a public opinion poll showing that two thirds of
Americans think their fellow countrymen may still be held against their will
in Indochina.
The US administration lifted a ban on direct telecommunications between the
US and Vietnam a week ago, but has linked the full restoration of relations
to a 'road map' of conditions which embraces not just the MiA issue but the
successful implementation of a peace accord in Cambodia.
US presidential candidates have shown no inclination to alienate voters by
following Brown, whose medals are displayed in the 'Exhibition House of
Aggressive War Crimes' in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) with the message: 'To
the people of a united Vietnam. I was wrong. I am sorry.'
For Vietnam, the worst aspect of the embargo under the Trading with the
Enemy Act is the US veto on aid from the multilateral institutions, which
could help the country develop its meagre infrastructure and finance
economic reforms.
Vietnam is also prohibited from buying US equipment, such as aircraft,
although Coca-Cola imported from neighbouring countries or smuggled through
Cambodia is freely available and businessmen say Vietnamese-made garments
with Korean or Taiwanese labels are exported to the US.
The US is derided by Vietnamese and expatriates alike for its obsession with
'captive' MiAs, but US investigators insist that economic pressure has made
the Vietnamese more forthcoming in locating remains and that the Vietnamese
authorities could do still more to assist the search. At the centre of the
dispute is the unknown fate of 135 of the 2,266 missing Americans, because
many of the rest are known to have died at sea or in the air or been
obliterated in landmine explosions.
US officials speak of differences between hardliners and liberals among
Vietnamese communist officials over how to respond to US demands for
information, and say there is forensic evidence that some of the remains
returned to the US had been stored above ground for a time - and therefore
could have been handed over sooner.
On the Vietnamese side the one positive effect of the embargo, according to
Vietnamese officials and foreign businessmen and diplomats, is that it has
forced Hanoi to enforce strict financial discipline and make its way in the
world without the easy credit which has been the ruin of many a developing
country.
The government, however, is openly resentful of the US refusal to restore
ties when Vietnam has withdrawn from Cambodia and provided assistance in the
search for MiAs, as demanded by the US 'road-map'. The Vietnamese think the
Americans are still sore because they lost the war.
'If we declare war with the US today and say we are defeated tomorrow, then
the embargo would be lifted,' was the sarcastic comment of Mr Le Bang, who
heads the Americas department at the foreign ministry. 'The MiA issue is not
really the fault of Vietnam or the US government but of the Vietnam
syndrome.'

FT  23 APR 92 / Swiss ponder their franc and splendid isolation: Ian Rodger
examines the intensifying debate over moves for greater co-operation within
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE dates for Swiss decisions on joining the European Economic Area (EEA)
and the European Community (EC) draw nearer, it appears that monetary policy
and the future of the Swiss franc will be at the centre of the public debate
on whether to end 700 years of splendid isolation.
In the past few months, the economic pain caused throughout Europe by the
German Bundesbank's severe monetary policy has given the Swiss a
demonstration of the negative effects of belonging to a pan-European
monetary system.
While the Swiss franc does not participate formally in the European Monetary
System (EMS), the Swiss National Bank (SNB) tries to keep the currency
stable, especially in relation to the D-Mark. This is partly to maintain the
franc's image as a stable haven currency and to keep in step with the
European trend.
But the central bank's main responsibility is to set an appropriate monetary
policy for the domestic economy, which has been in recession for more than a
year. It has been easing money supply for some time to help stimulate a
recovery and in December had the audacity not to follow the Bundesbank's 0.5
per cent official interest rate rise.
However, foreign exchange traders early last month decided that the bank
could not have it both ways. In a few hectic trading sessions, they drove
the franc down about 3 per cent against the mark. The bank, wearing its
European-solidarity hat, chose to intervene, but, in doing so, pushed up
short-term interest rates to levels that threaten to prolong the domestic
recession and drive up politically sensitive mortgage interest rates.
For the anti-EC forces, the message was that policies set by a distant
authority - in this case the Bundesbank - are often inappropriate for local
conditions. Therefore, it is better to keep one's distance, not just from
the EMS, but also from the EEA and the EC.
For the pro-Europeans, the events were merely part of an inevitable process
of bringing Swiss interest rates, which have been traditionally lower than
those in Germany, into line. They argue that, because the Swiss economy
performs at virtually the same pace as the German one, the country has
little to fear and much to gain from moving towards currency union.
The debate, which has been rumbling beneath the surface for some time, burst
into public view late last month when one of the leading Swiss economic
forecasting institutes, the Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF), openly
proposed pegging the franc to the mark. The institute painted a gloomy
picture of slow recovery for the Swiss economy, hindered by, among other
things, uncertainty over the outcome and economic impact of imminent
decisions on the country's integration into Europe. It said that, in this
'special situation', the bank should declare a floor mark exchange rate for
the franc at about SFr0.91 to stabilise expectations for the currency.
Mr Thomas Hess of KOF said the alternative of letting the franc float was
too risky: one could not predict how far it would fall, and franc interest
rates might continue to rise anyway.
The view found support in another institute, the Basle Economic Cycle
Research Group (BAK). Mr Urs Muller, vice-president, argued that Switzerland
had little to fear from convergence since its productivity was probably
closer to that of Germany's than other European countries'.
This was denounced as heresy along Zurich's Banhofstrasse, where gnomes have
long prospered on the mystique surrounding the franc: pegging it to the mark
would remove its raison d'etre.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust and a former central bank
official, said that the franc's decline was merely a reflection of the
ever-strengthening mark rather than an indication of real weakness. 'The
depreciation of the Swiss franc is absolutely in line with what you would
expect at this time,' he said.
He was unconcerned about a devaluation: 'Credibility is the result of an
evaluation of policy over many years. Nobody is going to change his view on
the basis of a single move.'
Other bankers agreed. 'It was not so long ago that the franc was under one
mark in value,' one private banker said. 'It is too strong now anyway.'
Another said that the OECD purchasing power parity of the franc in February
was SFr1.07 to the mark and therefore indicated considerable room for
weakening.
The debate is likely to intensify. A referendum to ratify the EEA treaty is
expected early next year, and Berne is thinking of applying to join the EC
even sooner.
Also, if the monetary squeeze became severe enough to provoke higher
mortgage rates, the temperature could increase even more. These would be
extremely unpopular when the property market and the construction industry
are on their knees. A rise would also be inflationary. Rents, which are
indexed to mortgage rates, account for 18 per cent of the retail price
index.
It is worth noting that support for European institutions is highest in
French-speaking Switzerland, where the property market is weakest.
In the German-speaking cantons, polls indicate that the majority supporting
any move towards integration with Europe is a fragile one.
Suspicion of remote governments, even the one in Berne, is deeply rooted,
and fears about being marginalised or penalised for staying out of Europe
are not great. Mr Schiltknecht said, 'We are the EC's second-largest market,
and they have a trade surplus with us. Why would they want to hurt us?'
Mr Beat Philipp, economist at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, believes the central
bank and the big commercial banks have made a secret agreement under which
the latter will not raise mortgage rates provided that the former does not
let three-month Euro-franc interest rates go above 8.5 per cent. But, with
the franc sinking to SFr0.92 to the mark last week, that agreement, if it
exists, could be tested soon.

<TEXT>
MR Manfred Stolpe, east Germany's most popular politician, yesterday
resisted pressures to resign as prime minister of Brandenburg state after
fresh allegations that he was an informer of the former Stasi security
police.
German television and the Berlin newspaper BZ produced Stasi documents
purporting to show that Mr Stolpe was a top Stasi informer on the Protestant
Church whose code-name was 'Secretary'.
Mr Stolpe was formerly the senior lay official in the Protestant Church of
Berlin-Brandenburg. He said yesterday he would present documents showing the
Stasi kept a file on 'Secretary' five years before his first meeting with a
Stasi officer and that the file consisted of information collected on him.
BZ quoted Mr Klaus Rossberg, a Stasi officer who worked with 'Secretary', as
saying he regularly met Mr Stolpe from 1969. The news paper also cited a
Stasi document allegedly showing that Mr Stolpe favoured arresting members
of Church-backed civil rights groups. Mr Stolpe called this 'nonsense'.
West German retail sales in February were around 2.5 per cent lower than a
year earlier, and showed no improvement over the previous month, the HDE
retailers' association reported said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes in
Bonn.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa was yesterday subjected to a scathing attack in one of
Poland's most widely read newspapers.
The Gazeta Wyborcza published a six-page, no-holds-barred account of Mr
Walesa's time so far in office. The account is based on interviews with
former members of Mr Walesa's staff and paints a picture of a man whose
responsibilities have far outgrown his abilities, and who is surrounded by a
kitchen cabinet led by Mr Mieczyslaw Wachowski.
The newspaper alleged, for example, that Mr Walesa was dissuaded only at the
last minute by Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the then prime minister, from
sending a congratulatory letter to the leaders of the coup in Moscow last
August. It also alleged that Mr Wachowski, who was an aide to Mr Walesa in
the heyday of the Solidarity movement in 1981, was protecting communists in
the armed forces.
The publication of the report is seen as a blow to Mr Walesa's attempt to
win control over the armed forces.
Meanwhile, a seven-week effort to enlarge Poland's centre-right minority
coalition government headed by Prime Minister Jan Olszewski broke down
yesterday, ahead of a key budget vote next month in parliament.
The end came when Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, head of the Democratic Union and a
former prime minister, said the three opposition parties he represented
would not co-operate with the government.
The talks had centred on the free-market Democratic Union, the Liberal
Democratic Congress and the PPG - a business pressure group - joining the
seven-party government. The aim was to build a strong parliamentary base
capable of supporting austere budget policies.
Differences over the division of ministries among the potential partners as
well as opposition by the farming lobby to taking the Liberals into
government put paid to the attempt.
The result leaves Mr Olszewski and Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance
minister, with the problem of putting a number of crucial issues to
parliament without any certainty of a majority.
The first test will take place this week when parliament must find a
two-thirds majority to overturn a constitutional tribunal ruling that a
pensions and wages cut for public employees last year was illegal. Should
the court ruling be upheld, some Zl 30,000bn (Pounds 1.3bn) will have to be
paid in compensation.
That would shatter this year's budget calculations and lead to the
government's resignation.
The budget for the last three quarters of the year is to be voted on next
month followed by laws enabling welfare spending cuts built into the budget
to be implemented.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government will sack regional governors who fail to meet its
targets for privatising state industry.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, said in an interview
yesterday he feared that Moscow would not be able to ensure the
implementation of its programme - which sets percentages of specific sectors
to be privatised by the end of this year - in the semi-autonomous republics
within Russia. But he was confident such 'traditional bureaucratic methods'
would work in most of the country.
He said a recent auction of 21 shops in the town of Nizhny Novgorod,
organised with the help of the World Bank and the support of enlightened
local authorities, would 'show the way' to others. 'No bureaucrat wants to
be the first, but nobody will want to be the last (in this process),' he
said.
He added that he would finalise by mid-May which sort of voucher system
would be used to give Russia's inhabitants the right to acquire free of
charge shares in shops and enterprises.
He said the government had set itself an autumn deadline to give ordinary
Russian citizens a stake in its ambitious privatisation programme.
Mr Chubais said a deluge of private western offers to invest in privatised
Russian enterprises - which followed the west's announcement of a Dollars
24bn aid package for Russian economic reforms  - made it imperative to set
rules quickly for foreigners to take part in privatisation process.
He suggested that no decision had yet been taken on plans for a special
exchange rate for foreigners to buy assets so as not to squeeze out Russians
thanks to the rouble's weak market value. But he reiterated his preference
for organising special auctions reserved for foreigners, or special
coefficients to make assets more expensive for foreigners multiplying the
value of assets sold to foreigners.

GERMANY AND France will establish a joint naval squadron next month,
expanding bilateral co-operation as a model for a wider European defence
force, Bonn's defence ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports.
Patrol ships from both countries will form a joint sea surveillance squadron
which will train by annual rotation in French or German waters under local
command, a ministry statement said.
The squadron, which will assemble for the first time on May 14, is part of a
joint defence initiative started last year by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France.
Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand announced last October plans for a 35,000-strong
Franco-German corps to be set up by 1995 which they hoped would be the
nucleus of a more broadly based European force.
The two advocates of greater unity in the European Community set up a
Franco-German brigade of some 5,000 men in 1990.
A Bonn ministry spokesman said the navy element would bring together a
German squadron of eight ships and 612 men with French counterparts in the
Mediterranean port of Toulon for three weeks of manoeuvres under French
command.

<TEXT>
ON THE EVE of negotiations to determine the fate of more than 200,000
refugees who have fled from Burma to Bangladesh, United Nations officials
say the refugee camps are in crisis.
More than 2,000 refugees are flooding across the border daily and 96,000
people have inadequate shelter. Aid workers warn of a cholera epidemic when
the monsoon arrives shortly.
Burma's foreign minister, U Ohn Gyaw, is due to arrive in Dhaka, the
Bangladeshi capital, tomorrow as part of a six-day visit to resolve the
refugee problem.
The government of Bangladesh has proposed a tripartite commission combining
the UN and the Burmese and Bangladeshi governments to return the refugees.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN Secretary-General, has said that 'an agreement
in principle has been obtained' to repatriate the refugees. However, many
refugees say they will die in Bangladesh rather than return to Burma under
the present military regime.
Most come from two districts of Arakan state just beyond the
Bangladeshi-Burmese border, where Rohingya Moslems are in the majority.
The refugees say they are fleeing because soldiers of Burma's military
junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), have forced
young men into slave labour, raped Rohingya women and transferred Rohingya
land and possessions to Buddhist Burmese in Arakan.
A recent survey by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees showed
that 86 per cent of the male refugees said they had been conscripted into
forced labour. Forty-six per cent of female family members reported they had
been raped, 52 per cent of the refugees could name persons killed by the
Burmese military and 80 per cent said their property had been confiscated.
The 12 refugee camps are squeezed into only 670 hectares of dry land south
of Dhaka.

FT  22 APR 92 / Leading a German crusade on strategic alliances: The Cartel
Office president has jolted the establishment with his attack on
Allianz-Dresdner links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Wolfgang Kartte, the outgoing president of the German Cartel Office, is
deeply suspicious of the growing trend towards strategic alliances among
international companies.
'Competition is restricted when there is no access for third parties,' he
says.
Mr Kartte, who is due to retire next June, has a strong personality and has
made his mark in the Cartel Office. He recently jolted the German insurance
and banking establishments by taking on one of the most powerful financial
alliances in Germany.
The Cartel Office decided earlier this month that Allianz, Europe's largest
insurance company, will have to reduce its stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's
second biggest bank.
He says the decision to take on the Allianz-Dresdner links was 'well
received' in the insurance world, to which an aide adds that Dresdner Bank
was also pleased.
If so, Mr Wolfgang Roller, Dresdner's chief executive, is not showing it. It
was Mr Roller who agreed with Allianz that the two would not poach on each
other's territory, a cosy arrangement the Cartel Office now seeks to undo.
If Allianz does not voluntarily drop its direct stake in Dresdner Bank from
22.3 per cent to the 19.1 per cent it held before June of last year - and it
is most unlikely to comply - the case will go to court, where it could take
more than five years to be decided.
Mr Kartte stresses that, although Allianz's additional 3.2 per cent share in
Dresdner appears negligible, it is enough to 'effectively control' the bank
with the help of an intricate web of crossholdings.
But it is Allianz's ability to prevent Dresdner from entering the insurance
business which lay at the heart of the Cartel Office's case, he argues,
since the result is economically undesirable restricted competition.
'In a strategic alliance one or both of the partners want to assure that the
other cannot have an affair with a stranger. But we cartel officials are
more for free love,' he quips.
The probe into the Allianz stake in Dresdner was made possible because of an
amendment to federal cartel law two years ago, which allowed the Cartel
Office to launch an investigation even when a company holds less than 25 per
cent in another one - provided, however, that it results in 'substantially'
reduced competition.
By far the most important decision in Mr Kartte's 16-year presidency - prior
to the move against Allianz - was the Cartel Office order in 1989
prohibiting Daimler-Benz from taking a majority stake in the MBB aerospace
and defence company.
The Cartel Office argued that the merger would lead to a market-dominating
position for Daimler-Benz and MBB in German defence production. However, the
ruling was overturned by Mr Helmut Haussmann, then economics minister, whose
decision was final.
Mr Kartte says that it was a 'political decision' which he accepted, warning
that with it Bonn assumed a 'moral responsibility' for the merger. The
active Mr Kartte keeps a watchful eye on 'interrelationships' within the
world's leading car manufacturers.
No investigation of carmakers is planned for the foreseeable future, Mr
Kartte admits, but the Cartel Office has to be 'prepared' if the opportunity
arises.
The preparations will, no doubt, take into account the lessons learnt by the
office during its price collusion case against the international oil
companies in the 1970s, which collapsed because most of the evidence was
beyond the reach of the Berlin cartel busters.
Only last year he was rebuffed by the European Commission for trying to
prevent Volkswagen from joining Ford in a 'strategic alliance' to produce
vehicles in Portugal.
The EC's approach to large mergers and alliances has made his job even more
difficult than when he took office in 1976. Undeterred, however, Mr Kartte
has proclaimed 'strategic alliances as a challenge to cartel law' as the
theme of the international conference on cartels, which he will host next
month in Berlin.
Although a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party,
the outspoken Mr Kartte makes no bones about his misgivings about Bonn's
economic policy towards depressed east Germany.
He is particularly concerned that the DM180bn (Dollars 109.7bn) in transfers
to the east this year will go mainly into consumption, although he pointedly
adds that 'politically' it was the only thing that could be done.
Similarly, he agrees that while the rescue of east Germany's shipbuilding
and chemicals industries made no sense in purely economic terms, 'you cannot
give them up without losing the next election'.
Mr Kartte's successor, to be named by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics
minister, is expected to be Ms Karin Pieper, the low-profile head of the
legal department of WDR, West German TV &amp; Radio in Cologne.
Meanwhile, the restless cartel chief is utilising his remaining months in
office to act as a part-time adviser to the Russian parliament.
Commuting to Moscow every few weeks, he is helping the Russians draw up
company law while acting as a self-styled 'catalyst' between the Russians
and his wide contacts in German industry.

FT  22 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking unsettles equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest government fund-ing via the gilts market, some Pounds 2.5bn of
stock, diverted attention away from an equity market still suffering from
the lingering effects of post-election profit-taking and worries about a
wave of rights issues.
The FT-SE 100-share index ended a much quieter session than has been the
case during the past two weeks a net 12.8 lower at 2,625.8.
Dealers said equities began on a defensive note and stayed that way for the
rest of the day in spite of closing well above the session's lowest levels.
It was also pointed out that activity in the Footsie future, which has hit
record levels over the past couple of weeks, was much reduced yesterday.
The Footsie kicked off with a 21-point decline at 2,617.6, mirroring
persistent weakness on the Tokyo market over the Easter holiday period, and
a poor showing by Wall Street on Monday, when that market came under
pressure. At its worst level the Footsie was down some 23 points within
minutes of the official opening.
Little real selling pressure emerged after this marking down, however, and
the market quietly clawed its way back around midsession before slipping
again and then picking up approaching the close. Wall Street, which opened
higher but then began to lose ground as London closed, was seen as one of
the reasons behind the UK market's uncertainty.
Turnover levels provided the real clue to the day's activity. By five
o'clock turnover had reached a miserable 420.1m shares.
This figure compares with the near 900m shares that changed hands last
Thursday, London's most recent trading session, and the previous day's 829m
shares.
Official figures released by the Stock Exchange showed that the value of
retail, or customer, business on the London market last week increased from
Monday's Pounds 1.22bn to Pounds 1.77bn on Thursday.
Marketmakers were by no means depressed by the decline. 'We have had to deal
with more than a touch of dullness from Tokyo and a poor showing by Wall
Street, and we have come through it very well,' said one trader.
He added that the market was happy to accommodate a bout of profit-taking
and that any prolonged selling pressure would uncover some strong
institutional demand. 'The market feels good, as good as at any time in the
past few months, and has not been shaken by Tokyo or Wall Street; they are
all accoun-ted for,' he went on to say.
Agency brokers adopted a similar tone. One said that since the election
result 'the market has gone up in a straight line, any correction has got to
be seen as healthy'.
Pharmaceutical stocks, notably Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, led the
market's retreat, upset by what were viewed as poor figures released last
week by US drugs group Merck. The steep declines in the two drug groups were
said to have been responsible for around 9 points of the market's fall.
Store shares made good progress, a specialist commenting: 'The consumer is
not dead and buried yet.' Property issues, apparently boosted by broker
Kleinwort Benson, were especially firm.

STOCK index futures main-tained a healthy premium over the underlying cash
market yesterday, although turnover was down on recent levels, writes Joel
Kibazo.
A one-point fall in the June contract on the FT-SE to 2,648 shortly after
the opening proved to be a temporary setback, before June began slowly to
crawl forward thereafter in light trading.
Dealers said the few selling orders on offer were quickly taken up. With
Wall Street having little impact, June continued forward during the
afternoon session and a surge just before the market close to 2,672 was
recorded after a large order for 300 contracts was transacted. June
eventually closed at 2,668, around 21 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 22. Turnover amounted to a poor 4,661 contracts.
In the traded options market, turnover reached 28,265 - well down on recent
levels. However, the FT-SE 100 option was busy, trading 13,605 lots. Volume
in the Euro FT-SE option reached only 937 contracts. Among stock options,
British Airways led the way with a day's total of 969 lots, with the July
280 calls the busiest series. This was followed by Marks and Spencer at 888
contracts dealt.

FT  22 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Quarterly results put focus

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
SHARE prices moved in a narrow range yesterday as first-quarter corporate
earnings dominated sentiment in a market unsure about which direction to
take next, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a modest 6.94 at
3,343.25, having spent the session only a few points either side of opening
values. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained just 0.10 at 410.26, while the
Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks eased 2.15 to 575.05.
Turnover on the New York SE was 214.5m shares but falls exceeded rises by
927 to 773.
Monday's declines had been triggered by a sharp rise in bond yields and
concern that the previous week's big gains (the Dow rose more than 100
points in five days), spurred by positive corporate earnings, might have
been overdone. With bond yields holding their own yesterday, and no fresh
economic news, trading was therefore relatively subdued throughout the
session.
The banks sector was the feature of the day as a host of banking groups
reported first-quarter earnings. Citicorp led the way, climbing Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 18 1/4 in turnover of 6.7m shares after reporting profits of
Dollars 183m for the first three months of the year, almost double those
made a year ago.
Banc One put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 on news of record profits of
Dollars 179m, compared to Dollars 130m a year earlier. Mellon Bank added
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 1/4 on revealing a 26 per cent improvement in
first-quarter profits to Dollars 86m.
The best performer in the sector was Wells Fargo, the West Coast banking
group, which jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 76 1/8 on announcing profits of
Dollars 2.09 a share for the quarter, well above analysts' estimates. The
results included loan-loss provisions of Dollars 215m.
Time Warner rose initially but slipped back to end down Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 102 5/8 after the media and entertainment group reported
first-quarter net income of Dollars 3m, against a sizeable loss incurred at
the same stage a year ago.
Tenneco fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 in active trading after the oil and
mining group paid out Dollars 50m to settle a shareholder lawsuit.
Storage Technology plummeted Dollars 11 1/4 to Dollars 45 in turnover of
3.76m shares on disappointing first-quarter profits of 30 cents a share,
down from the 36 cents recorded a year earlier.
On the over-the-counter market, Seagate Technology moved ahead Dollars 3/4
to Dollars 15 1/4 on news of fiscal third-quarter profits of 59 cents a
share, up from 38 cents a year ago.
MIPS Computer plunged Dollars 2 1/8 , or 20 per cent, to Dollars 8 3/8 as it
recorded a first-quarter loss of 51 cents a share, compared with a modest
profit at the same stage a year earlier.
Synopsys weakened Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 27 1/4 after reporting fiscal
second-quarter earnings of 11 cents a share, above the results of a year ago
but below market expectations.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower after moderate trading as declines among banking and
real estate issues more than outweighed a jump by gold shares.
The composite index slipped 18.1 to 3,380.7, while falls led advances by 317
to 230 after volume of 21.7m shares.
Financial services dropped 2.5 per cent as several banks fell amid continued
concern over the future of debt-ridden real estate giant Olympia &amp; York. The
gold group index climbed 3.9 per cent as New York spot gold gained USDollars
3.90 to USDollars 340.65 an ounce.

FT  22 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Political uncertainty fuels swings in
some markets - Recent trading patterns across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European markets showed a slight overall increase in volume last month, but
this rise was largely due to the UK and Switzerland, with Belgium and
Germany the only two other market areas to advance in March.
Italy had the steepest decline in turnover, a 33 per cent fall from
February. As with the UK, the market was hampered by nerves ahead of the
country's general election. Political commentators forecast, correctly, that
the ruling four-party coalition would suffer defeat, creating more
uncertainty as a new government was pieced together.
However, Mr James Cornish of County NatWest notes that volume in Italian
shares traded on Seaq International in London rose 36 per cent in March.
Switzerland saw a rise in volume as foreign investors were attracted by the
liberalisation of share ownership. The new code comes into force on July 1
but already a number of companies have announced that they will abolish
participation certificates. Activity was also stimulated by good
first-quarter results, particularly from the banks and Brown Boveri.
The decision by the Conservative government in the UK to call a general
election may not have taken the market by surprise, but early opinion polls
indicating a possible victory by the Labour party had a marked effect on
activity.
Unlike Italy, where volume was depressed, the UK saw a 10 per cent rise as
institutions switched stocks and bought into companies which they believed
might benefit from a change in the governing party.
Power utilities, which had been privatised during the 13 years of Tory
government, came into focus as some investors feared that Labour would
renationalise them. Property issues were also active on fears that a Labour
victory would lead to higher interest rates.
But with most opinion polls showing the two leading parties running
virtually neck-and-neck and the prospect of a coalition government looming
there was as much verve as nerve in the market.
Politics also played a part in France, where volume picked up later in the
month after President Francois Mitterrand forced the resignation of Mrs
Edith Cresson as prime minister. The market was pleased with the appointment
of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the former finance minister.
A stronger performance on Wall Street, boosted by some good first-quarter
results, helped calm the recent volatility in Japan and lifted markets
worldwide. Only South Africa showed a small decline on the week, largely
because of a fall in the gold price.
Denmark rose but on small turnover, as an increase in shipping rates lifted
that sector. Mexico's performance continued to improve as more foreign
investors turn to the market. In Hong Kong the release of information on the
inner reserves of the leading banks pushed the market up.

FT  22 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Lack of data slows trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LACK of fresh economic data and lethargy after the long weekend led to an
extremely quiet day on the foreign exchanges yesterday.
'There has been no real news to stimulate the market into any sort of
activity,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, who
described the day as torpid.
Analysts said a small rally by the dollar in late trading was more the
result of speculative money moving around than reaction to any news.
However, both the dollar and sterling benefited to a certain extent from a
wobbly D-Mark, which weakened in the wake of the warning from Mr Theo
Waigel, the German finance minister, at the weekend that Germany faced four
years of tight financial policies with public spending growth limited to 2.5
per cent per year.
Mr Waigel said there would be no new spending commitments without
compensatory cutbacks in spending elsewhere, a comment which prompted
immediate rumours that Germany might be pressured to lower interest rates at
the Group of Seven meeting this weekend.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.6690, after last Thursday's
DM1.6650. In Asian trading the dollar had ended slightly higher at Y134.47
and DM1.6655.
In New York last night the dollar finished at DM1.6687/92 and Y134.21/26.
Sterling finally stood at Dollars 1.7500/07.
The pound remained well supported, hovering above DM2.91 throughout the day.
However, traders said the UK currency was still having great difficulty
breaking resistance in the DM2.9180 to DM2.9220 area.
Figures for UK retail sales and trade data, due on Friday, are likely to be
down-played by the markets as 'pre-election' data presenting a distorted
month-on-month comparison because of uncertainty caused by the general
election.
The main currencies in the European Monetary System ended a quiet day little
changed from the end of last week. The D-Mark, under slight pressure from
the generally firmer dollar, drifted lower against the lira and French franc
but gained a fraction on sterling. Overall, it eased to 20 per cent of its
allowed swing above its central Ecu rate from 22 per cent on Thursday.
The French franc closed at FFr3.3793/98 against the D-Mark, a 12-month high
and up from FFr3.3798/3803 on Thursday, as the market continued to show its
approval of former finance minister Pierre Beregovoy's appointment as prime
minister on April 2.
The lira, which had weakened at the start of the month on uncertainty
surrounding Italy's general election, improved to L750.80/90 against the
D-Mark from Thursday's L751.55/65.
The Spanish peseta has been added to the exchange cross-rates table.

FT  22 APR 92 / Money Markets: Markets slumber
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONEY markets languished in a post-bank holiday mood yesterday, scarcely
moving in exceptionally thin levels of trading.
'It is very difficult to get people motivated,' said one dealer. 'We need a
jump lead to get the dealers back on track.'
The June sterling contract traded just over 9,000 lots during the day in a
four-tick range, 'barely giving a living to the jobbers', as one analyst put
it.
Yesterday's low volumes contrasted sharply with the frenzied activity after
the election when around 9,000 lots were moving easily in the first
half-hour of trading.
'I think there has also been a realisation that we are at or around fair
value in the cash and futures markets,' said Mr Nick Parsons of the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, explaining the lethargy in the market.
The contract hovered around 89.78 after opening at 89.76.
Rates at the long end firmed slightly as expectations for base rate cuts
receded.
Recent economic data has suggested that inflation is proving more stubborn
than expected.
'The producer prices index, the retail prices index and average earnings
have all shown that inflation hasn't been clubbed to death,' said one
analyst.
With the political imperative to cut rates removed and much talk of an
Easter 'boomlet' as shoppers took to the high streets, base rates of 10.5
per cent look likely to be around for some time yet.
One year money firmed slightly to 10 5/16 - 3/16 per cent from Thursday's
close of 10 1/4 - 1/8 per cent. The key three-month interbank rate remained
steady at 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent.
The overnight rate moved up during the day, touching 11-10 3/4 per cent at
one stage, as the Bank of England revised its initial forecast liquidity
shortage from flat, to Pounds 500m in the late afternoon.
The Bank did not operate in the morning, but late assistance of Pounds 270m
took its day's operations to Pounds 361m.
Earlier in the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 91m of Band-1 bank bills at
10 3/8 per cent. The overnight rate closed at 10 5/8 - 3/8 per cent.
In Germany, call money rates were steady to slightly firmer at 9.60/70 per
cent, compared with 9.60/65 per cent on Thursday. Traders said reserves were
holding up well.

FT  22 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex's first lady makes an
energetic beginning - An action-packed opening month for the exchange's
newly-elected chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH ON the job as chairman of the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), Ms
Donna Redel, elected to the office on March 24, has put her formidable
energy behind two priorities that have become nearly a mantra for all
exchange executives: raising trading volume and lowering costs. And in her
initial steps toward those goals, Ms Redel has shown the drive and boldness
that helped make her the first woman ever to chair a commodities exchange.
She has approached European exchanges directly to ask for closer
co-operation on products and has pressed for quick action on a merger of
Comex with the US Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. A merger would cut costs
for the overlapping memberships of the two exchanges.
Earlier this month, on a lightning trip to London, Ms Redel asked for the
advice and guidance of the London Metal Exchange on the possibility of
redesigning the Comex's languishing aluminium contract, which has not traded
since 1990. With precious metals in the slow lane of trading, she is seeking
to create a stronger base metals division to pump up volume. In this regard,
she underlines how important it is 'for Comex to explore reviving an
aluminium contract in a different format'. Moreover, she believes that
discussions with the LME are needed 'to improve the overall trading
environment (for metals) on a global basis'.
While in London, she also visited the International Petroleum Exchange,
where she held talks on co-ordinating the launches of the two exchange's
sour crude (Dubai) petroleum products. Comex's proposed Dubai futures
contract is expected to be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the US futures regulator, by late April. But Ms Redel says that
the new futures - and the IPE contracts - are likely to stay on the shelf
until the sour crude market matures sufficiently to guarantee some success.
Ms Redel is also working with another European exchange, the European
Options Exchange in Amsterdam, on Comex's first venture into equity-based
financial futures. She hopes that Comex's proposed stock index futures based
on the Eurotop 100, which trades in Amsterdam, will come later this month.
The American Stock Exchange, which has options on the Eurotop 100 ready to
roll, will wait for Comex's Eurotop futures to be approved so that the
launches can be co-ordinated, says Mr Ivers Riley, chief of derivatives
trading at the Amex. This will provide better arbitrage opportunities for
users between the cash market options and the futures.
In an effort to assure the success of the new financial futures, Ms Redel
intends to reach beyond co-operation with Amsterdam and the Amex into the
market-user community to ask for guidance on how best to market the new
product. She says she will call upon individuals from pension funds and
international portfolio management - the large institutional investors who
use the futures markets - to serve as an advisory group on the Eurotop 100
futures.
The linking of Comex's most liquid contracts with those of other
international exchanges is another scheme receiving Ms Redel's attention.
While she declines to give details of her proposal - which may be ready next
month - she says the purpose is to extend trading hours.
Meanwhile, the new chairman is stepping up efforts to arrange the merger
with the CSCE. A merger committee has prepared a proposal for consideration
by both exchanges' boards of directors at their next meetings. These will be
held by May 13 and, if the light is green, a merger scheme will be put to
the memberships of both exchanges.
Ms Redel hopes that the approval process, at the board and membership
levels, will be completed by the end of the year at the latest. A merger
would reduce costs for members, clearing firms and the exchanges by
eliminating duplication in the back offices and in administration.
With respect to the joint construction of a new building with the CSCE, the
Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange - the New York Mercantile
Exchange has decided to go it alone on a new site - Ms Redel has said that
she will evaluate the project on a 'cost-benefit analysis'. It is expected,
however, that Comex will proceed with its previous decision to move to a new
site.
Ms Redel made her first pilgrimage to Washington last week to plead with the
CFTC for higher limits on investors' speculative positions. She describes
raising position limits as 'close to my top priority'. On this issue, she is
joining a chorus of futures industry voices who argue that US exchanges are
increasingly losing business to overseas and unregulated markets because of
low, regulatory position limits on trading. With the advent of institutional
trading and large commodity funds, the industry has changed, but the rules
have not, said Ms Redel. She intended to request that gold and silver
contract limits be raised from their current level of 6,000 lots to 15,000
lots (of 100 troy ounces for gold and 5,000 troy ounces for silver).
Asked recently if she had any particular perspective as a woman in the
male-dominated world of futures trading, Ms Redel - daughter of a former
Comex chairman and executive vice president of the family firm, Redel
Trading - shot back: 'My perspective is a business one'. She is, however,
one of the few women to reach executive heights in the macho rough and
tumble of the commodities markets. She has taken leave of the
responsibilities at her own firm to work as the first full-time Comex
chairman, drawing a salary of Dollars 125,000 a year. But her capacity for
work has not been dented; she is also studying law at night to add a fresh
qualification to the MBA she already holds.
In a direct competitive challenge to the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
New York Commodity Exchange has announced plans to introduce platinum and
palladium futures, which currently trade on Nymex.
Comex announced that its board of directors last week appointed a task force
to review the markets and recommend specifications for the proposed
contracts. 'Incorporating platinum and palladium contracts into our existing
product line will be highly beneficial for the industry, while representing
a natural fit for us,' said Mr David Halperin, president of Comex, which
already lists gold, silver and copper.
Mr Halperin said that prior to his board's decision last week Comex and
Nymex had discussed several proposals which would shift trading of the two
contracts to Comex under a revenue sharing agreement. But none of the
proposals proved acceptable, he said in a statement released yesterday.
Nymex reacted angrily to the announcement saying, 'We question the
commitment to this industry by an institution which for apparent political
motivation would attempt to remove liquidity from existing markets by
offering a product with no substantial difference'.
The two exchanges have ended up at each other throats after years of talks
about a merger foundered last year.

FT  22 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond hunters' hopes soar in
the frozen north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST rush to stake mining claims in the history of the North American
industry is going on at Lac de Gras in Canada's Northwest Territories.
Causing all the excitement are 81 small diamonds, each less than 2 mm in
diameter but some of gem quality, found in a kimberlite pipe about 300 km
(185 miles) north-east of the city of Yellowknife.
At least 22,800 sq km (8,900 square miles) has been staked around the first
discovery and hundreds of claims are still outstanding.
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large - more
than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in most cases. A device fitted to the
helicopter gives a constant reading of longitude and latitude and when a
pre-determined site is found the helicopter lands, allowing a crew member to
jump out and hammer in a claim post.
The Northern Miner, Canada's mining newspaper, reports, however, that so
great is the rush that many of the posts are being dropped from above and
will be secured only after the spring thaw.
The claim rush, said by some observers even to outdo the Yukon gold days at
the end of the 19th century, is being caused by a peculiarity of geology.
Kimberlite pipes usually occur in clusters of ten to 40 spread over an area
of 100 sq km or more. So there is every chance that the main diamond bonanza
could be well outside the area where the first stones were found.
The diamonds were in a 140 m (465 ft) length of core drilled by a joint
venture owned by BHP, Australia's biggest corporation, and a Canadian junior
exploration company called Dia Met Minerals.
Significantly, among those to have rushed to the area is Monopros, the
Canadian exploration arm of De Beers, the South African group which controls
80 per cent of the world's trade in rough (uncut) diamonds.
The Northern Miner reports that the joint venturers have transported 200
tonnes of material from Lac de Gras for testing. Ten trucks carried the
material along the 580 km winter road, built when the ice is thick enough,
between Echo Bay's Lupin gold mine and Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest
Territories. This road runs half a mile from the diamond discovery.
Sampling is being carried out at Dia Met's 80 tonnes a day diamond recovery
plant near Fort Collins in Colorado. The company estimates that, after some
fine tuning, recovery rates will be about 99 per cent.
Analysts suggest that to be economic the kimberlite pipe, estimated to have
a surface area of 16 to 32 hectares, would need a grade of 0.5 to 0.9 carats
a tonne (1 carat equals 200 milligrams) with diamond quality of Dollars 50 a
carat. Sampling will indicate the ratio of industrial to gem quality
diamonds. Industrial diamonds, which also can be made synthetically, fetch
only about Dollars 1.3 a carat.
BHP has decided to double its annual spending on the Lac de Gras property to
CDollars 2m (Pounds 960,000). To earn a 51 per cent interest, the Australian
group has also agreed to finance a feasibility study and arrange production
financing of up to CDollars 500m. Mr Vincent Pisani, analyst at Potter
Warburg, the Sydney stockbroker, points out in the latest SG Warburg
International Mining Outlook, that the Lac de Gras venture is not the only
one providing diamond exploration excitement in North America. In
Saskatchewan, four or five companies are working in the Prince Albert area.
At Fort-La-Corne, Cameco and Uranerz Mining report that 160 microdiamonds
have been recovered from 15 separate kimberlite pipes. But, at an average of
2 carats a tonne, the grade is uneconomic. There is also exploration in
Northern Alberta and Ontario in the Attwapiskat River area.
Ashton Mining, the Australian group that owns 40 per cent of the world's
biggest diamond mine (in weight terms) at Argyle in the Kimberley district
of Western Australia, is committing 30 per cent of its USDollars 5m diamond
exploration budget over the next three years to the Great Lakes project
located south of Lake Superior and west of Lake Michigan in the states of
Michigan and Wisconsin.
Exploration there revealed a cluster of kimberlitic pipes bearing
microdiamonds and these are being tested for commercial potential. Ashton is
earning a 51 per cent interest in the project from a junior company called
Crystal Mining. Early work was carried out by Dow Chemical and it also
retains an interest.
Ashton believes that Great Lakes has the potential to be a world-class
diamond deposit.
However, Northern Miner adds some words of caution. It points out that there
have been several diamond finds in the US but only one, the Crater of
Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, ever reached production.
This is not surprising because, in order for diamonds to remain intact and
not become graphite or carbon dioxide, they must be brought to the surface
from depths of 160 km or more at speeds of 8 to 32 kph as the
kimberlite/lamproite magma reaches the surface.
Consequently, although there are more than 3,000 known kimberlite deposits
in the world, fewer than 1,000 carry any diamonds and only 50 to 60 have
ever proved economic.

STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, yesterday placed seven US airlines
on credit watch with negative implications, AP-DJ reports from New York.
The action affects about Dollars 19.5bn of securities issued by Alaska Air,
AMR, Delta Air Lines, NWA, Southwest Airlines, UAL and USAir and their
subsidiaries.
On Wall Street, shares in most of the quoted airlines were sharply lower
yesterday, in reaction to American's downward adjustment in fares announced
on Monday, adds Nikki Tait.
AMR, American's parent company, lost Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 68 1/2 ; UAL,
holding company for United Airlines, one of its big rival, eased Dollars 3
to Dollars 125; Delta Air Lines, the last of the 'Big Three,' lost Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 58 3/4 .
USAir, a financially weaker carrier and one of those leading the current
price competition, slipped  3/8 to Dollars 13 1/8 . Southwest Airlines, a
highly competitive smaller carrier based in Dallas, lost Dollars 1 at
Dollars 36 1/8.

FT  22 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Bank sets date for extra-long gilts
auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England's expected auction of extra-long dated gilts was
announced yesterday, the first such securities to be issued since the UK
government became a net buyer of gilts in the 1980s.
The Pounds 2.5bn of 25-year gilts to be offered on April 29 will mark the
first auction of the current financial year, an important moment
psychologically given the high level of funding needed to be completed this
year. The bonds are expected to be taken up mainly by UK insurance
companies, which until now have had no opportunity to buy long-dated paper
to match their liabilities.
UK investors reacted positively to news of the announcement, although they
remain cautious about the short-term outlook for the gilt market in the wake
of last week's strong post-election rally. A fixed income manager at one of
the UK's biggest fund management groups, who declined to be named, said:
'We're very pleased. There has been an anomaly in the UK yield curve. The
government's buying of gilts had created a quite massive distortion.'
However, insurance companies said that they would have to consider their
involvement carefully. 'We're not going to charge in indiscriminately and
push yields down,' said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income at Legal &amp;
General, the insurance group.
Two factors would determine his group's interest in next week's auction, he
said: the relative attraction of the UK market immediately ahead of the
auction, and the likely future supply of securities at the extra-long end of
the market. Expectations of substantial further funding at this maturity
later in the year, which could force yields up, are likely to prompt some
investors to hold back at this stage.
Concern about the supply of new gilts due to come on to the market, and
weakness in the US government bond market, had combined to drive prices of
existing gilts down by around half a point from last Thursday's close in
early trading yesterday. However, foreign buying during the afternoon was
credited with aiding a partial recovery in prices to just below their
Thursday levels.
The 9 per cent gilts maturing in 2011 were trading at around 99 5/16 late
yesterday afternoon, compared with a close of 99 17/32 on Thursday, while
the 9 3/4 per cent securities due 2002 were  3/16 lower than their Thursday
close at 103 3/4 . Long gilt futures on Liffe, meanwhile, ended close to the
day's high at around 98 21/32 .
See Lex
US Treasury prices were in mixed form yesterday as the short end of the
market staged a modest recovery from Monday's big losses on news of a
smaller-than-expected budget deficit for March.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 99
9/16 , yielding 8.033 per cent. At the short end of the market prices were
slightly higher, with the two-year note up  3/32 at 100, yielding 5.353 per
cent.
The market nose-dived on Monday because of reports from the previous week
which suggested that economic activity in the US was picking up.
With nothing to change that view, yesterday's gains were consequently
fitful, although some traders reported that European investors, who were on
holiday on Monday, returned to work as buyers of US Treasuries, seeking to
take advantage of the big drop in prices while they were away.
While the short end was buoyed by the report that the March budget deficit
was Dollars 49.36bn, below forecasts and thus good news for inflation,
sentiment at the long end was affected by imminent supply pressures, with
the Treasury scheduled to sell Dollars 14.75bn in two-year notes and Dollars
10.25bn in five-year notes this week.
A DECISION by the Japanese Ministry of Finance on Tuesday to delay its next
auction of 10-year bonds seemed to achieve the exact opposite of what was
intended: by unsettling the bond market, it pushed yields higher and left
observers nervous about the coming weeks.
After five interventions by the MoF to buy bonds in the market in the past
fortnight, the delay was seen as a sign that these purchases had not worked,
and that few options for supporting prices remained.
The yield on the benchmark bond 129 reached 5.625 per cent during London
trading yesterday, up sharply from the 5.46 per cent yield recorded towards
the end of last week.
TRADING was quiet as European bond markets resumed after the Easter break.
Prices were generally marked down in reaction to weakness in the US at the
start of the week. In Germany, the benchmark unity bond due 2002 closed on a
yield of 7.94 per cent, up from 7.88 per cent last Thursday.
The bund futures contract on Liffe traded in a narrow range between 87.76
and 88.88, eventually ending the day at 87.85.

<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has received approval from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission for its novel pollution futures, or 'Clean Air
Futures' as the CBOT calls them.
These are contracts based on the sulphur dioxide emission allowances that
will be issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency under the 1990
Clean Air Act.
These permits to pollute will be tradeable among the companies, primarily
electric utilities, that will receive them. Those companies that have
installed cleaner technologies will be in a position to sell their permits
to those who still cannot meet the more restrictive air standards.
Mr William O'Connor, the exchange's chairman, called the new contracts 'the
most exciting development in our industry since the introduction of interest
rate futures 15 years ago.'
The CBOT is still waiting for a decision by the EPA on its application to
administer the annual auction of the emission allowances. The first auction
is scheduled for March 1993 and the futures are expected to start trading
before then.

NIPPON Housing Loan, the troubled non-banker lender to the property sector,
is set to dismiss Mr Keiichiro Niwayama, president for 20 years, as part of
an effort to come to grips with its huge portfolio of bad debt.
The company confirmed yesterday it would soon appoint a new president,
likely to be Mr Susumu Niwa, a former executive at the Sanwa Bank who is
senior managing director at Nippon.
The management shake-up is symptomatic of the serious bad debt problems
facing the non-bank sector, and the commercial banks that provided finance.
The exact size of the problems at Nippon are impossible to gauge because bad
loans need not be declared as such until a year after payment stops. The
steep decline of property prices in Japan's principal cities, however, has
pushed many borrowers beyond the brink.
According to Teikoku Data Bank, a Japanese credit agency, loans declared bad
by the eight housing loan companies to corporations which failed last year
totalled Y90.7bn (Dollars 675m), although the final total is likely to prove
much higher.
Nippon had assets of Y3,992bn as of last September.

<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 29 per cent drop in
first-quarter net income as lower figures from its industrial and hotels
businesses more than outweighed an improved performance from its financial
operations.
The group had net income of Dollars 163m, or Dollars 1.20 a share fully
diluted, compared with Dollars 229m, or Dollars 1.70 a share, in the same
period of last year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 5.1bn, compared
with Dollars 5bn. The figures were roughly in line with market forecasts.
ITT Hartford, the group's large insurance business, saw an improvement in
earnings, from Dollars 165m to Dollars 181m, thanks to higher investment
income and a Dollars 10m pre-tax gain on the sale of a stake in securities
firm Piper Jaffray Hopwood. This was partly offset by the establishment of
reserves in domestic casualty operations and continued difficult market
conditions in the UK.
ITT Financial, which groups other financial service operations, also posted
higher operating results - Dollars 33m against Dollars 19m.
ITT Hartford and Financial together enjoyed portfolio gains of Dollars 84m,
or 63 cents a share, compared with Dollars 35m a year ago.
The group's Sheraton hotels business lost Dollars 16m, up from Dollars 3m a
year ago, which ITT said was due to 'significantly lower occupancy levels in
New York City, Miami and Toronto,' where Sheraton has recently completed
major renovations.
The automotive, fluid technology, forest products and defence businesses
suffered lower profits, while components posted an operating loss. Equity in
earnings from Alcatel, the European telephone equipment business, rose from
Dollars 32m to Dollars 50m. ITT is in the process of selling its 30 per cent
stake in this business to joint venture partner Alcatel Alsthom.

fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMOCO, one of the leading US oil companies, yesterday reported a 52 per cent
drop in first-quarter earnings due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices
and squeezed downstream margins.
The Chicago-based group reported earnings of Dollars 234m, or 47 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 492m, or 98 cents, in the same period last
year. Revenues fell to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 7.3bn.
The figures were helped by a Dollars 67m tax benefit and Dollars 20m due to
early debt retirement, partly offset by a Dollars 39m Norwegian tax charge.
Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman, said: 'The earnings decline reflects lower
crude oil and natural gas prices and continued weak margins and sales
volumes for chemicals and lower margins for refining, marketing and
transportation.'
The company, which previously announced a capital and exploration budget of
Dollars 3.7bn for the year, said it was re-evaluating this in view of the
'current adverse economic conditions affecting the industry'.
Domestic exploration and production earnings of Dollars 145m were down 33
per cent, while foreign activities incurred an Dollars 11m loss, compared
with earnings of Dollars 95m. Refining, marketing and transport made Dollars
65m, down from Dollars 214m, while chemicals earned Dollars 35m, compared
with Dollars 83m.

STORAGE technology's shares plummeted by more than 20 per cent yesterday
when the manufacturer of computer data storage systems announced
lower-than-expected earnings and said testing of its much-heralded new
product, the Iceberg disk array, had slipped behind schedule.
The stock price fell from a Monday close of Dollars 56 1/4 to close at
Dollars 45 yesterday.
Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 12.5m, or 30 cents per share,
compared with Dollars 13.4m, or 36 cents per share, in the same period last
year.
Analysts had been projecting first-quarter earnings of about 52 cents per
share.
Revenue for the quarter totalled Dollars 333.7m, an 8 per cent decline from
Dollars 361.2m in the first quarter of 1991.
'While results for the first quarter fell somewhat below our expectations,
we remain optimistic about our prospects for the year,' said Mr Ryal Poppa,
chairman.
Storage Technology's stock rose sharply in January, when the company
announced Iceberg, an advanced disk array product for mainframe computers.
Analysts said that it appeared unlikely the company would install Iceberg at
customer sites until the third quarter rather than in the current quarter as
had been expected.

UNION Carbide, the US chemicals company, yesterday reported an 8 per cent
fall in first-quarter profits after tax to Dollars 72m.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.187bn, against a restated Dollars 1.323bn in the
first three months of 1991.
The company blamed the fall on declining prices. It added that the
first-quarter slip was smaller than anticipated, given the 14 per cent drop
in chemicals and selling prices year-on-year.
The company's chairman, Mr Robert Kennedy, noted that weak selling prices
and further downward pressures on margins were expected to affect the second
quarter.
The first-quarter figures include profits of Dollars 33m from Union Carbide
Industrial Gases, up 22 per cent on the previous year.
This division, which was reported as a discontinued business, is due to be
spun off to Union Carbide shareholders by the end of the second quarter.
The profits figure came from sales of Dollars 653m.
Union Carbide shares rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 3/8 yesterday.
Warner-Lambert and Schering-Plough, two large US drugs companies, reported
strong earnings gains in the first three months of 1992. Warner posted a 17
per cent improvement in after-tax profits, at Dollars 164m.
Total sales increased by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn.
Schering-Plough reported first-quarter profits after tax of Dollars 193.3m.
This compared with Dollars 173.2m for the same period a year earlier. Sales
were up from Dollars 949.3m to Dollars 1.02bn.

TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment group, reported yesterday that
first-quarter revenues rose across all five of its divisions, helping turn
last year's Dollars 50m quarterly loss into a net profit of Dollars 3m.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), or
operating earnings, were Dollars 561m over the three months, achieved on
total revenues of Dollars 3bn.
Operating earnings in the same quarter last year were Dollars 530m on
revenues of Dollars 2.8bn.
The best performing division of Time Warner was its cable television group.
This saw operating earnings climb 11 per cent to a record Dollars 228m,
thanks to an increase in cable subscribers and advertising.
The group's publishing unit, Time Inc, reported operating earnings of
Dollars 44m, up 5 per cent from last year.
Gains were reported in advertising and circulation at the company's
magazines, in spite of the sluggish economy, and they helped offset lower
results at the book publishing division.
The Warner Music Group posted first-quarter operating earnings of Dollars
141m, up slightly on a year ago, after increases in domestic music sales and
music publishing.
Among its most successful artists were Metallica, Genesis and Simply Red.
On Monday, Time Warner's music division announced a multi-year Dollars 60m
deal with the pop-star Madonna.
At the group's movie-making unit, operating earnings were virtually flat at
Dollars 96m. The feature of the quarter was the success of the controversial
movie JFK, which since its release last year has grossed Dollars 160m
worldwide.
Operating earnings at the television programming division were little
changed at Dollars 52m, with the bulk of the small increase in income
recorded at the pay-for-TV services, HBO and Cinemax.
On Wall Street, the group's share price slipped Dollars  1/4 to close at
Dollars 102 5/8 . Knight-Ridder, the US media group, which recorded an
increase in first-quarter earnings, is cautiously optimistic for the
remainder of 1992, Reuter reports.
The company posted first-quarter net income of Dollars 25m or 46 cents a
share on revenues of Dollars 555.4m, compared with Dollars 15.8m or 32 cents
on revenues of Dollars 545.4 a year ago.
It said that while net income in the final three quarters would not match
those of the first quarter, it expected earnings growth in each quarter.
Barring a setback in the economy, Knight-Ridder expected 1992 to improve on
last year's Dollars 132.1m or Dollars 2.55 a share on revenues of Dollars
2.24bn.

MINNESOTA Mining &amp; Manufacturing, the US conglomerate based in St Paul,
Minnesota and known as 3M, reported a decline of 3.9 per cent in its
first-quarter net income.
The group recorded income of Dollars 288m, or Dollars 1.32 per share, down
from Dollars 300m, or Dollars 1.37 per share, last year, but the company was
optimistic that it would be able to improve results during the remainder of
the year.
First-quarter sales edged up to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3.38bn for the
same period a year ago.
The higher value of the US dollar reduced sales by about 2 per cent and net
income by about Dollars 15m, or 7 cents per share.
However, Mr L. D. DeSimone, chairman, said that the results were in line
with the company's expectations for the first quarter.
The group's international business, which accounts for about half its sales,
remained firm as steady growth in Europe and strong gains in Latin America
offset a slowdown in Japan.
International volume by unit increased 6 per cent, a level equal to the
growth averaged for all of 1991.
Sales in the US remained basically unchanged, but the company noted that
unit sales improved as the quarter progressed.
This, and more solid volume gains in the early days of the second quarter,
led the company to believe that the US economy would continue to show some
moderate improvement.
Mr DeSimone said the outlook for the full year was positive and he expected
higher second-quarter earnings, in spite of the fact that the effects of
currency translation would remain negative.
In the second quarter last year, the company earned Dollars 299m, or Dollars
1.36 a share, on sales of Dollars 3.35bn.

PHELPS DODGE, the largest US copper producer, saw operating income for its
mining operations drop in the first quarter to Dollars 76.9m from Dollars

The group, which manufactures truck wheels and rims and is a leading
producer of carbon black, reported first-quarter net income down to Dollars
53.6m or Dollars 1.53 per share, compared with Dollars 77.3m or Dollars 2.23
a year ago.
It said first-quarter earnings were satisfactory in spite of continued slow
economies in many of its markets.
Group revenues for the quarter declined to Dollars 590.5m from Dollars
601.8m, while Phelps Dodge Mining saw its revenues slip to Dollars 301.5m,
against Dollars 314m a year ago.
Phelps cited lower copper prices and the closure of concentrator operations
at its Tyrone, New Mexico mine for the reduction in mining profits.

Tribune's first-quarter earnings fell to Dollars 11.3m, or 17 cents a share,
from Dollars 16.9m, or 26 cents, a year ago. Revenues of Dollars 471.4m were
slightly higher than revenues in the 1991 quarter, helped by advertising
income which increased by 2 per cent.

FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Demutualisation plan attacked by
USX pension fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund, a sizeable US institutional investor
representing the interests of pensioners at the USX steel and energy group,
yesterday hit out at the share allocation suggested by Equitable, America's
fourth largest insurer, in its 'demutualisation' plan.
Mr James Carney, administrator of the pension fund, told a public hearing on
Equitable's scheme that the proposed allocation of shares among its
policyholders was unfairly biased toward the ownership of policies, rather
than the contribution made by policyholders to the insurer's profits. The US
Steel Pension Fund is a leading policyholder with Equitable.
Equitable is by far the largest US insurer to 'demutualise' - a practice
that many believe will become more common as US insurers seek to bolster
their capital resources. It is also converting under the supervision of the
New York State insurance department, viewed as one of most professional
state regulatory organisations.
Accordingly, the Equitable scheme - which is designed to turn the company
from one controlled by its policyholders into one owned by shareholders - is
being seen as a model for future US demutualisations. 'It will set a
precedent for the conversion of other mutuals,' Mr Carney told the hearing.
However, he warned, 'if policyholders resort to litigation', the precedent
would not be good one.
His complaint centred on the suggestion that each policyholder be allocated
three shares apiece regardless of the type or size of the policy. They then
would receive further shares based on more sophisticated actuarial
calculations of their contributions to the mutual's surplus. Mr Carney
claimed, however, that one share would be sufficient to reflect the policy
ownership.
He calculated - using one of Equitable's theoretical scenarios - that 23 per
cent of all shares going to policyholders could be allocated under the fixed
share basis if the three-shares-per-policy system were used. Since some
policy categories have been heavily loss-making in the past, he claimed that
this would be unfair.
Equitable responded by saying that the fixed element was in line with
previous demutualisations. Mr Carney stressed the fund was supportive of the
demutualisation in principle.
At the meeting, there were no representations from Axa, the large French
insurance group which invested Dollars 1bn in Equitable last year. Assuming
the demutualisation scheme goes ahead, Axa will convert this into an equity
stake of up to 49 per cent of Equitable, with the ability to take this over
the 50 per cent mark in 1994.

FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: US banking results offer
evidence of recovery

SHARES in Wells Fargo, the California-based banking group, jumped 14.9 per
cent yesterday after it reported first-quarter financial results which
dipped from a year ago but were better than Wall Street had been expecting.
Several other leading US banks - Chemical Banking, Banc One, Mellon Bank and
Bankers Trust - yesterday reported results that also underlined the gradual
recovery in the industry from the severe difficulties of the past two years.
Wells Fargo, which was hit hard by losses on its real estate portfolio in
1991, reported earnings of Dollars 119m, or Dollars 2.09 a share, in the
first quarter, down from Dollars 152m, or Dollars 2.86, in the same period
of last year.
However, some analysts had been expecting earnings per share as low as 80
cents, and in trading on the New York Stock Exchange the company's stock
closed in New York at Dollars 76 1/8 , up Dollars 9 7/8 .
The company's loan-loss provision was Dollars 215m, compared with Dollars
700m in the fourth quarter of last year, and Dollars 85m a year ago.
Net interest income increased 8 per cent to Dollars 680m, compared with
Dollars 631m a year earlier. Substantially all the increase was due to its
higher net interest margin - 5.70 per cent, compared with 5.06 per cent -
partially offset by lower earning assets.
Mr Carl Reichardt, Wells Fargo's chairman, said that 'economic recovery
around the nation is still fragile and in much of California we are still
waiting for some clear signs of a turnaround'.
Chemical Banking, which at the end of last year merged with Manufacturers
Hanover, a rival New York money centre bank, reported a 44 per cent increase
in net income to Dollars 260m, or Dollars 1 a share, from Dollars 181m, or
84 cents.
Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said there had been strong results in many
key earnings components: higher net interest income; an increase in trading
revenues; and improvements in several fee-based banking businesses.
The provision for losses was Dollars 375m, compared with Dollars 450m in the
fourth quarter of last year and Dollars 279m a year ago. Net interest income
rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.115bn, while non-interest revenue rose 16 per
cent to Dollars 810m.
Banc One, the rapidly expanding Ohio-based super-regional bank, reported
record first-quarter earnings of Dollars 179m, or 86 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 130m, or 67 cents, in the same period of last year.
Mr John McCoy, chairman, said that continued strong retail loan demand and
core deposit growth had boosted the net interest margin, which rose from
6.17 per cent last year to 6.82 per cent.
Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank reported net income of Dollars 86m, or Dollars
1.36 a share, in the first quarter, compared with Dollars 68m, or Dollars
1.25, a year ago.
The figures reflected increases in net interest revenue, trading and other
revenue, and service fee revenue. These gains were offset in part by
increases in operating expense and a Dollars 60m provision for loan losses,
up from Dollars 45m.
Bankers Trust, the New York investment banking group, reported a 9 per cent
increase in earnings to Dollars 175m, or Dollars 2.02 a share, up from
Dollars 160m, or Dollars 1.85m, in the first quarter of last year.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman, said a broad range of businesses had
contributed to the increase, including asset management, fiduciary and
global finance.
Trading revenue was down 42 per cent from the Dollars 370m earned in last
year's first quarter.
Fiduciary and fund management revenue rose 15 per cent to Dollars 162m; fees
and commissions rose 18 per cent to Dollars 142m; and other non-interest
revenue rose from Dollars 9m to Dollars 63m, helped by gains from equity
investments. Non-interest expenses dropped 8 per cent to Dollars 535m.

UNISYS, the long-struggling US computer manufacturer, yesterday reported
much better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, boosting hopes for a
successful turnround after years of heavy losses.
Many analysts had projected a loss for the quarter but the company unveiled
net income of Dollars 48.3m, or 11 cents a share. In the same period last
year Unisys recorded net losses of Dollars 98.2m, or 79 cents.
The result was the second consecutive quarterly gain for the company, which
last year reduced its workforce by 10,000 and consolidated operations in an
effort to return to profit-ability.
First-quarter revenue slipped to Dollars 2.01bn, compared with Dollars
2.06bn in the year-earlier quarter.
However, the company pointed out that revenue had increased slightly after
the elimination of first-quarter 1991 revenue of Dollars 62m from its
Timeplex subsidiary, which the group had sold last June.
'We are very pleased with a solid first quarter which exceeded plans in all
key areas. The results are a clear indication that our turnaround actions
and product and marketing programmes are on track,' said Mr James Unruh,
chairman and chief executive.

FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Blockbuster in first payout
after 62% advance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLOCKBUSTER Entertain-ment, the fast-growing US video-retailing group,
yesterday reported a 62 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings. It also
began paying quarterly dividends with a payout of 2 cents, Bloomberg
reports.
Earnings for the quarter rose to Dollars 25.7m, or 15 cents a share, from
Dollars 15.9m, or 10 cents, in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose to
Dollars 253.9m from Dollars 176.7m.
Mr H. Wayne Huizenga, chairman, said: 'With the company's substantial cash
flow, we are in a position to pay our shareholders dividends and to continue
to fund the company's aggressive capital requirements.'
He attributed the improved results to expanded market growth, gains in
same-store revenue, continued emphasis on cost control and increased
productivity.
Blockbuster became the world's largest home video retailer following its
acquisition earlier this year of City-vision, the largest home video
operator in the UK.
Partly as a result of that acquisition, Philips Electronics invested Dollars
93m in Blockbuster common stock. Philips, a Dutch company, also holds an
option to acquire 5m additional shares of Blockbuster stock before December
15.
If Philips exercises the entire option, it would hold about 7.1 per cent of
the video company's outstanding shares, Blockbuster said.
At the end of the quarter, there were 2,829 Blockbuster video stores, of
which 1,805 were company owned and 1,024 franchised.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Brands, the US tobacco and drinks group, said fluctuations in
exchange rates for foreign currencies, principally sterling, had adversely
affected income by Dollars 11m, or 5 cents a share, in the latest quarter,
AP-DJ reports.
However, the group lifted first-quarter net income to Dollars 245.2m, from
Dollars 216m in the 1991 quarter. Earnings per share increased Dollars 1.18,
compared with Dollars 1.06. Revenues were Dollars 3.83bn, compared with
Dollars 3.86bn.
Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Each of our five core
businesses, as well as our specialty businesses group, reported higher
operating income in the quarter and an increase in operating margin.
'These results were achieved despite continued weak world economies, higher
taxes on tobacco and distilled spirits and the stronger US dollar,' Mr Alley
added.
American Brands said profits from tobacco, its largest core business, were
slightly ahead of year-earlier levels, in spite of a stronger dollar and an
increase in UK cigarette taxes.
The company's American Tobacco unit posted record revenues and operating
income, up 9 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. Total cigarette unit
sales rose 2.6 per cent, including exports, while domestic cigarette sales
rose 0.5 per cent.
The Franklin Life Insurance unit posted a 26 per cent increase in operating
income as a result of higher realised gains on investments.
Operating income in distilled spirits rose 41 per cent, reflecting the
acquisition by Jim Beam Brands of seven brands from Seagram.

FT  22 APR 92 / O&amp;Y says it will run out of cash in May: Property developer
seeks Pounds 100m loan to pay for next 90 days' work at Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the world's largest property developer, will run out of cash
at the beginning of May, according to information the group has supplied to
its bankers.
This deadline in O&amp;Y's battle to avoid filing for protection under
bankruptcy procedures emerged yesterday, as the group began a two-day series
of meetings with bankers in London, to persuade them to provide a new Pounds
100m loan to cover the costs for the next 90 days of work on the Canary
Wharf office development in London's Docklands.
A banker at the centre of negotiations with O&amp;Y warned yesterday that the
group would find it difficult to obtain the new bank loans it requires. 'It
is too early to say whether we will agree to put up the new money,' he said.
'There is no possibility of a decision today or tomorrow.'
O&amp;Y had been hoping that banks would agree this week to provide it with
Pounds 100m for Canary Wharf and a separate CDollars 100m (Pounds 47m) loan
for Canadian expenses. Mr Steve Miller, the partner of investment bank James
D Wolfensohn, who is in charge of O&amp;Y's bank negotiations, was in London
yesterday talking to the leading lenders to the Canary Wharf project.
A banker said the Pounds 100m required for Canary Wharf may not appear very
large, but that sum was forecast to cover expenses only for the 90 days
during which O&amp;Y hopes to complete its negotiations on a reorganisation of
all its CDollars 14.3bn debt. Over the next two years, it needs Pounds 350m
for Canary Wharf, described by the banker 'as a large sum of money'.
O&amp;Y was yesterday also holding talks with Canadian banks in Toronto. One
complication in its attempts to raise new money is that groups of banks are
at loggerheads over which of them should provide the funds.
Any new loans for Canary Wharf will come from the existing lenders to that
project. But there are two groups of lenders - one 'club' of 10
international banks which has provided Pounds 500m and another group of four
Canadian banks which have lent Pounds 450m. The club of 10, including
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Citicorp of the US, Credit Suisse of
Switzerland, Barclays of the UK and its rival Lloyds, is arguing that the
four Canadians, which include Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank
of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, should provide the lion's share of the
money because the Canadians have inferior security and therefore have the
most to lose if O&amp;Y were to collapse.
However, the Canadian banks are also being asked to provide the new money
for O&amp;Y's Canadian operations, putting a huge burden on them.
O&amp;Y has many different credit lines for different purposes in the UK, the US
and Canada. It has been trying to persuade its 100 banks to form 12
different negotiating groups.
In a separate development, Trilon Financial Corporation, a financial
services holding company, said yesterday that O&amp;Y has sold the bulk of its
9.5 per cent interest in the company to a pension fund. O&amp;Y is thought to
have raised around CDollars 65m from the disposal.

FT  22 APR 92 / Late accounts levies expected to hit 15% of UK companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 15 per cent of British companies will face automatic levies for late
filing of accounts from July, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
The levies will be in addition to the fines that can be imposed as a result
of criminal charges against individual directors for late filing of accounts
with Companies House. Directors from less than 1 per cent of late-filing
companies were prosecuted last year.
Public companies are obliged to file accounts within seven months of their
year-end, while private companies have another three months' grace.
A survey by Peat Marwick has revealed that more than 22,700 companies - a
mixture of public and private - were 10 months or more late in filing on
April 2. The firm suspects that many companies delay filing to avoid
exposing their financial difficulties to credit rating agencies and banks.
The firm looked at the 147,608 most active private and public companies in a
database established by ICC Lotus One Source and updated monthly from
Companies House records.
Under the new system, directors of the companies concerned will still face
personal fines of up to Pounds 2,000 for not submitting accounts.
Companies House has had little incentive to pursue offenders because of the
cost of prosecution and the fact that fines disappeared into central
government funds. The new system means companies will be obliged to pay
immediately and the penalties will go directly to offset Companies House
costs.
Companies House is no longer a government department but was devolved to an
agency under the government's Next Steps programme in 1988.
The levies will be imposed when accounts are received. A 1989 amendment to
the 1985 Companies Act makes the offence absolute, with no excuses
permitted. Court proceedings are not needed.
The penalties are banded for lateness of up to three, six, 12 and more than
12 months. They range from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,000 for private companies,
and from Pounds 500 to Pounds 5,000 for public companies.
On the basis of the Peat Marwick study, Companies House could receive Pounds
11.35m in penalties when accounts are finally submitted. Peat Marwick
carried out the study to find leads for its recovery services and considered
late filing might be an indicator of trouble. The numbers discovered
surprised the firm.
Mr Alan Benzie, Peat Marwick's managing partner in Manchester, said: 'Many
companies claim they are late because accounts have not been finalised, but
there are always some late filers who delay for tactical reasons.
'Filing makes public a business's profitability and liquidity, or lack of
such. This may affect credit rating and can therefore impact on a company's
chances of survival. In some cases, companies may wish to conceal an
auditor's qualification as to on-going viability.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE remnants of Afghanistan's government promised yesterday to hand over
control to mujahideen guerrillas but the rebel groups remain divided about
how to share power.
Acting president Abdul Rahim Hatif told a news conference the government was
ready to step down but 'the problem is that the mujahideen must unite
together' to allow a peaceful transfer of power.
At the same time a United Nations special envoy failed to persuade a
military chieftain to give deposed president Najibullah safe passage out of
the country. Najibullah was reported still to be sheltering in UN offices in
Kabul after being turned back in an attempt to leave Kabul airport last
week.
In spite of old rivalries, there are many signs of heavily armed mujahideen
groups and former government forces working together near Kabul. One army
colonel, grinning at several guerrillas, said he had been told two days ago
to co-operate with the mujahideen, though a year ago 'I would have killed
them'.
On a road littered with burnt-out army vehicles, a bus passed with
mujahideen riding on the roof, aiming to help the army reinforce security
against another rival mujahideen group.
The government has lost control of all big provincial cities except
Jalalabad in the east, where the mujahideen are negotiating with local
commanders.
A northern-based coalition of mujahideen forces under Ahmad Shah Masood, the
Jamiat-i-Islami leader who is a minority Tajik, has continued to extend its
sway over much of Afghanistan. His forces are based some 50 miles north of
Kabul.
But Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who heads the rival Hezb-i-Islami group and is a
member of the Pathan majority, has threatened to attack the capital if the
government does not capitulate by April 26. His forces are to the south of
Kabul.
Masood has said he will not attack Kabul while peace talks continue with the
government. Guerrillas loyal to him are alongside government troops south of
Kabul to block the advance of Hekmatyar, his bitter enemy.
Masood's coalition seemed in an increasingly strong position to impose the
type of radical mujahideen government that the UN and western governments
have resisted.
The UN special envoy, Mr Benon Sevan, who is striving for a peaceful
transfer of power, was reported to have flown to the northern town of
Mazar-i-Sharif yesterday to try to secure safe passage for ex-president
Najibullah. He had a meeting there with General Rashid Dostum, whose forces
control Kabul airport.
But the general, who abandoned Najibullah last month, was reported to have
complained to the UN envoy for sheltering the deposed president and demanded
that Najibullah be put on trial.
A diplomat said Mr Sevan's long search for peace in Afghanistan had finally
centred on persuading Najibullah to quit office and he felt personally
responsible for Najibullah's fate.
Diplomats expect Mr Sevan to pursue efforts to get Najibullah out of the
country.

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin closed the Congress of People's Deputies
yesterday with a frontal attack on the majority of deputies who had
threatened to sink his reform programme, and who have deprived him of a
constitution guaranteeing a strong presidency.
Warning of a 'constitutional crisis' in the country, Mr Yeltsin, in a
powerful and aggressive closing speech to the country's supreme law-making
body, said that 'the time of puppet governments is passed'.
Although the reform process was salvaged through a messy compromise, drafts
of a new constitution - including one which would have given Mr Yeltsin
sweeping powers to appoint governments - were not discussed.
Earlier yesterday, in an effort to compensate for the lack of a new
constitution, he had presented a draft bill to the parliament calling for
powers to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, who would then appoint
other ministers. According to the draft, he could overrule demands to sack
the prime minister by keeping him in power for a year, or by replacing him
himself.
'If the
Under a formula agreed last week, Mr Yeltsin had to bring forward a bill on
the reorganisation of the government within three months, and to appoint a
new prime minister to a cabinet which he himself currently heads - although
the present government would keep office until December. However, the draft
bill was not discussed yesterday, and now passes to the smaller parliament
where it is bound to be a divisive issue.
He told the deputies that they had achieved little in more than two weeks of
often acrimonious debates, citing their refusal to tackle the critical state
of agriculture and to pass a law allowing private ownership of land.
He hinted that he had been ready to go to the people with a referendum to
give him the powers he sought if the Congress had not backed down on the
issue of economic reform.
Implying that the former Communists in the Congress had mounted a concerted
attack on his government, he said that 'the nomenklatura reaction did not go
through at this congress' - adding that the calls from many deputies to
restore the Soviet Union were 'demands for the creation of the parallel
structures of a second power'.
In a final kick against Mr Yeltsin, the Congress refused even to discuss
another bill tabled by him on Monday demanding that he be given the right to
appoint the central bank chairman - presently responsible to the parliament.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament speaker, said such a proposal would
never succeed while he was in the chair.

FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: Property contracts should be binding, and remain so
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D J LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We have under our management a large cross-section of property and deal
with a substantial number of assignments within portfolios over any given
period of time. We note with considerable concern the various proposals that
emerge from time to time, not least from the CBI (Letters, April 10), that
the contract between landlord and tenant shall be varied purely on the basis
of an assignment, whereby assignors might be relieved of their covenants if
an assignee defaults.
The terms of a contract freely entered into by the parties concerned will
remain exactly that. When a tenant signs a lease it is a contract for a
given period of time and is negotiated at arm's length. If the tenant then
seeks to sell that interest to a third party, it does not alter the contract
already entered into. The landlord, when approached for consent to an
assignment, has strictly limited powers to refuse such proposals. The
landlord chooses his tenant; he does not choose the tenant's subsequent
purchaser.
If there was any proposal to change the present privity of contract then it
most certainly should not be retrospective and must only be allowed to apply
in the case of leases granted after the law was changed. In that event, a
landlord should have power to require a direct covenant from his tenant that
he will remain liable under his covenant or an absolute power to approve or
not approve assignments. The landlord should not be put into a position
whereby, through no fault of his own, he finds the freely entered into
contract ends up between parties not of his choosing with financial
implications beyond his control.
Tenants usually assign leases for a premium which they receive and spend.
The landlord does not receive the benefit of such premiums. If the law was
amended on the basis that any premiums were put into a joint account
available to meet any subsequent default, then it might be possible to
accept some change. However, freely negotiated contracts should remain
without interference. Tenants are already protected under the Landlord and
Tenant 1954 Act and have security of tenure; so, if they are concerned, they
are perfectly able either to negotiate shorter leases or break clauses.
Any proposal that seeks to interfere with the freely negotiated contracts
would be a very retrograde step in whichever sector it might apply.

A couple of hundred alternatives later, the proud name GMTV was yesterday
revealed to the world.
No, it's not the internal communication station for General Motors or even a
rival to Granada in Greater Manchester. Having won the commercial breakfast
franchise from TV-am, Sunrise Television has decided to change its name 'to
avoid confusion with BSkyB's breakfast programme'.
To avoid a writ, more like. Sky News calls its breakfast segment Sunrise and
isn't likely to beam on any namesake.
The arduous task to find a name viewers won't choke on naturally involved an
opinion poll and the chewing over of focus groups; three dozen were
seriously considered and a short list of six exhaustively researched.
After that little hiccup, what about the programme?
'Good Morning' to you all.

Is Bob Worcester, ubiquitous chairman of pollsters MORI, taking refuge in an
ivory tower so as to ponder the lamentable failure of his 'science'?
Hard on the heels of the polling industry's election reversal, the London
School of Economics is making Worcester visiting professor of government -
his contribution will be a year's worth of lectures on public opinion. 'He
was very keen to come,' says an LSE spokesman, adding that the institution's
social scientists might have some valuable input into his line of market
research.
Many a political scholar would be quicker to acknowledge Worcester's
business skills than his academic talents. Honorary visiting professor of
journalism at the City University (since 1990) is one thing, they sniff. But
visiting professor of government . . .
His students will eagerly await his considered conclusions on the lesson of
April 1992 - a rather more honest assessment, it is to be hoped, than the
version so far doled out to the country at large.

Dodgy estate agents, Arthur Daleys and funeral directors massacring their
industry code of practice had better watch their step. John Mills, the new
director of consumer affairs at the Office of Fair Trading, will be down on
them with all the authority of one with three years in the prime minister's
Policy Unit under his belt.
The consumer world appeared bemused at yesterday's appointment. 'Who he?',
the chorus echoed, disappointed that the job should have gone to a civil
servant rather than a high-profile consumer advocate.
A career civil servant, Mills has spent most of his life at the Department
of Trade and Industry. It was during his stint in the telecom- munications
and posts division between 1985 and 1989 that he almost certainly came to
the attention of Sir Bryan Carsberg, the UK's telecoms regulator who is
about to become director general of Fair Trading.
Still, Mills can already claim some credit for assisting the consumer of
public services. He was Downing Street's man at the Adam Smith Institute
seminar in February 1991 which launched the PM's big idea, the Citizen's
Charter.

It would be wrong to read Derek Bonham's appointment as Hanson's chief
executive as just a sop to City opinion. It is a much more significant move
than last October's 'strengthening' of the board by the addition of a few
tame non-executive directors.
Bonham has been made chief executive of the whole group and not just the UK
bit, and although it is hard to imagine Lord White taking orders from the
48-year-old chief executive, time is on Bonham's side. It is early days yet
but the combination of him and David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson's US
operations, could develop into a sensible replacement for the elderly Lords
Hanson and White.
However, Bonham will need to make his mark fairly soon, if he is to convince
the City that anything has changed. Obviously, he can't kick Lord Hanson
upstairs as life president just yet, but perhaps he will be able to dump
some of the head office hangers-on.
On the other hand, it's not good news for the young Honourable Robert
Hanson's prospects.

FT  22 APR 92 / Observer: Asprey's jewel of the north
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain may be in the grips of its worst recession since the 1930s but the
House of Asprey, owners of the world's most expensive gift-shop, seems to be
on a Ratners-style expansion binge.
First it gobbled up crown jeweller Garrard, and Paris's exclusive Rene
Boivin not to mention Mappin &amp; Webb. Now it has pocketed Hamilton &amp; Inches,
Edinburgh's royal silversmiths and official repairers of the Calcutta Cup.
When Asprey began buying up the opposition just under two years ago its
market capitalisation was less than half the size of Gerald Ratner's family
firm. Capitalised at over Pounds 200m, the 211-year-old Asprey is now five
times as big as poor old Gerald's outfit, and its appetite is not yet sated.
'We are in our prime; I am very bullish,' says Naim Attallah, the well-known
publisher who doubles up as Asprey's joint managing director.
Like all good jewellers he refuses to disclose how much he has paid for his
' pearl of the North'. The target was under-capitalised and feeling the
recession, and Asprey could hardly turn down the chance of picking up
Scotland's crown jewellers. However, Attallah insists that his firm is not
over-expanding like Ratners. For a start he has no debt and close to Pounds
20m of cash in the bank. With Sears maintaining a protective stake Asprey
seems safe enough for the moment.

FT  22 APR 92 / Leading Article: Chilly spring in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOWERING cherry trees and the faint stirring of a US recovery make
Washington a welcome destination for the recession-weary. But the finance
ministers of the world's leading industrialised countries will not find any
soothing remedies at the coming week's jamboree. The world's economic
problems are largely home grown; they require domestic action, not
co-operative inaction.
The exchange rate co-ordinating role of G7 summits has all but died. Managed
world exchange rates have been replaced by domestically oriented monetary
policies. And a good thing it is too. The US authorities' attempts to manage
the rise and fall of the dollar effectively by manipulating Japanese
interest rates were in large part responsible for its subsequent boom-bust
cycle.
Some of the old rhetoric remains. The US will call for other countries to
follow its lead and cut interest rates aggressively. Japan will cautiously
agree, while fretting about the value of the yen. But Germany, the new
bugbear of the US growth lobby, will rightly point to its domestic
inflationary problem as a reason for keeping its interest rates high,
regardless of the wishes of the US administration. The rest of Europe will
sit in glum silence.
Fiscal consolidation
Benign G7 summits may avoid monetary policy errors; but they may also act as
an excuse for necessary action elsewhere. The need for fiscal consolidation
is unlikely to figure strongly in the forthcoming discussions. Instead, a
communique will stress the desirability of sustainable non-inflationary
growth and low world real interest rates. The IMF will produce yet another
report forecasting a world recovery next year. Everyone will feel a little
better; no one will be any the wiser; and the chances of a strong world
recovery will remain remote.
Yet the fiscal irrectitude of certain G7 governments is now an even greater
problem for world economic growth than in the late 1980s. The US, UK and
Japan have no choice but to deflate away their heavy private sector debt
burdens, having rightly, if bravely, eschewed the inflation route. But the
pain, for these countries, and indeed for debtors everywhere, is made more
severe by the current high level of world real interest rates that developed
country budget deficits have brought.
The US is the most experienced fiscal profligate. Because it failed to close
the budget gap in the late 1980s, despite rapid economic growth, fiscal
policy has not been available to kick-start the current sluggish recovery.
Even if Congress had agreed to the president's proposed fiscal package, the
result would have been higher long-term interest rates.
Ostensible culprit
Little wonder that the US administration has looked elsewhere to source its
pre-election recovery. But the European economy is unlikely to oblige. The
ostensible culprit is the European exchange rate mechanism, which is keeping
interest rates painfully high. But it is irresponsible fiscal policy, this
time in Germany, that is once more to blame.
The German government has failed to build a consensus around the need to pay
for the reconstruction of east Germany. Instead of tax increases and west
German spending cuts, they have paid the bills by large-scale borrowing,
increasingly through off-budget financing vehicles. The Bundesbank has had
no option but to push up interest rates to offset the resulting inflationary
pressures. The ERM has exported these high rates, and the unemployment they
bring, across Europe.
The world economy remains on a knife-edge. It needs lower interest rates to
fuel economic growth, and soon. Slow or no growth makes it politically
difficult for the G7 to tackle the other issues they face: aid for the
former Soviet republics, trade liberalisation, relief for debt-burdened
Africa.
Yet European interest rates, and US long rates, are unlikely to fall until
the structural component of the US and German deficits are brought back into
balance. Japan can and should cut interest rates further. The UK has room
for a half-point cut. But Europe looks set to face high real interest rates
throughout 1993 until either Germany shows signs of bringing its fiscal
deficit under control, or the ERM crumbles under the strain. The former
would be preferable; the latter looks increasingly possible.

FT  22 APR 92 / Tax wizard takes over the helm at Hanson / Derek Bonham
talks about his new role as chief executive of the Anglo-American
conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's appointment of Mr Derek Bonham to the newly created post of chief
executive begs a simple question: what does the job entail? For the
Anglo-American conglomerate, run by Lords Hanson and White, has never before
named a second in command.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Bonham, sporting a Hanson tie and tanned
after spending the weekend with the two lords in Beverly Hills, said the job
would be 'whatever I can create out of it'.
He was unequivocal that his remit extended across both sides of the
Atlantic. Just as he had been the group's financial director, spending a
large amount of his time in the US, so he will now be in charge of managing
Hanson's worldwide businesses - including those in the US.
This makes the position of chief executive the most senior post ever created
within the conglomerate. Mr Bonham said the reason was to make it clear to
investors that the management structure would be in place for the rest of
the decade, given the advancing years of the two lords. He also believes it
will deter other companies from taking a lead from Imperial Chemical
Industries - in which Hanson has a 2.8 per cent stake - and attacking the
group for its poor corporate governance.
'All the ducks are now in the right place,' said Mr Bonham. 'James (Lord
Hanson) is a very youthful 70-year-old but he wants to make sure the younger
team is in place under him.'
Mr Bonham, recruited to Hanson in 1971 by Mr Brian Hellings, senior director
responsible for finance in the US, became a board member in 1981. In such a
sweeping managerial reshuffle Mr Bonham conceded that the role of other
Hanson executives would change.
Lord Hanson, who has traditionally managed the businesses, is to leave more
day-to-day decisions to his new chief executive. 'Lord Hanson is to have
more of an ambassadorial role, to which he is ideally suited. I plan to take
a lot of the managerial work, including meeting with the institutional
investors, off his shoulders,' said Mr Bonham.
Indeed, Mr Bonham believes Lord Hanson may decide to become a non-executive
chairman. Whatever the outcome, he is confident that one man will not hold
the reins of chief executive and chairman at Hanson again.
Lord White, who has already delegated much of the daily running of the US
businesses to his deputy, Mr David Clarke, will continue to have a roving
brief trying to spot the next acquisitions, which Mr Bonham believes are
likely to be in continental Europe.
Mr Bonham said Mr Clarke, Lord White's chief executive and deputy in the US,
would continue to have an 'enormous job'.
In describing what could be a difficult relationship - Mr Clarke yesterday
suggested Mr Bonham's remit would not extend to what he called Lord White's
domain - Mr Bonham used the current partnership between Lords Hanson and
White as an example of how he sees the partnership between the two
developing.
'A good chunk of what I am doing is based over here. But there are no rigid
boxes and there has to be integration between the US and the UK. Just as
James is chairman of the group so I am chief executive of Hanson plc.'
The appointment is bound to be something of a disappointment to Mr Tony
Alexander, the 53-year-old chief operating officer in the UK. Mr Bonham said
he would continue to manage the UK businesses.
One of Hanson's financial advisers commented of Mr Bonham's appointment:
'This underpins the importance not just of tax wizardry but of tough
financial controls and squeezing as much cash as possible out of the
businesses.'
Such a view was an over-simplification, said Mr Bonham. As the architect of
Hanson's tax policy, which led to the group paying one of the lowest
corporation tax charges in the FT-SE 100 top companies, Mr Bonham is anxious
not to exaggerate the important of finance. But he said: 'Finance is the
largest part of the Hanson head office.'

FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: A Dead Secret
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
There is nothing like death to revive a reputation. Rodney Ackland, one of
the most subtly provocative playwrights of the century, was blasted into
oblivion by Look Back in Anger and the obsession with 'realistic' drama in
the 1950s. He died, virtually forgotten, last year. Now his plays are
everywhere, especially if everywhere includes Richmond. Currently you can
see his brooding 1943 masterpiece The Dark River at the new and enlarged
Orange Tree, while around the corner at the refurbished Richmond Theatre is
his earlier work, A Dead Secret.
On the surface this was a play of its time (the early 1930s), a safe
pot-boiler for weekly reps - a solid fictionalisation of the case of the
arsenic poisoner Frederick Seddon.
In his programme notes the director, Roger Redfarn, reminisces how he first
appeared on the stage as the second, totally silent, totally unnecessary,
constable, who in the final minute appears to arrest the Seddon character.
Even today this touring production fills the stage with a solidly satisfying
set, an Edwardian villa down to the aspidistra and stained glass, and
stretching up two floors, plus a throng of actors. But while much is
familiar and unexceptional, Ackland, always an outsider, unsettles the
progression of a predictable plot with a brooding uncertainty. Did Seddon,
here called Frederick Dyson and played by Edward Woodward, murder his rich
lodger or was he the victim of his miserly, self-righteous, bigoted,
character?
While lesser playwrights would have forced up the temperature with an
on-stage murder, or a combative court scene, Ackland concentrates on the
character of Dyson. We only learn in an aside that Maria Lummus (Vivienne
Martin) has died. This is the dissection of an ordinary man, with banal
vices, caught in extraordinary circumstances.
Everything revolves around Woodward - known to clerk and servant as 'The
Great I Am'. Unfortunately he only takes full command of the role in the
third act. Then the earlier longeurs are seen to be the fault of
performances rather than of play. Woodward is considerably bolstered by
Michele Dotrice, a decent woman still besotted with her warped husband, and
by Auriol Smith as the batty maid. Even the children are credible in a play
which works at one level as an exposure of pre-1914 lower middle class
gentility and at another as a clue-ridden detective story.
In the final moment you start to feel sorry for Dyson, concerned at his
fate. And you realise how clever Ackland has been at balancing the need of
an audience for a spine tingling melodrama and his own desire to create a
character of classically tragic stature.
Richmond Theatre until 18 April, then on tour.

<DATELINE>
   HOW SAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
almost unbelievable - to have lost Benny Hill and Frankie Howerd, the last
two great clowns of their generation, probably (as it seems at the time of
writing) on the same day.
Happily Hill had at least lived long enough to see his show restored to ITV
where, even as a repeat, it was once again winning big ratings. A few years
ago he was taken off British screens thanks to the influence of feminists
and politically correct 'alternative' comedians who, in the mindless mantra
of the times, accused him of 'sexism'.
The continued and growing popularity of his old series, with their pantomime
humour and simple comic songs, in 100 countries overseas must have helped
sustain his pride and eventually persuaded Thames TV of the absurdity of
suppressing his work in his own country. Scarcely changing in nearly 40
years (Hill was 67) his shows had unparalleled success in attracting huge
audiences for both BBC and ITV. Only Morecambe and Wise came anywhere near
his long term popularity.
Howerd (who was born Howard, in York not London, though he grew up in
Eltham, and according to his manager was 75 and not 70 when he died on
Sunday) was much less identified with television. He was clearly most
comfortable performing with a live audience.
At the Garrick in London's West End two years ago he had the audience,
consisting almost entirely of teenagers, working for him like a chorus. 'No,
please] It's not funny', he would say, pursing those expressive lips and
nodding his head back towards his accompanist, and the audience would finish
the line with him: 'It's wicked to mock the afflicted]' With a silly beam he
would ask 'Isn't it whimsical?' And then, with a frown,'Isn't it?' and the
chorus chanted 'Well, please yourselves'.
It is easy to describe his routine but, as with all great stand-up
comedians, impossible to analyse its success. How did Howerd make 'Ooh no,
missus]' so funny? His television work, notably as Lurcio the slave in Up
Pompeii, was as vulgar as anything Hill ever style of Max Miller; they
challenged you to admit to the mischief in your own mind. However rare
Howerd's television appearances, they will be terribly missed. With Eric
Morecambe and Tommy Cooper already gone, Hill and Howerd represented just
about the last of a great line.
                        *       *       *
Channel controllers clearly consider Easter a good time for bringing out
enormously long programmes. Did you sit right through the four hours five
minutes of The Undeclared War on BBC2? I tried, really I did. Marcel Ophuls
has proved with Le Chagrin et La Pitie and Hotel Terminus that the French
can make huge engrossing documentaries about their wartime experiences, and
several of Bernard Tavernier's feature films (especially Life And Nothing
But, shown by BBC2 on Monday) have been extraordinarily powerful. So his
vast documentary about French conscript experience in the Algerian war might
have been compelling, but actually it sent me to sleep. Three times.
How about Jana Bokova's Argentinian Journey, shown in Arena? At least this
was split into three episodes, each lasting 60 minutes on successive nights,
but it, too, had me nodding by the time we were introduced to the umpteenth
ethnic drummer in Part 3.
To be fair, Bokova's visual style has a stark purity which you rarely find
these days outside the work of still photographers, and her pictures of
Argentina were beautiful and deeply involving. But the drumming was so much
more monotonous and unimpressive than the guitar playing.
                        *       *       *
There is perpetual talk about the death of the single play on television,
yet BBC2 has just completed a run of 12 single dramas in the Screen Two
series which has proved what a virile form it remains.
Titles in March and April have included Truly, Madly, Deeply with Juliet
Stevenson's endearing performance as a young woman who recalls her lover as
a ghost; The Last Romantics in which Nigel Williams somehow fashioned the
Quiller-Couch/Leavis cultural war into a readily comprehensible drama; and
this week, in a fitting climax, an adaptation of Muriel Spark's Memento Mori
which was like an OAP victory parade: Michael Hordern, Stephanie Cole, Thora
Hird, Cyril Cusack, Maurice Denham, all were superb. It will be astonishing
and pleasing if 1992 produces any drama to beat this for sheer enjoyment.
                        *       *       *
We are told that the BBC is thinking of employing Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to
advertise its programmes because The Camomile Lawn on Channel 4 achieved an
audience of 7.9m following a Pounds 100,000 advertising campaign. This is a
bit like saying that Rodney died two minutes after drinking a cup of tea,
without mentioning that he was run down by a bus. What The Camomile Lawn
argument omits is that the drama starred Felicity Kendal and featured lots
of rumpy-pumpy. Advertising or no advertising, it would have attracted a big
audience.
                        *       *       *
Anna Raphael's programme about the model and would-be guru 'Rytasha' in
Channel 4's True Stories was a beautifully straight-faced put-down of what
appears to be an outrageous example of superciliousness and hypocrisy. This
latter-day Lady Bountiful swans about Bangladesh distributing charity
collected from the bickering matrons of Palm Beach and having her feet
bathed by her 'disciples'. However, the programme offered yet another
example of the disadvantages in having neither on-screen reporter nor even a
voice-over: surely every viewer wanted to know why this woman wears such
weird turquoise contact lenses, and why she has two black dots on the end of
her uncannily pointed nose.
                        *       *       *
How despicable of politician John Gummer to attack the BBC for screening a
programme - Heart Of The Matter - giving a platform to those clergymen who
discount the supernatural elements of Christianity and see the old stories,
such as the resurrection, as metaphor.
Day in day out, year in year out, the BBC serves as chief proselytiser for
Christianity in Britain, despite the fact that Christians are not even the
largest church-going group any more. In a country which aspires to freedom
of expression and plurality of views it is a disgrace that the national
broadcasting organisation should align itself with just one of the popular
religions. You can imagine the fuss politicians would make if the BBC
aligned itself with just one political party. Yet here is Gummer attacking
the Corporation for providing one programme which, even though it is
concerned solely with Christianity, does not happen to reinforce the beliefs
of his particular faction.

Carlos Fuentes and directed by some of the best people in the business:
Michael Gill ('Civilisation' etc), Peter Newington ('Monitor' etc), and
Christopher Ralling ('The Voyage Of Charles Darwin' etc). In this opening
programme Fuentes looks at the mixture of people that created the Latin
Americans: Spaniards, Arabs, Jews, Indians and Negroes, ranging from Vera
Cruz to Altamira.
BBC2 starts a three-part dramatisation of the comic thriller Mr Wakefield's
Crusade, by Booker Prize winner Bernice Rubens. Wakefield is played by Peter
Capaldi and the cast also includes Richard Griffiths (9.40).
Sean's Show (10.00 C4) becomes ever more tortuous. Comedian Sean Hughes, who

FT  22 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Backlash in golden state -
After years of leading the green movement, Californians have had enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bush, who promised in 1988 to be America's 'environmental
president,' has hardly mentioned the words during his current re-election
campaign. Instead of proposing new environmental initiatives, the president
now talks of balancing environmental protection measures with economic
repercussions.
This change of heart by Bush, and the apparent lack of enthusiasm for the
subject among other presidential candidates, reflects a growing
disenchantment with environmental regulation in the US.
This is particularly evident in California, the state which led the
environmental movement in the 1980s. There are now rumblings of a 'green
backlash' as businesses and consumers count the costs of protecting the
environment.
Despite broad interest in environmental issues, Californians tend to resent
government regulation, whether it comes from Washington or from Sacramento,
the state capital. The more intrusive these regulations get, the stronger
the feeling against them.
California's rejection of 'Big Green', a sweeping environmental regulation
initiative on the 1990 ballot, signalled the trend. Today, Californians are
increasingly concerned that strict environmental codes will drive businesses
out of the state, with a subsequent loss of jobs and slowing of economic
growth; this at a time when the 'golden state' is taking the brunt of a
nationwide economic recession.
The northern spotted owl, a rare bird that makes its home in old-growth
redwood forests, has become the symbol of debate over the environment versus
the economy. Thousands of lumber jobs in the Pacific Northwest are
threatened by logging limits imposed to protect the owl's habitat.
Yet the spotted owl is only one example of how conservation rules can be at
odds with the community. The livelihoods of West Coast commercial fishermen
are now at stake as the state this month moved to limit fishing hauls all
along the coast to protect the future of a dwindling salmon species.
Then there is the case of the 'delta smelt', a little fish that swims in the
waters of the San Jaoquin River in Northern California, a prime source of
water for the state's central valley farmers and residents of the Los
Angeles region.
The delta smelt could soon be declared an endangered species, requiring
expensive changes to the complex systems that shift water from Northern
California to the south. To date the State Water Resources Board has
struggled to satisfy legal requirements to protect fish and wildlife but has
been reluctant to impose standards that thwart an economy fuelled by
diversions of fresh water.
Now California's governor, Pete Wilson, has intervened with proposed new
regulations intended to keep the smelt and other species alive long enough
to figure out how California can have its water and fauna too. But a
proposed reservoir that would hold winter rain run-off and reduce the amount
of water that is currently pumped from the San Jaoquin delta  - to the
detriment of the smelt - has also run into a problem.
The planned site turns out to be home to a single family of rare kit foxes.
It is not only big state-funded projects that are stymied by environmental
concerns. Home builders and commercial developers are increasingly faced
with the discovery, often by anti-growth activists, of some rare animal or
plant that throws up a legal brick wall in the path of planning permission.
Endangered species are only part of the problem. Critics charge that
environmental regulations designed to reduce California air pollution are
wrapping businesses in red tape. Business executives claim that the cost of
complying with some of the rules set by the Los Angeles South Coast Air
Quality Management District far outweigh environmental benefits.
For example, large employers in the region are required to persuade
employees to use carpools or to find alternative non-polluting transport.
But McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace company, estimates that it will have to
spend Dollars 2.5m on incentive programmes to increase vehicle occupancy
among company employees to an average of 1.5 to meet the SCAQMD's
requirements.
Worse, the company suspects that this expenditure will have no long-term
effects. Last year, for example, McDonnell Douglas loaned new bicycles to
employees willing to ride to work. Although the company provided more than
200 bikes, all but about 50 participants in the programme reverted to
driving. The programme cost Dollars 100,000.
However, small businesses are the most vociferous critics of air quality
regulators. Dry cleaners, furniture manufacturers, car painters, restaurants
and other businesses must meet strict environmental codes in California. But
sometimes the rules backfire.
Last year, the SCAQMD tried to impose its air pollution regulations on Los
Angeles's 'rib joints', barbecue restaurants that are popular in many
communities. The regulators' efforts to cut air pollution from rib joints
got the kind of response that a sudden ban on 'chippies' might receive in
the north of England. It was quickly dropped.
There is also growing disillusionment in California with recycling. Although
sorting waste, in the office and the home, into paper, glass, plastic and
aluminium 'recyclables' has become habitual in many parts of the state,
there is mounting evidence that this does little to protect the environment.
Recycling programmes have produced a huge supply of paper, glass and plastic
waste but there are few plants that can turn this rubbish into something
useful. Aluminium is the only recyclable that pays its way - it is cheaper
to produce new cans from old than to make them from scratch.
Although manufacturers of many consumer products label packaging as
'recyclable', few use recycled materials themselves. Sorting rubbish into
recycling bins is also becoming a chore. Before disposing of an empty jar of
peanut butter, for example, it must be cleaned thoroughly, which requires
copious amounts of hot water and soap. The label must also be scraped off.
In addition, clear glass must be sorted from coloured glass. And it will
only be truly 'recyclable' if everyone else on the street has been equally
careful so that the load on the 'environmental truck' that collects weekly
is not contaminated. That assumes that the waste disposal company can find a
buyer.
If that is not enough to dent the enthusiasm of would-be environmentalists,
then last summer's call to ease air pollution by not lighting backyard
barbecues - a staple of the California diet - certainly was. Marin County's
talk of banning perfumes in public places also raised more publicity than
action.
The final straw came last December when San Francisco air quality regulators
issued a call for residents to forego the traditional glow of burning logs
in the grate over Christmas. But, like good environmentally-aware citizens,
Californians 'recycled' their Christmas trees in January. It was, after all,
the easiest way to dispose of them.

FT  22 APR 92 / Jobs: Executives' guide to powerful politicking - US
professor spells out lessons on a branch of management that management
schools rarely teach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPOSE you've just been made a senior manager, and can choose the location
of your office on the palatial top floor of group headquarters. Which of the
following pair would you pick?
A - A big one at the outside of the building, whose windows command a
glorious view of the surrounding city and countryside.
B - A smaller one opening on to a corridor directly opposite the door to the
executive lavatories.
As a general rule, American management professor Jeffrey Pfeffer would pick
the second. That was where he had his room at the University of California's
Berkeley business school before his elevation to its more famous counterpart
at Stanford.
The site of the office meant that every day everyone in the building who
mattered, 'except those with very strong kidneys', would pass his door. He
always kept it open of course. 'People who are well placed in the
communication network also tend to be the central players in terms of power
and influence,' he observes in his latest book. Called Managing with Power*,
it's the best guide to organisational politicking that the Jobs column has
ever read.
* Harvard Business School Press (Boston, MA 02163). Dollars 24.95
Mind you, he would not advise the same choice of site in all cases. Much
depends on the style of the organisation. In the hierarchical sort with
power concentrated at the top - General Motors is his example - the big
office with breath-taking vista is usually the cannier option. The smaller
one with leak-taking ambience is more likely to be advantageous in less
formally structured outfits, such as Apple Computer. But there are many
other factors that will determine which choice is best in any given set of
circumstances.
Indeed, the fact that politicking is a subtle and demanding craft is the
book's main message. In a text of 345 pages, I could find only one specific,
universally applicable rule: if you have two proposals to put before a
decisive meeting, present the stronger second.
The professor nevertheless argues that all of us must learn the craft if we
want to succeed, and often even survive, as executives. '. . .to get things
done, you need power - more power than those whose opposition you must
overcome - and thus it is imperative to understand where power comes from
and how these sources of power can be developed,' he says. Other
imperatives, once it is acquired, are the know-how to hang onto it, and the
will as well as the technical finesse to use it.
That is so even though most people find the idea of politicking distasteful,
believing that 'if we do our best, work hard, be nice, and so forth, things
will work out for the best.' Alas, experience shows they usually won't. So
the watchword should be: whenever you're not using power in your own favour,
someone else will be using it all the more effectively against you.
Jeffrey Pfeffer divides the process of acquiring the craft into steps,
starting with the recognition that there are varying interests in virtually
every organisation. 'This suggests that one of the first things we need to
do is to diagnose the political landscape and figure out what the relevant
interests are, and what important political subdivisions characterise the
organization . . . .'
For instance, if you are un-expectedly offered an important job high in a
company, don't take it as proof of your personal brilliance. Before
accepting, mull over the likely motives of those making the offer. They may
well have a hidden agenda; if so, there'll be pitfalls that need
investigating.
Nor is it enough just to identify the motives and perspectives of the
clusters of allied and opposing interests. Successful politicking also
requires analysis to find why the different factions hold their particular
attitudes.
The ego must not be allowed to colour the analysis. 'It is all too easy to
assume that those with a different perspective are somehow not as smart as
we are, not as informed, not as perceptive.' That sort of pride most often
goes before a fall, the professor says . One of the prime traits of
effective power-wielders is 'the ability to submerge one's ego in the effort
to get something accomplished', not least because the 'real secret of
success in organizations is the ability to get those who differ from us, and
whom we don't necessarily like, to do what needs to be done.'
After the outfit's political dynamics have been identified, he recommends a
seven-stage process of personal review. It goes:
1 - Decide what your goals are, what you are trying to accomplish.
2 - Diagnose patterns of dependence and interdependence; what individuals
are influential and important to achieving your goal?
3 - What are their points of view likely to be? How will they feel about
what you are trying to do?
4 - What are their power bases. Which of them is more influential in the
decision?
5 - What are your bases of power and influence? What bases of influence can
you develop to gain more control over the situation?
6 - Which of the various strategies and tactics for exercising power seem
most appropriate and are likely to be effective, given the situation you
confront?
7 - Based on the above, choose a course of action to get something done.
As for the strategies and tactics, to judge from the numerous cases that
Jeffrey Pfeffer cites to support his thesis, he takes an exceedingly broad
view. It is that, provided you can satisfy your own conscience that your
goal is of over-riding importance, any means that work to the said end will
do.
Blatant toadying is one example, although research suggests that it is most
extravagant in outfits under little or no pressure of competition. In
General Motors' heyday, for instance, one of its top men went to visit a
plant whose own chiefs were eager for his favour. Knowing he liked
late-night snacks, they sent a refrigerator full of delicacies to his hotel
room, but it was too big to go through the door. So they had a crew with a
crane remove the window, hoist in the goodies, and replace the pane.
Such little gestures of affection, however, are not always enough to turn
the trick. At the opposite extreme, there will be occasions when the only
way forward is to gain means of forcing dissenters to toe the line on pain
of ejection. In which case, it seems that serious operators don't hesitate
to hit their opponents when they're down.
The book cites an ambitious Wall Street manager who, after long temporising
with his main rival, suddenly decided the time was ripe to drive him out.
The reason was that the competitor had just been through surgery for a brain
tumour that had come on top of a painful and public divorce.
As the professor says, successful politicking rarely coincides with a yen to
be universally liked.
Even so, it is wise to stop short of becoming an absolute tyrant - a
condition which, in the Jobs column's experience, tends to lead to blindness
to the politics seething below. Over the years, several company despots have
sworn to me that no such activity exists in their organisation, on the lines
of the ancient tyrant who, when advised on his death bed to forgive his
enemies, replied: 'There aren't any. I hanged them all.'
My impression that the most dangerous politics are the unseen variety is
confirmed by Jeffrey Pfeffer. However long you've ruled unchallenged, he
says: 'Never underestimate your opponents. If you prepare too carefully, and
take too many precautions, you may waste some effort. But if you
underestimate what you are up against, you can lose, and losing even one
battle may signal the decline of your power.'

FT  22 APR 92 / Television campaign by ITV watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING AN advertising break last night on ITV the Independent Television
Commission launched a promotion of itself.
The first of a series of three advertisements was on the issue of
impartiality. It not only turned an argument on nuclear power on its head
but turned a head on its head - with its image of a face that could be
viewed from top or bottom.
The copyline ran: 'We're here to ITC you get both sides of the story,' in a
reference to the commission's regulatory role in ensuring that impartiality
rules are obeyed throughout commercial television.
Another 30-second advertisement will show a child grimacing in response to a
violent scene on television. It aims to explain the commission's role in
monitoring the 9pm watershed, after which programmes with more adult content
can be shown. The advertisement, depicting a shooting, is itself so violent
that it can be shown only after 9pm.
The third strand of the campaign will show how the commission ensures that
the rules on honest advertising are adhered to - 'We're here to ITC you
aren't misled.'
The campaign, devised by Duckworth, Finn, Grubb, Waters, the advertising
agency, would cost Pounds 500,000 at normal airtime rates. However, the
commission has the right to free promotional airtime.
It decided to go ahead with the campaign after discovering that in spite of
the publicity during last year's tenders for ITV franchises, barely 10 per
cent of the public knew anything about the regulatory body.

FT  22 APR 92 / Election boost to housing market reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEBUILDERS and estate agents say there has been a modest improvement in
interest from prospective house buyers since the Conservative general
election victory.
Some agents report that the number of people visiting show houses and other
properties for sale rose by up to 20 per cent over the two weekends since
polling day, compared with the weekend prior to April 9.
This period included Easter weekend when sales are usually higher. Estate
agents, nonetheless, said they were encouraged by the rise in interest.
Mrs Sandy Pearce, sales manager of south London estate agents Linay &amp; Shipp,
said the outcome of the election 'was the right result for the property
market'. She added: 'House buyers had been worried about the impact a Labour
government might have on taxation and interest rates. That uncertainty has
been removed and confidence among prospective buyers has risen. I am very
encouraged.'
Mr John Evans of the Nationwide estate agency in Chester also believed that
the Tory victory had given a fillip to the housing market.
'People who had been sitting on the fence and delaying exchanging contracts
have in the past two weeks decided finally to go ahead and take the plunge,'
he said.
Estate agents were, however, reluctant to talk of the possibility of a
sustained recovery. They said that sales had staged a similar improvement
last year after the Gulf war only to fall sharply again as summer
approached.
Mr Andrew Spittle, a partner of James &amp; Lister Lea in West Midlands, said
prices were still falling in some instances and would remain under pressure
while there was such a backlog of unsold properties on the market.
He said that interest from buyers had risen since the beginning of this year
and had improved further since the election, but that there was still a lot
of slack in the market.
Housebuilders also remained cautious. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman of
Persimmon, a builder based in the north of England, said the company had
made a solid start to the year which was continuing. But it was too early to
say whether the outcome of the election would lead to a longer term
improvement.
Mr Richard Fraser, chairman and chief executive of Westbury, the
Cheltenham-based building group, said: 'We are encouraged by the performance
since the election and over Easter which has gone slightly better than we
expected.'
Mr David Holland, chief executive of Wimpey Homes, the UK's second-largest
housebuilder, said: 'Our sales this year have been running about 10 per cent
above the corresponding period last year. There was a fall-off during the
run-up to the election, but sales have picked up again since polling day.'

Sir, Congratulations on your pre-election editorial, concluding, marginally,
with advice to vote Labour. Not that I agreed with you; I didn't. But I
admired the fearless way with which you reached and published a judgment

<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for your careful leader analysis and Labour recommendation,
which, despite the election result, shows that at least someone is keeping a
clear mind. As an Englander who has already left England, all the talk of
'keeping socialism out' in the UK looks rather odd to me here in Austria
where the government is a conservative/socialist coalition led by a
socialist chancellor with a doctorate in banking. Such a comparison would
probably be lost on some of your letter writers of April 10 who continue to
use the word 'socialism' as if the Cold War hadn't ended. As far as
political stance goes, it seems to be forgotten that the FT recommended the
Tories in 1987.

   From Mr HUGH MARSDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have fully appreciated the identifying feature of the Financial Times
being pink in colour but I had not realised how indicative it was.
Your leading article 'The Day of Decision' in your edition the day of the
election ends with a bias towards the Labour party risking change for the
sake of it.
If you have reasonable memories of the 1960s and the 1970s you will remember
what 'grey days' these were with union leaders and politicians hogging the
headlines telling us how to run our lives.
There was no pride in being British and our industry was very unimpressive
with low morale.
We live in a different world today although it may not be a better world for
many.
However, there have been many achievements which I feel the press and the
politicians might willingly recognise, whatever their colour or creed.
My disappointment in the general election was that the politicians failed to
raise any proper debate upon which we should decide for whom to vote. This
is surely only surpassed by the failure of the press properly to draw this
to the attention of the public.
The record of the Labour party in government has not been very satisfactory,
nor indeed has any other party. The purpose of any government is to provide
a stable background in which we can lead our lives and prosper.
On the social front it is important to help those most in need efficiently
and without wasting tax payers' money. The eventual question to be answered
surely is, do you trust Labour to spend your money better than the
Conservatives?
Certainly Labour will spend more of your money] This factor decided my vote]

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In addition to the comments in other newspapers about your unexpected
pre-election editorial, you have no doubt received lots of expressions of
surprise and dismay from your business readers. Certainly most will have
been shocked that the newspaper which is so cherished by industry, commerce
and the City should have actually suggested that a Labour victory was
preferable.
In my view you are to be warmly congratulated, but not because I think your
advice was right. Indeed in my view it was quite misconceived. It is of
course desirable that we should not end up with one party permanently in
government and the others permanently in opposition, but I believe that the
Labour party has a good deal more learning and forgetting to do before it
can be entrusted with government. It may well be that this will now happen
and your advice, if it were then the same, could more safely be followed
next time.
However, the point is that you demonstrated once again that splendid
independence which has always characterised the editorial columns of your
newspaper. As you know, I was privileged to be a director both of the
Financial Times and your parent company for eight years. I sat on the board
with such great men as Lord Drogheda, Lord Gibson and your famous
predecessors, Sir Gordon Newton and Fredy Fisher.
While we would occasionally gossip at board lunches about matters of
political and commercial interest, there was never any attempt to influence
editorial policy. I am sure that this would also have been the case on this
occasion.
I repeat, therefore, that while I disagreed strongly with your editorial
advice I support totally your right to proffer it.

Sir, Your paper was certainly entitled to recommend voting for whomever it

However, are you aware that radio channels in my country, most of them

promptly used your article to, in my view, herald benefits of socialism.
I expect our daily, enlightened, companion - the FT - to be more aware of

Britain is a capitalist country. One only has to look at the shadow Budget

FT  22 APR 92 / EOC is criticised on value for money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission is failing to provide value for money,
according to a Civil Service investigation.
The draft findings of the inquiry into the commission are likely to be
submitted at the end of the month to the Department of Employment. After the
general election the department took responsibility from the Home Office for
overseeing the commission's work.
The early conclusions of the investigation are that the commission is
overstaffed and that some employees are too highly graded. In 1990-91 the
commission spent Pounds 2.6m on staffing costs associated with its 160
employees out of a Pounds 4.7m income. Departments were reorganised in late
1989 with further changes in 1990 aimed at integrating legal strategies and
other activities.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary - who also has responsibility for
women's issues - could be embarrassed by the report. There may be attempts
to tone it down before it is presented to the commission.
Mrs Shephard is unlikely to want a confrontation with the commission at a
time when she is coming to grips with equal-opportunities issues, and
expectations from women's groups are high. There is added tension because
some EOC commissioners have made clear that they opposed the transfer of
responsibility for the commission. The commission argued that it needed to
be overseen by a central policy department and that its activities were far
wider than employment.

FT  22 APR 92 / European football sponsorship deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEGA Enterprises, the Japanese video-game maker, is expected to sponsor ITV
's coverage of the European football championship.
In February the ITV companies said they were seeking bids of at least Pounds
950,000 for sponsorship rights to UK coverage of the championship, to take
place in Sweden in June.
A deal of around Pounds 2m has been put together which includes advertising
during the programmes. An announcement is expected this week.
Sponsorship of the football championships follows Sony's successful
sponsorship of the rugby world cup championship last November for a fee of
around Pounds 1.25m.
Coverage of the European championships will alternate with the BBC until the
semi-finals, when ITV will have exclusive rights to the France v England
game and the Scottish games against the states of the former Soviet Union
and Germany.

FT  22 APR 92 / Chamber sees signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECLINE in manufacturing output is slowing and there are signs of
recovery, according to a survey published yesterday by the London Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
A total of 38 per cent of manufacturers said orders for the first quarter
were up for the first time in two years, although 30 per cent reported a
fall in orders. The balance of 8 per cent is the first positive figure for
two years. A balance of 7 per cent of service-sector companies reported a
fall in orders, while in the previous quarter a balance of 1 per cent
expected a rise.

FT  22 APR 92 / Shake-up of leases urged by CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for urgent reform of
the law governing commercial property leases to prevent companies being
forced out of business, Charles Batchelor writes.
The CBI wants a change in the law which allows landlords to require tenants
who sell or assign leases to make good unpaid rent owed by a subsequent
occupier.
Mr John Pollard, CBI company affairs policy adviser, said: 'Some tenants who
have assigned leases have been sued for sums running into hundreds of
thousands of pounds, covering rent, service charges and repairs after they
assigned the tenancy with the landlord's consent. They can be put out of
business by this liability.'
An existing tenant can run up substantial arrears before the landlord
notifies the previous tenant that anything is wrong. The landlord is not
obliged to notify promptly and does not even have to sue the non-paying
tenant or evict him. Former tenants can also face demands for rents that are
higher than those which applied when they moved out.

FT  22 APR 92 / Botnar car group wins franchises in restructuring move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFG, the car-retailing group controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has gained
dealer franchises from five leading European carmakers in its effort to
restructure in the wake of losing the Nissan franchise at the end of last
year.
The company received franchises for 29 of its dealerships from Peugeot,
Citroen and Renault, the French carmakers, from Rover of the UK and from
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US.
Agreement has been reached with some of these groups for the refranchising
of a further 13 sites.
It is understood that negotiations are also at an advanced stage between AFG
and the Fiat group, which includes Alfa Romeo and Lancia, for the Italian
carmaker to franchise up to 45 more AFG dealerships.
Fiat, which is concerned about its poor performance in the UK, where it
captured only 1.9 per cent of new-car sales in the first quarter of this
year, is committed separately to investing around Pounds 100m over the next
three years to strengthen its ailing UK dealer network. The potential deal
with AFG would be an addition to its current plans and could boost its
annual UK sales by between 15,000 and 18,000 cars a year. Last year the Fiat
group sold 39,621 new cars in the UK and reached a combined market share for
the Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo marques of only 2.5 per cent.
AFG, whose network of 160 new-car dealerships was previously accounting for
more than half of all the new Nissan vehicles sold in the UK, has been
forced to drastically restructure.
Its operation, still the largest motor-retailing network in the UK, has been
reduced from 160 dealership to 127 through the sale or lease of some sites,
but AFG aims to retain more than 100 dealerships, as it seeks to become the
country's largest multi-franchise dealer group.
In the early months of this year most of its sites were surviving from the
sale of used cars and the sale of the depleting stock of close to 20,000 new
Nissan vehicles it retained at the end of last year.
AFG, which was based exclusively on the Nissan franchise, had its future
jeopardised when Nissan UK, its sister company, lost the Nissan franchise
after the legal conflict between Mr Botnar and Nissan Motor, the Japanese
carmaker.
The exclusive Nissan UK importer/distributor contract was terminated by the
Japanese carmaker with effect from the end of December, when Nissan Motor
took direct control of the sales and marketing of its vehicles in the UK.
The AFG network is still controlled by Mr Botnar, who faces arrest in
connection with an alleged corporation-tax fraud. A warrant was issued for
his arrest in January when he was abroad, and Mr Botnar has yet to return to
the UK.

FT  22 APR 92 / NatWest adopts business-led charities policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank, Britain's biggest corporate supporter of charity,
has recast its community involvement policy to reflect the bank's business
priorities more closely.
The shift in emphasis follows a review of community support at NatWest,
which last year gave Pounds 13.7m in cash and other forms of support. A
number of large companies are reviewing the basis on which they support the
voluntary sector, and the business-led approach of NatWest is likely to be
adopted elsewhere.
NatWest has adopted the promotion of financial effectiveness and enterprise
as the central objective of its community investment policy. Requests for
money and other support will be assessed on whether they meet this
objective.
Many companies have until recently supported charity on a largely haphazard
basis, reflecting the enthusiasms of individual directors or the
eye-catching nature of charitable appeals.
The shift towards a more planned approach shows a growing recognition that
the private sector's now familiar involvement in the community must be
handled as seriously as any other business activity.
Ms Amanda Jordan, NatWest's head of community relations, said that in the
past the bank tended to support good ideas rather than focus on objectives.
'By focusing on those activities which we understand as a bank we hope that
we will be able to integrate the skills of our staff into the assistance we
offer, enabling us to give more than money,' she said.
In one of NatWest's special interest areas - education - the new focus will
be represented through support for schemes that promote financial literacy
in schools, mini-enterprise programmes and a 'Your Money Matters' teaching
package. Another of the bank's schemes helps the National Association of
Citizens' Advice Bureaux provide financial counselling, while plans are
being developed to help voluntary organisations improve their financial
management.
All applicants for NatWest's support will be sent leaflets explaining that
the bank's aim of helping to develop a more financially informed society and
encourage enterprise skills in the community will be the 'guiding principle'
for its involvement.
Ms Jordan accepted that the change of policy would lead to some requests for
support being turned down because they did not meet the new criteria -
although NatWest will meet existing commitments.
'But there are losers under any system,' she said. 'Like all large
companies, we receive far more appeals for help than we can meet. We hope
that a more structured approach will enhance the value of the support we are
able to give.'
Cuts in local-authority funding are leading an increasing number of
voluntary organisations to look to the private sector for support. NatWest
was one of about 40 companies which gave more than Pounds 1m in financial
and other support to charities last year, but growth in private-sector
charitable activity is being hit by the recession.

FT  22 APR 92 / Ucatt announces redundancies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UCATT, the construction union, is to make redundant nearly 10 per cent of
its staff because of a decline in membership.
Last year the union had a Pounds 500,000 deficit and lost at least 5,000
members. Membership stands at just over 200,000.
Sixteen clerical workers will lose their jobs, out of a total of 181
officials and staff.
Criteria by which the redundancies will be selected have yet to be agreed
with the GMB general union which represents the clerical workers.
Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, said the cuts were aimed at
enabling the union to 'weather the recession and stay independent'.

The Irish Times reported that the document showed the Metropolitan police

that the level of threat remained high and that an attempt at a

FT  22 APR 92 / Insurers win ruling on Gulf payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERWRITERS AT Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, could recover part
of one of the biggest insurance payouts of the Gulf war following a judgment
in the Commercial Court, Richard Lapper writes.
Lloyd's syndicates led reinsurance on a war-risks policy which paid out
Dollars 300m (Pounds 168m) to Kuwait Airways following the seizure of 15
aircraft by the invading Iraqi forces in August 1990.
In February last year an order was made that Iraqi Airways should pay the
underwriters and Kuwait Airlines Dollars 489m. The order was made without
Iraqi Airways entering an appearance and Iraq applied for it to be set
aside. Last week Mr Justice Evans reaffirmed the order.
Kuwait Airways, whose total losses amounted to nearly Dollars 1bn, is
pursuing both Iraqi Airways and the state of Iraq for further compensation.
There is also an outstanding dispute between the Kuwaitis and the
underwriters. Faced with a claim for Dollars 690m (the value of the insured
aircraft) the underwriters argue that cover was subject to a Dollars 300m
aggregate limit.

FT  22 APR 92 / Parcelforce to get Pounds 250m boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has sanc-tioned a further Pounds 250m investment programme
into the Post Office's loss-making Parcelforce division.
The move was revealed as the Post Office yesterday announced that its
Datapost letter and document service, which is making a profit, is to be
merged into Parcelforce which last year made a loss before tax and
exceptional items of Pounds 131m.
The Post Office's two other divisions, Royal Mail and Post Office Counters,
both made profits. Overall the Post Office last year made a profit before
tax and exceptional items of Pounds 30m.
Earlier in the year Parcelforce received approval from the Department of
Trade and Industry to invest Pounds 250m over five years in eight new
automated sorting centres. About Pounds 50m has already been invested in
Parcelforce.
The DTI said that the fresh Pounds 250m investment would come from the Post
Office - possibly from cashflow as pre-tax profits had been just Pounds 30m.
Mr Peter Howarth, managing director of Parcelforce, said the merger with
Datapost - which guarantees a next-day service - would significantly reduce
Parcelforce's losses and would mean it was expected to be back in the black
by 1992-93.
Parcelforce is to publish its own accounts for the first time when the Post
Office produces its reports and accounts in July.
The new Parcelforce service will offer customers guaranteed deliveries for
10am and noon the next day, as well as access to Parcelforce's standard
services - which take between three and five days - throughout the Post
Office network.
Customers will now be offered a 25 per cent price differential between the
10am and noon services. The former will cost Pounds 17.20 and the latter
Pounds 13. The average price for a parcel will remain Pounds 2.70.
The merger will lead to a net loss of 100 jobs which the Post Office expects
to come from voluntary redundancies.

FT  22 APR 92 / Company failures rise by 31%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of company failures rose sharply in the first three months of
this year after remaining steady on a quarterly basis throughout last year,
according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
Receiverships rose 31 per cent to 1,362 in the first three months of this
year from 1,037 in the final quarter of last year. One reason for the
increase was a rise in the number of retail companies forced into
receivership after making unsuccessful attempts to stave off collapse with
pre-Christmas and new-year sales, KPMG said.
Manufacturing companies fared better in the first quarter, accounting for
only 25 per cent of failures. This compares with nearly 29 per cent over the
same period last year. Finance and business services companies accounted for
17 per cent of failures compared with 12.5 per cent, while retailing
companies accounted for nearly 10.5 per cent compared with nearly 8 per
cent.

FT  22 APR 92 / Clearing gas pipes for competition: Plans to open Britain's
supply network to outside shippers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADENSELY-WORDED document released this month by British Gas outlining
proposals for transporting gas along its pipeline network will form the
basis for a more competitive gas market in the UK. If at first glance it
appears an arcane paper, it could prove extremely important to the way
competition develops.
The discussion paper, which will be debated until the end of this month
before publication of a price list in August, aims to simplify the existing
transport pricing system. This largely relies on British Gas providing
individual quotes to shippers which want to send rival gas down its
pipelines. To date the company has supplied around 60,000 quotes to
competitors.
As part of British Gas's agreement with the Office of Fair Trading on
creating more competition in the market, it will turn its gas-transport
business into a separate subsidiary by the end of the year.
When that happens, British Gas will have to negotiate with its own transport
company on the same basis as its competitors. The regulators believe this is
the only way to ensure the company does not discriminate against rivals.
But rival suppliers claim the way British Gas has structured its pricing
proposals is aimed at protecting parts of its business and making it more
difficult for newcomers to compete.
British Gas explains that its pricing suggestions seek to iron out
differences in charges for transporting gas to different parts of the
country. This means that under the new system the price for sending gas over
long distances could fall, while transit over short distances could rise.
In addition, the tariffs for transporting gas through the company's regional
and local low-pressure grids - mostly for delivery to smaller customers and,
eventually, to households when that section of the market is opened to
competition in 1996 - are likely to rise moderately.
Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, one of the UK's gas marketing
companies, sees the potential rise in local tariffs as British Gas's way of
protecting its margins in a sector of the market it is seeking to defend.
The OFT has required British Gas to halve its share of the industrial market
to 40 per cent by 1995. Some of its rivals believe it could achieve this by
mainly relinquishing its high-volume, low-priced business rather than its
smaller, more lucrative customers. However, British Gas has yet to work out
the details of how to reduce its market share.
Mr John Huggins, who heads British Gas's transport unit, says prices would
probably rise slightly for local gas transit: 'We were probably
under-recovering on the low-pressure grid under the existing system.'
The most important effect on prices will be the overall rate of return that
British Gas is allowed by its regulator, Ofgas, to make from the transport
business.
The company is allowed to make a 4.5 per cent return on transport, but Mr
Cedric Brown, senior managing director, says: 'This is not an adequate
ongoing rate of return.' He will be asking Sir James McKinnon, head of
Ofgas, for permission to increase it, probably to between 5 per cent and 7
per cent. That is the return British Gas is believed to make on the rest of
its domestic business.
There is some support from the City for Mr Brown's view. Mr Peter Nicol, oil
and gas industry analyst at SG Warburg, questions why the company, with its
obligations to maintain a safe pipeline system, should receive a return less
than that invested in index-linked gilts.
However, Sir James points to the low-risk nature of the business for his
belief that 4.5 per cent is a decent rate of return, and possibly too high.
Another point of concern on pricing for companies such as Kinetica looking
to build rival pipeline systems is British Gas's suggestion that it will
lower transport tariffs over longer distances. That will make it less
attractive for competitors to build pipelines and compete with the British
Gas grid.
Pricing is by far the largest concern of rival shippers which are still
digesting the complex document of proposals. But the system for regulation
of the transport business is also unclear and is to be decided between
British Gas and Ofgas.
Rival shippers will get a chance to put their views at a public meeting on
April 27. Given the complex nature of the proposals and the important base
they will provide for a newly competitive market, it promises to be a heated
debate.

FT  22 APR 92 / Securitised asset rule may change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS are likely to be exempted from a new accounting standard requiring
certain securitised assets such as mortgages to be included on their balance
sheets, it emerged yesterday.
The Accounting Standards Board said it had no intention of turning the banks
into 'unintended casualties' of EC regulations under preparation.
Mr Allan Cooke, the board's technical director, said: 'For some months we
have made no secret of the fact that we do not want to pillory the banks for
guidelines drawn up by people to whom securitisation means nothing.'
Securitisation is the process by which certain assets such as mortgages and
other loans are packaged together as securities and sold on to third parties
via an intermediary company.
Banks argue that this arm's-length intermediary - which may have been set up
by a bank - acts in the interests of the purchasers of the securities, and
that most of the risks and rewards of the loans are transferred to it.
Banks therefore record securitised assets in notes to the accounts rather
than counting them as assets on the balance sheet.
Securitisation has come under threat as one of a number of practices subject
to change in a discussion document on off-balance-sheet finance issued by
the board last October.
The board is about to launch a series of informal discussions over the next
few months in anticipation of a standard about off-balance sheet finance by
the end of this year.
It says that securitised assets should generally be included on the balance
sheet because they are resources available to the business from which it
makes money.
However, under an EC draft directive, the Bank of England will be required
to ensure that banks have sufficient capital to cover their balance sheet
assets as defined under UK accounting standards.
Banks argue that the board's current proposals will restrict their lending
and place the UK at a competitive disadvantage. This is because they will
need to provide additional capital to match the securitised assets placed
back on the balance sheet.
The board stressed yesterday that if the EC draft directive is modified so
that it does not require banks' securitised assets to be matched by
additional capital, then its own standard might then require securitised
assets to be dealt with on the balance sheet.

FT  22 APR 92 / Teachers back local strikes over jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUT teachers' union yesterday voted for local strikes to resist
threatened teacher redundancies, but drew back from endorsing a national
strike to protest at job losses.
After the failure of attempts by the executive of the NUT - Britain's
largest and most militant teachers' union - to soften the line, delegates at
the union's annual conference in Blackpool voted to support immediate
strikes should members in a local area vote for industrial action.
The prospect of disruption is real, since employers estimate that several
thousand redundancies are virtually certain at the end of the academic year.
Most local education authorities in England and Wales face tight spending
constraints. The impact on jobs will be exacerbated by the introduction of
local management schemes - under which schools gain full control of their
budgets, including recruitment, with funding tied to pupil numbers.
The NUT conference also called for a salary increase of 35 per cent over two
years, to spread the 10-point teachers' pay scale between Pounds 14,000 and
Pounds 25,000. It backed a campaign of industrial action to pursue the
claim.
Unlinke the other teachers' unions, the NUT opposed the establishment last
year of the teachers' pay review body, which awarded a 7.5 per cent increase
for this year. That was considerably more than was gained by the rest of the
public sector.
Mr Malcolm Horne, for the NUT executive, said the award was 'a massive step
backwards', and justified the NUT's claim as necessary to restore relative
pay to the level of 1974.
Later, Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, appeared to tone down the
threat of action on pay. 'If the government is seen to put cash limits on
what our pay review body can award then we would need to test our members'
attitudes,' he said, adding that it was too early to say what form action
might take.
The conference of the NASUWT, the third-largest teachers' union, unanimously
deplored the lack of support for schools faced with growing levels of pupil
disruption.
Delegates, meeting in Scarborough, claimed that disruption caused by violent
and unruly pupils was being 'swept under the carpet' with parents unwilling
to control their children and authorities unable to fund special facilities.

FT  22 APR 92 / Strike by Jobcentre staff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKE by Jobcentre staff has failed to prevent the removal of protective
screens from unemployment benefit offices and Jobcentres, the government
claimed yesterday.
A total of 100 members of the CPSA Civil-Service union in three Jobcentres
in London and Bristol have been in dispute with the Department of Employment
for more than a year over a policy to make offices open-plan.
'The Employment Service remains committed to its open-plan programme,' the
department said.
The union claimed there had been an increase of 50 per cent in violent
attacks on Jobcentre staff since the removal of security screens and
counters began in 1989. The union's figures were disputed by the government.
An official announcement of the end of the dispute is expected today after
meetings between union officers and the strikers.
The union would not comment on claims that its members faced an embarrassing
climbdown, and said the strikers would look at proposals for a return to
work today. The action, which has included a one-day national strike, has
cost the union more than Pounds 1m.

FT  22 APR 92 / Royal Bank of Scotland suspends staff in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 40 Royal Bank of Scotland staff in Glasgow have been suspended as
a dispute between Bifu, the banking union, and Royal Bank intensified
yesterday.
The dispute, originally about pay, now centres on whether Bifu members are
entitled to withdraw from overtime they normally work.
A total of 41 Bifu members have been suspended for refusing to work
'contractual overtime'.
The bank said: 'Staff who refused to work normal hours have been sent home.
They are free to resume work as soon as they agree to restrict any
industrial action to legitimate voluntary or abnormal overtime.'
The bank said action over the Easter weekend had had an 'insignificant
effect' on services. It anticipated minimal disruption at affected branches,
all of which are in the centre of Glasgow.
The union launched an overtime ban and work-to-contract action just before
the Easter weekend as part of its campaign of industrial action over pay.
It has rejected an offer of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent for
clerical grades. It has also rejected a performance-related pay package for
managers, which it says fails to guarantee a rise.
Bifu has asked Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, to intervene
in the dispute. It alleges that the bank's management is intimidating Bifu
members engaged in legal industrial action.
Mr Leif Mills, Bifu general secretary, is due to address a meeting of Royal
Bank of Scotland staff, including those who are suspended, in Glasgow this
evening.

FT  22 APR 92 / Bernie Grant joins Labour deputy race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RACE for the Labour deputy leadership widened yesterday as the leftwing
Campaign group of MPs endorsed the nomination of Mr Bernie Grant, the MP for
Tottenham.
At a meeting at Westminster about 10 MPs from the Campaign group, which
claims a membership of around 30, also supported the candidacy of Mr Ken
Livingstone - the MP for Brent East in London and the leader of the Greater
London Council when it was abolished in 1986 - for the leadership.
The fifth MP to join the deputy leadership contest, Mr Grant is unlikely to
get the 55 signatures from MPs needed for his name to appear on the ballot
paper for the election in July, but his candidacy may damage the chances of
Ms Ann Clwyd, the MP for Cynon Valley in south Wales. Nominations close next
Tuesday.
Ms Clwyd will launch her manifesto for the deputy leadership today. There
had been some speculation that the Campaign group would support her, but the
move seems to have faltered over her pro-proportional representation stance.
If Ms Clwyd, Mr Grant and Mr John Prescott all proceed with their
candidacies for the deputy leadership, they may each fail to win the
required number of signatures, leaving the election to be contested solely
by Mr Bryan Gould and Mrs Margaret Beckett.
But Mr Grant, a former leader of Haringey Borough Council in north London,
who became an MP in 1987, said after the meeting yesterday: 'We feel the
leadership has been stitched up and that there is a need for the party to be
given a wider range of choice.'
He highlighted the elements of the Campaign group programme dealing with
anti-racism and equality for women, and made clear that his campaign was
partly in opposition to the rule specifying the minimum number of
nominations for the election, which the Campaign group called
anti-democratic.
The Campaign group ticket has the most positive policies on Labour's links
with the unions of any of the groups campaigning for for the leadership.
'We are offering a choice not an echo,' Mr Livingstone said. 'We are
committed to keeping the trade union links and rebuilding party membership.'
He issued a plea to socialists who had 'lost heart in recent years' to
return and help change the party.
Mr Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington North and secretary to the Campaign
group, said it supported a 10-point plan which included opposition to pacts
with the Liberal Democrats and to proportional representation; withdrawal
from the European exchange rate mechanism; redistribution of wealth and cuts
in defence spending together with the scrapping of nuclear weapons.
Mr Livingstone said last week that Labour's plans to tax middle-income
families 'cost us the election'.

FT  22 APR 92 / Major throttled by back-seat driver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRONY of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who suffered from the backbench snipings
of Mr Edward Heath, her predecessor, inflicting similar wounds on Mr John
Major has not gone unnoticed at Westminster.
Since her enforced resignation as prime minister and party leader in
November 1990, Mrs Thatcher has been regarded by the Tories with the mixture
of caution and respect which might be afforded an unexploded bomb. A sense
of unpredictability and of danger has never been far away.
Mrs Thatcher's article in the April 27 issue of Newsweek, the US magazine,
includes explicit warnings (above) to Mr Major under the headline Don't Undo
My Work. She begins: 'People are asking, is John Major free to go his own
way? He is - within the constraints of the principles set out in the
Conservative manifesto. Don't forget, I set out our principles . . . '
She writes that she 'set out to destroy socialism because I felt it was at
odds with the character of the people' and, in an attack on the Labour
party, she says it was defeated because of 'what that party was, and still
is'.
Mrs Thatcher's words soon after her departure from Downing Street about
being a good back-seat driver showed that her relationship with her
erstwhile protege would not be easy.
The most consistent source of friction has been Europe. She avoided voting
against the government in the Commons debates before and after the
Maastricht summit, but her difference from Mr Major on the issue was clear.
Last year, for example, she said in an interview that the government's
refusal to consider a referendum on the issue of a single European currency
was 'arrogant' and 'wrong'.
As well as public comments, there has been the continual irritant for
ministers of press reports of criticisms expressed by Mrs Thatcher to
friends - about the abolition of the poll tax, for example, and the handling
of interest rates.
Mrs Thatcher spent a loyal election campaign, as the party had always
prophesied she would. She regarded a fourth successive Tory victory as
essential for protecting her achievements. She shared a platform with Mr
Major and launched a rousing rallying cry to party candidates, even though
it did contain faint jibes at her successor. She found time to mention that
the 'enormous detail' in the manifesto might obscure important issues and
that it was still vital to keep a grip on public spending.
During the campaign, Mr Major himself seemed unsure at times whether he was
addressing her disciples or was seeking to reach out to the disenchanted
with his brand of a more caring Conservatism.
In winning the election, he has secured time to make his mark on the party.
But if Mrs Thatcher has lost influence, she has retained her ability to make
headlines.
Don't undo my work
I don't accept the idea that all of a sudden Major is his own man.
I cut back the powers of government.  Now they've got to be jolly careful
they don't give government too many extra powers and undo what i've done.
If new ministers pursue a policy of intervening in industry ..then the
economy will go downhill again.
Just because you speak softly and talk more about welfare and social
services dosn't mean that you do more for them ...look at the record and
make a judgment.
There isn't such a thing as Majorism.  There couldn't be, at the moment.  My
colleagues and I turned round the whole philosophy of government.
There is a line of analysis that says Mr Major synthesizes the best of the
'wet' with the best of the 'dry' and forges a new consensus for Conservative
Britain.  But consensus is the absence of principle and the presence of
expediency.
Thatcherism will live.  It will live long after Thatcher has died, because
we had the courage to restore the great principles and put them into
practice ....

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PANEL of medical advisers to the US government yesterday recommended
approval of DDC, a new anti-viral drug, for the treatment of Aids, provided
it is used in combination with the drug AZT, writes Martin Dickson in New
York.
This is the first time DDC, sold as Hivid and produced by the Swiss company
Hoffman-La Roche, has been given an approval recommendation for use outside
of clinical tests.
Earlier in the day the committee declined to recommend that the US Food and
Drug Administration approve the use of DDC alone for treatment of Aids.
AZT, marketed as Retrovir and developed by Britain's Wellcome, is the only
anti- viral approved for all patients with Aids symptoms.
The panel was swayed by a study of 56 patients, which showed positive
effects from combined use of DDC and AZT.
The FDA need not accept the panel's findings but usually attaches great
weight to its pronouncements.

FT  22 APR 92 / Abortion issue again before Supreme Court: Controversy is
heightened in election year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court today once again turns its attention to the
controversial question of abortion. Whatever it determines when it hands
down a judgment in two or three months' time will certainly have an impact
on a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. It may even
affect the outcome of this year's presidential election.
The court is to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a 1989 law passed
in Pennsylvania, a strongly Catholic state. This places several restrictions
on the right to abortion, including waiting periods and obligations on
doctors to advise of alternatives, on minors to obtain the consent of at
least one parent or a judge and, in most cases, on women to notify their
husbands in advance.
The Bush administration has already filed briefs with the court in support
of the law. It is opposed by the pro-choice movement, which fears that the
right to an abortion, laid down in the landmark Roe vs Wade ruling of 1973,
is in the process of being legally whittled into extinction.
Roe vs Wade established the 'fundamental' constitutional right. It also
stipulated that any restrictions on abortion imposed by the states would be
subject to 'strict scrutiny'. Subsequent legal challenges have been designed
to test this framework, rather than the principle, and this appears to be
the case with the Pennsylvania law, though President George Bush is on
record as wanting Roe vs Wade overturned.
The composition of the nine-member court has changed greatly since 1973,
when Roe vs Wade was passed by seven to two. Of the current justices, only
Harry Blackmun, a Nixon appointee and author of the judgment, and John Paul
Stevens, elevated under President Gerald Ford, have consistently come out in
favour of the basic right to an abortion.
The other seven, all but one Republican appointees, are presumed to favour
restrictions, if not necessarily outright repeal of the law. Mr Bush has
made a pro-life commitment a requirement of any judicial nomination he
makes. His administration has also withdrawn US funding for several
international family planning programmes.
The record of the court in recent years has been not to make sweeping law
but to claw back through narrow interpretations some of the more
interventionist legal edicts handed down in its great liberal activist
years, which began with its school desegregation order of 1954 and lasted
through the mid-1970s. In general, the court has preferred to cede authority
to the states, as it did in several rulings on Monday.
Most experts, therefore, expect the court to uphold the Pennsylvania law,
but not to bite the bullet of repealing Roe vs Wade outright. This would
eventually lead the court to considering several other cases involving state
restrictions on abortion now working their way through the lower courts.
If it took the course of throwing out Roe vs Wade, probably at least a dozen
states would pass laws banning abortion outright. Congress would then almost
certainly get into the fray by seeking to pass a law negating the repeal,
thus inviting a presidential veto and provoking a constitutional crisis.
Either way, the issue will be elevated into even greater public
consciousness, if that is possible. Washington this month saw a great march,
of as many as 1m people, in favour of a woman's right to choose; yesterday,
Buffalo, New York, was braced for possible violence as the pro-life movement
began picketing an abortion clinic in the city.
Though abortion has long been a question provoking passion on both sides, it
has not been a big determinant in presidential elections. However, this year
an uncertain electorate looking around for reasons to vote one way or the
other may consider it more important than in the past.
The political divisions are clear. All those who have competed for the
Democratic party's presidential nomination believe in choice, as does Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is expected to run as an independent.
The Democratic party will go into the election campaign with this commitment
in its platform.
The provisional Republican party platform, echoing that of 1988 and, now as
then, mostly drafted by the right wing, calls for a constitutional amendment
banning abortion, which is probably rather further than some of Mr Bush's
more cautious political advisers would like to go. A floor fight at the
party's nominating convention in August might harm the president.
Both sides claim polling evidence that a majority of the country supports,
or opposes, abortion, but there has been little real evidence of voter
preference either way in this year's primary elections.
However, several prominent Republicans, such as Robert Taft, the former
senator from Ohio, and Ann Stone, of the Republicans for Choice
organisation, have warned of the electoral dangers of seeking to ban what
many Americans now consider to be acceptable, if not desirable. Ms Stone is
particularly concerned about the defection of women voters to the Democrats.
In this respect no justice will be under greater scrutiny in the
Pennsylvania judgment than Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation to the court
last year was surrounded by charges of sexual harassment and indisputably
unpopular with women of left and right. His vote in court could indeed
affect the way the country votes later.

FT  22 APR 92 / Peru's austerity plan at risk as minister quits: Economic
management thrown  into chaos by President Fujimori
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERU'S economic management was thrown into turmoil yesterday with the
resignation of Mr Carlos Bolona as finance minister and President Alberto
Fujimori's dismissal of the central bank's governing board.
However, Mr Jorge Chavez, governor of the central bank, said he would not
submit to the president's orders. 'It is my duty to defend the autonomy of
the central bank. Mr Fujimori will have to remove me by force.'
At the Finance Ministry, Mr Bolona's aides said he had presented his
'irrevocable' letter of resignation to the president but that Mr Fujimori
had not accepted it.
Mr Bolona was not available for comment.
He is the second member of the cabinet to resign since Mr Fujimori seized
dictatorial powers two weeks ago. Mr Alfonso de los Heros resigned as prime
minister on the night Mr Fujimori closed down Congress and the judiciary and
installed a military-backed 'emergency government'.
Mr Bolona's decision to quit follows a fruitless trip to Washington last
week in which he failed to convince the US Treasury, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank to resume economic aid to Peru. He was told
there would be no help forthcoming until Mr Fujimori restored democracy.
Creditor nations and the IADB have frozen more than Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
840m) of debt relief and development grants in condemnation of Mr Fujimori's
palace coup.
Peru now faces a balance of payments crisis, as it needed foreign aid to
clear its debt arrears with the International Monetary Fund and other
multilateral agencies.
Mr Bolona's resignation may also signal that Mr Fujimori is preparing to
abandon an IMF-inspired austerity programme that had placed the government's
finances in order and curbed inflation from a monthly 60 per cent two years
ago to about 5 per cent now.
Mr Fujimori is under pressure to raise military expenditure and adopt more
populist economic measures to retain the loyalty of the armed forces and the
majority of poverty-stricken Peruvians who supported the coup. Mr Fujimori
last week pledged more than Dollars 20m to improve Lima's sprawling shanty
towns and promised industry a Dollars 200m credit line to help jump-start
the economy.
The armed forces on Monday reaffirmed their support for Mr Fujimori in an
effort to stifle a bid by the disbanded Congress to set up a rival
government.
Congress yesterday swore in Mr Maximo San Roman, the former vice-president,
as the head of Peru's 'constitutional government'. This leaves Peru with
three men claiming the presidency - Mr Fujimori, Mr San Roman and Mr Abimael
Guzman, leader of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas, who is
known as 'President Gonzalo'.
Mr San Roman's investiture will pose a diplomatic problem for a delegation
of the Organisation of American States now visiting Lima. The OAS is on a
peace mission to try to reconcile Mr Fujimori and the disbanded Congress. It
will also attempt to persuade Mr Fujimori to adopt a rapid timetable for the
restoration of democracy.
In an attempt to mollify international opinion, Mr Fujimori has announced
that municipal elections will go ahead as planned in November. He has also
called for a national dialogue, to begin on May 1.
Congressmen have already rejected his proposal, saying they will recognise
only Mr San Roman as the constitutional president of Peru.

AN international computer software counterfeiting ring, believed to have
been producing thousands of illegal copies of personal computer programs a
month, has been shut down after an investigation by Microsoft, the leading
US personal computer software publisher, Louise Kehoe reports from San
Francisco.
Microsoft said it had stopped the software pirates with co-operation from
authorities in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.
Raids uncovered groups and individuals responsible for fake manuals,
computer disks and packaging including Microsoft's trademark hologram
designed to thwart counterfeiters.
Microsoft said the police raids had led to seizures of large amounts of
counterfeit product, including fake copies of English, French, German,
Italian and Swedish-language versions of Microsoft's latest and widely used
personal computer operating system.
The fake products were destined for distribution in Asia, Australia, Europe,
Latin America, the Middle East and the US, according to seized records.
The Business Software Alliance, a software industry association, says piracy
cost the industry Dollars 12bn-Dollars 14bn in displaced sales in 1990.

FT  22 APR 92 / World Trade News: Row erupts over Japanese ban on wines from
Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROW has erupted between Japanese government officials and Italian wine
importers over a sales ban imposed for health reasons on 27 types of Italian
wine.
The importers believe Tokyo is over-reacting to a problem limited to a few
rogue producers.
The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare says it must act cautiously to
protect consumers.
The arguments began last week when the ministry banned sales of eight kinds
of wine, after the US authorities found some wines shipped to America
contained traces of methyl isothiocyanate, a banned insecticide.
This week, the ministry added a further 19 wines to the list on the basis of
reports from the Italian authorities after additional laboratory checks
carried out in Italy. The sales bans will stay in place until the ministry
has completed checks on the wines.
The ministry has also advised importers of other wines to test their wines
before selling them to the public.
The importers' main complaint is that as well as containing the names of 24
individual, mostly small-scale, producers, the ministry's list names a whole
region and two grape types grown in many parts of Italy. The importers say
it is unfair to blacklist the wines simply because they come from the same
region, or are made of the same grape, as wines from the offending wineries.
Mr Mark Bedingham, president of Jardine Wines and Spirits, a major drinks
importer, said yesterday: 'This is over-reaction by the Japanese
authorities'.
Italian trade officials said they were meeting the ministry every day to
provide information and ask for the general sales ban on the wines to be
lifted. It was wrong to penalise thousands of Italian wineries, they said.
A ministry official said tests had to be carried out on all the wines
because no guarantee could be given they were safe. Importers said the
ministry's checks might not be complete until mid-May.
The ministry's action is already affecting all Italian wines. At Isetan, a
leading department store, officials said all Italian wines had been removed
from the shelves.
At Sabatini, a top Italian restaurant in central Tokyo, a manager said some
older customers were double-checking the type of wine they were drinking.
Inaccurate reporting had spread confusion, he added. 'On television a story
about the problem was illustrated with a bottle of a different Italian
wine.'
Methyl isothiocyanate can be used to control fermentation but is banned from
use in food in several countries, including the US, Japan and Italy.

Lufthansa chief

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief executive, yesterday accused the US
government of blocking attempts to allow it and other European carriers more
access to US destinations.
Lufthansa has long sought better operating conditions for European airlines
in the US. It is limited to 10 cities in the US, while US airlines have wide
access to airports in Germany and the rest of Europe. 'The Americans are
blocking us totally. They are not willing to budge towards compromise,' Mr
Weber said. 'Equal competition between the US and European countries is
simply not a subject for them.'
Germany and the US have been holding talks on the bilateral aviation accord
which, Lufthansa claims, favours US carriers and does not let Lufthansa
compete equally. The north Atlantic accounts for some 30 per cent of
Lufthansa's traffic but, like other airlines, it loses money on the route.
Mr Weber, who repeated his determination to restore profits - last year's
losses totalled DM400m (Pounds 137m) - called the present state of the
US-German air talks 'more than disappointing'. Noting the next meeting would
be in June, he said: 'I am pessimistic.'
He claimed 'new so-called liberalisation concepts' were being produced in
the US which would help US airlines and put more disadvantages Lufthansa's
way. Progress in the US would only be possible with strong political
pressure, he added.
A US transportation department official said yesterday the two governments
had agreed to renegotiate 'because the US is interested in a liberalised
agreement and more opportunity for US carriers in Germany'.

seen as a 'prerequisite for world economic growth and prosperity, and
therefore for jobs'

<TEXT>
AS President George Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president, meet in Washington today, world business leaders are stepping up
pressure for an agreement on global trade liberalisation.
Mr Bush and Mr Delors will try to resolve differences between the US and the
EC, mainly on farm subsidies, that have blocked agreement so far in the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks. It is seen as the last chance of
concluding a Gatt pact before a new administration takes office in the US in
January. A senior US official yesterday depressed hopes of a breakthrough in
the talks, but insisted that the coming presidential election was no
'impediment' to agreement.
Japanese, US and European businesses said in Tokyo yesterday that successful
completion of the Round was 'a prerequisite for world economic growth and
prosperity, and therefore for jobs'. Agreement would restore business
confidence by reducing uncertainties and the risk of trade conflicts, they
said in a joint statement signed by the Keidanren, Japan's leading business
organisation, and US and European business groupings. The Tokyo statement
follows a letter signed last week by more than 120 chief executives around
the world appealing to national governments to iron out their differences.
Among US signatories to the letter from the International Chamber of
Commerce, IBM, AT&amp;T and General Motors stressed the need for a clear set of
trading rules. Their absence 'raises the cost of doing business,' a GM
official said. IBM said it was vital to have a trading framework covering
services, anti-dumping and trade in services. 'We want a consistent
world-wide application of trade practices that can be applied locally.'
GM noted tariffs were no longer especially important in trade in cars. It
had reservations about the language of the Gatt draft's anti-dumping
provisions, but was pleased it would at least replace many local content
rules complicating external investment.
AT&amp;T thought aspects of the draft could be improved, in the protection of
intellectual property, rules of origin and the anti-dumping provisions. But
it believed an umbrella agreement was the priority. Mr Patrick Gillam,
chairman of Asda, the UK supermarket chain, said his organisation as a
'buyer of a lot of imported goods' would benefit from liberalised world
trade. 'Anyone who is an industrialist will be happy not to see the world
fall into competing trade blocs. The record since Gatt was introduced shows
ever-increasing world trade ..if you can complete the agreement you will
have similar beneficial effects. Our organisation benefits from the general
economic prosperity that arises from greater freedom of trade.'
Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT Industries chairman, said: 'With the world on the
whole in a recession and experiencing difficult economic conditions, there
is a bit of a beggar-my-neighbour attitude about. It would be easier to get
an agreement in a period of prosperity. To bring about a meaningful
agreement needs political courage, which is lacking in Europe and the US.'
The BDI, Germany's leading industry association, warned of the 'devastating'
economic effects (of failure in Gatt) on the national economy, which derives
32 per cent of income from exports. Companies took a more cautious view. The
immediate worry is that heightened uncertainty will further delay economic
recovery. They fear polarisation of world markets into three defensive
trading blocs, the EC, the US and Japan, which would have unquantifiable
effects on reconstruction and social conditions in Europe's former communist
states.
'We are all worried because central and eastern Europe need market access to
build their economies,' said Mr Jurgen Pfingster, chief economist at
Commerzbank, one of Germany's biggest banks. Global businesses such as
Siemens, the electronics and engineering group, fear increased
'complications in procedures' will hamper their development, a spokesman
said. The heads of five of Italy's leading companies also signed the letter,
among them Fiat, the country's largest private sector group, and ENI, the
state-owned oil and energy concern.
Mr Luigi Orlando, chairman of SMI, Europe's biggest maker of copper and
alloy products, stressed his commitment to open markets, but like Fiat's
chairman, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, he believed the Commission should produce
policies to defend European companies against their US and Japanese
competitors.
In Australia, Mr John Prescott, chief executive of Broken Hill Proprietary
(BHP), the mining, energy and steel group, said Australia had suffered
materially 'as a result of the agricultural protectionist policies of the US
and the EC. We believe that wholesale abolition of agricultural protection,
combined with steady progress towards the ultimate removal of protection of
manufactured goods would lead to a more even spread of world prosperity.'
'We do so much exporting that it's vital to us,' said Mr Alf Powis, chairman
of Noranda, the Toronto-based resources and industrial group. Mr Red Wilson,
president of the Montreal telecommunications holding company BCE, said that
while BCE was unsure how it might be affected by lower barriers to
international telecommunications, 'we'd rather talk about opportunities to
liberalise than not talk about them.'

FT  22 APR 92 / Suchinda's honeymoon may end before it begins / Examining
the problems already besetting Thailand's new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OPPOSITION parties have warned that there will be no honeymoon for the new
Thai government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the former army commander.
They are almost certainly right.
An estimated 30,000 people, demonstrating on Monday in a central Bangkok
plaza near both parliament and Supreme Command headquarters, applauded
loudly as elected leaders from four opposition parties called for Gen
Suchinda's resignation. Some of the speeches were uncommonly blunt. One
speaker pointed out Gen Suchinda's dubious distinction of being the first of
19 prime ministers since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 to have been
the target of demonstrations even before he made his first policy statement
to parliament.
Gen Suchinda was de facto leader of last year's coup, which led to a
13-month government led by an appointed civilian prime minister, Mr Anand
Panyarachun, whose administration was largely clean and competent. Now,
following the March 22 general election in which Gen Suchinda did not stand,
he is himself prime minister at the head of a government including many of
the ministers he overthrew ostensibly because of their alleged corruption.
Critics of the military say that the election, which saw widespread
vote-buying, represented a second coup on the sly. Far from being a return
to democracy, they say, the election became another step in the ascendancy
of the group of officers known as Class 5, the fifth class to graduate from
the military academy under the revised post-Second World War curriculum.
Within the military, membership of a clique, usually based on a graduation
class, can be all-important. And the consolidation of Class 5's power is
probably unprecedented in recent history, even though rivalries within it
cannot be ruled out.
The staunchest critics warn that a third 'coup' would be possible if members
of the government coalition demanded too much influence or money in return
for their support. The precedent, they say, would be 1971, when the
strongman of the day staged a coup 'against himself' to get rid of a
troublesome parliament.
This analysis is debatable because Thailand has changed. Unlike in the
1970s, Gen Suchinda has had to resign from the army. Public opinion forced
the drafters of last year's constitution to drop a provision that would have
allowed serving government officials to hold cabinet posts.
Nevertheless, Class 5's strength is clear. Gen Suchinda has been replaced as
army commander by his brother-in-law and former classmate, General
Issarapong Noonpakdi, who was interior minister in the post-coup government.
His successor is a Class 5 former air force officer, Air Chief Marshal Anan
Kalintha.
Gen Suchinda's successor as armed forces supreme commander is another Class
5 graduate, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, who played an important part
in the creation of the pro-Class 5 party, Samakkhi Tham (Justice Unity), and
in bringing together the five-party coalition that supports Gen Suchinda.
When parliament convened for its first debate last Thursday, the opposition
wore black to mourn the demise of democracy. Outside, a former member of
parliament had been on hunger strike for a week. On Sunday, Bangkok's
voters, in the election for the capital's governor, gave 88 per cent of
their votes to two candidates representing anti-military parties. By
Monday's mass public demonstration, the lone hunger striker had been joined
by more than 40 others.
Members of the five-party coalition supporting the new prime minister have
been forced into a corner. In the general election campaign, they proclaimed
their democratic principles by pledging that the leader of the largest party
would head the government. This turned out to be Mr Narong Wongwan, who was
immediately engulfed in controversy when it was revealed that last year he
had been refused a visa to enter the US for allegedly being associated with
drug smuggling. The coalition then chose Gen Suchinda and faced another
round of criticism. Gen Suchinda had himself broken his pledge not to seek
the premiership.
Coalition members deny that their support is undemocratic, arguing that
their 195 seats in the 360-seat House of Representatives allows them a
mandate to support any prime minister as long as they do not violate the
constitution. Some younger MPs considered to be among the more able members
of the coalition have pleaded with the public to give the new government a
chance.
Gen Suchinda has repeatedly stressed that his priority is to make sure that
the economy continues to be run properly in order to maintain
investor-confidence and Thailand's position as one of the world's
fastest-growing economies.
The reappointment of an unelected technocrat finance minister, Dr Suthee
Singhasaneh, and Gen Suchinda's choice of economic advisers suggest that
fiscal and monetary caution will continue. Priorities are likely to remain
the avoidance of inflation, balance of payments problems and excessive debt.
Gen Suchinda has also announced that he will continue with the junta's
declared objective of reducing corruption. However, the fact that he has
been forced to appoint ministers with questionable backgrounds is seen as an
indication of his limited bargaining power. Much will hinge on the
discipline of the coalition parties; some factions disappointed by not
gaining cabinet posts are already threatening trouble.
Much will also depend on the behaviour and unity of Class 5. Questions are
beginning to be raised concerning the ambitions and numerous family
connections of the new army chief, Gen Issarapong. And Air Chief Marshal
Kaset has made no secret of his own political ambitions. The air force chief
also has numerous business interests, including chairing the boards of Thai
Airways International and the company that imports Hyundai cars.
When he took over as supreme commander he is reported to have pledged to
continue the tasks begun by Gen Suchinda and to keep out of politics. One
observer responded: 'Gen Suchinda had better watch his back.' The comment
was a joke, based on Gen Suchinda's previous pledges to stay out of
politics, but, still, it had the ring of truth as well.

NEARLY 20,000 protesters took to the streets in Taiwan demanding direct
presidential elections during three days of rallies organised by the
island's main opposition party, the DPP, writes Luisetta Mudie in Taipei.
The protests were scheduled to end by midnight yesterday, but the protesters
staged a sit-in in central Taipei, saying they would not move until the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) agreed to direct election of the president,
currently chosen by the National Assembly.
The issue highlighted deep divisions within the KMT leadership last month,
but a decision was deferred until 1995 at the latest.
KMT deputies in the National Assembly, which is currently in session to
amend the constitution, have been ordered to shelve the issue.
The DPP advocates formal independence for Taiwan.
The demonstrations were largely peaceful, although scuffles broke out with
police when DPP National Assembly deputies arrived at the presidential
palace demanding to see the president.

Mr Chung Mong-Hun, vice-chairman of Hyundai Merchant Marine, was arrested
for tax evasion after a two-week investigation of Korea's biggest shipping
company.
Prosecutors said they originally suspected that some of the Won11.2bn
(Dollars 14.5m) hidden from tax authorities was used to finance the
anti-government Unification National party but found no evidence to support
this theory.

<TEXT>
MIDDLE EAST peace negotiations will move to Rome after the next round of
talks, which are scheduled to open in Washington on Monday, the US State
Department announced yesterday.
The new venue represents a modest step forward in resolving the procedural
difficulties which have delayed consideration of substantive issues.
Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinian delegation had strongly resisted
Israel's efforts to site the talks closer to the Middle East. They felt it
was to their advantage to hold the early bilateral sessions in the US where
pressure from the administration and the attention of the media worked to
their advantage.
In order to break the deadlock, the State Department asked each delegation
to submit a list of acceptable venues. Rome was common to the five lists. No
date has been set for the first meeting in Italy and may have to await the
outcome of the general election in Israel on June 23.

<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary who is making his first visit to
Turkey, yesterday commended Ankara's robust role in the US-led coalition
against Iraq. He emphasised the importance of Turkish backing for an
extension of the allied air umbrella for the Kurds of north Iraq.
Mr Hurd also sought to reassure Turkey of renewed UK support for a new role
for Turkey in Europe which 'goes beyond Turkey's membership of Nato'.
He pledged that Turkey would be considered as a recipient of aid under the
Matutes plan, the EC's development programme for the Mediterranean basin, on
an equal basis with EC members. Turkey has an association agreement with the
EC and is moving towards a customs union in 1996.
The visit follows the allied demarche to Iraq last week to remove missile
batteries and end its radar illumination of allied aircraft. Mr Hurd said he
was 'very encouraged by the shared analysis' of the security situation in
North Iraq where Iraqi forces have tightened an economic blockade on Kurdish
areas.
He also indicated Turkey had given approval for a possible strike against
Iraq, which he said was implicit in the terms of the demarche.

FT  22 APR 92 / Ukraine's budget sets tight deficit target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian government yesterday unveiled a budget with an ambitious
deficit target of just 2 per cent of gross national product this year in an
attempt to meet stringent International Monetary Fund requirements.
Mr Hryhori Piatachenko, the republic's finance minister, is trying to bring
Ukraine's rising deficit under control by slashing social welfare spending
and subsidies to enterprises and by raising taxes. The budget deficit
overran its target by five times last year.
The sight of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster demonstrating outside
the parliament against a cut in the generous government aid to which they
are entitled showed the IMF medicine will be a bitter pill for the Ukrainian
public. But government officials were confident parliament would approve the
budget this week.
It calls for spending of Rbs458.4bn and revenue of Rbs441.3bn. Subsidies to
state enterprises account for 25 per cent of expenditure. The army,
numbering more than half a million and of growing political importance as
tensions between Ukraine and Russia increase, is the next biggest cost,
accounting for nearly 16 per cent of the budget. Social welfare takes 14.5
per cent, with an additional 10 per cent earmarked for cleaning up the
effects of Chernobyl and compensating its victims.
Value added tax will provide 52 per cent of the money raised by the state
this year. A tax on enterprise revenues, which the Finance Ministry hopes to
raise from its current level of 18 to 24 per cent, is to account for an
extra 25.6 per cent of government revenue.
The main criticism in parliament yesterday was that the budget was still too
lenient with state enterprises. Mr Boris Markov, deputy chairman of the
national bank, said: 'This is the best budget we have yet produced, but it
is still necessary to create more powerful stimuli to develop a market
economy.' He supported a proposal from parliament's budget commission to
keep taxes down by reducing subsidies to state enterprises. 'The money
should be left with the population. . . . The people can decide for
themselves what to buy.'
Ukrainian officials hope the budget will receive 'high marks' from the IMF.
Ukraine must now obtain the Fund's approval for the republic's economic
reform plan, which officials hope to achieve when a high-level IMF team
comes to Kiev later this month.
Spain is to grant Ukraine a Dollars 250m credit line to encourage trade
between the two countries, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the foreign
minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Madrid. He was speaking at
Madrid airport en route to Russia and Ukraine for an official visit.

A LEADING Ukrainian parliamentarian yesterday insisted that his republic

A Russian Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that no missiles had been
transferred since the announcement last week by Mr Anatoly Zlenko that the
weapons would be returned following international pressure on the country.
Mr Mykola Porovsky, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's defence
committee, said that 'Mr Zlenko's statement was a general statement, not
specifically to do with tactical weapons. We will not ship them to Russia
until there is a system of international verification for their destruction.
Such a system would require western and Ukrainian participation.'

<TEXT>
RUSSIA, a late starter in the age of the car, has roared to a leading place
in the world's statistics for road deaths, Reuters reports from Moscow.
Authorities said yesterday that Russia's traffic carnage matches its size as
the world's biggest country.
Sixteen out of every 100 people injured in car crashes die, Mr Vladimir
Fyodorov, head of the Interior Ministry Traffic Police Department, told a
news conference.
The figure is several times higher than the 2 to 7 per cent average for the
rest of the world.
But Mr Fyodorov said a lower proportion of Russians were injured in
non-fatal car accidents.
'Accident reports in the west usually show large numbers of crashes with
very few people killed. With us, it's the other way round,' he said. 'We are
falling far behind the civilised world in traffic security.'
Traffic police analysis shows that 0.14 per cent of the Russian population
were injured in car crashes last year. Comparative figures for west European
countries show a higher 0.5 per cent. But 0.025 per cent of Russians are
killed in the accidents, compared with only 0.016 in western Europe.
Mr Fyodorov blamed the extremely high death rate on poor road conditions, an
inadequate ambulance service and lack of modern communications.
'We sometimes get news of a traffic accident from passing drivers hours
after it happened,' he said.

FT  22 APR 92 / Sarajevo attack pushes Bosnia towards civil war
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SARAJEVO, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, was pounded by artillery and
mortar fire yesterday as a Serbian assault pushed the newly independent
republic closer to all-out civil war.
Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, appeared willing to risk
economic and political isolation from the international community as its
forces pressed home their attack on Moslem-dominated areas of the republic.
The fighting in Sarajevo was seen by Bosnian leaders as an attempt to cut
the capital in half, linking up Serb-controlled districts. Serb leaders said
Moslem militia had attacked them first. The television centre was repeatedly
hit by mortars.
Eyewitnesses said United Nations peacekeepers headquartered in Sarajevo
drove around in armoured vehicles to try to help the wounded, who could not
be reached by ambulance because of sniper fire. The witnesses said corpses
were lying on the streets in the Novo Sarajevo and Novi Grad districts.
Casualty figures were difficult to confirm but Belgrade television said at
least three civilians had been killed and dozens wounded. The federal army
command in Sarajevo said two soldiers had been killed in an overnight
attack. It said the army 'had not fired a single shot'. Gunmen have blocked
most main roads in Bosnia. Sarajevo yesterday was divided by road
barricades, some manned by Serb militants and others by Moslems.
Elsewhere in the republic, Belgrade radio said Serb leaders in Vlasenica, a
predominantly Moslem town in eastern Bosnia, had ordered the 55,000
inhabitants to hand over all illegal weapons.
Serb irregulars over the past month have seized seven predominantly Moslem
towns along or near the River Drina, which marks Bosnia's border with
Serbia. They have formed a corridor of Serb-controlled territory to link
predominantly-Serb regions throughout Bosnia with Serbia.
The US and the European Community have warned Serbia of heavy sanctions,
including a possible severing of diplomatic ties with the rump Yugoslavia,
if the Serbian government does not curb the fighting in Bosnia.
A diplomat based in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, said
yesterday: 'Serbia is ignoring private and public warnings from the US and
the EC. Milosevic is aware of the consequences but has made no attempt to
stop the fighting. If the fighting progresses, Serbia will face some very
serious sanctions.'
If Serbia fails to make any move towards ending the violence in Bosnia by
the end of April, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has
warned that it may exclude the rump Yugoslavia from the organisation. A
western diplomat said: 'A stiff trade embargo is under serious
consideration. But cutting off diplomatic ties may not be too far off.'
Lord Carrington, chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference, is due in
Belgrade tomorrow in an attempt to stop the fighting. Meanwhile, Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, German foreign minister, is embarking on a series of
talks on Yugoslavia with some EC and east European countries and with the
US.
Serbia has rejected international criticism that it is abetting Serb
irregulars in an attempt to stake claims on huge portions of territory in
Bosnia. 'Serbia has no territorial pretensions on others and from the very
start has been for a peaceful and legal solving of the Yugoslav crisis,' the
Serbian government said yesterday after Mr Milosevic had met a senior
official of the US State Department.
The fighting in Bosnia erupted over Bosnian independence. Serbs, who make up
31 per cent of the 4.35m population, vehemently oppose independence which is
supported by Moslems, 44 per cent of the population and Croats (17 per
cent). Clashes escalated after April 6 when the EC followed by the US
recognised Bosnia. More than 200 people have been killed in fighting in
Bosnia and some 170,000 have fled their homes.
Another western diplomat yesterday said: 'The fact that Bosnia is now
internationally recognised in many ways makes the situation much clearer.
Serbia is violating international law and borders. Bosnia is no longer a
part of the rump Yugoslavia.'

FRENCH industrial production fell by 0.9 per cent from January to February,
a surprise to most analysts, who were expecting a small rise, William
Dawkins writes from Paris.
The fall is partly due to warmer than expected weather, which caused a sharp
decline in energy use, said Insee, the state statistics body. The result
brings the Insee industrial production index to 113.5, or 0.26 per cent
above the 113.2 of February last year.
Food production also fell, while manufacturing output rose by 0.6 per cent.

FT  22 APR 92 / Search begins for Italy's 51st postwar government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S 11th postwar parliament is due to open tomorrow, paving the way for
formal talks on the creation of a new government.
The political parties have so far made virtually no progress towards forming
a government since the April 5 general elections, confining themselves to a
ritualistic statement of positions.
The first item on the agenda of the new parliament will be the election of
leaders of the 630-seat chamber of deputies and the 315-seat senate. On
Friday Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime minister, is due to submit
his resignation.
Parliamentary groups will then be formed, opening up formal consultations on
a new government, which will be the 51st since the war  - though this is
only the 11th parliament, because the frequent changes of government have
not often necessitated fresh general elections.
The most significant development has been the way in which the Christian
Democrats have decided to close ranks after their vote fell below 30 per
cent for the first time. Last week a special two-day congress rejected the
resignation of Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the party secretary-general, which he
tendered after the elections.
By maintaining Mr Forlani in his post, which he is due to leave in the
autumn, the Christian Democrat leadership indicated it was not prepared to
contemplate a radical shake-up at this stage. This was despite calls from
younger members for the ageing leadership to step down in recognition of the
large protest vote directed against the long-ruling Christian Democrats.
The Christian Democrats remain confident that as the country's largest party
they will be the centre of any new government. They are also counting on the
support of the Socialists and their other two minority party allies, the
Liberals and the Social Democrats.
Although this four-party coalition has a a majority in the chamber of
deputies, it lacks the political credibility to act as a government to carry
out the necessary institutional reforms and tough economic measures. This is
why the Socialists have made tentative overtures to the former communists,
the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), who with 16 per cent of the vote are
the second largest party.
The latter are aware their participation in a government would provide the
necessary credibility and cross-party support for reform. However, the PDS
is playing hard-to-get and wants to make the point that the rules of the
game have changed.
President Francesco Cossiga has been carrying out preliminary consultations
and over the weekend backed the idea of a government of 'technicians' - a
proposal put forward by Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small centre-left
Republican party. However, Mr Cossiga is profoundly mistrusted by most of
the parties, and few would want to let him claim the kudos for knocking
heads together to form a government.
The choice of leaders of the two houses is important: these are prestigious
posts, and the parties' behaviour in the nominations could indicate their
attitude towards future government alliances. The easiest option would be to
reconfirm Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the republican leader of the chamber, and
Ms Nilde Iotte, the PDS leader of the Senate.

FT  22 APR 92 / Tory leadership seeks to play down Thatcher's attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORY leadership yesterday sought to play down the impact of a remarkable
series of comments by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in which she issued a blunt
warning to the government to control public spending.
Her remarks that Mr John Major was 'not his own man' and that there was no
philosophy of 'Majorism' attracted immediate controversy. But concern about
public expenditure is set to be the subject of continuing tension within the
party in the run up to what is expected to be a fiercely contested autumn
spending round.
The debate over Britain's Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement
will be revived next month as Tory backbenchers have opportunities to
express unease over public finances in debates on the finance bill and the
economy as a whole.
In a characteristically forthright article in the American magazine
Newsweek, Mrs Thatcher wrote: 'There are many new, young Conservative
members of Parliament who are as orthodox on finance as I am. They know they
must start to get government borrowing down, and therefore constrain public
spending.'
With the election won, senior ministers are much less concerned about how
far Mrs Thatcher's words are seen as a criticism of Mr Major, while some
Tory backbenchers were angry at what they saw as unhelpful sniping by the
former prime minister.
Mr Douglas Hurd pointed out that the prime minister himself had said there
was no such thing as 'Majorism'. The foreign secretary said that Mr Major
was 'putting his own stamp on the future course of the government'.
Downing Street maintained a studied silence over Mrs Thatcher's remarks. Her
supporters said she stood by her comments and would continue to speak out
for the things she believed in.
In the article, Mrs Thatcher warned the government over public spending and
industry policy. She reiterated that the government's task was to have sound
finance with low public expenditure and borrowing.
Under the headline, Don't Undo My Work, Mrs Thatcher wrote: 'People are
asking, is John Major free to go his own way? He is - within the constraints
of the principles set out in the Conservative manifesto. Don't forget, I set
out our principles before we came into power so that people knew exactly
what we stood for.'
Her criticism of an interventionist stance and a belief that government
could successfully second-guess industry appeared to be directed against Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, whose leadership
challenge led to her downfall.
The backbench attack on Mrs Thatcher was led by Mr William Powell, Tory MP
for Corby and Mr Heseltine's parliamentary private secretary.
He said on the Radio 4 Today programme: 'Her whole analysis is quite
extraordinary. What won the election was Conservative policy. She seeks to
wrap Conservative policies in a cloak called Thatcherism. This whole article
reeks of the kind of triumphalism which people found so objectionable in Mrs
Thatcher.'

FT  22 APR 92 / 'Civil disobedience' urged over Scottish rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of Britain's biggest local authority yesterday called for 'civil
disobedience within the law' to put pressure on the government over demands
for a degree of self-government for Scotland.
Mr Charles Gray, Labour leader of Strathclyde regional council, called for
mass demonstrations and strikes, and did not rule out 'civil disobedience
outside the law' if Westminster did not respond to calls for changes in the
way Scotland is governed.
In a speech to the Scottish Trade Union Congress in Perth, Mr Gray said he
would not follow government instructions to implement another round of
compulsory competitive tendering for local government services. 'We cannot
accept another swathe of job losses,' he said.
Mr Gray was speaking in the debate on home rule, which ended with the STUC
backing a motion calling for a 'multi-option referendum' on the
constitutional question, offering the choice between no change, devolution
and independence.
'If this government isn't going to speak to us in the united way we are
demanding, maybe we are going to have to live a little dangerously,' Mr Gray
said.
'We have had the poll tax, compulsory competitive tendering where I was
witness to thousands of good local government people protected by trade
unions being made redundant - and I'm not bloody well going to do it again.'
Mr Campbell Christie, STUC general secretary, said the Conservatives had
raised the constitution in the general election. 'Seventy-five per cent of
the Scottish electorate voted for parties supporting constitutional change.
We now want to know when we are going to get that change.'
The Rev Norman Shanks, convener of the Church of Scotland's church and
nation committee, told the conference: 'There is a mounting groundswell of
concern, discontent and frustrated expectations that will not be prepared
indefinitely to take no for an answer.'
Canon Kenyon Wright, chairman of the executive of the Scottish
Constitutional Convention, told the 500 delegates that Scots had voted in
the general election for a democratic, devolved, just and sustainable
society. 'The government had better listen.'
The first large-scale demonstration of public antipathy to Westminster is
being planned for the December European summit in Edinburgh.
The STUC also moved yesterday to end the longstanding enmity between the
labour movement and the Scottish National Party.
The STUC general council, dominated by Labour party loyalists, decided on
Sunday not to invite Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, to address the congress.
But a majority of delegates are clearly in favour of co-operating with the
nationalists and the motion passed yesterday called for discussions with all
parties ready to 'co-operate with or join the Scottish Constitutional
Convention'.
The SNP has said it will not join the convention but is ready to co-operate
with it.

FT  22 APR 92 / California action may prompt rise in US executions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA carried out its first execution for 25 years yesterday, raising
fears among opponents of capital punishment of a wave of executions across
the US.
Robert Alton Harris was gassed to death in front of 49 witnesses at San
Quentin prison after a series of reversals in which a federal appeals court
four times stayed his execution, and was four times overruled by the Supreme
Court in Washington.
The Supreme Court overturned the fourth and final stay, which was issued
after Harris had been strapped in the gas chamber, and ordered the lower
courts not to file any more stays without the high court's permission.
After this ruling, Harris was hastily returned to the chamber for the last
time, looking sombre but winking at one guard. Harris was executed for
murdering two teenagers in 1978.
The state of California has often set political and social trends for the
US. It not only has the second-largest number of convicted prisoners facing
death - 328 after Harris's execution - but has also been the scene of a
vigorous public debate, as conservative politicians attacked the liberal
state judges appointed by Mr Jerry Brown, a contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination, when he was governor in the late 1970s.
Popular support for the death penalty as a punishment for murder has almost
doubled since the mid-1960s, when it fell to about 40 per cent. Nine
executions in 10 have taken place in the southern states. Black prisoners
have received a disproportionate number of death sentences.
Although the death penalty has been brandished by politicians as a weapon
against rising crime, it is rarely carried out.
Only 169 executions have been carried out since 1976. At the current rate,
15 times this number of new prisoners arrive on 'death row' each year.
The Bush administration last year tried to pass legislation making it easier
to carry out a death sentence by weakening the habeas corpus protections
which enable prisoners to delay execution with seemingly endless appeals.
The Democratic-controlled Congress responded by proposing to extend the
death penalty to 50 federal crimes - a largely irrelevant gesture which
covered such offences as the murder of a federal egg inspector. However, the
extension was also intended to curb indiscriminate sale of guns.
President George Bush then threatened to veto the entire bill, partly
because he claimed it would tie the hands of policemen and prosecutors by
further extending habeas corpus protection, but also partly because of his
opposition to gun controls.
The resulting stalemate has blocked any federal crime legislation, leaving
states to press ahead with their own solutions.

FT  22 APR 92 / Hanson may opt for 'part-time' position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON, chairman of the Anglo-US industrial conglomerate that bears his
name, may elect to have a non-executive role as more of the day-to-day
managerial decisions are left to Mr Derek Bonham. Mr Bonham has been
appointed to the newly-created post of chief executive.
Mr Bonham yesterday told the Financial Times: 'James (Hanson) has a lot to
contribute. But he may become part-time and decide to elect for a
non-executive role. The situation is likely to be reviewed as times goes on
and he will make that announcement in due course.'
It was not immediately clear whether Mr Bonham, who had been Hanson's
finance director, had responsibility for Hanson Industries in the US as well
as Hanson in the UK.
Mr David Clarke, deputy chairman of Hanson Industries and the named
successor to Lord White, chairman of Hanson's US arm, said: 'There is no
conceivable way that Derek Bonham would have anything to do with those
matters outside Lord Hanson's domain.'
While Mr Clarke praised Mr Bonham's abilities and described him as a good
friend, he said there was a clearly defined role for a chief executive in
the UK while he would continue to be in charge of the US businesses.
Mr Bonham said he had a developing role which would extend across both sides
of the Atlantic. 'I am chief executive of Hanson PLC but there is only one
balance sheet off which to drive the companies.' Both Mr Clarke and Mr
Bonham stressed how they had enjoyed working together and how they were
looking forward to developing the new partnership between them.
Asked whether his new appointment would lead to his taking over the
chairmanship of Hanson when Lord Hanson retires in 1997, Mr Bonham said:
'Let's wait and see. I prefer to take one day at a time. I want to make a
success of this job first.'

FT  22 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Brokers cut Rank forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE BROKERS were called in to see Rank Organisation yesterday prior to the
leisure group moving into its closed period, and all seemingly emerged to
cut their profits forecasts. Continuing worries over the performance of its
part-owned subsidiary Fuji Xerox were thought to have influenced the
downgrades, although other anxieties emerged.
All three houses - County NatWest, Hoare Govett and Goldman Sachs - were
already at the bottom of the range of analysts' forecasts. County shaved
Pounds 5m off its estimate to Pounds 265m, and Hoare's figure was also down
that amount to Pounds 270m. Goldman was reported to be downgrading by a
similar amount. This, and the fact that Rank has had a good run, moved
County on to a short-term sell stance.
Fuji Xerox is part of Rank Xerox, the office equipment group which
contributes 60 per cent to Rank Organisation's overall profits. There was
also some disquiet on the US video distribution business. The shares lost 19
to 739p.
Marshalls placing
Ibstock Johnsen was said to have sold its 4.2 per cent stake in Marshalls,
the Halifax-based building materials company, raising Pounds 3.6m for the
hard-pressed brick and forestry products group.
The 3.9m shares were sold by Ibstock at 85p - apparently by Ibstock's broker
James Capel - and placed at 86p. Ibstock is believed to have made a small
profit on its holding.
The shares were picked up by three large institutional buyers within minutes
of being offered. Marshalls was unmoved at 88p, and Ibstock firmed a penny
to 86p in turnover of 3.6m.
Life assurance companies followed the market's downward trend, ahead of a
buy note on the sector from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance
specialist at UBS, pointed out that the life sector has underperformed the
market by 8 per cent since the beginning of the year, but he expects it to
recover as political risk has been removed following the general election.
The prospect of lower interest rates and economic recovery is also positive
for life assurance companies, according to Mr Ziai, as well as the
conclusion of the ABI's accounting proposals for life companies. UBS
believes this could produce room for a 10 per cent upward rerating when
companies publish their restated figures.
Legal &amp; General finished 2 firmer at 390p, but other stocks in the sector
lost ground, with Britannic, one of UBS's buy recommendations, falling 11 to
854p and Refuge, another on the favoured list, slipping 7 to 658p.
A shortage of stock exacerbated rises in leading property shares as the
weekend talk of economic recovery brought buyers into the sector. MEPC
forged ahead 17 to 317p, Land Securities 12 to 412p, British Land 23 to 215p
and Slough Estates 9 to 187p.
Exotic fruits and banana importer Geest declined 4 to 369p as company
president Mr John van Geest disposed of 1.25m shares in the market,
representing 1.75 per cent of Geest's equity, via a placing at 360p per
share.
After Mr van Geest's disposal the Seaq ticker revealed a line of 920,000 had
been placed at 363p.
There was a late flurry of activity in the regional electricity stocks and
the Electricity Package, thought to have represented more unravelling of the
Package units.
Large late trades of 1m shares each in some of the regional electricity
companies saw East Midlands climb 3 to 291p and Eastern a penny to 281p. The
Electricity Package closed 10 higher at Pounds 3155.
Highest turnover of the day was in Scottish Power, at 10m shares, as the
price receded 3 1/2 to 94p. Scottish Hydro, also active on trade of 7.9m
shares, slipped 3 1/2 to 99p.
Pharmaceuticals again suffered a hangover from Wall Street as US investors
continued their drift from the sector into more cyclical stocks.
There was also negative sentiment surrounding US drugs group Merck, which
reported fairly pedestrian first-quarter figures last week, reflecting on
selected London drugs stocks.
Glaxo tumbled 34 to 754p, Medeva fell 25 to 259p and SmithKline Beecham
dropped 39 to 833p. Merck's low level of price increases disappointed the
market, and SmithKline is expected to follow this trend when it reports
tomorrow. This, together with the cost of launching several new products, is
expected to limit profits growth.
Cable and Wireless lost ground after a rumour that its broker had downgraded
the telecoms group. There was also talk of additional pressure from the
options market with the expiry today of the April 550 series. The shares
slipped 14 to 558p.
Big international earners among brewery stocks lost out to cyclical
companies, on hopes of an economic upturn in the UK. Guinness slipped 8 1/2
to 563p and Grand Metropolitan 10 to 460p, but Bass improved 4 to 615p and
Allied-Lyons 2 to 640p. Whitbread 'A' was steady at 444p.
Midland Bank eased a further 2 to 360p as the market continued to take on
board last week's disposal of 60m shares by the Kuwait Investment Office and
doubts that Lloyds Bank will produce a bid to counter the agreed offer for
Midland from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking.
Lloyds lost 2 to 391p, while the problems surrounding property company
Olympia &amp; York continued to weigh on Barclays, 5 lower at 334p.
Simon Engineering declined 7 to 270p after Smith New Court weighed in with a
profits downgrade for the current year.
The broker cut its figure by 13 per cent to Pounds 18.8m. Mr Iain Lowe at
Smith said: 'First-half profits are likely to be worse than we had hoped and
the indication is that the company will not be among the first to emerge out
of the recession.'

FT  22 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei below 17,000 in
low volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE-LINKED selling drove shares lower yesterday, leaving the Nikkei
average closing below 17,000 for the first time since April 9, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The average lost 284.03 at 16,787.33, after a day's high of 17,124.55 and
low of 16,682.86. Monday's fall on Wall Street also depressed sentiment.
Volume picked up modestly from 200m shares to 250m. Falls outscored rises by
712 to 240, with 162 issues unaltered. The Topix index of all first section
shares slipped 12.49 to 1,280.20, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
edged up 0.35 to 1,039.06.
Trading remained dominated by index-linked activity, as the fall in the
futures markets prompted arbitrageurs to unwind positions. Small-lot selling
of stocks bought on margin six months ago added to the decline.
Traders said buy orders placed at lower levels by some pension funds and
life assur-ers failed to lift sentiment. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew said domestic investors were hoping that foreigners would return now
that the Easter break was over.
Bio-technology issues, which were actively traded on margin last October,
lost ground on margin unwinding by individuals. But some short-term traders
sought speculative stocks, Morinaga Milk gaining Y9 to Y726 and Okamoto
Industries Y40 to Y1,130.
Bank shares were lower, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y60 to Y1,670 and
Fuji Bank off Y50 at Y1,260. Most analysts believe that asset-backed stocks
need to fall further before investors regain confidence in them.
Industrial blue chips were firm. Sony put on Y30 to Y4,150. Mr Barry Dargan,
electrical analyst at James Capel, said international blue chips looked
cheap by international valuation standards.
Department stores fell on prospects of lower earnings, after sharp drops in
March department store sales for the Tokyo and Osaka districts were
announced. Mitsukoshi shed Y42 to Y832 on reports of expected losses for the
financial year to February. Tokyu Department Store fell Y43 to a low for the
year of Y540.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 216.45 to 19,213.53 in volume of 10m
shares. Institutional investors and some foreigners were seen bargain
hunting, but overall activity remained subdued. Roundup
WEAKNESS in Tokyo and on Wall Street weighed on the Pacific Rim yesterday.
Indian brokers continued to boycott trading in Bombay.
AUSTRALIA ended slightly lower in thin trading, the All Ordinaries index
losing 2.0 at 1,588.0 in turnover of ADollars 136.4m.
Among the bright spots, QBE, ADollars 6.20, and Lend Lease, ADollars 15.40,
gained 20 cents apiece after their joint purchase of Australian Eagle
Insurance. BTR Nylex rose 7 cents to ADollars 2.61 after Westinghouse Brake
and Signal advised shareholders to accept its offer.
BANGKOK closed at an eight-month low as protests against the appointment of
an unelected prime minister intensified. The SET index fell 23.75 or 2.9 per
cent to 785.09.
NEW ZEALAND recovered from a weak start, the NZSE index finishing 0.85 up at
1,411.54 in turnover of NZDollars 15.6m. The listing of Australian
Consolidated Press was not well received. No shares were traded in its first
day on the exchange.
HONG KONG ended below the day's best after cautious trading. The Hang Seng
index gained a net 10.40 at 5,093.09 and turnover contracted to HKDollars
2.45bn from HKDollars 3.17bn.
HSBC Holdings came under selling pressure, and brokers noted some switching
from HSBC into Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia.
MANILA lost ground on concern about threats by army rebels to attempt a
fresh coup ahead of the May 11 elections. The composite index receded 4.68
to 1,171.54 in combined turnover of 191.9m pesos, after a previous 172.2m
pesos.

BOURSES re-opened for business after the Easter break but trading was
uneventful, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had a quiet day, as the DAX index closed down 2.73 at 1,746.50,
while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained 0.32 to 711.48.
Turnover fell to DM3.8bn from DM5.1bn last Thursday.
The market is waiting for the March money supply figures this week and
commentators are hoping for signs of a slowing in monetary growth. However,
the expectations are that the Bundesbank will be unable to cut interest
rates until the fourth quarter. The result of strike ballots among public
service workers is also expected before the weekend.
Lufthansa was unchanged at DM153.50 in spite of a statement by Mr Jurgen
Weber, the chairman, at the weekend in which he said that first quarter
results were likely to be poor.
The airline refused to comment on a report in a German magazine which said
that the airline had lost DM400m in the first three months. Mr Weber said
that the 3 per cent reduction in costs should be seen as the first step in a
cost-cutting programme, but that further cuts would not affect services.
Veba moved ahead DM1.90 to DM392.50 after reporting on Saturday that its
petrochemical division had shown a 29 per cent improvement in 1991 group net
profit.
Hoesch was DM4 weaker at DM248 on last week's news that the cartel office
had approved its merger with Krupp, while the latter gained DM2.40 to

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ, FACING the certainty of an even smaller harvest than last year, is
raising government prices for wheat and barley by up to 200 per cent to stop
farmers selling to private buyers, reports Reuter from Baghdad.
The government announced it would pay farmers D2,250 (Pounds 1,320) dinars a
tonne for wheat, compared with D800 last year, and D1,500 a tonne for
barley, up from D500.
UN experts said they expected this year's wheat and barley crops to be at
least 30 per cent below last year's because of UN sanctions imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
Agriculture ministry figures put last year's wheat harvest at 525,000
tonnes, down from 1.19m tonnes in 1990 and the barley crop at 520,000
tonnes, compared with 1.85m tonnes.
Shortages of fertiliser, insecticides, irrigated land, spare parts and
certified seeds caused the shortfall despite fairly good rains and a full
year to recover from the Gulf War.
'It was a fairly good year compared to last but negative factors caused by
sanctions will mean the wheat and barley crop is even less,' said one UN
expert. 'This trend will doubtless continue until sanctions are lifted.'
President Saddam Hussein ordered the price rises. He has vowed Iraq will
survive sanctions despite US and British pledges to continue them until he
is toppled.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Platinum, a Canadian exploration company that has so far
confined its efforts to North America, has acquired control of a platinum
prospect in South Africa.
IP is buying Jamestone Exploration, the main shareholder in which is Mr
James Hamilton, a South African geologist. Mr Jamestone has in turn
exercised an option on a property previously held by Britain's RTZ, near the
Northam platinum mine in the western Transvaal.
Mr Glen Varty, IP's president, said that IP is now looking for a partner to
carry out further drilling work on the property.
Part of the funds for the exploration work will come from the proceeds of a
recent CDollars 305,000 (Pounds 150,000) private placement, which has
resulted in an Australian company, Turnbull Doyle Resources of Melbourne,
acquiring a 20 per cent stake in IP.
The chairman of Turnbull Doyle is Mr Neville Wran, who was premier of New
South Wales from 1976 to 1986.
IP, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange and on Nasdaq, has nine
platinum exploration properties in Canada and the US state of Michigan. But
Mr Varty said that with the improved political situation in South Africa,
'it's attractive to be back down there'.

PLATINUM was in retreat on the London bullion market after the Easter break.
By midday platinum futures on Nymex were hovering around the key resistance
level of Dollars 340 a troy ounce. New York dealers pointed to the third
consecutive day of losses on the Tokyo stock market, continuing to signal
that the Japanese economy is slipping towards recession, with bearish
implications for platinum demand. They were surprised prices had not fallen
further given both the Japanese slowdown and high levels of outstanding
Soviet swaps still held in Switzerland. 'The Swiss are awash with platinum
and they just seem to be holding it back from the market,' one dealer said.
On the LME COPPER closed down, but off 10-week lows struck in early trading.
Recent constructive US economic data, underlying Chinese buying interest and
drawdowns in LME stocks suggest that further declines could be be limited.
London COCOA futures ended narrowly mixed, with most activity in the rolling
forward of positions out of May and into July. News that the Ivory Coast had
proposed an export quota system at UN talks on a new international agreement
had little impact.

FT  22 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: Mexico to sell another 25m
shares in Telmex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is to sell a further 25m shares in Telmex, the
Mexican telephone monopoly, next month, further reducing its shareholding in
the company from 9.3 per cent to 4.6 per cent.
The international offering of American depository shares, totalling Dollars
1.5bn, was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in New York on
Thursday. Roadshows will be held over the next few weeks in the US, Europe
and the Far East, and the deal is expected to be priced in mid-May.
Just under 40 per cent of the deal will be aimed at investors outside the
US, under the lead management of Goldman Sachs.
Foreign investment in the Mexican stock market rose 348 per cent last year
to a record Dollars 9.05bn. Since Telmex's Dollars 2.2bn international share
offering last June, which accounted for a substantial portion of that growth
in foreign investment, its share price has more than doubled from Dollars 27
1/2 to Dollars 57 5/8 .
Meanwhile, the trend for deleveraging among US companies which piled up debt
through takeover sprees and management buyouts during the 1980s is becoming
particularly obvious among cyclical stocks.
Among the latest offerings under preparation, Black &amp; Decker is planning to
sell 18m shares, totalling around Dollars 425m, which will bring the
company's gearing down from around 60 per cent to 40 or 45 per cent. A total
of 3.6m shares will be offered through an international tranche, arranged by
Lehman Brothers. The company is also to spin off a computer subsidiary.
Federated Department Stores, which re-emerged from bankruptcy protection
under Chapter 11 earlier this year, is preparing an offering of 32m shares,
of which 8m will be offered internationally.

FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks take the lead
in UK power station loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks played a significant role in three big loans signed in London
last week, despite fears that the recent weakness in Japanese share prices
would force the banks to withdraw from international lending.
In one loan - a Pounds 370m facility to finance the construction of a
gas-fired power station for Medway Power in Kent - half the 10 lead banks
were Japanese.
The three loans, all for independent gas-fired power station projects,
reveal that the Japanese banks are now pursuing high margin lending, rather
than repeating the low margin loans with which they flooded the
international credit markets in the 1980s.
The margin on one of the projects, a Pounds 375m loan to build a power
station at Keadby, South Humberside, rises from a healthy 1 percentage point
in the first three years to 1.15 percentage points at the end of the 15-year
loan. The terms of the other loans have not yet been revealed, but are
believed to be broadly similar.
Five Japanese banks - Sanwa, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Fuji and Dai-Ichi Kangyo
 -are among the 10 underwriters of the Medway loan. Some of the Pounds 370m
will be taken up by other banks through a syndication agreement, but each of
the 10 lead banks is expected to advance a significant portion of the loan.
Sanwa is the only Japanese bank among the seven lead banks in the Keadby
loan, while LTCB International is among the lead banks in the third project,
a Pounds 150m loan for a power station at Derwent, in the Midlands.
The three projects were agreed last week, ahead of the expiry of draft
supply agreements with British Gas. These would have lapsed had loan
agreements not been signed within six months of the contracts being agreed
last autumn.
Part of the explanation for the continued involvement of the Japanese is
that all three projects have been under consideration since the end of last
year.
The banks' involvement with the projects goes back even further. Japanese
banks were among the most active in lending to the UK's regional electricity
companies in the run up to their privatisation in 1990. These companies are
now joint partners behind the projects.
The earlier loans to the regional electricity companies were made at margins
of only around  3/16 of a percentage point. Involvement in the new project
loans is seen as part of the compensation for having supported the
electricity companies before.

FT  22 APR 92 / International Bonds: Activity set to centre on demand for
dollar securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTIVE demand for dollar securities is set to provide some direction for
activity in the Eurobond market over the next few weeks. Following the
latest easing by the Federal Reserve, the market has so far failed to rally.
Borrowers are keeping an eye on the market, however, and a number of
companies are likely to tap the dollar sector, if the market picks up as
they expect. Although swap opportunities remain unappealing, many borrowers
may be prepared to lock in to fixed interest rates at around these levels.
A number of Japanese borrowers, including the Export Import Bank of Japan,
have been looking at the market, but so far only the Japan Finance
Corporation for Municipal Enterprises (JFM) has mandated a bank to arrange a
transaction. A Dollars 200m 10-year deal for JFM is expected to emerge later
this week via Bank of Tokyo. The deal is expected to be priced to yield
about 30 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury.
France's Compagnie Bancaire is expected to launch a Dollars 500m five-year
deal via J. P. Morgan after a series of roadshows in the next few weeks.
Demand for dollar paper is concentrated mainly among retail and small
institutional investors in continental Europe, who take a positive view on
the dollar.
Three deals emerged, in dollars and D-Marks, in the Japanese equity-linked
sector, despite a further fall in the Nikkei index, which ended below
17,000. However, the calendar for new issues in the coming weeks is
extremely thin. Few deals had been planned, and several have been cancelled
due to the dire performance of the Tokyo stock market.
The two dollar offerings yesterday, for Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry
and Nippon Koshuha Steel, both performed quite well, bid at 100 1/4 and 100
5/8 respectively, above their par issue price, according to lead manager
Yamaichi International.

programme

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN is cutting sharply its programme of government bond issues as its
six-year, Dollars 300bn economic development plan runs into difficulties,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
The government intended to increase new bond issues by at least 140 per cent
in the fiscal year to June 1992, to pay for the ambitious development plan,
originally scheduled to end in mid-1997.
In November it reformed its issuing system, auctioning bonds instead of
allocating them at fixed prices, to ease pressure on state finances and
create a secondary bond market able to absorb the large number of new
issues.
However with many projects in the six-year plan plagued by delays, the
government is now cutting bond issues because it is unable to spend the
money on schedule, said Mr John Shueh, head of the Treasury department in
Taiwan's central bank.
'Delays in construction projects are the major factor in our scaling back
issues,' he said.
The government cancelled a bond issue due in May and will only issue about
TDollars 230bn (USDollars 9.1bn) in the current fiscal year, against the
original target of at least TDollars 250bn.
In the next fiscal year, to June 1993, the government will issue TDollars
230bn of bonds instead of the TDollars 300bn which was originally planned,
Mr Shueh said.

board row at San Miguel
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDUARDO Cojuangco, the Philippine businessman who last week looked set to
gain control of San Miguel Corporation, the country's largest industrial
enterprise, was yesterday left with only one seat in the board.
An order from the chief justice of the Philippine Supreme Court issued hours
before San Miguel's annual meeting yesterday restrained Mr Cojuangco from
voting a block of shares that last year qualified his group for three seats
in the 15-member board.
Until last week Mr Cojuangco, on the basis of a separate Supreme Court
decision on March 4 ordering a new election at United Coconut Planters Bank,
was widely seen as poised for a takeover of the bank and San Miguel.
The bank was organised by Mr Cojuangco with proceeds from a levy on the
coconut industry. It is administrator of a block of 30 per cent of San
Miguel shares.
Mr Cojuangco had persistently argued that the shares in San Miguel, although
registered in the names of 14 shell companies he and his associates
controlled, were actually owned by some 1.4m coconut farmers who paid the
coconut levy over between 1973 and 1982.
The lower court instructed by the Supreme Court to supervise elections at
bank, however, is still to schedule the shareholders' meeting. Furthermore,
the present board, composed of government nominees placed after the bank was
sequestered in 1986, had already cancelled this year's annual meeting and
election when the court decision came.
Yesterday's restraining order effectively pushed Mr Cojuangco from the
beer-and-food conglomerate, which last year recorded sales of 53.3bn pesos
(Dollars 2.2bn).
However, the incumbent controlling group, the Soriano family and nominees of
the state's Presidential Commission on Good Government - which sequestered
the United Coconut Planters Bank-administered shares - nominated only 14
names, leaving one for the Cojuangco group.
The shares in question were in the names of Mr Cojuangco, his relatives and
a number of companies his family controlled.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB Banking Corp (ABC), the biggest international Arab bank, has announced
a turnround to net profits of Dollars 45m for 1991 from losses of Dollars
91m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Manama.
Mr Abdullah Saudi, president and chief executive, said the bank, which is
mainly owned by the Libyan Treasury, Kuwait's finance ministry and the Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority, blamed the 1990 loss on the Gulf crisis. However
it expected net profits of at least Dollars 100m in 1992.
He said ABC had not been affected by United Nations sanctions against Libya.
It was still accepting Libyan deposits and its relationship with Libyan
authorities had not changed, he said.
'We have a normal relationship with Libya . . . and we are maintaining this
relationship. We are operating in this country and we are receiving deposits
here and this is acceptable and legal,' he said.
Gulf-based bankers said last month Libya had shifted large amounts of its
liquid assets from Europe to accounts in the Arab world to protect them
against future economic sanctions.
Mr Saudi said the bank was not on a list of Libyan-owned institutions with
which US companies were banned from dealing. Nor was it likely to be placed
on it in the future.
ABC would maintain its policy of expansion in the Arab world and planned to
open a representative office in Iran before the end of 1992, he said. Only
about 15 per cent of the bank's assets are in the Middle East.
The bank said Dollars 102m was allocated for 1991 loan-loss provisions,
compared with Dollars 179m in 1990.
Total income rose to a record Dollars 622m from Dollars 555m the previous
year. Assets declined to Dollars 20.45bn from Dollars 20.55bn, while
deposits climbed to Dollars 16.8bn from Dollars 16.6bn.
Capital adequacy ratios exceeded international requirements of 8 per cent,

TAIWAN Aerospace has announced the appointment of Mr Earle Ho, 53, as
chairman, following the resignation of Mr David Huang, 72.
Mr Ho, known as the 'Ship-breaking King' during the 1980s, is also chairman
of the private Tungho Steel and heads the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries
Association.
His appointment is seen as a means for the Taiwanese government to distance
itself from the company's proposed Dollars 2bn deal to buy up to 40 per cent
of the commercial operations of McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group.
His predecessor, Mr Huang, had close ties with the government and the
military.
The deal has come under fire in the island's parliament, and the government
is considering taking as little as a 25 per cent stake in the deal. 'It
could be 30 or 25 per cent,' acknowledged Mr Denny Ko, president of Taiwan
Aerospace.
It is hoped that Mr Ho's influence in the business community and lack of
official ties will help to re-establish Taiwan Aerospace's image as a
private enterprise, although observers say the government will still make
the final decision and find the money to finance the deal.

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's 25 securities firms suffered net losses of Won46.24bn (Dollars
58.9m) in the 1991 fiscal year ended March 31, according to estimates by the
country's securities supervisory board, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. The figure
represents a sharp reversal from year-earlier earnings of Won29.62bn.
In contrast, six new securities firms showed combined earnings of Won46.91bn
in the same fiscal year. The six firms, most of which started in the second
half of 1991, are converting their businesses from short-term lending to
brokering.
The securities supervisory board attributed the poor results of the older 25
firms to the sluggish local stock market and tighter liquidity, which meant
higher interest expenses.
Meanwhile, the six new firms benefited from tighter liquidity as they were
allowed to do short-term lending business on a temporary basis until the
completion of their conversions.
Of the 25 established firms, only six reported a rise in earnings in 1991,
compared with the previous fiscal year.
The six include Daewoo Securities with Won9.59bn in net earnings, up 622.1
per cent from a year ago; Seoul Securities with Won3.55bn, up 96.6 per cent;
and Hanyang Securities with Won3.15bn, up 84 per cent.
Daewoo, as the nation's largest securities house, fared well in securities
investments in the local market compared with other companies. Earnings were
also boosted by dividends of Won4bn for investments in a joint securities
venture in Hungary, which started up in 1991.
Tonyang Securities is the only one which swung to the black, with net
earnings of Won6.9bn in 1991 from a loss of Won16.39bn a year ago.
Seven companies, including Daishin Securities, Lucky Securities and Dong Suh
Securities, showed full-year losses, a turnround from the black a year ago.
Three companies, Ssangyong Securities, First Securities and Construction
Securities, reported losses for the second straight year.

BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and industrial group,
yesterday announced it was merging various subsidiaries in the meat industry
to form a company with a projected turnover of NZDollars 185m (USDollars
100.5) and a forecast profit of NZDollars 8.3m.
A main component of the new company will be Huttons Kiwi, a company BIL said
last year would be relisted on the New Zealand Stock Exchange this year.
Huttons Kiwi, a producer of bacon, ham and other meat products, is to be
merged with the Riverland Group which exports beef to the US and Pacific rim
countries.
The two companies are to merge with a Brierley controlled retail group
Apparel Holdings, which is listed on the stock exchange and seems destined
to be the vehicle to launch the meat group. Apparel, which is 96 per cent
owned by BIL, will then sell its assets to the parent company for cash.
In the year to December 1990 Apparel made a NZDollars 55m net loss but
reduced this to a NZDollars 199,000 loss in the year to last December.

R59.6m

<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT improvement in performance at the Joel mine helped the gold
mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group to boost
profits in the March quarter.
The group posted net profit after tax of R59.6m (Dollars 20.7m), a 2.1 per
cent increase over net profit in the December quarter. The upturn came in
spite of a 2.2 per cent drop in the average gold price received to R33,134 a
kilogram.
Total gold produced rose by 3.1 per cent to 12,361kg on account of a 3.5 per
cent improvement in the average grade to 4.11 grams a tonne.
The improvement in the group's results was attributed to the performance of
Joel, where the grade had increased by 18.1 per cent to 6.45 grams a tonne
and production had risen by 13.5 per cent to 1,560kg. Net profit after tax
rose to R7.4m from R890,000.
The group said it was confident of repeating these results in the current
quarter. The improved performance at Joel reflected more selective mining,
which allowed a significant reduction of the dilution percentages in the ore
mined, the group said.
Mr Kennedy Maxwell, head of JCI's gold and uranium division, said he did not
believe the strategy currently employed at Joel would have a big impact on
the mine's reserves. He said JCI believed the gold price would recover to
levels which would allow the group to return to low grade areas and mine
them profitably.
The group's Randfontein mine benefited from a similar approach. It saw the
yield rise to 3.6 grams a tonne, a level last reached in June 1987.
Gold production was 2.5 per cent higher at 8,014kg, while both revenue and
costs per kilogram were slightly lower.
Net profit after tax dropped by 7.7 per cent to R50.3m on account of a much
higher tax bill. The mine again paid out a R5.2m productivity bonus to
workers, effectively a further 12 per cent increase over their 5 to 6 per
cent basic increase.
At Western Areas, R6m profit from uranium offset a R5.4m loss on the gold
operations. Net profit from Western Areas slipped by 37.5 per cent to R1.8m
.

</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KOREA'S Hyundai Group is to shift management of its worldwide personal
computer and computer peripherals operations to the US to improve its
response to rapidly changing market conditions and to gain earlier access to
advanced technologies.
In an unusual move for an Asian company, full management control, marketing,
product development and product assembly for the group's Dollars 750m
personal computer and peripherals business will be moved from Seoul to San
Jose, California.
The decision reflects Hyundai's recognition of the critical value of
day-to-day contact with suppliers and customers, said Mr Edward Thomas, the
newly appointed president of Hyundai's Information Systems Division.
Mr Thomas, a veteran of the US computer industry, said his mandate was to
create an autonomous business unit with global responsibility for expanding
Hyundai's personal computer sales.
Last year, Hyundai sold about Dollars 300m-worth of personal computers in
the US. 'We should be able to double that in a few years,' said Mr Thomas.
'We fully expect to have our next generation of desktop and notebook
computers - designed, engineered and assembled in America - shipping to US
and world markets by the end of the year,' he added.
The move would enable Hyundai to reduce the time it takes to bring a new
product to market by more than 30 per cent, Mr Thomas said.
The relocation would not displace Korean workers, Mr Thomas stressed.
Circuit board manufacturing would continue to be performed at Hyundai's
Korean factories, he said.
However, a US assembly operation would enable Hyundai to compete more
effectively with US computer makers through a quicker response to customer
requirements.
A further advantage is that Hyundai would be able to react more rapidly to
price trends, Mr Thomas said.
Once the US operation is in full swing - probably by year-end - Mr Thomas
plans to turn to the European market and establish European sales, service
and assembly operations.

PHELPS DODGE, the largest US copper producer, saw operating income for its
mining operations drop in the first quarter to Dollars 76.9m from Dollars
113m a year ago, Reuter reports.
The group, which manufactures truck wheels and rims and is a leading
producer of carbon black, reported first-quarter net income down to Dollars
53.6m or Dollars 1.53 per share, compared with Dollars 77.3m or Dollars 2.23
a year ago.
It said first-quarter earnings were satisfactory in spite of continued slow
economies in many of its markets.
Group revenues for the quarter declined to Dollars 590.5m from Dollars
601.8m, while Phelps Dodge Mining saw its revenues slip to Dollars 301.5m,
compared with Dollars 314m a year ago.
Phelps cited lower copper prices and the closure of concentrator operations
at its Tyrone, New Mexico mine for the reduction in mining profits. It added
that reduced worldwide demand caused first-quarter copper prices to average
about 11 cents less than a year ago.
Phelps Dodge Industries reported an improvement in operating income, to
Dollars 20.3m from Dollars 16.8m a year ago.
The company said its share of copper production from worldwide operations
was 123,100 tons in the first quarter, compared with 130,400 tons a year
ago.
Copper sales from mine production were 127,700 tons, down from 138,500 tons
a year ago.

IMPERIAL OIL, Canada's largest integrated oil company, reported a sharp fall
in first-quarter net profit to CDollars 40m (USDollars 33.9m), or 21 cents a
share, down from Dollars 196m, or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier. Revenues
were Dollars 2.07bn, against Dollars 2.4bn.
The latest period included a Dollars 14m after-tax loss on divestments,
against a gain of Dollars 64m a year earlier.
Imperial, 70 per cent-owned by Exxon, said it was putting its PVC plastics
business up for sale, but would invest further in its polyethylene and
ethylene businesses.
The company has been re-structuring and reducing its downstream operations
since its Dollars 5bn takeover of Texaco Canada two years ago.
In 1992, it plans to eliminate 1,700 jobs, shut 1,000 service stations and
reduce refining capacity. Nova, the Calgary gas transmission and
petrochemicals group, earned CDollars 32m in the first quarter, against
Dollars 26m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12 per cent to Dollars 746m.

technology accord

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the US computer giant, and Thomson-CSF, the
French state-controlled defence electronics group, yesterday announced a
technology and marketing accord for a new generation of chips.
They have reached agreement in principle for Thomson-CSF to be licensed to
make a new chip being developed by IBM and Motorola, the US electronics
group. Thomson-CSF will then customise the chip, known as a Power PC
microprocessor, for its own products: high-speed computers, working in real
time, for space, military and industrial use.
The Power PC is being developed with Motorola, the US electronics group, as
part of the partnership between IBM and Apple, the personal computer maker,
announced last summer. The new chip, to be used in IBM and Apple's future
personal computers and workstations, is based on IBM's reduced instruction
set computing (Risc) technology, which enables computers to execute
instructions faster.
The Thomson-CSF deal helps IBM to enlarge the potential market for computers
using Power PCs, against rivals such as Hewlett Packard and Digital
Equipment, which had also been courting the French company for a technology
accord.
IBM will market versions of Power PC developed by Thomson-CSF for real-time
computing, a sector where IBM is absent, and which is used for a range of
professional applications from software engineering to guiding missiles.
Cetia, Thomson-CSF's real-time computing unit, will also market some IBM
workstations and use them for its own applications.
Cetia said it expected to launch the first prototypes of workstations using
Power PCs by the end of the year, for sale up to six months later. The chips
themselves will be made by another subsidiary, Thomson Composants Militaires
et Spatiaux.
Thomson-CSF approached IBM last July, as soon as it licensed Motorola to
build the Power PC, said officials of the French group. The French group has
been Motorola's biggest European components customer for the past 10 years
and was therefore keen to cement links with its supplier after Motorola's
accord with IBM.
This is the latest example of IBM's eagerness to form partnerships and its
most recent link-up with French state-owned industry. The US computer group
formed a far wider ranging accord at the end of January with Bull, which
also gets access to Risc technology. IBM is also negotiating to take a
minority stake in the computer-aided design unit of Dassault, the partly
government-owned aircraft group.

<TEXT>
TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurance group, reported an operating profit
of SKr531m (Dollars 88m) for 1991, representing a five-fold increase on the
previous year when the group suffered heavy losses on share investments.
However, the operating profit is still well below the level achieved in 1988
and 1989.
Trygg-Hansa SPP said its 1991 figures were seriously hit by losses in Gota,
the Swedish commercial banking group which showed heavy credit losses in the
real estate and finance company sectors.
The insurer, which owns 43.5 per cent of the share capital and 48.3 per cent
of the voting rights in Gota, made a SKr1.5bn bid for the outstanding shares
in the banking group a week ago in an attempt to quell doubts about Gota's
financial stability.
The insurance group plans to pay for the Gota shares with a new issue of its
own shares and will issue SKr3bn in convertible debentures later this year
in order to strengthen its capital structure.
Gota's heavy losses led to a SKr850m loss for Trygg-Hansa SPP last year,
curbing the recovery in the group's operating profit.
However, Trygg-Hansa SPP said the profit from its underlying insurance
business - which is predominantly consumer insurance - reached a record
level, increasing by 50 per cent to SKr931m, against SKr621m in 1990.
Premium income increased by 13 per cent to SKr7.47bn and Trygg-Hansa SPP
said its growth in costs slowed to SKr2.008bn, compared with SKr1.789bn in
1990, contributing to the improvement in the insurance results.
The board proposed maintaining the dividend at SKr4.

<TEXT>
USINOR SACILOR, the world's second largest steelmaker, has struck a
production sharing accord with Hoogovens, its Dutch competitor, which paves
the way for Hoogovens to close a 45-year-old heavy plate rolling mill.
Hoogovens is to close by the end of 1992 its 140,000 tonne per year Walserij
West mill, and then buy its supplies of heavy plate exclusively from the
French group's more modern plant.
Heavy plate, one of the most depressed sectors of the steel industry, is
mainly used in civil engineering, shipbuilding and to make large soldered
pipelines for the oil, gas and water industries.
In return for Usinor Sacilor's heavy plate, Hoogovens will provide the
French company with an equivalent tonnage of hot rolled coil, principally
used in the car and packaging industries.
This is the latest example of restructuring between European steel
companies, and is one of the ways in which the industry has responded to the
recent decline in world steel demand.
For similar motives, Usinor Sacilor two years ago combined its large pipe
making plants with Mannesman Rohrenwerke, the leading German steel tube and
pipe maker.
The joint venture, Europipe, happens to be a leading user of plate of the
type made by Hoogovens' Walserij West plant.
Usinor Sacilor will supply Hoogovens from its two plate rolling mills GTS in
Dunkerque, northern France and Dilling in Germany.
The two plants produce more than 2m tonnes of plate annually, making Usinor
Sacilor the world's biggest supplier.
Hoogovens says it hopes to find other jobs for the 300 workers at Walserij
West.

<TEXT>
HAVAS, one of France's leading media, marketing and travel groups, saw its
net profits fall by 6.1 per cent to FFr1.08bn (Dollars 192m) in 1991 mainly
due to losses in its travel interests and the slowdown in the advertising
market.
The group also announced plans to take full control of Comareg, which
publishes free newspapers in France, by buying the 38 per cent of the shares
it does not already own. Havas is offering one of its shares for two Comareg
shares.
This forms part of the trend for large French companies, such as the Suez
industrial group and Paribas investment bank, to restructure their
investment portfolios.
Havas, which is the biggest single force in French advertising through its
interest in the Eurocom group of agencies and marketing service
consultancies, experienced a 12 per cent increase in sales to FFr26.5bn
during 1991. However, on a strictly comparable basis, the growth in sales
was slightly lower at just 6.4 per cent.
The contribution from Eurocom, which last week announced a 5.2 per cent fall
in net income to FFr183.1m, was affected by the competitive condition of the
advertising market in France and in other European countries, notably the
UK.
Last year Havas was also affected by a fall in profits from its free
newspaper publishing interests and by an operating loss of FFr40m from its
travel business. However the group's other publishing interests fared well
despite the advertising downturn as investments in the Canal Plus and CLT
television groups.
The board proposed raising the dividend from FFr6.90 in 1990 to FFr8 a share
for 1991 and said the outlook for 1992 was 'more favourable' than that for
1991. In the first two months of the year Havas mustered sales growth on a
comparable basis of 10.7 per cent, with particularly strong growth from its
interests outside France.
In the meantime Comareg has been affected by the weakness of the French
advertising market. Its net profits fell sharply from FFr128.8m in 1990 to
FFr85m in 1991 on static sales of FFr1.83bn.
Compagnie Financiere de Suez increased its consolidated net attributable
profit to FFr3.83bn (Dollars 680m) in 1991 from FFr3.71bn in the previous 12
months, agencies report from Paris.
The dividend on 1991 earnings will be FFr8.20 a share, up from FFr7.80 on
1990 earnings. Net asset value per share rose to FFr525 compared with FFr504
in the previous year.
Results were also influenced by a 170 per cent jump in provisions that
Suez's French banks made against property loans.
However, Suez's flagship bank, Banque Indosuez, announced last month an
exceptional writedown of FFr650m.

CITICORP, the largest banking group in the US, yesterday underscored the
battered sector's gradual return to financial health. It reported doubled
first-quarter profits and said it expected to regain its normal earnings
capacity by the year-end.
The bank, which has been seriously hurt by the crisis of the past two years
in the US and foreign real estate markets, is in the throes of a
reorganisation and capital building programme.
It reported net income of Dollars 183m, or 37 cents a share, compared to
Dollars 93m, or 17 cents, in the same period of 1991.
Continuing real estate problems were shown in its Dollars 1,23bn provision
for credit losses. This compared with Dollars 1.15bn in the fourth quarter
and Dollars 812m in the same period of last year. North American commercial
real estate comprised Dollars 588m of the total, compared with Dollars 562m
in the previous quarter and Dollars 175m a year ago.
Net write-offs totalled Dollars 997m, compared to Dollars 646m a year ago,
with North American real estate making up Dollars 362m, compared to Dollars
86m a year ago.
Mr John Reed, chairman, told the company's annual meeting yesterday that the
US real estate market and Citicorp's portfolio had stabilised. However, he
repeated that write-offs and other costs of commercial credit would continue
to be about as high in 1992 as in 1991.
He said the quarter's results reflected 'continuing progress towards the
successful completion of Citicorp's two-year programme to restore
profitability, build the company's capital position, and further develop
core business franchises.'
Net interest revenue rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.83bn, while the net
interest margin rose to 3.76 per cent from 3.66 a year ago.
The operating margin - the difference between revenues and operating
expenses - rose 23 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, helped by a 5 per cent growth
in revenue and a 6 per cent decline in expenses.
The bank's global consumer business produced a 61 per cent improvement in
net income to Dollars 260m, helped by solid credit card revenue growth in
the US, and a good performance in Germany. Operating expenses fell 5 per
cent.
The global finance business, which includes most of its commercial business,
reported net income down from Dollars 212m to Dollars 161m. Asia, Latin
American and the Middle East produced strong growth, but economic weakness
in the US Japan and Europe meant a Dollars 17m loss in these regions.
The bank's North American commercial real estate operations, which have been
reorganised as a separate reporting category, lost Dollars 463m, against
Dollars 124m a year ago.
The bank's tier one capital ratio, which it wants to boost to at least 5 per
cent by the end of 1993, improved 33 basis points in the quarter to 4.06 per
cent.
Mr Reed told the meeting: 'By the end of the year we expect to have restored
our normal earnings capacity and to have significantly improved our balance
sheet.'

The Exploration Company of Louisiana, the oil and gas exploration and
production company quoted in London, plunged into losses in 1991.
In the final quarter non-cash provisions related to a Dollars 6.9m (Pounds
3.89m) write-down of investments and other assets and an impairment of oil
and gas properties amounted to Dollars 14.6m. The latter resulted from
sharply lower 1992 gas prices.
Net losses of Dollars 23.9m compared with net income of Dollars 1.09m last
time. Oil and gas revenues advanced to Dollars 11.2m (Dollars 8.35m) thanks
to higher production levels. Losses per share grew to 32 cents (1 cent).

FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ivax pays Pounds 22m for Waverley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAVERLEY Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned contract manufacturing company,
has been acquired by Ivax Corporation, the US chemicals and pharmaceuticals
group.
Waverley's owners have been paid about Pounds 22m in non-tradeable stock for
the group which in 1991 had turnover of Pounds 9m and trading profits of
Pounds 650,000.
Mr Ian Black, Ivax's vice president international, said the company would
continue to pursue companies throughout Europe in an effort to expand its
marketing network and product range. The group already has expertise in
tablet, capsule, injectable and aerosol delivery systems. It develops and
manufactures both patented and generic medicines.
'This move will help us achieve our aim of becoming a fully-integrated
pharmaceutical manufacturer with the capability to produce all dosage
forms,' Mr Black expl-ained.
Waverley, which specialises in blow-filled seal technology used in
respiratory medicine, opthalmology, surgery and contact lens care, sells
nearly all its products in Europe.
Ivax has no previous experience in the technology, involving plastic
containers which are blow-moulded, filled with product and sealed in one
continuous sterile operation.
The number of blow-filled seal units manufactured in the UK has increased
from 6m in the mid-1980s to more than 300m last year. Waverley produces
about half of these which it supplies to Ciba Vision, Boehringer Ingelheim
and Boots.
Waverley said it would use the additional resources provided by Ivax to
develop and expand its manufacturing operations.

advance

<TEXT>
EXPANSION by Greenacre Group, the nursing and residential care home
business, saw pre-tax profit increase 70 per cent, from Pounds 536,000 to
Pounds 913,000, in the year to January 31 1992.
Beds under operation and/or development rose from 119 to 334 and the number
of homes from three to seven. Most of the expansion was in Gloucestershire
where the group was the principal provider of long stay nursing beds for the
elderly.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 2.18m). Nursing and residential care
homes accounted for Pounds 751,000 (Pounds 439,000) of the profit. Earnings
per share were 0.7p (0.47p) basic and 0.47p (0.45p) fully diluted. The final
dividend is 0.125p for a total of 0.25p (0.225p).
Mr Tony Acton, chairman, said the balance sheet remained strong with
shareholders' funds of Pounds 11.6m and net cash of Pounds 3.2m. No interest
was capitalised in the past year.
'We remain in an excellent position to continue our expansion plans in the
year ahead,' he stated. The 60-bed nursing home at Trowbridge was expected
to open in the final quarter.

FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ropner stages second half recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROPNER, the engineering, property, investment and shipping group, picked up
in the second half to leave 1991 pre-tax profits just 4.5 per cent short on
the previous year.
Profits for the 12 months worked through at Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 5.53m),
after being Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.97m) at the halfway mark. 'A creditable
performance' according to Mr Jeremy Ropner, chairman.
Following the earlier disposal programme, turnover dropped from Pounds 35.4m
to Pounds 14.6m, and generated an operating surplus of Pounds 1.55m compared
with Pounds 2.64m.
The rest of the profit was made up of income from interests in associated
undertakings Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.59m) and investment revenue Pounds 2.09m
(Pounds 2.11m), less interest payable significantly lower at Pounds 181,000
(Pounds 815,000).
Mr Ropner said each of the three operating divisions contributed positively;
stringent control of costs and 'a realistic approach' to marketing made a
significant impact.
Engineering activities included production of domestic electric heaters,
textile and can making machinery, and machinery for paper making and paper
processing.
Profit of the Scruttons associate was Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 1.87m). Group
share was Pounds 1.22m and included non-recurring exceptional items of
Pounds 2.42m of which Pounds 693,000 was attributable to the shareholding.
It was clear that recessionary and competitive influences were affecting
Scruttons' performance in 1992, Mr Ropner declared.
Cash resources created by disposals had been conserved against the
background of a deteriorating business environment. The group had generated
a positive cash flow while continuing to invest in existing businesses.
For the current year Mr Ropner was optimistic of a better contribution from
engineering, where Meltog had a gratifying order book, and of continuing
progress in property. Shipping, however, was unlikely to achieve a result
comparable to 1991.
'When the business climate improves I am confident that - as a result of the
measures we have taken to restructure the framework of the company - our
profitability and dividend-paying capability will improve,' he said.
Earnings per share were maintained at 15.8p and the dividend is held at
8.25p with a final of 4.75p.

<TEXT>
SHARES IN Venture Plant Group were yesterday suspended at 8 1/2 p, shortly
before the USM-quoted plant hire business said it would soon announce a
substantial acquisition.
Venture is expected to announce the purchase of a materials handling
business in the mining industry, funded with a rights issue, by the first
week of May.
The deal will represent the first significant move by Mr Richard Cameron and
Mr Brian Thompson, Venture's joint chief executives, who both joined the
loss-making company from Blackwood Hodge, the international distributor of
earthmoving equipment which was bought by BM Group in 1990.
Venture was seen as an attractive 'shell' by Mr Thompson and Mr Cameron, who
each own 7.6 per cent of the company. The group incurred pre-tax losses of
Pounds 5.5m in the year to end-September, but eight of the 11 branches have
been closed, and there have been substantial redundancies and sales of
surplus equipment and land.
At suspension, Venture had a market value of Pounds 2.6m.

FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Fire and Acts of God included - The
fortunes of the Ecclesiastical Insurance Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOD MAY have had a hand in its creation, but Ecclesiastical Insurance Group
finds that most of its current concerns are rooted firmly here on earth.
It is scarcely ruffled by the Pounds 2m it estimates will be paid out as a
result of the IRA bomb 12 days ago which damaged six churches in the City of
London. It is confident that its diverse portfolio should absorb any
short-term impact on premiums.
A statement issued shortly after the bomb blast was more preoccupied with
the damage to church heritage and 'irreplaceable' stained glass than with
the claims it would be required to meet.
'Mercifully,' it said, 'the organist at St Helen's, Bishopsgate, who was
playing the organ at the time of the explosion and was showered with glass
was uninjured although he was severely shocked.'
The aura of the Church of England still hovers over the company, which was
founded in 1887 by senior members of the Anglican hierarchy and still
insures 95 per cent of its churches. However, divine inspiration has not
left the company safe from the problems facing its secular competitors. It
declared losses of Pounds 2.16m for the six months to last June, and of
Pounds 640,000 for the last full year - much of it the result of the 1990
storms and other natural catastrophes.
Ecclesiastical paid out more than Pounds 3m to York Minster after fire
damage caused by lightning in 1984 - unleashed, some people suggested, by
the enthronement two days' earlier of the controversial Bishop of Durham. It
is also contributing to the costs caused by the crane that collapsed on to
the roof of St James Garlickhythe in London last year.
Mr John McArdell, who joined the company straight from school in 1948 and is
now deputy managing director, lists a number of 'standard perils' triggering
its policies, with wind damage, frozen pipes and lightning strikes high
among them.
Acts of God are all covered by Ecclesiastical's policies. But those
motivated by Mammon are rather more of a drain on its resources. Vandalism
and arson are both on the increase, while one in three churches are now
affected each year by theft of items such as lead roofing, offeratory boxes
and pews.
The company employs 75 surveyors and valuers around the country, well-versed
in their appreciation of historic buildings, who quantify premiums and
assess payments when claims are made.
The Ecclesiastical Buildings Fire Office, as it was originally known,
remains true to its Victorian roots and objectives: to conserve for the
Church profits from insuring its property. On top of its original motto  -
'For the church' - its modern slogan is 'Insurance you can believe in.'
The board is still dominated by Anglican clergy, and its various
subsidiaries are all ultimately owned by Allchurches Trust. The trust is
able to recover the tax paid on the dividends and distribute the money to
church causes.
The religious backdrop has not blurred a good eye for business, however.
Dividends to the trust have grown sharply, totalling Pounds 16m since it was
created, Pounds 6m of which was generated in the last five years.
Ecclesiastical's investment portfolio mirrors that of other insurance
companies. It has boosted premium income with new products, such as contents
cover for vicarages and motor insurance for the clergy. In 1988, it launched
the Amity Fund, an ethical unit trust investing in companies which
contribute to 'the quality of family and community life'.
The company is not exempt from unholy competition, however. Alongside the
larger general insurers, Methodist Insurance, Congregational &amp; General and
United Reform Church Insurance all vie to cover the buildings of their own
denominations.
'The stock of churches is not expanding and the Church is under a lot of
financial constraints,' says Mr McArdell. 'We try to run church insurance
near to break-even. The market is very competitive.'
As a result, the company launched a programme of diversification in the
1970s and now has 10 offices in the UK and three in Canada.
It has also moved into more general types of insurance, using its expertise
in historic buildings to capture the business of more than 50 per cent of
all independent and public schools, as well as a growing number of nursing
homes and charities.
But the ethical philosophy remains, reflected in initiatives such as
subsidies to keep premiums charged to vicars in inner cities to levels in
lower risk areas.
'We are wholly independent of the Church of England,' says Mr McArdell, 'but
would hope everything we did would be approved of by it.'

FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Capital reorganisation for Dwyer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dwyer, the Dublin-based property company, is proposing a capital
reorganisation aimed at cutting gearing and allowing it to end the payment
of preference dividends.
It plans to replace its convertible preference shares with ordinary shares
on a 1-for-1 basis. The 12.8m shares resulting will represent a little less
than 50 per cent of the enlarged capital.
The company said that with the conversion price of 256p, against yesterday's
closing price of 34p, down 5p on the day, and following a fall of 9p on
Thursday, it was unlikely holders would exercise their rights making the
preference shares similar to debt.
Treating them as such resulted in gearing of about 400 per cent, which the
reorganisation would cut to 175 per cent. On the same basis net asset value
per share would fall from 120p to 110p.
The proposals will be put to an extraordinary meeting on May 14.

<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the accountancy firm, yesterday strongly rejected charges
in a writ issued against it for its role as adviser to the Pounds 629m
management buy-out of Magnet, the kitchen retailer, in 1989.
Mr Roy Chapman, managing partner, said: 'The claim borders on fantasy. This
is yet another case of those having lost money in a high-risk venture
turning to accountants for restitution.'
The comments follow confirmation from Bankers' Trust, the lead financiers to
the Magnet deal, that it had launched legal action against the firm at the
start of April on behalf of the creditors and shareholders of Airedale
Holdings, the name by which Magnet is now known.
The troubled MBO, one of the largest which had taken place in the UK at that
time, was delayed by resistance from shareholders and then ran into
difficulty with the banks, who found themselves unable to syndicate their
exposure to financing the deal.
The Bankers Trust action is for an unspecified amount.

FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Worcester shareholders at odds with
Takeover Panel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY INVESTORS in Worcester Group, the manufacturer of central heating
boilers, are considering a complaint to the Takeover Panel about the terms
of an agreed bid for the company which they claim gives management a better
deal than they will receive.
Shareholders say they will argue that the first general principle of the
Takeover Code states that 'all shareholders of the same class of an offeree
company must be treated similarly by the offeror'.
They also feel that management could have obtained a better price from
another bidder.
The dispute raises questions about directors' obligations to shareholders
even when industrial logic renders an offer in the best long-term interests
of a company and its employees.
Shareholders receiving cash for their shares have no interest in a company's
long-term prospects following a takeover.
Worcester had been in talks with Robert Bosch, the German automotive
components, telecommunications and appliances group, for more than a year.
It had terminated preliminary conversations with other potential buyers who
could not have offered the same long-term growth prospects or security to
employees.
Worcester's management and their families control 38.4 per cent of the
company's shares. They have accepted the Bosch offer, which will give
shareholders 225p per share in cash.
Also, institutional shareholders representing 13 per cent of Worcester's
shares have given commitments to tender their shares at the agreed price.
In exchange for their shares, management will receive shares in the new
subsidiary of Bosch. Its stake will then be bought out in 1996 at a price
dependent on the performance of Worcester of up to 393 1/2 p, and not less
than 100p.
The Panel said it had looked at the offer carefully before it was announced
and it was satisfied that the offer to management was not worth more than
the cash offer.
It said it was unusual, but constitutionally possible, for shareholders to
appeal against a decision by the executive of the Panel.
However, the Panel repeated that it was satisfied by the arguments put to it
by Bosch and Worcester that shareholders were not being unfairly treated in
the offer.
However, shareholders argue that the Panel has only con-sidered arguments
from the two parties interested in consummating the deal and that their
views should also be heard.
Under rule 16 of the Takeover Code the management of a company could keep a
stake in a business when it was taken over so long as there were risks as
well as rewards attached to the retained holding.
JO Hambro Magan, which is acting for Bosch in the bid, said that more than
50 per cent of shareholders regarded the price as fair and had accepted.
Corporate financiers said that it was difficult for minority shareholders to
exert much power once a bidder had more than 50 per cent. 'It takes a brave
institution to accept the position of a minority holder, especially in a
subsidiary of a private German company,' said one.
Merchant bankers said that other possible buyers of Worcester had been put
off because they regarded the Bosch bid as a fait accompli.

FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: EIS moves ahead to Pounds 14.4m and expects
further advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIS GROUP has extended its record of continuous profit and dividend growth
to 21 years and predicted another improvement in 1992.
The specialist engineer reported pre-tax profits ahead by 7 per cent to
Pounds 14.4m in 1991. This was in line with expectations and with the
interim results when profits rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 7.06m.
Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said conditions remained tough. 'But
we're budgeting for an improvement this year and we're happy to say we
achieved our budget in the first quarter,' he said.
Turnover increased to Pounds 190m (Pounds 178m) of which 52 per cent (48 per
cent) was generated overseas. Interest receivable grew to Pounds 1.74m
(Pounds 1.21m) as net cash at the year end increased to Pounds 13m, thanks
to last year's Pounds 18m rights issue.
Flexibox, the seals and transmission couplings subsidiary, lifted pre-tax
profits to Pounds 4.67m (Pounds 4.19m).
Pre-tax profits of the aircraft engineering division fell to Pounds 2.92m
(Pounds 3.09m). Mr Haslehurst said that was entirely caused by a cost
overrun on an unnamed, sizeable project.
Process equipment, which includes a range of vacuum pumps, suffered from
price competition but increased pre-tax profits 11 per cent to Pounds 4.41m
due to reduced costs.
Capital expenditure fell to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.7m). However, this
reflected price reductions rather than lower investment levels, Mr
Haslehurst said.
Staff numbers were reduced by 350 to 3,850, leading to restructuring costs
of about Pounds 750,000.
Earnings per share fell to 28.526p (28.769p adjusted for the rights). A
recommended final dividend of 8.525p makes a total of 11.7p (11.4p).
COMMENT
The market forgave EIS' unfortunate cost overrun in its aircraft division,
concentrating instead on the company's well-regarded management and ability
to cope with costs. The shares gained 8p against the trend to 394p, helped
by optimistic noises about the outlook and by news that capacity has been
increased at Davall Moulded Gear, the precision gear system maker. But while
EIS has proved it can handle recession, most of its businesses will be late
beneficiaries of the upturn. Davall should come out early, in line with
business machines, but aircraft engineering and the process equipment's
vacuum range are still some way off. On that assessment, forecast profits
this year of Pounds 15m put the shares on just over 14 times earnings and
suggest they are well valued. The rating is slightly ahead of its sector,
but the premium is underwritten by EIS's 21-year record.

<TEXT>
ARAN ENERGY Exploration, the UK subsidiary of Aran Energy, the Dublin-based
oil company, is paying Dollars 26.4m (Pounds 14.9m) for a one-third interest
in North Sea Block 211/24a from the UK arm of Chevron.
The acquisition includes Chevron's 14.38 per cent stake in the Dunlin
oilfield and its associated share of the Brent pipeline system.
Aran said the consideration may be reduced 'to take account of the
resolution of outstanding commercial issues which may result in additional
economic benefits' to the company, but that in any event the final price
would be not less than Dollars 19m.
Mr Michael Whelan, Aran's chief executive, said he could not detail what
those benefits would be. However, the full price of Dollars 26.4m will be
paid only if those benefits accrue to Aran.
The acquisition gives Aran access to 11m barrels of oil in the Dunlin field
from remaining proven recoverable reserves of 52.4m barrels at July 1 1992.
Production from the field in the second half of 1992 is expected to be
22,500 barrels of oil per day, of which Aran will have 4,740 bpd.
The field is operated by Shell UK and the platform facilities are also used
by the nearby Osprey field on a tariff basis.
The transaction is conditional on the waiving of pre-emption rights by the
other participants in the block within 60 days and on regulatory clearance
in the UK.
Aran does not expect the transaction to be completed before June 26.

FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon plans changes to board pay
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MB-CARADON, the building products, security printing and packaging group, is
to ask shareholders for authority to double the amount it can pay
non-executive directors.
A resolution will be put to them at the annual meeting on May 14.
At present the group is allowed to spend up to Pounds 100,000 a year on
employing non-executive directors. It currently has five, including the
chairman, and is close to the Pounds 100,000 limit which the group said was
a restraint. It wants to move to a limit of Pounds 200,000 though it does
not expect to reach that for some years.
Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, received Pounds 50,096 in 1991 - up from Pounds
36,255 in 1990, according to the group's accounts which were published
yesterday. Three other non-executives appeared to have been paid between
Pounds 15,001 and Pounds 20,000. A new non-executive director has been
appointed to replace one who will retire at the annual meeting.
Executive directors of the group suffered a pay cut in 1991 because part of
their remuneration was bonus related to growth in earnings per share.
Earnings for the year were unchanged at 15p on a fully diluted basis. The
highest paid director who is not named but is understood not to be either Mr
Peter Jansen, group chief executive, or Mr Daniel Cohen, group finance
director, received Pounds 223,000. In 1990 Mr Jansen was the highest paid
with Pounds 256,000.
The group is to also ask shareholders to approve a plan to cancel the Pounds
161.6m share premium account and transfer it to a capital reserve against
which goodwill arising on acquisitions can be written off.
There is Pounds 88.8m of goodwill shown in the balance sheet as a negative
reserve which would be written off if the plan goes through. The change
would not affect the group's net assets.

<TEXT>
VICKERS expects its troubled Rolls-Royce Motors Cars subsidiary to suffer a
trading loss of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m this year compared with a
trading loss of more than Pounds 30m in 1991 in the face of continuing weak
demand particularly in the UK and Japan.
In spite of speculation about the possible sale of the prestige car
operations to a foreign carmaker, the company said yesterday no deal would
be disclosed at the Vickers shareholders' meeting tomorrow.
Exploratory talks have been held with several groups, but BMW, the German
executive and luxury carmaker, has remained front-runner for possible
co-operation.
However, BMW yesterday repeated denials of a pending deal.
The Rolls-Royce and Bentley business last year dragged the whole of Vickers
group into loss and forced it to cut its dividend.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars lost half its market last year in the face of
recession in its main markets, the US and the UK. Sales worldwide fell 48.3
per cent to 1,723 - the lowest since 1968 - from the record 3,333 achieved
in 1990. Sales in the UK halved to 513 from 1,007, while sales in the US
plunged 65.2 per cent to only 400 from 1,149 in 1990.
Conditions remained tough in the first quarter this year: in the UK sales
fell to only 109 cars from 209 a year ago; in the US sales rose 20 per cent
in the first quarter, but from a depressed level a year ago.

FT  22 APR 92 / NatWest expects operationsin US to return to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank's US operations are on course to make after-tax
profits of more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 57m) this year, having made
cumulative losses of Dollars 860m since 1989.
This was confirmed by Mr John Tugwell, chairman of the US subsidiary,
NatWest Bancorp, who said yesterday he expected 'Dollars 100m to Dollars
120m profit for the year'.
The bank has suffered since 1989 from exposure to the depressed New Jersey
property market. But Mr Tugwell said reserves to cover future loan losses
were now more than adequate.
He added that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates
US banks, had agreed that NatWest Bancorp had a 'surplus of tens of millions
of dollars' in its loan-loss reserve above the amount needed as cover
against losses.
NatWest's gross income in the US is more than Dollars 1bn, compared with
expenses of Dollars 650m. It would therefore make a pre-tax profit of
Dollars 350m in the unlikely event there were no loan losses.
However, Mr Tugwell said even a profit of Dollars 350m would not represent
an acceptable return on the capital NatWest had invested. 'We have to get to
Dollars 400m in the long term,' he said.
But he hinted that NatWest was not keen to dispose of its US business in the
near future. He said the US operation would not have to pay tax on the next
Dollars 1bn of profit because it was able to carry forward for tax purposes
the losses it had been making.
But any bank which bought the US business would not have the benefit of
these tax losses, under US tax rules. So he said it made sense to 'keep (the
business) until it has made Dollars 1bn of profits'.
Nevertheless, senior New York bankers say both Chase Manhattan Bank and
Chemical Bank, two of the biggest US banks, are interested in acquiring
NatWest's network of 270 branches.
Mr Tugwell said he was interested in buying bank branches to add to the
existing network of 270. 'We need a greater concentration of branches,' he
said. He would also like to acquire credit card businesses.
He became chairman of NatWest Bancorp last year and, since then, has changed
the bank's system of assessing credit risk, made 'dozens' of senior staff
changes and retrained staff.

FT  22 APR 92 / Lloyds Bank eyes Midland's riches: The Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank attempt to buy a UK clearer may be thwarted by the Black Horse - The
bid for Midland may become a two-horse race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank will this week decide whether to make its biggest gamble since
it tried and failed to acquire Standard Chartered, the international bank,
in 1986.
On Friday, Lloyds' board is expected to discuss whether the clearing bank
should challenge Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's attempt to buy Midland by
making its own takeover offer.
Banking sources say that opinions within the board on whether to enter the
battle are evenly split.
If Lloyds were to intervene, it would merely state an intention to bid
rather than put a price on Midland. Any detailed offer would have to get
past the competition authorities in the European Community and the UK.
According to his colleagues and advisers, Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief
executive, will be disappointed if Lloyds holds back. He has been planning
such a takeover attempt for more than a year and has been working on it,
with the help of the merchant bank, Barings, since last December.
Senior bankers at Lloyds say Mr Pitman has no doubts about the huge
incremental profits it can make by combining its UK operation with
Midland's. Most of that profits growth would come from cutting overheads,
especially staff costs.
At the end of December, Midland had 57,640 employees, of which 51,000 were
based in the UK, while Lloyds' staff, excluding those employed by its life
insurance subsidiary, Lloyds Abbey Life, numbered 57,877 and most were UK
based.
Another big running cost in any bank is incurred in maintaining a network of
high street branches. Midland has 1,830 branches, whereas Lloyds has 2,000.
Lloyds would plan to combine the branch networks and close adjacent outlets.
Over a three-year period it would expect to close more than 1,000 branches
and reduce staff numbers by more than 20,000. There would also be large
savings from merging the two banks' head offices and sacking a group of
senior managers.
Lloyds estimates this would lead to cost savings of more than Pounds 500m,
and perhaps close to Pounds 1bn. Those savings should be compared with the
two banks' combined profits for 1991 of just under Pounds 700m before tax.
That target for cost savings is not particularly ambitious. In the US,
Chemical Bank estimates that its recent merger with Manufacturers Hanover
will lead to cost savings of Dollars 750m (Pounds 428m), even though the two
banks had much smaller branch networks than either Lloyds or Midland.
No one on the Lloyds' board doubts the financial merits of making a takeover
bid. Lloyds would have to offer much more than the Pounds 3.1bn at which the
Hongkong Bank bid values Midland.
But Lloyds can afford to offer more. Hongkong Bank would not be able to reap
cost savings at Midland equivalent to those available to Lloyds, as Hongkong
Bank does not have a UK branch network.
Lloyds has been assessing the attitude of its shareholders and those of
Midland to a bid and it has little doubt that they would like it to enter
the fray. Some of the big investors in the two banks confirm this view.
However, a contest for control of Midland between Lloyds and Hongkong Bank
would not be decided by the stock market alone.
The UK and European Community competition authorities would wish to examine
in detail whether the combination of two big UK banks would operate against
the public interest.
At the Department of Trade and Industry, Lloyds has sounded out Sir Peter
Gregson, the permanent secretary. It has also had discussions with Sir
Gordon Borrie, the soon-to-retire director-general of the Office of Fair
Trading.
Lloyds is concerned that the two banks' combined share of the small business
loans market would be big enough to persuade the DTI that any proposed deal
would be subject to detailed and lengthy scrutiny by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Because of the vital role which would be played by the small business sector
in any economic recovery, the government would be concerned that a deal
between Lloyds and Midland might reduce the supply of new finance to this
sector.
Lloyds' worst fear is that a bid from it would be referred to the MMC,
though one by Hongkong Bank would not. If that happened, Midland's
shareholders might opt to back the Hongkong Bank bid, for fear that an offer
from Lloyds would be blocked.
Bankers at Lloyds also admit it would be difficult to persuade the MMC that
there would be adequate competition in the small business market if it were
dominated by just three big banks - Barclays, National Westminster and the
combined Lloyds/Midland.
If Lloyds does bid, it will lobby the Brussels authorities and the DTI to
inquire into Hongkong Bank's bid for other reasons, such as the need to
assess competition within the UK banking market in general or the threat to
Midland's depositors were there to be economic upheaval in Hong Kong after
China regains control of the colony in 1997. Lloyds' case would be helped if
it had the support of the Bank of England, but the Bank is expected to
remain neutral in the struggle.
Members of Lloyds' board are therefore divided about whether they should
enter the fray given the risk that any bid would be blocked by the
authorities. Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, is believed to be more
concerned about the risks of failure than Mr Pitman. However, Sir Robin
Ibbs, Sir Jeremy's heir apparent, is said to be broadly in favour of making
an offer.
Some Lloyds' bankers see little shame in trying and failing. After all, it
is an open secret in the City that Lloyds held detailed talks with Midland
about making an offer in March.
Indeed, there would be a significant cost in not trying at all. In an
interview earlier this year, Mr Pitman said he expected banks' income growth
in the 1990s to be sluggish and therefore profits growth would have to be
generated by cost cutting.
Lloyds has cut its overheads further than its rivals. To keep up its
superior profits record it needs to make an acquisition.
It has evaluated making bids for TSB Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and
Standard Chartered. But it is convinced that the spoils available from
buying one of these would be trivial compared with Midland's riches.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest KPMG survey of UK companies going into receivership paints a
tantalising picture of the economy. The 31 per cent rise in receiverships in
the first quarter was in sharp contrast to a year-long plateau. Though the
approach of the election complicated the picture, the increased
preponderance of retailers and service companies among the failures is
consistent with the idea of businesses having been hanging on for a
Christmas recovery that failed to materialise.
The difficulty lies in interpreting the evidence further. The survey tells
us nothing about the size of company going under, so it is hard to measure
the impact on the economy or the banking sector. It will be another quarter
or two before any change in the trend is apparent, if only because for every
company going down there may be two which the banks are quietly keeping
afloat for the moment. In part, the banks are keen to avoid bad debts on top
of their already hefty provisions. Equally, they may have written the debt
off already and be holding on until the market for bankrupt assets improves.
In either case, history suggests a further round of companies will go bust
for lack of working capital when recovery gets decisively under way.
It is perhaps the more curious that the Hoare Govett small companies index
lost a mere eight constituents to receivership in the first quarter, but
lost 13 to takeover, some admittedly at fire-sale prices. The failure rate
is running one-third below last year's level when logic suggests it should
be rather higher. Whether this is a sign of recovery is anyone's guess. But
it may fill one gap in the KPMG survey - the majority of companies going
under are presumably too small to have gone public at all.

FT  22 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to find any immediate justification for Mrs Thatcher's alarm over
the state of government finances. True, the PSBR will double to Pounds 28bn
this year, but the gilts market barely flinched at yesterday's Pounds 2.5bn
auction announcement. With that money secured, the Bank of England already
has some Pounds 8bn in the bag. So strong, it seems, is the demand for gilts
since the election that the PSBR appears disappointingly small.
Since a large part of the demand for UK government paper comes from abroad,
that also implies little immediate grounds for alarm about the current
account deficit. The Bank's decision to make the auction issue free of tax
to non-residents suggests it perceives overseas demand even for the
longest-dated gilts. If non-residents buy only half the Pounds 30bn in gilts
expected to come on offer this year, they would produce a capital inflow
sufficient to cover the government's estimated current account deficit more
than twice. Indeed, far from being a threat to recovery, the rising trade
deficit could be dismissed as a natural corollary to the capital inflow.
It is only because such a situation is not sustainable in the long term that
Mrs Thatcher's strictures make sense. In the early 1980s the US happily
managed to run large deficits on its government and current account thanks
to inflows of foreign money into the Treasury bond market. The difference
between that situation and the UK today is that, when foreign investors
became sated, the US was at least able to tackle its trade deficit by
devaluation. That route would not be open to the UK as a member of the ERM.
Though the UK's semi-fixed exchange rate encourages capital inflows, it also
means the burden of any eventual adjustment will fall more heavily on
government spending: all the more so since a high exchange rate will prevent
growth snapping back with any vigour, limiting the cyclical effect of
recovery on the PSBR.
There are also more immediate reasons why the Bank of England should not get
carried away by its funding success since the election. Gross gilt sales
will still need to run at a rate of some Pounds 2bn a month for the rest of
1992-93 if the requirement is to be met. Also, Pounds 1.75bn of the auction
proceeds will only flow into its coffers in May and June. The partly-paid
structure may offer leverage to investors hoping for a further fall in
nominal yields, but later issues will hit a market cluttered by sizeable
calls on investor cash.

Yesterday's further downward lurch in UK drug stocks confirms that the
sector's extraordinary three-year bull market has come to an end. This
partly results from a fresh bout of nerves about drug pricing. But more
important is another familiar theme: the shift from defensive stocks into
cyclicals.
This might be thought a bullish sign for the UK market as a whole. Sadly, it
is not that simple. The driving force for the UK drug sector is the US
investment community, which owns a quarter of Glaxo and a third of
SmithKline Beecham. Those volatile and uncommitted holders drove UK drug
stocks up last year when they decided domestic stocks like Merck were high
enough. That they are now turning away from the sector, just as they did
when the US bull market kicked off 10 years ago, may be good news for Wall
Street. The implications for the UK market are purely secondary.
It is also evidence of US influence that drug pricing should have re-emerged
as a source of worry at all. For several years, drug prices in most of the
world have been flat even in nominal terms. In Japan they have actually
fallen. Only in the US, the world's largest and most lucrative drug market -
from which Glaxo, for instance, derives a third of its profits - have prices
held up. Recent menacing noises from the US government about healthcare
costs have upset US investors accordingly. They should have come as little
surprise to anyone else.
In share price terms, the results of all this have been fairly dramatic. The
S&amp;P drugs sector peaked relative to the US market on January 13 this year.
SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo peaked relative to the FT-SE on the same day,
and have since underperformed by 17 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.
The exception is Wellcome, which has underperformed by only 7 per cent. But
Wellcome is unusual in that only some 2 per cent of its shares are held in
the US. The success of its forthcoming share sale will largely depend on how
far that can be changed. The climate scarcely looks propitious.

The conflict in Bosnia illustrates the need for the international protection
of minority groups
If you live in a part of the world that is still relatively comfortable and
secure, how do you react to the troubles of less fortunate people whose
homes and lives are being wrecked by conflict?
One way is to try to understand, to sort out the rights and wrongs, to
become emotionally involved. Sooner or later, this almost inevitably leads
you to take sides. Another way is to take refuge in a general condemnation
of violence, blaming the conflict on the economic backwardness or primitive
political culture of the people concerned.
In the former case, one will easily become the dupe of the self-deceptive
and self-righteous arguments of one side, since conflicts where one side is
wholly in the right and the other wholly in the wrong are rare. In the
second case, one can slip into self-righteousness oneself, looking
patronisingly on innocent and guilty alike, and failing to take seriously
the fears and grievances of people who, in most cases, do not embark on
violence for fun but in the sincere belief that only by doing so can they
protect themselves and their 'community' from extinction.
In reacting to events in Yugoslavia, the outside world has oscillated,
perhaps fatally, between the approaches described above. Broadly, the latter
approach prevailed until last December. The US treated the issue as a
regional one best left to regional institutions, notably the EC. The EC
presented itself as an impartial mediator and would-be peacekeeper. But the
fighting in Croatia went on, with the Serbs and the federal army appearing
more and more obviously the aggressors. Public opinion was increasingly
inclined to the 'goodies-and-baddies' approach, and in December this carried
the day. The EC took sides, to the extent of recognising Croatia and
Slovenia and maintaining sanctions only against Serbia and Montenegro. The
US, at the time, made clear its disagreement with this approach. Now,
however, it recognises not only Croatia and Slovenia (three months behind
the EC) but also Bosnia-Hercegovina (simultaneously with the EC) and is
putting the blame very loudly and publicly on Serbia for the continued
fighting.
If I were a member of any of the three communities in Bosnia, I should find
this procedure profoundly irritating. The best argument for not taking sides
in Croatia was that the secession of Croatia from Yugoslavia was bound to be
followed by the attempted secession of Bosnia and the extension of the
conflict to that republic. The Moslem and Croat communities in Bosnia,
forming a comfortable majority between them, were never going to agree to
remain in a rump Yugoslavia which would be in effect nothing more than a
greater Serbia. The Serbs in Bosnia - a much larger minority than the Serbs
in Croatia - were not going to let themselves be carried out of Yugoslavia,
and thus separated from Serbia, by a decision of the other two communities.
Thus it was fatuous for the EC to make its decision on recognising Bosnia's
independence contingent on the result of a referendum, since the result was
predetermined by the size of the three communities.
The traditional grounds for recognising a state would be that it exercises
effective control over a given territory. By that criterion, Bosnia would
surely have failed, given the presence on its territory of a large number of
units of the federal Yugoslav armed forces, which so far have not recognised
its authority. There was, no doubt, a case for using recognition as a lever
to help produce a non-violent settlement between the communities. But if
that was the goal, the requirement should have been that the request for
recognition come from a government representing all three communities, not
that the numerical superiority of two of them over the third be demonstrated
by a vote.
It is that notion of 'community' which lies at the root of so many
conflicts. If one member of a community kills another, that is deplorable
but we expect the community to deal with the matter according to its own
procedures. But if we feel that the killer and the victim belong to
different communities, then all of us in the victim's community see
ourselves as threatened: we require protection against, or reassurance from,
the killer's community.
Nations and states are particular forms that a community can take. States
are institutions, capable of defining law and imposing it on their citizens;
capable also - or claiming to be capable - of defending those citizens
against attack by non-citizens. 'Nation' is a word which, in the modern
world, makes a community sound respectable and permanent. A nation, in most
people's minds, is entitled to be represented by its own state. To side with
your own 'tribe' against another tribe sounds primitive. To rally to the
defence of your 'nation' is normal, even honourable.
Nations began as a way of identifying citizens with a state. But once the
nation is postulated as a pre-existing entity, from which a state can be
derived, there is no obvious place for the process to stop. Why should not
Serbs be able to secede from Bosnia, just as Slovenes, Croats or Moslems
have the right to secede from Yugoslavia?
It would not matter so much, if the process were not almost inevitably
accompanied by violence. The essence of a state is that it monopolises the
use of force on its own territory, and that is a monopoly which each
self-defined 'community' is naturally reluctant to concede to another. In
the end, the only solution seems to be for communities to regroup, each on
'its own' territory, separated from others by state frontiers. But that
involves the wholesale uprooting and transplanting of populations: something
seldom if ever accomplished without large-scale bloodshed.
There must be a better way. 'Communities' should be able to feel safe even
when outnumbered by other communities within the state of which they are
citizens. States should be able to recognise self-defined 'communities' on
their territory without feeling that they have opened the door to secession
and disintegration.
An internationally accepted regime of minority rights and obligations is
indispensable if much more chaos and bloodshed in eastern Europe is to be
avoided. The Dutch proposal for a High Commissioner for Minorities, tabled
at the current Helsinki Follow-Up Meeting of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) deserves serious and urgent consideration. If
it is true that Britain is blocking it for fear that such a High
Commissioner might interest himself in Northern Ireland, that is surely a
mistake. The need for the minority to be assured of its rights, and for the
majority to be reassured that those rights do not threaten it, is as acute
in Northern Ireland as in many parts of eastern Europe.

FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: Engineers' status not real problem
</HEADLINE>

   From Dr JAMES MURPHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Ledger is, of course, correct - 'without engineers, no amount of
help from Mr Heseltine will save our industry' (Letters, April 18). However,
the low status of engineers is not, as Mr Ledger protests, a 'key factor
behind UK industry's problems'. The UK might not treat its engineers with
the same respect as other countries; even so, it still enjoys, according to
the Central Statistical Office, a favourable ratio of highly qualified
engineers to workers, when compared with Japan, US, west Germany and France.
Indeed, after Japan, the UK has, says the CSO, 'the highest proportion of
engineering qualifications in comparison with the employed workforce'.
Given that such an advantage has, ominously, done little to halt the slide
in the engineering industry - so well outlined by Andrew Baxter ('Machines
in need of maintenance', April 14)) - the key problem facing British
industry is not a shortage of happy engineers but a shortage of a
manufacturing base that will create such a shortage.

FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The monopoly factor must decide any bid for Midland
Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ANDREW D BAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Institutional shareholders in Midland Bank are surely deluding
themselves if they expect a successful bid from Lloyds to win them a higher
price.
Of course Midland would be worth more to Lloyds than to Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank. Competition between UK banks would be reduced, particularly
in the key market for small and medium sized firms, in payments services and
in bank credit cards. So the clearing banks could increase their margins, at
their customers' expense.
The reduction in competition in these markets would clearly be against the
public interest. With a Lloyds bid a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
reference is certain; the MMC would be failing in its duty if it did not
recommend against the takeover - particularly when a takeover by Hongkong
Bank would strengthen Midland and increase competition in the UK market -
and the government would be failing in its if it did not accept the MMC's
recommendation.
A counter-bid from a European bank? Now that would be another matter.

FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: Regard for finite resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOMINIC DIBBLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the last few days, your newspaper has highlighted the extreme concern
of both businessmen and politicians regarding the potential failure of the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. At the same time, you have
also indicated that the up-coming Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro is not
receiving anything like the same concentration of effort and attention from
leaders in both these fields (for example, 'Negotiators try to settle
differences', April 16).
The fact that president Bush has yet to confirm his attendance at the
conference is one of the most visible signs of this lack of commitment. It
is perhaps unprecedented that two such crucial sets of negotiations should
be deadlocked simultaneously, and it strikes me that what is needed in both
situations to break the log-jam is some evidence of goodwill from all
parties.
Nonetheless, I think it is important to focus on the fact that the Uruguay
Round appears to be given priority by decision-makers. Does this imply that
the goods which people manufacture and trade fundamentally deserve more
attention than the finite source whence they came? This idea seems
disastrously short-sighted and unsustainable, and I would be interested to
know whether any of your readers feel that it can be adequately justified.
In this regard, another article ('Boom years predicted for Third World in
1990s', April 16) gives cause for concern, as it makes no mention of the
potential environmental impact of the predicted growth. A sustainable future
will only become possible when it is accepted that the environment lies at
the heart of the economic process, and not at its periphery.

FT  22 APR 92 / From catastrophe to mere crisis: Russia is embarking on a
new phase of economic reform which could reignite inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister in charge of economic
reform in Russia, the past week has been the end of his beginning. He and
his team of reformers have survived the popular disaffection over price
liberalisation. They have also survived a Congress of Peoples' Deputies in
which their policies were excoriated.
Now begins a new period: over the past few days, senior government ministers
have stressed that it will usher in significant modifications to the reform
process. The turn in policy is not being executed because of intolerable
popular pressure: the anti-government demonstrations have been poorly
attended, while the Congress, though showing an anti-reform majority, has
been manipulated into surly acquiescence.
Both the street protests and the Congress have been deeply inhibited by the
fact that they do not represent real voters. Their most active leaders are
former Communists who, although they can profit rhetorically from the
harshness of the government's measures, cannot reap real political rewards
because of the reluctance of the population to give them their trust. The
ruin the government inherited is the Communists' principal legacy. Their
rhetoric cannot hide this truth.
The policy change has been made more because of fears of the future, than
because of the pressures of the present. Mr Gaidar, the reform's architect,
made this clear when he said in an interview that 'we have had three years
of strong negative growth from 1988 to 1991. We paid for the absence of
reforms: now we must pay for reforms. We cannot stand three more years of
that: one year only (1992) is possible. The long-term structural agony of
this economy will create a very unpleasant situation - we must get growth.'
As the government has repeated many times over the past week or two, the
'successes' of the first quarter of the year permit some relaxation. Mr
Gaidar insists, for example, that in the first three months of the year the
budget was balanced: the Ministry of Finance says there was a deficit of
about 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product on an actual expenditure
basis and 5 per cent on the basis of commitments, although international
financial institutions suspect it may be about 10 per cent.
Even so, fiscal policy has been a success, particularly when output in the
first quarter is estimated to have fallen by more than 13 per cent from the
level of the same quarter of 1991. The budget deficit of the Russian
Federation was, after all, about 20 per cent of GDP in 1991, allowing for
Russia's share of the revenue and expenditures of the former Soviet Union.
What is more, after serious teething difficulties, the Ministry of Finance
has achieved something that has eluded most post-Communist governments: the
establishment of a reliable source of revenue independent of profits in the
state enterprise sector. Revenue from value-added tax has risen from
Rbs10.5bn (Dollars 68m at market exchange rate) in January, to Rbs32bn in
February and then to Rbs54bn in March. To this will soon be added taxation
of both domestic consumption and exports of oil and gas as their prices are
raised towards world levels.
The new system of trade regulation, too, suffered from initial difficulties
in January, following the introduction of a new system of export taxation.
But postponement of the export taxes, introduction of a market exchange rate
for hard currency and curtailment of administrative regulations reversed the
declining trend in exports. In February they rose to Dollars 3.8bn, from
Dollars 2.2bn in the previous month, while in March they rose to Dollars
4.8bn. Meanwhile, rescheduling of payments of principal on medium- and
long-term loans due in 1992 has saved Russia Dollars 11bn of the Dollars
21bn that comes due this year. The foreign exchange position is moving from
the catastrophic to the merely critical.
Equally successful, if more brutal, was the price liberalisation at the
beginning of the year. As has happened elsewhere, notably in Poland, prices
climbed much more rapidly than the government forecast. Official estimates
are that prices rose three and a half times in January and by another
two-thirds from January to March. Unofficial estimates suggest that they
rose still more.
This surge in prices has lowered officially estimated real incomes by 40 per
cent, thus eliminating queues, the growing disequilibrium between nominal
wages and the nominal value of output, and the 'monetary overhang', or
unspendable store of roubles, which had been among the main issues in the
previous two years.
At the end of last year the stock of broad money (M2 on the Russian
definition) was about 60 per cent of GDP. By the end of March 1992 that
ratio had fallen to well below a quarter. Inevitably, money became very
short, particularly cash, the demand for which (at the present face value of
the notes) surpassed the capacity of the four printing plants (all located
in Russia): many workers have been told that there is no cash for their
wages.
Nor should one ignore the most visible, if least quantifiable, success: the
liberalisation of commerce. The pavements of Moscow have become the site of
one of the world's most densely thronged street bazaars. This may add little
to Russia's output; it may, indeed, be extremely inefficient; but it says
much about the entrepreneurship of a population for which such activity was
long a criminal, if not a capital, offence.
These 'successes' have had a high price. Output has fallen further from an
already deeply depressed level. It has become clear, above all, that
industry will not respond unaided and unprompted to the hidden hand of a
still wildly imperfect market.
Unsurprisingly, post-Soviet enterprise managers have pushed up their prices,
stockpiled the goods they cannot sell and sent good to other enterprises
without any likelihood of payment. Inter-enterprise indebtedness has risen
from Rbs39bn at the beginning of the year to Rbs900bn by mid-April. Mr
Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, who receives a steady stream of
such managers in his office in the former Gosplan state planning commission
building in the centre of Moscow, has noticed an encouraging shift in their
petitions: they no longer assume he can help them with supplies, but want
him to dole out cheap money. Instead, he claims, he tells them to cut their
prices, wages and staff.
However, he also now offers some help. He will soon authorise Rbs200bn in
extra investment credits from the Central Bank of Russia over the next six
months, of which Rbs120bn will go to industrial companies that, in his view,
can use it for sensible investment. This in turn, would produce marketable
goods. He has put aside Rbs42bn to assist defence conversion (not much,
given the scale of the problem) and another Rbs40bn for social protection of
displaced workers in the military sector.
Mr Nechayev hopes to pick a few winners, but also wants to force a few
losers to the wall. He expects that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
will soon sign a decree on bankruptcy. This will allow the government to
force 10 or 15 companies into liquidation: a small beginning, but an
important demonstration to others of the consequence of failure.
The right way for the government to proceed, as it has recognised in its
memorandum to the International Monetary Fund of last month, is via rapid
structural change. The list of requirements is long, the obstacles high and
the technical difficulties immense.
What is needed embraces: price liberalisation, including the raising of
energy prices to world levels, expected to be achieved by the end of 1993,
starting with a sixfold increase in prices of crude petroleum from Rbs350 to
Rbs2,000-2,500 a ton; auction of small-scale shops and enterprises (recently
started in just a few cities); private ownership of land; privatisation of
food production and distribution; demonopolisation of industry;
commercialisation of larger enterprises, leading to mass privatisation in
early 1993; liberalisation of international trade; and effective
convertibility of the rouble, including for interest, dividends and capital
inflows.
Yet Mr Gaidar also argues, probably rightly, that the Russian economy needs
to be 'remonetised'. Unfortunately, the monetary grease is to be provided by
the central bank, a point on which, it should be noted, the government and
the central bank do not now disagree.
Pointing to the shortage of money in the economy, which is one
characteristic of an economy teetering on the brink of hyperinflation, the
Central Bank of Russia is expecting an increase in the money supply of
between 50 and 120 per cent this year. Some of that will come from
monetisation of the budget deficit, expected to remain at about 5 per cent
of GDP. A credit line to the Ministry of Finance of Rbs67bn has just been
established. More will come from the Rbs200bn promised to enterprises, while
another Rbs70-80bn will come from schemes of Mr Gyorgy Matiukhin, the
chairman of the central bank. Applying the multiplier of 2-2.5 on central
bank credit deemed normal in Russia, the resulting credit expansion is
already Rbs700-850bn, or about 50 per cent of recent levels.
No wonder that Mr Gaidar still talks of inflation running at an annual rate
of 40 per cent at the end of the year, while Mr Matiukhin, probably more
realistically, talks of 100 per cent. No wonder, too, that a 'crawling peg',
or moving, exchange rate is seen as more realistic than a fixed one. The
question is whether 'remonetisation' will prove a euphemism for resurgent
inflation, especially when, even at its recently increased level of 50 per
cent, the interest rate on credit from the central bank is far below the
rate of inflation.
These plans are bound to be of serious concern to western donors, including
the International Monetary Fund, the staff of which is in discussion with
the government this week. The planned stabilisation fund of Dollars 6bn
would make little sense if the exchange rate were not to be fixed. The
rouble market exchange rate, currently 150 to the dollar, is hugely
undervalued. The exchange market is extremely thin. Nonetheless throwing
dollars at it, in order to raise its level to Rbs40-50, as the government
hopes, might prove ineffective if monetary expansion were not under secure
control.
The government of Russia deserves credit for what it has achieved. It
deserves credit too for the ambitions it has for the future. Much - if not
most - remains to be done, but the foundations are at last being laid.
Unfortunately, the government already seems to be tempted by the easiest of
all paths, the one to the printing press. If it is not careful, Russia will
become not a market-oriented great power, but another Brazil, caught in a
never-ending series of short-term inflationary cycles, each one reducing
still further the credibility of its government and its capacity to govern.
Mr Gaidar describes the need to print more money as 'terribly unpleasant'.
It is worse than that. Inflationary finance is fraud. However tempting and
however respectable, fraud is no basis on which to build the new democratic
Russia.

FT  22 APR 92 / Leading Article: A Lloyds bid for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Bank will decide later this week whether to attempt to buy Midland
Bank in the teeth of an agreed bid by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation. It should summon up its courage and press ahead.
To urge Lloyds to bid is to fly in the face of received wisdom, which argues
that the UK banking sector is already too concentrated, and that hostile
bids for banks are at best unseemly and at worst disastrous.
There is truth in both these arguments; but the case for a Lloyds bid is
strong enough to over-ride them. Lloyds is the best managed of the big UK
banks. The point of its bid would be to integrate two UK domestic branch
banking networks, aiming for huge cost savings - some Pounds 500m a year or
more. Since Lloyds is likely to offer its shares in exchange for those of
Midland, the gain would accrue to both sets of shareholders.
The scale of the potential gains is a strong argument for a bid: it
indicates the extent to which the historic pattern of banking in the UK has
left the country with too many branches and too much managerial and clerical
infrastructure to support them.
Throughout the 1980s, despite the potential savings from computer
technology, the big banks continued to allow their staffs to grow. In the
last couple of years, individual banks have at last started to make big cuts
in staffing and branch networks.
Full integration
However, only a full-scale integration of two banks is likely to bring about
the scale of cost-cuts the industry needs. By transforming its own cost
structure, a merged Lloyds/Midland would put enormous pressure on its big
rivals, National Westminster and Barclays, to make corresponding savings.
Customers would benefit along with shareholders.
There is another important lesson from the scale of the potential savings:
it illustrates a drawback of the existing bid, from the Hongkong Bank. In
that bid, potential cost savings are much smaller: the Hongkong Bank argues
instead that it could run Midland better than it has been run up to now,
helped by its stronger capital base.
Midland could certainly use more capital; but the Hongkong Bank's record of
managing large overseas businesses is not encouraging. Indeed, it is hard to
think of a single cross-border bank acquisition in a developed economy which
has proved a resounding success. Domestic mergers of overlapping banks,
though still risky, have a better record.
So much for the advantages of a Lloyds bid; what are the potential
drawbacks? The first is that, by taking on Midland's problems, Lloyds itself
might be fatally weakened. A year ago, with the scale of Midland's
difficulties still unclear, that uncertainty might have been enough to
render a Lloyds bid imprudent. Now, with the benefit of a new management's
unsentimental judgment of the Midland books, the risk looks far less, as the
timing of the Hongkong bid indicates.
Potential drawback
A second potential drawback is the harmful effect on competition of reducing
Britain's Big Four banks to a Big Three. In most of the UK's financial
services markets, however, there is abundant competition, which would not be
lessened by a merger. Retail banking for individual customers, wholesale
banking for large companies, investment banking for corporate finance
customers - in all these markets, a customer can pick and choose at will
between fiercely competitive suppliers.
This is not true, however, in one of the most politically sensitive areas of
banking: lending to small businesses. It lacks the new entrants - from
abroad, or from the building society sector - which have made the the rest
of British banking so competitive. Building a nationwide network of bank
managers experienced in assessing the credit-worthiness of small business is
an expensive business. This is why the new entrants have not rushed to do
so; it is also an argument against allowing the elimination of one such
network.
Balancing that issue against the gains to competition from transforming the
banking system's cost structure is a task for the competition authorities.
Fear of such an investigation should not deter Lloyds from going ahead.

FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: Charlemagne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sarah Miles' first play, Charlemagne, is a bold swipe at the issues
surrounding transvestitism and transexuality. Beneath the shouts and the
violence, she has written a fine, tense play about an unusual subject. If it
lags conceptually, it is never emotionally or visually dull; and it is
superbly acted.
Miles has created an intriguing triangle. Harry writes, Clara rides; they
live on a West Country farm, the Aga and the trust fund bubbling gently in
the background. They are trying for a child.
Before this becomes a New Yorker short story, Lillibet, friend and dolphin
therapist from Los Angeles, arrives to discover that Harry is a transvestite
who secretly dresses as Hattie. The plot follows Harry into Hattie through
hormone therapy then surgery, and Clara through a course of compromises
which allow her to keep loving him/her. Lillibet ends up happily pregnant
with a dolphin man from Greenpeace.
The 'wickedly naughty' atmosphere promised on the play's handbills takes the
form of other sexual undertones. These emanate from the eponymous
Charlemagne the stallion at stud 'pungent with sweat and supple leather',
from hinted lesbian affairs at college ('cuddling in the ha ha'), and from
world music fertility dances to set the hips gyrating.
Sex and sexuality, however, are not everything, even if they seem so for
Harry. He/she says, 'we're totally harmless, we just make others squirm.'
The issues of nature-nurture, sexual identity and role-playing are present
if not thoroughly worked out, so the play makes one feel voyeuristic and at
times prurient; and there are genuinely shocking scenes. Miles wisely
concentrates on the women's reaction as they watch Harry's 'imbalance' take
over his life.
Greg Hicks as Harry minces and convinces, playing this difficult role with
great tact; Lindy Alexander as Lillibet ('I see the disappointment in your
body language') is a fine LA psychobabbler.
Sarah Miles herself is the plucky Clara, all confusion and jodhpurs. Lisa
Forell directs meticulously, especially the confession and confrontation
scenes. As Meredith said in Modern Love, 'then each applied to each that
fatal knife, deep questioning, which probes to endless dole.'
The Old Fire Station, Oxford, until 25 April (0865-794494).

FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: A Little Night Music - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Plymouth's Stephen Sondheim is less appealing than Leicester's, the fact
is that A Little Night Music is in itself a less enticing proposition than
Merrily We Roll Along. It came some nine years earlier in the Sondheim
oeuvre, and the idea of setting Ingmar Bergman's romantic film-comedy Smiles
of a Summer Night to waltz-time got a brittle realisation, one that needs
all the stage help it can get.
Roger Redfarn's Plymouth production has its merits. There are pretty sets by
Martyn Bainbridge: a decayed proscenium arch, trellises, a large mock-rococo
fresco, shadowy trees outside Grandmamma's chateau (far too many bright
stars, though, for a midnight-sun night). Reduced to two pianos and a cello,
all commendably expert, the score sounds brittler than ever - pastiche
operetta, even G&amp;S, with ingenious rhymes over mildly queasy
waltz-harmonies. One misses the original string ensemble. The one surefire
number, 'Send in the Clowns', comes near the end; there is nothing so
memorably apt and infectious as 'Old Friends', midstream in Merrily We Roll
Along.
The real trouble, however, lies with the adaptation (by Hugh Wheeler and
Sondheim). In Bergman's comedy, quite naturalistic and slightly cruel, a
weary, unglamorous lawyer, with a still-virgin bride of 11 months, competed
with an icily formidable Count for the favours of a famous actress (the
irreplaceable Eva Dahlbeck). In the musical the Count is only a blustering
dunderhead and the equally icy Countess a lachrymose Wronged Wife; the
lawyer becomes a mature romantic hero - attractively played here by Gary
Raymond, sung at variable pitch.
Rula Lenska puts a credible face on the actress, and Richard Lyndon and
Deborah Grant do their best for the sadly declasse aristos, but the tense
class-divisions go for nothing, leaving the story lamed. Worse, for Broadway
the ultra-dignified Grandmamma - once a famous courtesan - was turned into a
raunchy old dame, a coarse Lady Bracknell. Though Hermione Gingold just
about got away with it, this gross cartoon lies well outside Eileen Page's
more delicate range.
Kate Arneil's lusty maid is fetching, and Dermot McLaughlin makes something
of his under-written role as the lawyer's greenstick son (piety sabotaged by
rampant adolescence). The child-bride is Lisa Hollander, who sings and
smiles charmingly, and delivers each new line as if it had nothing to do
with her last one.
Plymouth Theatre Royal. Runs until 2 May.

FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: Lucerne Easter Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there room for yet another event on Europe's crowded festival map? The
answer after the inaugural Lucerne Easter Festival must be a guarded 'yes'.
Long ago, Lucerne boasted a lively tradition of Passion plays at Easter,
dating back to the Middle Ages. Over the past 50 years it has developed one
of the most successful summer music festivals. The new festival aims to
build on these twin pillars. The danger was that it would turn out to be
nothing more than a miniature replica of the summer event - or worse, a copy
of Salzburg's Easter Festival, which has little to do with the people of
Salzburg and even less to do with Easter.
Lucerne has avoided that. After an initial tussle with the city's church and
musical establishment - which feared that its own Easter celebrations would
be overshadowed - the festival drew up a programme which struck a balance
between local and international forces, between spiritual and secular.
The first part, from Maundy Thursday to Easter Sunday, was devoted to sacred
music, shared among Lucerne's magnificent churches and in some cases
dovetailed into Easter worship (and therefore free). Philippe Herreweghe
conducted a period instrument performance of the St Matthew Passion, and
Andrew Parrott a Schutz programme. Local forces contributed Honegger's early
Easter Cantata, suggesting that Switzerland at least is not ignoring his
centenary.
This contrasted with the final three evenings of expensive concerts in the
Kunsthaus, where the London Symphony Orchestra under Mariss Jansons and
Michael Tilson Thomas explored the more earthly visions of Honegger's
Pacific 231, Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique and Mahler's First Symphony.
The centrepoint of the festival was an Easter Vigil in the Hofkirche, a
twin-spired Roman Catholic church with the architectural dimensions and
acoustical spaciousness of a Gothic-Romanesque cathedral. Guillaume de
Machaut's 14th century Messe de Nostre Dame formed the main structure of the
service, interspersed with extracts from Messiaen's Messe de la Pentecote
for organ and a selection of 12th century songs by Hildegard von Bingen (the
latter evoking the same mystical spirit as the birdsong in the Messiaen).
For those primarily interested in its devotional aspect, this was a mass of
unusually pure musical dimensions. The four voices of the Taverner Consort,
filling the darkened nave in the solemn opening Kyrie, showed their mastery
of Machaut's unpredictable rhythms and harmonic modulations. Emily van Evera
delivered Hildegard's unaccompanied songs with the same simple radiance as
the candles held by the congregation. The priest, Father Gerold Beck, was in
no way outclassed in his vocalisation of the Gregorian Lumen Christi, and of
course the crowded congregation were able to join in the sung responses.
For those who went for the music alone, the benefit of hearing it in this
atmospheric, incense-filled context was offset by the amount of liturgy on
offer - the service lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours - and Machaut's
Gloria was spoilt by the simultaneous clanging of church bells. A work
commissioned from the avant-garde Swiss composer Klaus Huber did not
materialise, and Krzysztof Penderecki's new Benedicamus Domino was so short
and self-effacing as to be indistinguishable from the Machaut.
And yet this was a genuine Easter celebration. The new festival director,
Matthias Bamert, will doubtless want to explore a much wider spectrum of
Easter activity in future, perhaps embracing scenic oratorio, church opera,
dance and even film. But a useful start has been made.
The production is sponsored by Swissair and American Express.

ITALIA EXPRESS (FT, January 14)
A vessel was sunk outside Piraeus harbour and the underwriters alleged that
there had been a plot to blow up the ship. They wished to prove the original
conspiracy by means of surreptitious tapes of conversations of those
involved, including the divers allegedly responsible. At first instance, it
was held that the tapes were not admissible in evidence under the Civil
Evidence Act 1968. Allowing the appeal against that decision in part, the
Court of Appeal stated that insofar as the tapes related to evidence of
facts stated by one of the alleged conspirators, GDV, who knew that the
conversations were being taped and who supplied the tapes, GDV was quite
deliberately making simultaneous statements both orally and in a document.
Subject to production and proof of the tapes or authenticated copies, the
statements of the other interlocutors would not be evidence of facts stated
but, in so far as they proved the context in which GDV's statements were
made, would be evidence of that context.
DEUTSCHE BANK AG v IBRAHIM AND OTHERS (FT, January 15)
The bank claimed in an action in December 1991 for a declaration that it had
valid equitable mortgages of two leases owned by the daughters of the
defendant as security for their father's overdraft. The claim was refused on
the ground that section 4 of the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied in that
there was no memorandum in writing by the daughters to support the loan.
Allowing an application to recall that judgment to hear further argument, Mr
David Neuberger QC stated that the bank had sent draft memoranda to the
daughters for signature. However, that was insufficient to satisfy section
4. The court had found that the memoranda were received by the daughters,
but were never acknowledged by them, nor executed by them in any way. It
would be quite wrong to infer approval on the daughters' part, whether of
the memoranda generally or of inclusion of their names. Moreover, the bank
could not bring the facts into the class of cases where section 4 could be
said to have been used as 'an engine of fraud'. The daughters' counterclaim
for the delivery of the title deeds for want of consideration succeeded.
IN RE LONDON UNITED INVESTMENTS PLC (FT, January 17)
In October/November 1990, the secretary of state, in exercise of his powers
under section 432(2) of the Companies Act 1985, appointed inspectors to
investigate the affairs of a company, LUI. Mr Wilson was a director of LUI
but had refused to answer the inspectors' questions, invoking the common law
privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, he contended that it was
improper for the secretary of state to appoint inspectors to investigate
matters which were the subject of allegations of fraud because it was more
appropriate that suspected crimes should be investigated by the Serious
Fraud Office or the police. Dismissing an appeal against a first instance
decision that the refusal to answer was unjustified, the Court of Appeal
stated that under the provisions of the 1985 Act, as amended by the
Companies Act 1989, (i) inspectors would in very many cases have been
appointed where the circumstances suggested fraud; (ii) persons questioned
were bound to answer their questions; and (iii) the inspectors' report might
lead the secretary of state to petition for winding-up or to proceed in the
company's name in the public interest.
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND v CASSA DI RISPARMIO DELLE PROVINCIE LOMBARD AND
OTHERS (FT, January 21)
The Royal Bank of Scotland claimed reimbursement on a letter of credit as
confirming bank, subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits 1983 Revision, where reimbursement was to take place in New York.
However, when the bill was still current, the issuing Italian banks had
received information to the effect that the documents might be false because
the underlying transaction was said to be fraudulent. Service of proceedings
on the issuing banks was set aside at first instance on the ground that the
English court had no jurisdiction to hear the claims under the Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, article 5 of which stated that, with
regard to contracting states, a person may be sued 'in the court of the
place of performance of the obligation in question'. Dismissing the Royal
Bank of Scotland's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that the 'obligation
in question' for the purposes of article 5 was the obligation to effect
reimbursement, and that was an obligation which was due for performance
outside the jurisdiction of the English court.
RE SHOE LACE LTD (FT, January 22)
An application was made by the liquidator of Shoe Lace Ltd for return of
company funds paid to another company, Sharp Investments Ltd, which held 80
per cent of Shoe Lace's issued share capital. Section 245 of the Insolvency
Act 1986 provided that a floating charge created within two years before the
onset of insolvency in favour of a person connected with the company was
invalid, except to the extent of consideration paid for creation of the
charge 'at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge'. The
floating charge was created within two months before the onset of insolvency
in the instant case where Sharp controlled Shoe Lace and so was a 'connected
person' within the section. No businessman, having knowledge of the kind of
time limits imposed by the Insolvency and Companies Acts and using ordinary
language, Mr Justice Hoffmann stated in granting the application, would say
that the payments had been made at the same time as execution of the
debenture in the present case.
MARC RICH &amp; CO AG v SOCIETA ITALIANA IMPIANTI (FT, January 24)
In a dispute over the sale of a cargo of oil by the defendant to the
plaintiff, the contract having been negotiated in Italy, the plaintiff
sought leave to appoint an arbitrator in London. The defendant issued
proceedings in Italy where it was held that there was no arbitration
agreement. Article 1(4) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention
1968 provided that the Convention did not apply to arbitration and the Court
of Appeal, on the plaintiff's appeal against a dismissal of its application
to restrain the defendant from pursuing the action in Genoa, referred to the
European Court questions on whether the exception under article 1(4)
extended to litigation as to the initial existence of an arbitration
agreement. The ECJ held that the exclusion did extend to litigation, which
was pending before a national court and which concerned the appointment of
an arbitrator, even if existence of an arbitration was a preliminary issue
in that litigation. In light of that answer, the Court of Appeal stated, the
plaintiff's appeal against a setting aside of leave to serve on the
defendants outside the jurisdiction would be dismissed.
CHANNEL TUNNEL GROUP LTD &amp; ANOTHER v BALFOUR BEATTY CONSTRUCTION LTD &amp;
OTHERS (FT, January 29)
The defendant contractors (TML) appealed against a decision in an action in
which Eurotunnel had issued a writ against TML, claiming an injunction
restraining it from suspending work. No order was made on an undertaking
that TML would not suspend work except on 14 days' notice. The judge also
dismissed an application by TML that the action be stayed in favour of
arbitration. Clause 67 of the contract provided that any dispute should
first be referred to a panel of independent experts and that 'the seat of
such arbitration shall be Brussels'. Allowing TML's appeal, the Court of
Appeal stated that some of the parties were not English but French, and they
had all agreed to arbitrate in Brussels. The court was therefore not
concerned with a domestic arbitration agreement (see section 1(4)
Arbitration Act 1975). Whether or not there was jurisdiction, an interim
injunction should not be granted when the parties had agreed to arbitration
in a place outside England and there was an arbitrable dispute between them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Brogden, a chemical engineering graduate from Leeds University, will
need all his skills in alchemy to transform ICI's Chemicals and Polymers
division where he has just been appointed chief executive officer.
The division is ICI's most pressing problem. From peak profits of Pounds
452m in 1989, it crashed into losses during the last quarter of 1991 and is
expected to report further losses during the first quarter this year. Its
plight is not helped by the state of the bulk chemicals sectors, such as
plastics and petrochemicals, which are in trouble generally.
ICI explained that Brogden, who is on holiday, would not want to talk about
his plans until he had spoken to the employees. A former general manager of
personnel at ICI's group headquarters, he will probably continue scaling
down the workforce; the division has already said it wants to cut 4,700 jobs
from its 38,000 workforce.
Brogden may also want to continue the policy, established by his
predecessor, Ralph Hodge, of disposing of non-core businesses. Both the salt
and the soda ash businesses have been sold in recent months. There are also
rumours that the division could be sold or or floated.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, following in the wheeltracks of Volkswagen, has appointed a full-time
director to oversee the car-maker's environment and safety-related
activities in Europe.
The appointment as director, environment and safety, of Austrian-born Walter
Brandstetter, 52, underlines the increasing importance environmental issues
are assuming to all Europe's car-makers, as pressure mounts on them to
produce 'cleaner', more economical vehicles, to use less energy and
materials to make them, and finally recycle efficiently the nearly 15m cars
Europe scraps each year.
Brandstetter, who received his doctorate at Vienna's Technical University
and who has previously combined technical stints at General Motors and
Volkswagen with a career in lecturing, will have a similar role at Ford to
that of Ulrich Steger at Volkswagen. Steger became Volkswagen's full-time
head of 'green' affairs last year; the first appointment of its kind in
Europe.
Since joining Ford in 1988, Brandstetter has been head of engine engineering
at Ford in Germany, and thus has also played a significant role in the
development of new engine families like the Zeta, on which Ford is relying
heavily to restore its lacklustre reputation for engine development inside
Europe.
He will continue to be based in Germany, where he was recently made an
honorary professor by Lower Saxony's Minister of Science and Culture.

FT  22 APR 92 / People: Banking on a weekly audience
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robin Moser, chief executive of Alexanders Discount, will be going to see
the Governor of the Bank of England more than most people in the City over
the next couple of years. As the new chairman of the London Discount Market
Association his job is to call on the Governor every Thursday afternoon and
brief him on the views of the London money markets.
Moser, 44, who still wears a top hat on his way to his Thursday meeting at
the Bank, inherits a tradition which started when Montagu Norman became
Governor in 1920. The discount houses had formed their own committee during
the 1914-18 war and when peacetime came Norman decided to formalise his
weekly meeting with the chairman of the committee. Thursday afternoon was
chosen as it followed the weekly meeting of the Bank of England court, when
Bank rate was published, and Friday's treasury bill tender.
When things were difficult, the chairman would occasionally bring another
member of the committee along with him. By 1929 'difficulties' had become so
frequent that it became accepted that the deputy chairman would always
attend; Moser is therefore accompanied by his deputy, Michael Walker, 43,
managing director of Clive Discount. Traditionally, the two discount house
men met the Governor and the principal of the Bank's Discount Office.
However, this responsibility now falls to John Townend, head of the Bank's
gilt-edged and money market division.
Although the importance of the discount market is not what it was in Montagu
Norman's day, the fact that the Governor of the Bank still continues with
the half-hourly meeting every Thursday suggests that it serves a useful
purpose. 'People are always saying that the discount market is on its last
legs,' says Moser, 'but you can't write us off just yet.' He is confident
that his successors will still be in business well into the next century.
However, the job does have one drawback. Moser has to walk around the rest
of his discount house members before his Thursday meeting, and following his
talk with the Governor he cannot get involved in decisions about his own
firm's position taking until after the Friday treasury bill tender.

FT  22 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: A case of buyer beware in
Czechoslovakia / Describing the environmental responsibilities which foreign
investors could inherit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to pollution in Czechoslovakia, government officials agree on
only one thing - the task of cleaning it up will be difficult. Consensus
fades when officials from the ministries of the environment, finance and
privatisation discuss the means and methods needed to implement
improvements.
As the privatisation programme gathers steam in Czechoslovakia, questions
have emerged on how newly privatised companies will assume environmental
responsibilities and what demands will be placed upon foreign investors when
they are involved.
For the federal committee of the environment in Prague, environmental issues
must be tackled as the privatisation programme unfolds. Jozef Vavrousek, the
environment minister, has warned against what he calls the icing-on-the-cake
attitude which consists of implementing reforms first and tackling
environmental issues later.
On his initiative, the federal parliament adopted in February an amendment
to the privatisation law which forces local enterprises to evaluate
environmental liabilities when presenting their privatisation projects to
the government. Under the Czechoslovak privatisation programme, more than
half of the country's enterprises have drafted privatisation projects which
will place their equity in private hands.
The efforts of the environment minister aim at ensuring that government
officials, when choosing between competing projects, will take into
consideration plans for environmentally-beneficial investments. 'We must
make sure that environment issues, which have been neglected, are now
factored into privatisation,' says Vavrousek.
Strategies for the environmental clean-up have become urgent as private
companies are created. These enterprises will be owned by a mass of
scattered shareholders. More than 8.5m citizens in Czechoslovakia
(population 15m) have registered to receive vouchers which will become
shares in the county's enterprises. Such a diffuse ownership will provide
little incentive for management to implement environmentally beneficial
technologies and respect environmental laws.
To complicate matters, environmental laws have been hampered by
Czechoslovakia's federal political system. Federal laws have so far laid
down general principles, but follow-ups defining concrete implementations
are under the jurisdiction of the Czech and Slovak republics. So far,
regional parliaments have been slow to pass legislation.
Future legal proposals will tackle the possibility of creating a Superfund,
based on the American model, with whole sites being cleaned-up with
government funds and costs later recouped from the original polluters. An
environmental tax on companies to cover clean-up projects is also under
consideration. According to Miroslav Zamecnik, an adviser to President
Vaclav Havel, these taxes should be used to provide soft loans for the
environment.
But both lack of resources and negligence under the communist rule make it
hard to identify culprits today and implement polluter-pay strategies. 'It
is often impossible to pinpoint who is responsible for past damages and,
when you can identify a polluter, he has no money,' says Vavrousek.
The problem of financial resources can be partly resolved when foreign
investors are involved in the privatisation of local enterprises. Western
companies are generally ready to include environmental investments in a
joint-venture in order to meet EC environment standards. But difficulties
arise on the question of environmental liabilities committed in the past.
'Foreign investors buying a company with potential environmental problems
will want a clause in a contract whereby they will not be held responsible
for damage caused before the joint-venture,' says William Harter from
Proctor &amp; Gamble, which bought a Czech detergent company last year. 'The
government is not terribly willing to agree on such clauses. They would
rather see the buyer fix the problems.'
To simplify negotiations, the government recently drafted a purchasing
contract which clarifies environmental policies. Foreign investors are
encouraged to commission environmental audits with a recommended list of
about 20 companies. On this basis, the government may pay indemnifications
for a clean-up. These indemnifications cannot be greater than the purchasing
price paid by the foreign buyer, however.
'If foreign buyers don't do an environmental audit, then we won't take any
responsibility for liabilities they find at a later stage,' says Edmond
Franco, adviser to the Czech ministry of privatisation.
With the bulk of the companies in the hands of shareholders who have never
been to a shareholders' meeting, and with enterprises' budgets strained by
the economic transition to a free market, funds will be hard to come by on
the polluters' side. Yet, under the privatisation programme, the environment
becomes the polluters' problem.

FT  22 APR 92 / Management: Why smoking is a burning issue - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cigarette smoking is the single most important cause of preventable disease.
It is one of the biggest contributors to the number one killer in developed
countries: heart disease. The average smoker lives five to eight years less
than non-smokers. Smoking one packet of cigarettes a day increases the risk
of heart disease threefold, and that of lung cancer fivefold.
Cancers of virtually every part of the body are increased by smoking
cigarettes: mouth, larynx, oesophagus, stomach, bladder and so on.
Women who were once relatively safe from heart disease until they reached
the menopause, are now approaching and surpassing men in some cancers
because of smoking. According to a study published in the Archives of
Internal Medicine (USA), one woman smoker in 10 can expect to contract
stomach cancer over the next 12 years.
One need not even be smoking actively to suffer the consequences: evidence
published in the American Heart Association Journal, Circulation, revealed
that in the US alone, 53,000 non-smokers die each year from diseases caused
by the passive inhalation of tobacco smoke. Office workers are particularly
vulnerable.
How do cigarettes kill us? There are more than 4,000 identifiable substances
from cigarettes and their filters going into the lungs of smokers. The lists
includes ammonia (detergent), cyanhydric acid (used in the Nazi gas
chambers), acetone and toluene (solvents), methane (swamp gas), carbon
monoxide (a constituent of car exhaust gas), DDT (insecticide) and at least
10 cancer-causing substances, including polonium (which is radioactive) and
cadmium (a heavy metal used in car batteries).
The danger is starting to be appreciated in the west, but only very slowly.
According to the World Health Organisation, between 1970 and 1985, smoking
fell by 9 per cent in the US, and 25 per cent in the UK. However, in
developing regions, the trend is in the opposite direction with smoking up
by 42 per cent in Africa and 22 per cent in Asia.
Cigarette companies are fighting hard to make sure people continue smoking.
According to Advertising Age, in 1986 Philip Morris and RJR Reynolds were
the second and third biggest buyers of advertising space. Tobacco companies
target children with emotionally powerful messages, aimed at turning them
into life-long consumers and faithful clients.
But what is to be done for those who want to stop?
BEFORE QUITTING
Develop a new reward system. Stop viewing cigarettes as a reward for a long
day or a job well done. Buy yourself something, or treat yourself to a
massage.
Plan some activity for the times that you smoke. Many managers smoke during
lulls in the action because of boredom. Giving up while on holiday is a bad
idea: most people start again as soon as they get back to the office.
Keep a smoking journal. Most smokers underestimate how much they smoke. Make
a note of each cigarette you have, putting a star next to any you enjoyed.
Most managers who smoke seem to enjoy only about one in 10 of the cigarettes
they smoke.
Never smoke blindly. Smoke only to the exclusion of all other activities,
being aware of what you are doing to yourself.
Smoke your first cigarette an hour later every day.
ONCE YOU HAVE QUIT
Stand up for your new rights. When people ask you if you mind if they smoke,
say 'yes'.
View yourself as a long-term non-smoker. You have to stay vigilant forever:
if you fall off the wagon and have a cigarette, don't use it as an excuse to
have a second and a third.
When you feel like smoking, don't drink alcohol which lowers your resistance
to cigarettes.
Compensate for previous damage from cigarettes with exercise.

FT  22 APR 92 / Management: Dealing the cards for happy families / A look at
an American childcare initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uh-oh - it's going to be one of those ghastly days. Cathy Jennings, a
research chemist at a US pharmaceuticals company, has just woken up to find
her three-year-old daughter standing by her bed, complaining of a sore head
and 'feeling kinda hot'.
For hundreds of thousands of working women, this is one of the worst moments
in trying to juggle a career and motherhood. Either they stay at home and
miss a day's work or dump the child with a relative or minder, pray the
fever is not too serious, and fret all day.
Result: they feel guilty either way. It might be different if Cathy were to
work in New Brunswick for Johnson &amp; Johnson, the healthcare business which
has its headquarters in the New Jersey town. For Johnson &amp; Johnson is at the
forefront of a growing movement among US companies to provide much better
support for employees with family problems.
Those difficulties can range from childcare to ministering to the needs of
geriatric parents - an emerging problem for baby boom employees now entering
middle-age.
Johnson &amp; Johnson not only provides an on-site childcare centre at its New
Jersey headquarters, as do a substantial number of US companies, but it also
has its own sick bay, where mildly-ill children can be dropped off by their
parents.
This is just one facet of a policy, introduced three years ago, which states
that 'we must be mindful of ways to help our employees fulfil their family
responsibilities'.
That is no idle commitment. Johnson &amp; Johnson's other initiatives include:
personal counselling and a nationwide network to help employees find
services for elderly relatives; paid time off to provide emergency care for
family members and up to a year of unpaid leave to look after sick
dependents; subsidies to off-site childcare centres; and on-site classes in
topics such as parenting, nutrition, toddler health and stress management.
Such a coherent programme is still very much the exception among US
businesses, according to a recent study* by the Families and Work Institute,
an independent research organisation.
This puts Johnson &amp; Johnson alongside IBM, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty and Corning
in an elite group of four (2 per cent) of the 188 leading US companies which
the institute surveyed.
The report argues that the four have an integrated, well thought out
approach to the issue and a commitment to change the group's culture, linked
with achieving equality of opportunity between men and women at work.
But while most companies are far less committed, the survey found that
two-thirds of them had evolved some sort of family programmes, and the trend
is clearly growing.
The latest annual report on US employee benefits published by the Hay Group
consultancy** says that 'family-oriented benefits such as long-term care,
work-at-home policies, flexible hours and paternity leave are becoming more
widespread,' with almost 50 per cent of companies offering the latter two.
Why are American businesses suddenly embracing the family? A crucial factor
is demographics. Family issues tend to be a woman's responsibility, and a
surge of women into work over the past 20 years means that 45 per cent of
the US labour force is now female.
The US, moreover, will face a shortage of skilled labour in the 1990s,
making it more important not only for companies to hold on to skilled
employees, but to make them as productive as possible, minimising
absenteeism and stress.
The Families Institute argues that these factors will force a re-evaluation
of some basic management tenets. For example, the idea that personal
problems should be kept at home becomes 'an increasingly difficult and
unrealistic philosophy' when children have only one parent lenges the
assumption that a company's performance depends on having all its employees
turn up to work every day, a conviction which prevents many US managers from
granting time off or work-at-home options. 'It seems counter-intuitive to
managers that employees could actually produce more at home,' the study
says.
The Institute reckons that companies tend to pass through three stages in
their approach to family issues. First, one or more executives start to
champion the idea that it is in the company's interest to respond to
childcare issues because these are taking a toll on productivity.
At this point, however, the management remains opposed to a serious
commitment. It argues that this is not a business issue and worries that it
would be interfering in individuals' lives or laying itself open to charges
of inequity by providing benefits mainly taken up by women. The result is
the half-baked development of one or two policies, such as a referral
service for childcare.
In stage two, the company's leaders join the crusade and the business moves
from piecemeal initiatives to an integrated policy covering all work-family
issues.
In stage three - the pinnacle reached by Johnson &amp; Johnson and its three
peers - managements try to co-ordinate their work-family programmes with
efforts to break through the 'glass ceiling', the invisible culture barrier
which is said to prevent many women getting top jobs.
One issue such an approach can address is the problem of men and women being
penalised for taking advantage of family-friendly policies. 'Work and family
programmes may allow women to work fewer hours,' the Institute explains,
'perhaps inadvertently creating a 'mommy track' where women are seen as less
committed and less worthy of promotion. A higher turnover rate among women
than men has been the impetus for companies to try to reconcile these two
streams of corporate action.'
The path which led Johnson &amp; Johnson to its new policy is instructive. The
pharmaceutical industry generally leads other sectors in its development of
work-family programmes, presumably because it is particularly dependent on a
highly educated workforce conducting research which can take many years to
come to fruition. It needs to woo the best scientific talent and then retain
it.
Johnson &amp; Johnson had another imperative: its strong presence in the market
for baby products gave it the image of a company with high ethical
standards, which served families and was good to work for. However, by the
late 1980s the company found its marks were not as high as it wished in
annual surveys of the best companies for working mothers, and it began to
feel it had to do more to attract and keep the best employees.
The result was a comprehensive review of its policies and employees' needs
which threw up some surprising statistics.
A survey of workers in New Brunswick, where it has seven businesses, found
that 45 per cent had missed at least one day of work in the preceding three
months because of a breakdown in childcare arrangements; 53 per cent were
late to work or left early because of childcare problems; and 9 per cent had
responsibilities caring for the elderly, 59 per cent of whom reported that
this interfered with work.
The upshot was a raft of new initiatives, including a change in the
company's 'credo', or statement of values, to include workers' family
responsibilities. And in an effort to change the corporate culture, it
became one of the few US companies to train supervisors in handling
work-family issues.
The idea is that employees are responsible for making sure their work gets
done, and for suggesting ways this can be achieved, while supervisors
provide the necessary flexibility.
The Families and Work Institute is carrying out an follow-up investigation
of Johnson &amp; Johnson's programme for the company, to determine its benefits
and what needs to be done next. The early results suggest that the scheme is
far from perfect. For example, employees suspect that supervisors are not so
keen on flexibility as the supervisors themselves claim to be.
But the study also provides evidence that work-family programmes can have an
appreciable impact on a company's hire power. A poll of employees found that
'the effect of the job on personal relationships' was the fifth most
frequently-cited reason for taking a job at the company and the fourth most
important for staying.

FT  22 APR 92 / EOC is criticised over value for money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission is failing to provide value for money in
its operations, according to early conclusions of a Civil Service
investigation.
The draft findings of the inquiry into the EOC are likely to be submitted at
the end of the month to the Department of Employment which, since the
general election, has taken over responsibility from the Home Office for
overseeing the commission's work.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, who also has cabinet
responsibility for women's issues, could be embarrassed by the report and
attempts may be made to tone it down before it is presented to the
commission.
Mrs Shephard is unlikely to want a confrontation with the commission at a
time when she is coming to grips with equal-opportunities issues and
expectations from women's groups are high. There is added tension because
some EOC commissioners have made it clear they opposed the transfer of
responsibility for the commission and were annoyed there had been no
consultation on the issue. The commission argued that it needed to be
overseen by a central policy department and that its activities were far
wider than just employment - taking in education, health, housing and
consumer rights, among other issues.
The early conclusions of the investigation are that the commission is
overstaffed and some employees are too highly graded by Civil Service
criteria. In 1990-91 the commission spent Pounds 2.6m on staffing costs
associated with its 160 employees, out of a total income of Pounds 4.7m.
Departments were reorganised in late 1989 with further changes in 1990 aimed
at integrating legal strategies and other activities.
The current investigation is part of a programme of management audits. All
government departments and government-funded bodies are subject to
independent scrutiny every few years. The commission was last investigated
about six years ago.
The commission said yesterday that it was not in a position to comment on
the initial findings of the investigation because it had not yet seen a
draft of the report.

FT  22 APR 92 / Shake-up of leases urged by CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday launched an appeal for
urgent reform of the law governing commercial property leases to prevent
companies being forced out of business.
The CBI wants a change in the law which allows landlords to require tenants
who sell or assign leases to make good unpaid rent owed by a subsequent
occupier. The Law Commission suggested changes to the law in 1988 but
nothing has been done.
Mr John Pollard, CBI company affairs policy adviser, said: 'Some tenants who
have assigned leases have been sued for sums running into hundreds of
thousands of pounds, covering rent, service charges and repairs after they
assigned the tenancy with the landlord's consent. They can be put out of
business by this liability.'
In the 1980s landlords could re-let properties without loss, but they have
been unable to do so during the recession and have had to enforce their
rights against previous tenants to cut their losses, the CBI said.
The directors of some small companies have been required to give personal
guarantees so that if their company is not able to pay, then the individual
directors are forced to.
The problem is increased by the fact that an existing tenant can run up
substantial arrears before the landlord notifies the previous tenant that
anything is wrong. The landlord is under no obligation to notify promptly
and does not even have to sue the non-paying tenant or evict him.
Tenants can also find themselves facing demands for rents that are far
higher than those which applied when they moved out. One company that was
paying Pounds 355,000 a year on a central London office block was faced
several years later with a demand for rent equivalent to nearly Pounds
800,000 a year when a subsequent tenant failed to pay the rent.
'Detailed consultations have been carried out by the Law Commission and a
draft bill included in their 1988 report so the spadework has already been
done,' the CBI said. 'The report should receive the immediate attention of
the Lord Chancellor before more firms are forced out of business.'

reported a fall. The balance of 8 per cent is the first positive figure for
two years.
A balance of 7 per cent of companies in the service sector reported a fall

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, will apparently go ahead with his
independent candidacy for US president.
'The decision is made. I made a commitment to the American people,' he said
in an interview yesterday. Earlier Mr Perot had said he would run if his
supporters could get him on the ballot in every state, a process as yet
incomplete.
Mr Perot may be influenced by several polls suggesting he would be a real
factor in the presidential race. This runs against the history of most
independent candidacies, which tend to bloom in spring before withering.
The greatest concern to President George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton, the
presumptive Republican and Democratic runners, is probably less that Mr
Perot would win outright than that he might tip the balance in some states.
A Texas poll published yesterday, for example, found he could win the
critical Lone Star state. The survey gave him 35 per cent to 30 per cent for
the president, who calls Texas home, and 20 per cent for Mr Clinton, from
neighbouring Arkansas.
The White House promptly dismissed the significance of the poll, saying Mr
Perot was still enjoying a political 'honeymoon' that might not stand up to
scrutiny. A spokesman predicted Mr Bush would carry Texas.
Another national poll in Newsweek magazine found Mr Perot's support in
retreat; it gave him 20 per cent, down from 24 per cent at the start of the
month. Mr Bush was given 42 per cent (from 44 per cent) and Mr Clinton 27
per cent (25 per cent).
This survey also found Mr Perot doing better in the west of the country (27
per cent) than in the south (17 per cent).

<TEXT>
MR Marion Barry, the 56-year-old former mayor of Washington, will be
released from prison tomorrow after serving six months for cocaine
possession, Reuter reports from Washington.
Political analysts expect Mr Barry, a former civil rights leader, to try to
resurrect his political career by running for one of 13 Washington city
council seats in this year's elections.
He is able to do this as he was convicted of only a misdemeanour, not a
felony which would have disqualified him from holding public office.
But an election win is not certain for Mr Barry. Once considered unbeatable,
with a nickname of 'mayor for life,' he lost badly when he ran for a city
council seat in 1990 after his conviction and before sentencing.
Nevertheless, a band of supporters plans to escort Mr Barry back to
Washington in a bus caravan from a federal prison in Loretto, Pennsylvania,
where he spent the last few months of his jail term.

A LOS ANGELES rocket scientist has been sentenced to 30 months in prison and
fined Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 143,000) for selling classified US software
used in the 'Star Wars' weapons programme to Japanese and South African
concerns, Reuter reports from Los Angeles.
After sentencing Mr Ronald Hoffman on Monday, a federal judge freed him on
Dollars 1m bail pending an appeal.
Mr Hoffman, 52, a former employee of Science Applications International Corp
of Century City, California, helped develop the software, known as the
Contam System, for the US Air Force.
Prosecutors said Japanese companies and South African agents paid Mr Hoffman
about Dollars 750,000 between 1986 and 1990 for the technology, which Mr
Hoffman had claimed was not covered by US arms export restrictions.
The software is used to research and develop the US Strategic Defence
Initiative, the so-called Star Wars project aimed at creating an
anti-missile space shield.

<TEXT>
FRENCH and German electricity companies intend to form joint ventures to
build and manage new power stations in east Germany and France.
Bayernwerk, one of the German companies, said it would combine with Preussen
Elektra (part of the Veba group) and RWE to set up two ventures with
state-owned Electricite de France (EdF). No financial details were
available, but the German side will have the majority stake in the east
German projects and EdF in the French ones.
The power plants to be built for and operated by these companies would have
a capacity of 2,000MW each. In east Germany, they will probably be
conventional plants based on imported coal. Nuclear plants could be built in
France, where these are less controversial than in Germany.
The German companies had previously wanted to take a 15 per cent stake in
EdF in return for a holding of the same size by EdF in Veag, the new east
German utility. But France declined to cut its stake in EdF. The new
agreement provides a way round this obstacle.
Preussen Elektra, RWE, and Bayernwerk, in which the Viag industrial group
owns 39 per cent and the state of Bavaria 59 per cent, will acquire 75 per
cent of Veag when it is privatised by the Treuhand agency later this year.

IVECO, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group, has reached

No details about the value or production volumes of the deal have been
revealed. But it is believed to be the first agreement of its kind between a
Russian and western company in the heavy-vehicles sector, and could lead to
close co-operation between the two groups.
Iveco will supply Uralaz, based in the Urals city of Miass, with technology
to assemble a new range of trucks designed to operate in temperatures down
to -55 degrees Celsius. The new models will complement the existing vehicles
made by Uralaz. which currently makes about 30,000 trucks a year. The accord
also calls for extending the collaboration in production of non-Arctic
models.

Telecoms procurement policy has been one bone of contention between the US

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE visit by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, to Indonesia
had an unsettled start yesterday when President Suharto reiterated concern
at foreign interference in his country's domestic affairs.
In a banquet speech last night, President Suharto said Indonesia would not
accept 'comment and criticism that only exaggerates the backwardness of our
national development effort and interferes in our domestic affairs'.
'Every nation and state has a level of dignity that is not open to
bargaining,' he said.
Earlier in the day, Mr Keating had met Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign
minister. Diplomats in Jakarta said Mr Keating raised the issue of East
Timor, the former Portuguese territory which Indonesia forcibly annexed in
1976.
Last November, up to 180 civilians were killed in East Timor when soldiers
opened fire on pro-nationalist demonstrators.
Australia recognises Indonesia's annexation of the territory, but diplomats
said that Mr Keating suggested East Timor might be granted special territory
status. He also questioned whether East Timorese nationalists currently on
trial should be prosecuted under criminal law for their political offences.
Such suggestions are likely to be viewed by Indonesian officials as an
intrusion in internal affairs.
In his banquet speech, Mr Keating adopted a softer line and said he
'respected Indonesia's determination to pursue an independent course in the
world'. He praised President Suharto for having 'dramatically improved
living standards in your own country, and contributed to wider regional
stability'.
Mr Keating's four-day trip, his first abroad as prime minister, has been
flagged as a move by Australia toward greater economic and political
co-operation with Asia. 'Each of us is the other's best test of how
effectively we will be able to deal with the social and political diversity
. . . which will mark our region in the 1990s,' he told President Suharto.

PRESIDENT Mubarak of Egypt emerged yesterday from talks in a tent near the
Libyan-Egyptian border with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi and declared there was a
'ray of hope' for an end to the crisis between Libya and the west over the
downing of two airliners.
'We are consulting with a lot of parties. We hope to find a way out to bring
things back to normal,' Mr Mubarak told reporters, without elaborating.
The talks took place inside a military airbase at Sidi Barani, 75 km east of
the border town of Salloum.
It was the Libyan leader's first high-level encounter with a fellow Arab
ruler since United Nations sanctions, including an air and arms embargo,
came into force last Wednesday. It was not immediately clear whether the
meeting would yield any fresh ideas to resolve the crisis.
In remarks to reporters, Mr Mubarak warned against a military solution,
saying that such an approach would merely 'increase dangers and complicate
matters'.
'I don't think there will be extra measures (against Libya) soon, but I hope
that we could reach a solution before any extra measures,' he declared.
Egypt's president has had a series of meetings with Col Gadaffi aimed at
resolving the dispute over Libya's continued refusal to yield nationals
suspected of involvement in the 1988 and 1989 bombings of American and
French airliners. With more than 1m Egyptians working in Libya, Egypt fears
that if the crisis continues to fester, open conflict might ensue,
destabilising Libya in the process.
Cairo has urged Libya to hand over the two men accused of bombing Pan Am
flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland for trial in either Britain or the US,
but Tripoli after indicating that it might be prepared to do so has
repeatedly balked at the last moment.
Libya has also been resisting French attempts to gain access to four
Libyans, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning in
connection with the blowing up of a French UTA flight over Niger.

Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the divisions which have rent Afghanistan during 13 years of civil
war seemed to be disappearing yesterday as heavily armed mujahideen
guerrillas linked up with government forces to guard strategic positions on
the once dangerous highway linking Kabul to Jalalabad near the Pakistan
border.
At the entrance to the Kabul gorges where the road plunges between high
cliffs, Nassir Mohammed, a young guerrilla fighter from the Harakat group,
said: 'Mujahideen forces are here to combine with the army to bring peace to
Afghanistan. We are not here to fight.'
In a nearby hut, Colonel Ali Jan of the Tsarandoy, a paramilitary unit under
the ministry of defence, said he had been told two days ago to co-operate
with the mujahideen.
Grinning as he sat opposite several mujahideen - all carrying automatic
weapons or rocket launchers - he said: 'A year ago I would have killed them.
A year ago I did kill one.'
Asked whether he would serve a mujahideen government if this was formed in
Kabul, he said: 'If it follows Islamic practice, then we will support it
more than we did (President) Najibullah's regime or that of the king.'
Both at Tange Pole Charqui, about 20km outside Kabul, and further down the
Kabul gorge - the scene during early years of the war of devastating attacks
by guerrillas on Soviet convoys - there were plenty of signs of mujahideen
groups working together and across ethnic divisions.
Present in the area were units of the Jamiat-i-Islami (controlled by Ahmad
Shah Masood, now the main mujahideen leader), Harakat, and the Khalis Yunus
group of the Pathan Abdul Haq.
At several points along the road were burnt-out remains of army tanks and
armoured personnel carriers.
At Mahayapur a bus passed with mujahideen riding on the roof under orders to
work with the army in reinforcing security around the southern perimeter of
Kabul.
The reinforcements are intended as a safeguard against a threat of attack by
Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami movement who are resisting Mr
Masood's domination of a post-war administration. But the Hezb look
increasingly isolated and lack the strength to impose their will.
At Mahayapur, there was a moment of tension when the rattle of automatic
fire echoed across the gorge. But it turned out to be a young mujahideen
testing his weapon.
Mujahideen occupying a roadside house from which the roof had been blasted
said they had only taken up the position yesterday. 'We are under orders not
to fight but to work with the army,' said one.
As yet no mujahideen have moved into Kabul where the army and police still
operate on their own.
In the hectic consultations to set up an interim administration that could
take over from the government, Mr Benon Sevan, the UN special envoy,
yesterday met Rashid Dostan, head of the Uzbek militia, in north Afghanistan
and 50 other commanders who are part of Mr Masood's northern-based
coalition.
Near Pole Charqui, we passed prisoners just released from the nearby jail -
one of the largest in the country and used both for political prisoners and
captured mujahideen.
Mohammed Shafi, 32, who had been imprisoned for two and a half years, said
he had only heard of his release two hours previously. He had been an
officer in the paramilitary forces who had also worked for Mr Masood's
Jamiat-i-islami.
In pouring rain he took off his socks to show how his toe nails had been
torn off under interrogation.
About 1,500 prisoners have been released this week in an effort to encourage
compromise and reconciliation. 'Now the government know that they put
nationalists in prison,' he said. 'They were in the wrong, not us,' he said.
Barriers between the security forces and the mujahideen could disappear more
rapidly than many people think because of the family links between the two.
'All my relations were in the mujahideen,' said Colonel Ali Jan of the
Tsarandoy. Asked if he helped them during the war, he said: 'Naturally I did
', recalling an incident at nearby Sarobi where he provided a mujahideen
unit with medicines, tea and sugar.
Meanwhile, reports from Kabul yesterday said there were soldiers on the
streets while shops were open and traffic moved normally.
But there was an air of expectancy as people waited to see which way events
would turn. Grounded aircraft and helicopters at the airport reflected the
suspension of military operations against the mujahideen.

SHARE prices on the Stock Exchange of Thailand fell sharply yesterday as
local investors expressed their concern about the stability of the new
government led by Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, prime minister and former army
commander.
The SET index fell 23.75
Gen Suchinda, left: markets fear political instability
points, or nearly 3 per cent, to close at 785.09, after a fall of 14.04
points on Monday.
Yesterday's bout of selling followed a peaceful rally in central Bangkok on
Monday night by an estimated 30,000 opponents of the government and a
suggestion by Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme commander, that
he would ban such demonstrations if they caused trouble.
Company results and official forecasts show the Thai economy to be in good
shape - economists predict real growth of about 8.5 per cent this year - but
Thai speculators have taken fright at the possibility of a showdown between
the military establishment and civilian opponents.
'Thais haven't been paying attention to the New York or Tokyo markets,' said
a stockbroker. 'It's really just concern and uncertainty over instability
and the government.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE state government of New South Wales (NSW) yesterday announced a tax
compensation agreement with the Australian federal government paving the way
for several proposed privatisations.
Mr George Souris, privatisation minister in the state's conservative
government, said Canberra had agreed to write off ADollars 430m (Pounds
187m) of NSW debt to allow privatisation of the NSW Government Insurance
Office (GIO).
The debt write-off is intended to compensate the state government for the
loss of corporate income tax from the GIO. Under a long-standing arrangement
between the federal and state governments, state-owned businesses are exempt
from federal income tax, but are required to pay an equivalent sum to the
state.
The agreement, which is the first of its kind, overcomes a significant
obstacle to the privatisation of state government assets by compensating for
the loss of tax revenue. It is likely to pave the way for similar
compensation for other state government assets listed for privatisation -
notably the State Bank and electricity generation industry in NSW.
Mr Souris said the agreement was 'vital' to the successful privatisation of
the GIO, Australia's fifth largest domestic insurance company, which is
expected to raise up to ADollars 1.8bn in a flotation later this year.
He said the bulk of the debt write-off would comprise ADollars 360m
reflecting the estimated net present value of GIO's projected tax payments
to the state over the next five years. The remaining ADollars 70m would
compensate the state government for deferred tax liability accumulated by
the GIO Life Fund.
The debt write-off is equivalent to about 5.7 per cent of the state
government's total debt of ADollars 7.6bn.
The federal government confirmed that a deal had been reached in principle
between Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, and Mr Nick Greiner, the NSW
premier.

THE African National Congress yesterday gained a voice in South Africa's
segregated parliament for the first time, as five white MPs joined the

The five, who had been elected as members of the liberal opposition
Democratic party, said they would stay in parliament as independents
representing the ANC. The Democratic party, which suspended four of the five
men last week, yesterday said it would expel them.
The move illustrates the realignment in white politics taking place since
last month's white referendum, in which the ruling National party gained an
overwhelming mandate to abolish apartheid.
With the first multi-racial elections expected to take place by early next
year, white politicians are beginning to woo non-white voters. The National
party is seeking a coalition of whites, mixed-race 'coloureds', Indians and
moderate blacks while the ANC wants to extend its support beyond blacks.
Yesterday the ANC, which for decades has condemned the whites-only House of
Assembly as racist, said it was delighted at the move. The five men - Mr
Pierre Cronje, Mr Dave Dalling, Mr Jan van Eck, Mr Jannie Momberg and Mr Rob
Haswell - cannot officially sit as ANC MPs because the ANC is not registered
as a political party, but they will represent its interests in the
legislature. They said they would try to improve the image of the
organisation in the white community, where it has very few supporters.
The five were obviously emotionally moved by their decision to become
members of the multi-racial ANC, after years of informal contacts with the
organisation inside and outside the country. Mr Momberg, who previously
spent 30 years within the ruling National party, spoke of a desire to right
the wrongs of apartheid for which he accepted partial blame.
The five said in a statement: 'We join the ANC to work towards the full
liberation of all South Africans. . . to work for democracy in practice.'
They ended their address with the words of the ANC national anthem, 'Nkosi
sikele i'Afrika' (God bless Africa).
Sitting at a table flanked by senior ANC leaders, they quickly adopted the
rhetoric of liberation, referring to their new colleagues as 'comrade'.
The five men are likely to have little influence in parliament, where the
National party has an overwhelming majority.
But their defection will damage the Democratic party, which now has 28
seats.

FT  22 APR 92 / Poland keeps grip on budget spending
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S new government is keeping a tight grip on budget spending as first
quarter inflation is running at lower-than-expected levels.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office shoe the deficit reached Zl
10,450bn at the end of March, Zl 7,500bn less than the ceiling fixed by
parliament for the first quarter.  The budget deficit is one of the key
indicators the International Monetary Fund will be considering in
forthcoming talks with the Poles; it is insisting that the figure not exceed
Zl 65,500bn for the year.
The talks are aimed at agreeing new performance criteria and should lead to
the release of new tranches of a Dollars 1.6bn extended facility suspended
when the previous government allowed the deficit to exceed agreed targets.
The lower-than-expected deficit comes despite a 10 per cent shortfall in
first quarter revenues and was achieved thanks to a sharp 17 per cent cut in
planned spending.  This policy of cutting spending will come under strain in
coming months as state sector industrial profits, which are the main source
of revenues, continue to weaken despite a growth in sales in March.
Consumer prices in the first quarter rose by 12.7 per cent compared to the
last three months of 1991, or a couple of percentage points below
expectation.  The results also show a sharp 17 per cent rise in industrial
sales in March compared to February when sale had already begun to show
signs of improvement.  March saw unemployment decline for the first time
since free market reforms were introduced in 1990. It fell 25,000 to 2.2m.
However, this probably reflects changes in rules on benefit entitlement.
Figures for foreign trade are unavailable but the rise in industrial sales
could reflect a growth in exports as a recent 12 per cent devaluation of the
zloty begins to work through.

FT  22 APR 92 / An Ecu for Europe's poor: Delors wants to put poverty higher
on the agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community's leading anti-poverty programme has a budget of
Ecu55m (Pounds 38.6m), about one Ecu for each of the 50m-plus deprived
people estimated to be living in EC countries.
The EC's Poverty 3 programme is consuming its Ecu55m over five years,
reducing annual expenditure to around one-fifth of an Ecu per poor person.
This is, European Commission officials admit, a pitifully poor sum to be
devoting to one of the most challenging social issues of the day.
Both in the commission and among anti-poverty organisations, however, a wish
is growing for the EC to become more involved in promoting measures to
support Europe's disadvantaged citizens.
Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, intends to produce a document on
poverty and social exclusion aimed, first, at increasing political and
public awareness of the issues and eventually establishing a charter of
rights.
Mr Delors admitted at a conference in Brussels this month that the fight
against poverty is an area where the EC has little to boast about. National
governments still took the view that 'each parish has its poor people' and
did not want the next parish, much less the commission, involved.
But he voiced a willingness to use the commission's influence to help lift
issues of social exclusion and disadvantage to a higher point on Europe's
political agenda. Poverty was a cumulative process, said Mr Delors, and 'if
it takes place against a backdrop of indifference in society, at some stage
the problem will become intractable.'
Definitions of poverty are themselves the subject of frequent disagreement.
Current EC estimates that some 50m of its population - 15 per cent of the
total - live in poverty are based on a calculation of the number of people
receiving less than half the average income in the country where they live.
Some politicians would argue with this definition but Mr Wim Van Velzen,
president of the European Parliament's social affairs committee, says that
on the same basis 30m people were in poverty in 1978. In spite of economic
growth and aid to less developed regions, the proportion of poor people in
Europe has grown each year.
This arises largely from the consequences of industrial restructuring and
long-term unemployment, factors which have also helped change the nature of
'typical' west European poverty. Once traditionally associated with such
groups as the elderly, it is now far more likely to afflict younger,
unemployed families and single parents.
The concept of what is meant by poverty is also changing - the phrase
'social exclusion' is increasingly used to indicate that poor people lack
not only money but access to a range of other services and opportunities.
Notions of poverty being about more than shortage of money have gained
strength since the mid-1980s when Faith in the City, the Church of England's
influential report on urban areas, described it as being about 'how people
are treated and how they regard themselves; about powerlessness, exclusion
and loss of dignity'.
Some welfare campaigners are concerned that if this view is carried too far,
however, the link with lack of money may be lost to such an extent that poor
individuals are seen by others as being responsible for their own plight.
'It is right to talk about exclusion but poverty is still about money,' says
Mr Quintin Oliver, president of the European Anti-Poverty Network which
co-ordinates the work of the voluntary sector. 'It is caused by lack of
money, and money helps solve many of the problems.'
In late 1990 the EC set up a support group of independent specialists to
examine the prospects for developing a European strategy to fight poverty
and social exclusion.
The group has concluded that the EC has a substantial and potentially useful
part to play 'despite its meagre resources for direct action'. Although
local projects funded by the EC were unlikely to add up to an effective
policy for fighting poverty, they should continue as a means of supporting
innovative approaches and exchanging information.
The group recommends that the commission produce an annual report on the
state of human development in the EC, enabling the social consequences of
development to be measured alongside economic ones.
Rising EC interest in the problems of poverty and social exclusion reflects
fear about the potential consequences of leaving a large section of Europe's
population living outside the mainstream, particularly at a time when
extreme-right political parties have been gaining ground in some EC
countries.
Time may be short. The support group's report warns of a 'veritable
explosion' for society, with parts of large towns tending to become urban
ghettos for marginalised people where 'moonlighting, fraud, delinquency,
prostitution and drug-trafficking seem infinitely more remunerative than all
the benefits that could possibly be paid out by the welfare system.'

FT  22 APR 92 / Rise in steel demand predicted: OECD sees glimmer of hope -
but output is set to stagnate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE demand for steel in the industrialised world should pick up slightly
this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), offering a glimmer of hope for the recession-hit
industry
The OECD's latest steel market review says prices have stabilised since the
turn of the year and might rise in the second half. This follows a year in
which demand and output fell abruptly, causing heavy losses and job
reductions for many of the leading suppliers.
The OECD forecasts a 0.5 per cent rise in steel demand, after the more than
5 per cent drop recorded last year, so bringing steel consumption in 1992 to
4.5 per cent below the level in 1990. Output should stagnate this year,
after falling by 4 per cent in 1991, says the OECD.
The US steel industry can expect an upturn in demand on the strength of a
rise in housing starts and the beginnings of a recovery in car production.
However, prices are expected to remain soft and the US industry is facing
another year of operating losses, says the report.
It does not expect a real increase in steel demand in the European
Community, on the grounds that the EC is heading for only a slight economic
recovery this year, with no significant rise in industrial investment or
consumption. Steel users are expected to rebuild depleted stocks in
anticipation of a stronger recovery, which should at least stabilise the
market and help end the price fall.
For the Japanese steel industry, the outlook is bleak. Consumption fell 2.5
per cent in 1991 and the general weakening of the national economy should
produce a 'considerable' decline in steel demand in the first half of this
year, in all sectors except shipbuilding. This, plus the effect of
de-stocking, led to a 13.5 per cent fall in output in the first quarter and
output is expected to fall another 16.8 per cent in the second, says the
report.

FT  21 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats after rise in
bond yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER three consecutive days of record-setting gains, US stock markets ran
into heavy selling yesterday as investors reacted negatively to fresh
declines in Tokyo and sharply higher bond yields at home, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.19 down at 3,336.31, although
about 20 points above a mid-afternoon low for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 receded 5.89 to 410.16 and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks dropped 14.61 to 577.20. Turnover on the New York SE came to 192m
shares.
Early weakness had been expected, although the magnitude of the losses
surprised many analysts. Most of last Thursday's gains were linked to the
monthly expiration of stock index futures and options and had disguised the
underlying soft tone in a market that looked overbought.
Another substantial drop in Tokyo share prices overnight, and a rise in US
bond yields triggered by Friday's bullish housing data, exacerbated a
downward trend established at the start by profit-taking.
The Dow's retreat would have been greater but for strength in Caterpillar,
which rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 as investors continued to respond to
the end of the union strike at the company, and Alcoa, up Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 77 3/4 on hopes that its earnings will recover alongside the
economic rebound.
Otherwise, quarterly earnings continued to dominate sentiment among
individual stocks and sectors. Chase Manhattan shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars
23 1/2 after reporting a 20 per cent rise in first-quarter net income to
Dollars 141m but also warning that loan-loss provisions would remain at
relatively high levels for the foreseeable future.
Eli Lilly lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 3/4 after news of first-quarter
profits of Dollars 442.6m, up from Dollars 388.6m at the same stage a year
ago. The drug group also said it would acquire a majority interest in a
German pharmaceutical company, pending approval from German anti-trust
authorities.
Among entertainment stocks, Capital Cities/ABC dropped Dollars 10 3/4 to
Dollars 457 1/4 on a decline in quarterly earnings to Dollars 41.7m. Time
Warner slipped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 102 7/8 after announcing a Dollars
60m multi-media deal with pop star Madonna.
Microsoft fell Dollars 9 1/2 to Dollars 118 1/8 after warning that income
growth will slow next year.
Canada
TORONTO stocks drifted lower in very light trade. The composite index ended
16.3 off at 3,398.8. Falls led rises by 308 to 164 on volume of 11.9m
shares.
South Africa was closed.

FT  21 APR 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries tumble on data surprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bond prices fell sharply yesterday as Wall Street returned from
the long Easter weekend holiday to absorb some unsettling new economic data
and await this week's sizeable auctions of Government paper.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond broke through the psychologically
significant 8 per cent barrier and was quoted in late afternoon trading at
around 8.027 per cent, for a price of 99  5/8 , down 1 1/8 on the day. The
three-year issue was quoted at 98 27/32 , down  5/16 , to yield 5.936.
Concern over this week's auctions kept many retail buyers on the sidelines
and prices on the slide for most of the day. The Treasury will sell Dollars
14.75bn of two-year notes on Wednesday and Dollars 10.25bn of five-year
notes on Thursday.
The market was also reacting to two pieces of economic news released last
Friday, when US credit markets were closed: some unexpectedly strong figures
for housing starts and fresh testimony before Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Home building figures for March jumped by 6.4 per cent, the fourth monthly
increase in a row and far above analysts' expectations. And that increased
the market's concern that the US could be facing a stronger-than-expected
economic recovery, with attendant inflationary pressures.
However, the relative strength of the US recovery remains a matter of
contention, with generally strong economic data for February being
superseded by relatively soft indicators for March.
Other data for March released over the past few weeks has presented a
picture of a sluggish recovery. Last week, for example, brought figures
showing March retail sales fell 0.4 per cent after rising by 1.3 per cent in
February and 2.1 per cent in January.
Mr Greenspan's cautious testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on
Friday was broadly neutral for the market. He said the recent indicators
were all in 'the context of moving forward in a modest way' and he estimated
that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the first
quarter. While he did not believe this was adequate, he added: 'We do
project a higher rate of growth moving on through the rest of the year and
into next.'
Despite yesterday's dip, many bond market analysts see the current economic
configuration as modestly bullish for the long end of the Treasury market
over the next months. Noting that the broad monetary aggregates are still
stuck at the bottom of the Fed's target range, they predict economic
recovery will remain sub-par for many months ahead. This in turn leaves open
the possibility of still more easing by the Federal Reserve over the next
few months, on top of the 25 basis point cut in the Fed Funds rate announced
earlier this month.
However, the long bond seems unlikely to break out of its current 7.80 to
8.00 yield range until the market becomes convinced that inflation really is
under control and the Fed is not becoming dangerously accomodating.
This week is unlikely to bring much change in the underlying mood, since
relatively few economic statistics are scheduled for release. Thursday will
bring figures for March durable goods orders, with the consensus forecasting
1 per cent growth following a 0.3 per cent fall in February.
The sharp decline in recent months in the Japanese real estate and equity
markets has led some analysts to worry that the repatriation of Japanese
funds from the US might have serious knock-on effects on America's fixed
income and equity markets.
However, the theory was knocked on the head last week by Mr Greenspan, who
noted in his Congressional testimony that Japanese investors held only a
small fraction of outstanding US equities and government debt.
Ms Susan Hering, a fixed income research analyst at Salomon Brothers, said
Japanese investors owned just 2.2 per cent of marketable US Treasury
securities at the end of 1991, according to official tallies. She argues
fears of major repercussions from a Japanese sell-off may be exaggerated,
citing the relatively small size of the holdings; the likelihood that any
sell-off would be gradual; and the fact that private US credit demands are
in secular retreat, leaving the economy well positioned to absorb hefty
government debt.

FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: El Al profits climb despite Gulf
conflict
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Gulf war, which bought Iraqi Scud missiles exploding close to El Al's
headquarters at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, turned out to have a bright
side for Israel's state-owned airline, its annual results show.
The carrier announced 1991 net profits of Dollars 38.9m, up almost three
times from the Dollars 14.1m returned in 1990. It was the sixth consecutive
annual profit for El Al, despite remaining officially in receivership where
it was placed in 1982 to rescue it from heavy debts and losses.
Although the Gulf conflict affected tourism to Israel in the first half, El
Al benefited by being the only operator bar one that continued to fly in and
out of the country during the war. It consequently took almost 100 per cent
of the traffic, where usually it has only a 50 per cent share.
With space limited, prices were also at a premium. After the war, when
passengers returned in large numbers, they were often booking at short
notice, again paying top prices. Sales were up 12 per cent at Dollars
877.6m, although the number of passengers carried fell slightly to 1.75m.
Ironically, a spokesman said yesterday profits in 1992 might not reach the
1991 level, despite a dramatic recovery in passenger traffic, because of
heavy competition and discounts on forward booking.
Last year, a trend to charter flights in the second half was reflected in a
sharp increase in contributions from El Al subsidiaries, up by more than
twice to Dollars 8.1m.
Little progress has been made so far in long-standing government plans to
privatise El Al, which would help raise much needed capital for the airline.
The company, however, has gone ahead with a big modernisation programme,
financing the purchase of seven new Boeing 757 aircraft from its own
resources. It is seeking government guarantees to help it finance the
purchase of two Boeing 747/400 aircraft in 1994.

FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: Hyundai to shift PC management
to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KOREA'S Hyundai Group is to shift management of its worldwide personal
computer and computer peripherals operations to the US in an attempt to
improve its responsiveness to rapidly changing market conditions and gain
earlier access to advanced technologies.
In an unusual move for an Asian company, full management control, marketing,
product development and product assembly for the group's Dollars 750m
personal computer and peripherals business will be moved from Seoul to San
Jose, California.
The decision reflects Hyundai's recognition of the critical value of day to
day contact with suppliers and customers, said Mr Edward Thomas, the newly
appointed president of Hyundai's Information Systems Division.
Mr Thomas, a veteran of the US computer industry, said his mandate was to
create an 'autonomous' business unit with global responsibility for
expanding Hyundai's personal computer sales.
Last year, Hyundai sold about Dollars 300m worth of personal computers in
the US. 'We should be able to double that in a few years,' said Mr Thomas.
'We fully expect to have our next generation of desktop and notebook
computers - designed, engineered and assembled in America - shipping to US
and world markets by the end of the year,' he said.
By moving control of its worldwide research &amp; development to the US, Hyundai
will be able to reduce the time it takes to bring a new product to market by
more than 30 per cent, Mr Thomas said.
The relocation will not displace Korean workers, Mr Thomas stressed. Circuit
board manufacturing will continue to be performed at Hyundai's Korean
factories, he said, however, the establishment of a US assembly operation
will enable Hyundai to compete more effectively with US computer makers by
enabling the company to quickly configure systems to customers'
requirements.
A further advantage is that Hyundai will be able to react more rapidly to
price trends, Mr Thomas said. Once the US operation is in full swing  -
probably by year-end - Mr Thomas plans to turn his attention to the European
market and establish European sales, service and assembly operations.

Equitable plan
</HEADLINE>

THE US Steel Pension Fund, a sizeable US institutional investor, is likely
to raise objections to a demutualisation scheme proposed by The Equitable,
the large but ailing US life insurer, when public hearings on the plan start
today.
The demutualisation scheme is designed to transform The Equitable from a
policy holder-controlled company to one owned by shareholders, thus easing
The Equitable's efforts to bolster its thin capital base. Policy holders are
being asked vote on the matter next month, and two-thirds of those voting
must be in favour for the scheme to go ahead.
Axa, the big French insurance company, has an acute interest in the outcome;
it invested Dollars 1bn in The Equitable last year, and if demutualisation
goes ahead, could convert this into as much as 49 per cent of The
Equitable's shares.
The US steel pension fund is a major policyholder with the Equitable, and
confirmed yesterday a representative planned to be at the hearings, being
held by the New York State Insurance Department later today.
The fund stressed it supports the principle of demutualisation, but
'questions the fairness of the way in which they are going about it'. It
declined to comment further.
The Equitable said yesterday that 95,000 - out of the 2.2m policyholders who
were sent details of the plan - had rung its 'hotline' by Friday evening,
with queries about the demutualisation scheme. The bulk of the queries, it
said, came shortly after the copious documents were sent out.

COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, produced a 25 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income, from Dollars 91.3m last year to
Dollars 113.8m, on sales which rose from Dollars 1.46bn to Dollars Dollars
1.6bn, writes Martin Dickson. Earnings per share rose from 65 cents to 74
cents. The company attributed the profits advance to unit volume growth,
manufacturing efficiencies and a more profitable business mix.
*****
AMERICAN Airlines, the large US carrier which provoked an industry-wide
response when it overhauled its domestic fare structure two weeks ago,
announced yesterday it was reducing fares further in an effort to beat
competitors, writes Nikki Tait. It is converting its 21-day advance fare to
a 14-day advance purchase fare; reducing coach fares in 1,500 domestic
markets and cutting some of the 14-day fares to match competitors'
discounts.
*****
UNITED Technologies, the US aerospace and engineering group, yesterday
reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 109m, or 77 cents a share, up
from Dollars 40m, or 25 cents, in the same period of last year, writes
Martin Dickson. Revenues totalled Dollars 5.2bn, against Dollars 4.8bn.
Contributory factors included the group's restructuring programme and higher
deliveries of aircraft engine spares from its Pratt &amp; Whitney subsidiary.
*****
LOCKHEED, the US defence and aerospace group, made an after-tax profit of
Dollars 66m in the first quarter, up from Dollars 54m a year ago, Nikki Tait
reports.
First-quarter sales were marginally lower at Dollars 2.23bn.
*****
GILLETTE, the Boston-based shaving products group, reported after-tax
profits of Dollars 129.4m in the first three months of 1992, compared with
Dollars 107.2m a year earlier, Nikki Tait reports.
Sales were Dollars 1.21bn, up from Dollars 1.11bn.

FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: Mitsui chemical, petrol
companies in merger talks
</HEADLINE>

MITSUI Petrochemical Industries and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals are in talks
about a possible merger that could create one of Japan's largest integrated
chemicals companies.
The two companies confirmed yesterday that talks were underway, although
they said no details of any possible merger had yet been agreed.
The idea of a merger between the two companies, both part of the loosely
structured Mitsui group, has been discussed for 20 years. Downturn in the
worldwide chemicals industry and in the Japanese economy has recently made a
deal more attractive.
Both companies saw profits fall steeply in 1991, and are expected to report
further profit declines in the fiscal year which ended last month.
A merger would have a certain industrial logic. Mitsui Petrochemical is a
bulk producer of petrochemicals. Mitsui Toatsu is a big producer of resins
and other industrial chemicals, but lacks a naptha cracker, which means it
has to buy basic feedstock from outside suppliers.
Combined sales of the companies would be about Y770bn (Dollars 5.78bn),
putting it among the top ranks of Japan's chemical companies, and increasing
its international competitiveness. The combined company, however, would
still be relatively small by world chemical industry standards.
Mr Toshihiko Nakajima, analyst at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The biggest
problem is how not to violate the anti-monopoly act.'
Mr Nakajima said the two companies' combined production of phenol accounted
for between 40 and 50 per cent of the Japanese market, well over the 25 per
cent limit set by the Fair Trade Commission.
There were also doubts about how much would be achieved by a merger, unless
the companies were able to rationalise the business.
Japan's lifetime employment system at big companies makes it difficult for
them to spin off operations and reduce manpower, even though in this case
there would be obvious potential savings.
And even though the companies have reasonably close business ties, outright
mergers between different companies with individual management cultures and
histories have often proved difficult in Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABITIBI-Price, the Canadian forest products company 82 per cent-owned by
property developer Olympia &amp; York, has entered its third consecutive year in
the red.
The unremitting weakness in the newsprint market pushed Abitibi to a
first-quarter loss of CDollars 41.6m, (USDollars 35.2m) or 61 cents a share,
from a CDollars 5.5m loss, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Losses
totalled CDollars 75.9m last year and CDollars 44.6m in 1990. First-quarter
revenues dipped by 10 per cent to CDollars 650m.
As one of O&amp;Y's non-property assets, Abitibi is a candidate for disposal to
ease the parent company's liquidity crunch. However, O&amp;Y would prefer not to
sell the company at the bottom of the forest products cycle.

<TEXT>
CHASE Manhattan, the large New York banking group, and NationsBank, the
southern-based regional giant, yesterday underscored the improving health of
the US banking sector with sharp improvements in first-quarter net income.
Chase recorded a 21 per cent increase, despite higher provisions for credit
losses, while NationsBank, recently formed from a merger between North
Carolina-based NCNB and C&amp;S/Sovran, reported a near doubling of income.
NationsBank, reporting figures for the merged bank for the first time,
produced net income of Dollars 310m, or Dollars 1.28 a share, compared with
Dollars 159m, or 70 cents, a year ago.
Chase reported net income of Dollars 141m, or 81 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 117m, or 73 cents a share, in the same period last year.
Chase's capital ratios also improved, with the Tier One figure rising to 5.7
per cent from 4.5 per cent a year ago and the total capital ratio rising to
10.2 per cent from 8.7 per cent.

FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Forecasts of mergers boom borne out by
deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREDICTIONS of a post-election mergers and acquisitions boom in the UK were
borne out by some of last week's international deals, writes Brian Bollen.
Two of the UK's biggest names featured for different reasons. Corporate
clearing house Hanson sold the Ever Ready battery manufacturer to US foods
group Ralston Purina in what was described by a financial adviser as a
tidying-up exercise before making a larger acquisition.
The latest stage in ICI's restructuring involves the sale of its two salt
businesses in a transatlantic management buy-out led by major US salt
producer D George Harris &amp; Associates.
The offer by German components group Robert Bosch for Worcester Group, a UK
central heating boiler maker, is thought likely to turn up the heat in the
ongoing debate about corporate governance. While management has recommended
the offer, some shareholders were not happy, arguing that the price should
have been much higher and that the group's directors would receive a
different offer from outside sharehold-ers.
There was discord too at engineering group Cronite, where most of the board
recommended the cash offer from AFE, a French engineering company.
