FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (2): Safety and security - Banking

EVERY morning a fleet of shiny Mercedes pour over the Italian frontier into
Monaco to deposit their fur-clad passengers into the Louis XV restaurant of
the Hotel de Paris for lunch.
These rich Italians are the bread and butter of Monaco's banks. For, after
lunching at the Louis XV and shopping at Louis Vuitton, they then pop into
their banks to check on their tax-free deposits.
'High net worth individuals are what banking in Monaco is all about,' said
one local financier. 'The tax advantages are important, of course, but there
is also the ambience. These people are too frightened to walk around Torino
or Milano. They can't wear their furs. They can't park their cars. Here they
feel safe. They could walk around in their jewels all day if they wanted
to.'
So far the banks have thrived on Monaco's appeal to this wealthy clientele.
Business had always been buoyant for the Monegasque banks, but for the past
five years, ever since the French government removed exchange controls and
their customers could move money in and out more freely, they have
flourished.
The value of deposits lodged in Monaco is believed to have risen by between
20 and 25 per cent a year throughout the late 1980s and mustered growth of
just under 20 per cent to about Dollars 10bn last year. Ten years ago there
were 20 banks in the principality, now there are nearly 40. The only recent
casualties have been Chase Manhattan, which closed its Monaco office as part
of its internal restructuring and the local branch of BCCI.
'In difficult times people look for safety and security from their
investments,' said Mr Yves Max, director-general of Credit Foncier de
Monaco, a subsidiary of Suez, the French financial group, and the
principality's biggest single bank. 'Even 1991, a dreadful year for banks in
other countries, wasn't too bad for Monaco.'
Most of the Monegasque banks are subsidiaries or affiliates of international
groups, mainly of the big French banks such as Suez, Paribas, Credit
Lyonnais and Societe Generale - although Italian, British and, to a lesser
extent, American banks are also present.
The bigger banks operate as retail banks for residents and are also involved
in advising and financing local businesses, mainly in the property industry.
There are some local investment institutions, notably the Monaco Treasury,
Societe des Bains de Mer, the state-controlled hotel and casino group, and a
handful of small pension funds.
But the bulk of their business is in dealing with wealthy private clients.
These clients are undoubtedly attracted by Monaco's tax system where
everyone, except the French, is exempt from tax. The French have been taxed
on any money deposited in Monaco since 1962 when General de Gaulle,
infuriated by the number of rich Frenchmen using Monte Carlo as a tax haven,
sent his troops to seal off the border until Prince Rainier agreed to
compromise.
Monaco is, however, at a disadvantage compared to other 'tax havens' such as
Luxembourg and Switzerland in that the rules on disclosure are far stricter.
The Monegasque government is empowered to demand access to all information
on bank accounts.
Until recently, the local banks tended to concentrate on customers in
neighbouring Italy and North Africa (with which they have long links thanks
to France's colonial ties). Now they are looking further afield.
Paribas and Credit Foncier both send sales executives to other countries.
'We see northern Europe and the southern Mediterranean as important growth
markets,' said Mr Michel de Robillard, director of Credit Foncier. 'We, like
the other big Monaco banks, are now much more active at international
marketing.'
The critical question for the Monegasque financial community is how it will
develop in the future. To some extent this will be determined by the
direction of Europe's financial legislation in the post-1992 unified market.
The worst possible scenario would be for other European countries to align
with France and wipe out the principality's tax exemption.
Such a scenario would have dire consequences for the local economy. But
luckily for the Monegasques it seems improbable, at least for the
foreseeable future. Instead, the banks are more likely to see some moderate
reforms in the level of regulation.
For operational purposes, the Monaco banks come under the joint jurisdiction
of the French and Monegasque authorities. They follow French banking
regulations and all securities dealings come under the scrutiny of the
Parisian stock market authorities.
This system is designed to enable the Monegasque government to strike the
delicate balance between making Monaco flexible enough to attract investors
without scaring them away - and attracting the wrath of the French
authorities - with scandals.
Most of the time the system works. 'People play by the rules,' said Mr
Joseph Sauzier, director of Societe Generale's Monaco operations. 'After
all, it is in our interest to do so. The bigger banks here all belong to
large financial groups with tight management and financial controls.'
But from time to time things go wrong as illustrated by the collapse two
years ago of Banque Industrielle de Monaco, the principality's sole
surviving fully independent bank. The murky details of BIM's demise - from
the suicide of one senior executive, to the arrest of another and the
discovery that it made a great deal of money from bearer deposit notes held
by Monegasques as 'cats' paws' for tax-dodging French citizens - fulfilled
the financial sector's worst fears of a local scandal.
Bigger banks admit, privately at least, to being terrified of another
BIM-style collapse.
The authorities are already tightening up some areas of banking regulation
although Mr Jean Pastorelli, counsellor to the government for finance,
insists this has nothing to do with BIM's demise. Legislation is under way
to make Monaco's laws on money-laundering the same as those of France. Other
reforms are in the pipeline.
In the meantime, Monaco's financial community is looking forward to a
prosperous future. 'There are now nearly 40 banks here employing around
1,200 people,' said Mr Gilles Trousseau, director of Paribas. 'But there is
lots more potential. There is no reason why we shouldn't have 50 or 60 banks
with 2,000 employees.'

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (3): Superchef from a pig farm - Profile:
Alain Ducasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the first guests checked into the Hotel de Paris in the 1860s they paid
FFr5 for a set meal starting at 5.30pm on the dot every day.
Today, the hotel's eating arrangements are rather more elaborate. For the
past two years the Hotel de Paris has boasted the only three-star restaurant
in Monte Carlo and one of the very few along the whole Cote D'Azur, thanks
to Mr Alain Ducasse, 34, the superstar chef at the Louis XV.
Before Mr Ducasse, Monaco's culinary credentials were lacklustre at best.
Monte Carlo has a proud epicurean history. It is, after all, a place where
Escoffier cooked. The Hotel de Paris itself swiftly shed its early air of
austerity. By the 1880s it had made its name as a place for resplendent
meals for which, as one writer noted, its kitchens consumed 700 kilos of
beef, 200 chickens, 150 pieces of game, 14 sheep, 150 dozen oysters and
1,400 bottles of liquor daily.
But by the late 1980s, Monaco's reputation had waned. The local Monegasque
dishes - hearty blends of northern Italian and Provencal cooking - do not
tend to lend themselves to haute cuisine. Most of the principality's
restaurants dished up undistinguished French and Italian fare.
When the Hotel de Paris decided to open a new restaurant, it realised that
it needed to be a special place. It head-hunted a new chef who would be
capable of making his - or her  - mark in the restaurant world, and found
him in Mr Alain Ducasse, then working at La Terrasse along the Riviera coast
at Juan les Pins.
Mr Ducasse, the son of a pig farmer in the Les Landes region of south-west
France, started cooking at the age of 16, going on to work under such famous
French chefs as Mr Michel Guerard and Mr Roger Verge.
He cites Verge, Guerard and Robuchon as his main influences. His style of
cooking is in the modern tradition of classically prepared, traditional
dishes with a Provencal twist, rather than the contortions of nouvelle
cuisine.
The Hotel de Paris, or rather its owner, the Societe des Bains de Mer, has
ploughed nearly Pounds 2m into creating the Louis XV restaurant for him.
The restaurant, on the ground floor of the hotel with windows looking onto
Monte Carlo's Place du Casino, is in the grand 19th-century French style
accompanied by a 1,100 sq m state-of-the-art kitchen and the 2,500 wines in
the hotel's cellars.
Two years ago, the Michelin guide bestowed its coveted three stars on the
Louis XV, turning it into one of the elite band of 19 three-star restaurants
in France.
Gault Millau, the creme de la creme guide which is the bible of France's bon
viveurs, rated it 19 out of 20 despite describing the decor as exactly how a
Hollywood movie studio would have depicted a 'big French restaurant' in the
1950s.
Mr Ducasse, the youngest chef ever to get three Michelin stars, is lauded
with all the laurels of a latter-day culinary star in France.
He not only presides over a team of 90 at the Louis XV but is a business
partner in the restaurant.
His picture is plastered all over the glossy promotional literature. And his
name is emblazoned on everything from menus, to the petit fours papers and
even the cream canopies flapping in the breeze on the Place du Casino facade
of the Hotel de Paris.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (1): Royal legacy lingers on - Although the
grand old days when Europe's aristocracy whiled away their summers at the
Hotel de Paris are over, Monaco is still one of the most expensive and
exclusive resorts, says Alice Rawsthorn who wrote this survey. The
principality must now face the challenges of a unified European market after
1992

<TEXT>
IT was back in the mid-19th century that the seeds of modern Monaco were
sown. The French riviera was flourishing as the wealthy citizens of Paris
and Lyons tumbled off trains into the sunny towns of Nice and Cannes, but
Monaco was still a poverty-stricken principality of straggling orchards and
olive groves.
That was before Prince Charles III, heir to the throne, realised that
gambling, then illegal in France, could coax visitors away from Nice and
Cannes to Monaco. He was right. By the end of the 19th century his
principality was prospering and Monte-Carlo, an old olive grove hastily
renamed in his honour, had become the smartest spot on the Mediterranean as
the old and new wealth of Europe congregated in its luxury hotels - and, of
course, the casino.
From a modern perspective, the legacy of Prince Charles has been both a boon
and a bane to Monaco - a boon because of the prosperity he created and a
bane because of the sleazy aura of that early era of legalised gambling. His
successors, and their subjects, have since been struggling to strike a
balance between the two.
This conflict has come to a head most poignantly under the present
sovereign, Prince Rainier, who since 1946 has been responsible for the
government of Monaco and for forging placable relations with its powerful
neighbour, France. It has been said so often that Prince Rainier has saved
Monaco that it almost seems a cliche to repeat it, but any analysis of the
principality's post-war development suggests that it is true.
When Rainier took the throne at the age of 26 in 1949, Monaco was little
more than a playboy's playground for the seedier sort of sybarites that
converged on the Cote D'Azur each summer. Worse still, it was in dire danger
of falling prey to the darker elements of the Mediterranean underworld from
Nice and Marseilles.
A glance at the latterday front pages of Nice-Matin, which covers the
adventures and misadventures of neighbouring Provence, spells out the risks.
Day after day the paper is packed with horror stories of heroin hauls,
cocaine busts and particularly messy Mafia-style murders.
Somehow Prince Rainier had to spruce up Monaco's image to attract
respectably wealthy residents and visitors, thereby creating long-term
employment and business opportunities for the indigenous Monegasques to
prevent them emigrating to the US and Europe.
For the most part he has succeeded. Monaco, with its pretty villas and belle
epoque apartment blocks, is the home of a number of prominent expatriates -
among them Mr Karl Lagerfeld, the pony-tailed fashion designer behind
Chanel, Mr Bob Beckman, who made his millions predicting doom and gloom on
the world stock markets, and Mr Boris Becker, the Teutonic tennis star.
Although the grand old days when Europe's aristocracy whiled away their
summers at the Hotel de Paris are over, Monaco is still one of the most
expensive and exclusive resorts on the Mediterranean.
Moreover, the Monegasques have stayed. Monaco has been spared the same waves
of emigration of other tiny European states such as San Marino which, until
recently, has seen its indigenous population drift off to look for jobs in
other countries. The Monegasques represent nearly 4,500 of the
principality's 27,000 or so inhabitants. They tend to stay in Monaco for
secondary education but leave for France to go to college or university.
They almost always return to work in their native state.
The Monegasques are entitled to have special housing subsidies, although
this does not fully compensate for the difficulty of finding affordable
apartments in a property market where prices are inflated by the influx of
wealthy expatriates.
Similarly, although the price of a Hermes bag or a Chanel suit is the same
in Monte Carlo as in Cannes or Genova, the cost of everyday items such as
food and household goods is extremely high.
The basse and moyenne corniches out of Monaco are crammed with the cars of
the Monegasques, and even of the rich residents, on their weekly shopping
trips to cheaper supermarkets over the borders into both France and Italy.
Prince Rainier has also insisted on preferential employment for the
indigenous population. They have guaranteed jobs in government service. All
Monaco companies have to offer jobs first to the Monegasques, then to local
residents, and then to the inhabitants of the four neighbouring French
communes before looking further afield.
Local employers complain that these privileges have pampered the
Monegasques, making them lazy and complacent. But the Monegasques are a
charming people. Their friendly demeanour and laid-back ways undoubtedly add
to Monaco's appeal, giving it a special ambience that stops it becoming yet
another glitzy tourist resort.
But Prince Rainier's biggest achievement has been to stimulate the local
economy by creating two thriving industries in banking and tourism.
The principality's banks have prospered by using its tax advantages (for
everyone except French citizens) to turn Monaco into a deposit centre for
wealthy private clients. For the past five years, since the French
government abolished exchange controls, the banking industry has boomed.
There are now nearly 40 banks in the principality, double the number of 10
years ago. The value of deposits lodged in their vaults rose by 20 to 25 per
cent a year in the late 1980s and even increased by a little less than 20
per cent to around Dollars 10bn in 1991, a grim year for most areas of
international banking.
There are some clouds on the horizon. As the local banks are well aware, the
same light level of regulation that attracts their rich depositors also runs
the risk of bringing in less salubrious customers whose activities, if they
attracted the attention of the French or Monegasque authorities, could
herald more rigorous regulation.
The collapse of Banque Industrielle de Monaco (BIM) in 1990, accompanied by
the suicide of one executive and the arrest of another, fulfilled their
worst fears. The authorities are now reforming some aspects of banking
regulation although there have been no serious scandals since the BIM
debacle.
The local tourist industry is buoyant too. For years, Monaco basked in the
allure of the fairytale romance between Prince Rainier and his wife, Grace
Kelly, the Hitchcock blonde and Hollywood star. Since Princess Grace's death
in 1982, the gossip columnists have turned their attention to her children -
Caroline, Albert and the wayward Stephanie  - whom they pursue with equal
enthusiasm, ensuring that the Monegasque royal family is never far from the
headlines.
Monaco, with its sunny climate and the luxury yachts glistening in its
harbour, now attracts 3.5m visitors a year. Most are day trippers who come
to admire the Garnier grandeur of the casino, to check on their deposits at
the local banks, or to watch the changing of the guard at Prince Rainier's
pink palace. But the principality still attracts about 240,000 overnight
visitors and is now expanding its conference and exhibition activities to
enhance its appeal to the burgeoning business travel market.
Prince Rainier has endeavoured to broaden the base of the local economy,
notably with the Fontvieille development of 22 hectares of reclaimed land to
the west of the old town, which is now a centre for light industry and
low-cost housing. This initiative will continue, according to Mr Jean
Pastorelli, government counsellor for finance, with new land reclamation and
development projects to further expand the economy into the next century.
In the meantime, Monaco faces the more immediate challenge of the
implications of the unified market in Europe after 1992. The most pressing
issue is the forthcoming reduction in the rate of value-added tax in France,
probably from an average of 18.6 to 17.5 per cent. Monaco will be forced to
follow suit - given that its rates are linked to those of France - creating
a shortfall in state revenue. Mr Pastorelli is confident that this will be
countered by a corresponding increase in consumer spending.
The unified market would only pose a serious threat to Monaco if, in the
longer term, it affected its fiscal status. The biggest problem would be if
Monaco lost its tax advantages over other European Community countries, so
that their citizens, like the French, could no longer avoid paying tax on
deposits in the principality. If that happened there would be a run on the
banks, foreign residents would flee, property prices - and the local economy
 - would collapse.
Such an apocalyptic prospect seems remote, at best. For the foreseeable
future, Monaco seems set to carry on basking in the sunshine and to tussle
with the legacy of Charles III, its visionary prince.

FT  15 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie index closes at six-month
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST of an expected flurry of post-general election takeover bids in
the London market emerged yesterday and helped fuel another determined
advance by UK equities.
The FT-SE 100 share index rose 9.5 to 2,600.5, its highest closing level
since October 18 last year and a rise of 164.1 since the Tory election
victory last Friday.
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's agreed offer for Midland Bank, worth in
excess of Pounds 3bn, came as no great surprise to banking specialists
although there was disappointment at the terms. Within two hours or so of
the announcement it emerged that a big block of Midland shares were being
offered around the market.
Although there was no official confirmation it was thought that Hoare Govett
had been unsuccessful in attempting to place 60m of the Kuwait Investment
Office's 78m stake in Midland. The market's disappointment at the terms was
reflected in the decline in Midland's share price.
The market opened around five points lower, concerned that any unexpected
bad news in the large batch of company reports expected this week could
spark off a prolonged bout of profit-taking in leading stocks.
But with no real horrors emerging from yesterday's results and the Hongkong
bid being confirmed the market turned upwards and reached a day's high of
2,603.5, or 12.5 firmer, in mid-morning.
Thereafter the Footsie traded in a relatively narrow range, with dealers
professing slight disappointment at London's reaction to encouraging data on
the UK economy, released around midday, and a firm opening by Wall Street.
They also mentioned the rally by Tokyo overnight. The US market was moving
ahead strongly after London closed.
A 1.1 per cent rise in UK industrial production was well ahead of market
expectations, as was the similar rise in manufacturing output, according to
market observers. Gilts, under modest pressure during the early part of the
day, rallied to close modestly higher on balance, helped by another
steadfast showing by sterling.
Turnover in equities remained brisk but continued to diminish. Yesterday saw
601.8m shares change hands, compared with Monday's 629.3m and last Friday's
1.345bn.
Stock Exchange figures showed that the value of customer business on Monday
totalled Pounds 1.22bn, or around half that of last Friday.
Building shares remained in the spotlight with full-year results from RMC
coming out ahead of most expectations. The dividend was particularly well
received and the shares delivered one the Footsie's best individual
performances. Taylor Woodrow also came in for strong support despite the
lapse into losses for the year. Dealers were bracing themselves for bad news
on the dividend front from Tarmac this morning.
A senior marketmaker described the market's performance as encouraging and
said it had been a session of consolidation. 'Wall Street looks okay, we've
closed above 2,500 and there are hints of plenty of bids and rights issues
in the pipeline,' he said.

FT  15 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE on stock index futures sent the June contract on the FT-SE sharply
forward to trade at a large premium to the cash market for most of the
session, writes Joel Kibazo.
June opened at 2,623 but slipped back due to lack of interest. However,
buyers returned sending the contract forward to 2,644, the high of the day,
by mid-morning, underpinning the underlying cash market.
Once again, a firm Wall Street had little influence on trading in London
during the afternoon session which saw June decline slightly. However, a bid
for 100 contracts in the dying minutes of the session sent June ahead.
Dealers also talked of independent traders closing short positions towards
the end.
June closed at 2,643, up 14 on the previous session and around 21 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Volume was 5,809
contracts. Traders talked of further rises in after hours dealing and they
expect a strong opening on the cash market tomorrow.
Traded options were busy and turnover reached 41,545 contracts. Volume in
both the index contracts was heavy. The FT-SE 100 option traded 13,365 lots
while the Euro FTSE option reached 6,789.

FT  15 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland bid terms disappoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TERMS of the agreed takeover of Midland Bank by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation (HSBC) disappointed the market yesterday. The shares
were further weakened by an apparently huge amount of stock waiting to be
sold.
The two banks said jointly that HSBC was making a recommended paper offer
offer for Midland valuing it at Pounds 3.1bn or 378p per share. Analysts had
expected an offer well above 400p. The lower than expected offer revived
speculation that Lloyds Bank would come in with a higher bid. Potential
pressure on Lloyds' balance sheet prompted its shares to slip 5 to 390p.
There was also a strong belief in the market that the Kuwait Investment
Office was trying to place 60m Midland shares, a stake of 7.64 per cent
through securities house Hoare Govett at 362p - worth Pounds 217.2m. The KIO
is the only shareholder apart from HSBC with a stake above 5 per cent.
The KIO said it never commented on market talk and Hoare Govett declined to
respond to questions.
Market dealers said Hoare was trying to place the shares in an 'all or
nothing deal' but only managed to pre-place up to a third of them yesterday.
They believed the deal was competitively valued and would probably be taken
up by arbitrageurs - dealers who trade off relative differences in markets -
who would wait to see how HSBC shares would react when they opened in Hong
Kong
Midland lost 7 to 365p on heavy turnover of 29m shares.
Hopes that the worst may be over boosted the battered building materials and
construction sector, while talk of a possible bid supported Tarmac ahead of
today's results. The shares rose 10 to 145p, despite expectations of a very
sharp fall from the previous year's profits of Pounds 190.7m. Analysts
suggested that if this results in a passing of the dividend, it may bring
the balloon created by bid speculation down to earth.
RMC climbed 22 to 606p after reporting profits at the top end of market
expectations and paying an increased dividend of 20p against 19.3p. The 1991
profit of Pounds 167.4m was down from Pounds 216.2m, but was viewed
favourably when compared with forecasts of Pounds 150m to Pounds 170m and
resulted in analysts upgrading forecasts for the present year. Blue Circle
was cheered by the news from RMC, rising 7 to 285p, ahead of today's
results.
Taylor Woodrow gained 9 to 129p, as the dividend was held at 9 1/2 p on a
1991 loss of Pounds 2.7m. The payout followed statements made at the time of
last year's rights issue and was regarded as 'a matter of honour', but the
company said it made no promises for this year. The loss was in line with
forecasts and followed a profit of Pounds 83.4bn previously.
John Mowlem rose 9 to 157p, despite Monday's announcement of sharply lower
profits, after County NatWest said the shares look cheap long term.
Wellcome fell 21 to 1110p on a US press report suggesting that its anti-Aids
drug Retrovir (AZT) might soon face competition from rivals. The article
said Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug, DDI, which received approval from the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, had emerged in a new study as
equal to or better than Wellcome's AZT.
Analysts said an FDA advisory committee would soon meet to discuss
Bristol-Myers' DDI as well as aids drug DDC, which is made by the Swiss
pharmaceuticals group Roche.
Bid rumours pushed discount food retailer Kwik Save up 15 to 568p, on higher
than usual turnover of nearly 1m shares. Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm holds 25
per cent of Kwik Save and is looking to diversify ahead of 1997.
Argyll, the third largest UK supermarket group, eased 3 to 341p but was not
regarded as likely to mount a bid in the short-term, while Tesco and J.
Sainsbury would probably be prevented by legislation.
Stores group Dixons rose 3 to 242p, continuing to benefit from the general
election result. Analysts were impressed by a company presentation, which
concentrated on forthcoming technolgy and buying trends.
A positive and in-depth analysis from SG Warburg Securities helped lift
Pearson despite its already high share price. Warburg recommended buying the
shares on weakness and Pearson climbed 11 to 845p.
Bowater, which joined the FT-SE 100 Index two weeks ago, advanced 16 to 769p
as the stock returned to favour after a recent downward correction.
Whitbread, hit on Monday by comments from the Office of Fair Trading about
beer supply agreements, gained a little relief from news that it is to lease
115 pubs to Devenish, free of tie for eight years. Whitbread 'A' improved a
penny to 426p, while Devenish rose 3 to 248p.
Cable &amp; Wireless jumped 12 to 570p with sentiment boosted by a BZW buy
recommendation and news that the company is to form a joint venture in
Russia. Kleinwort Benson, however, was said to be advising investors to
switch out of Cables and into Vodafone, 2 better at 358p.
Bid speculation continued in Delta. The shares added 12 to 469p as County
NatWest reiterated its buy recommendation.
The market's first cash call since the general election was well received as
shares in Laird Group recovered from an early decline to end a penny firmer
at 275p. The company which reported a Pounds 10.5m fall in its final figures
to Pounds 28.4m is making a 1 for 5 rights issue to raise Pounds 41.4m.
British Aerospace gained 10 to 350p as turnover rose to 5.8m on reports that
Saudi Arabia is to put aside a further 200,000 barrels of oil to meet
payments under the UK/Saudi al-Yamamah defence pact.
Television company Central put on 20 at 1285p. SG Warburg Securities new
chart analyst Mr Richard Lake believes the stock is ready to break out of
its trading range.
Aviva Petroleum, which recently had a one-for-fifty consolidation of its
shares saw its price virtually halved yesterday before rallying to close 38
off at 111p. Marketmakers said they had seen no big sellers in the market
and knew of no apparent reason for the falls.

FT  15 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: India spices the market for foreign
investors - Reforms of its capital markets have added to the sub-continent's
attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweeping reforms of the Indian capital markets have fuelled the speculative
rally in the country's stock market, making it the best performing emerging
market in March and in the first quarter of 1992, according to the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank.
The Indian government's capital market-oriented budget of late February
included the following measures: the partial convertibility of the rupee;
allowing foreign pension funds to invest in Indian equities; the abolition
of controls on the amount of equity Indian companies can raise in the
domestic capital markets; the simplification of the country's tax structure
and the reduction of income and import taxes.
Mr Sridhar Venki, emerging markets analyst at Olliff &amp; Partners in London, a
specialist broker in off-shore country funds, says that a large amount lot
of foreign money is now flowing into Indian equities and that trading volume
has increased substantially. He cautions, however, that the crop of
corporate results in the coming weeks might not meet the market's
unrealistic expectations. Disappointments on the earnings front could cool
the market down in the near term, but its long-term outlook remains
attractive.
In the January-March period, Brazil came a poor second to India, held back
by a steady devaluation in the local currency and by restrictions on foreign
investment. IFC data show that the Brazilian stock market rose by 166.6 per
cent in local currency terms in the first quarter but by just 46.2 per cent
in dollar terms.
Dr Roberto Faldini, the new president of the Brazilian Securities Exchange
Commission, told a group of investors in London yesterday that while he was
in favour of a further opening up of the stock market to foreign investors,
he was unable to give an exact timing. Furthermore, priority would be given
to investors from Latin American countries.
Dr Faldini said he planned to improve the policing and transparency of the
stock market, as well as improve protection for minority shareholders.
On the positive side, investors in Brazilian equities have been encouraged
by evidence in March that inflation was coming under control and that the
privatisation programme was back on schedule. News that Telebras and Aracruz
will issue American Depositary Receipts later this year has also attracted
attention.
Venezuela was the worst performer on the IFC table last month, losing 26.3
per cent in dollar terms. The market has been depressed by political
uncertainty following a failed coup and a run on the bolivar. Pressure on
the currency has eased, but Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities
remains cautious about the market which he says is vulnerable to speculators
and any changes in the political situation.
The worst performer in the first quarter in dollar terms was Turkey, which
fell 26.4 per cent, followed by Pakistan which dropped 23 per cent.

FT  15 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Michelin jumps 6.8 per cent as
loss shrinks in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were generally firmer as Michelin's results gave a boost to
Continental of Germany, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS concentrated on individual stocks, Michelin and TF1 in particular. The
CAC-40 index closed 9.04 higher at 1,972.31, in heavy turnover of FFr3.2bn
which reflected healthy domestic buying.
Michelin jumped FFr11.60 or 6.8 per cent to FFr181.30 on 1.6m shares after
reporting a better-than-expected result for 1991, during which net
attributable loss fell to FFr699m from FFr4.81bn the previous year. The tyre
manufacturer also said it needed to have a capital increase but did not say
when. Dealers said the new shares were likely to be issued between FFr180
and FFr200 which would put a limit on the share's upside.
Several blocks of shares amounting to 1.6 per cent of the television company
TF1's share capital were put through the market yesterday. The stock rose
FFr5.90 to FFr428.90 with 826,487 shares traded. Dealers said Mr Bernard
Tapie, the new urban affairs minister, was the likely seller.
Alcatel, which gave a presentation in London yesterday morning, added FFr14
to FFr633 on buying ahead of its issue of ADSs.
L'Oreal closed FFr10 up at FFr845 before announcing 1991 results at the top
end of expectations, as well as a 20 per cent increase in the dividend.
LVMH fell another FFr82 or 1.9 per cent to FFr4,291 on continued concerns
about its slowdown in sales in Japan.
FRANKFURT saw strong activity in the car sector after reports that prospects
for 1992 sales had improved. The DAX index closed up 4.79 at 1,732.53 and
the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 0.29 to 707.12. Turnover fell
to DM4.4bn from DM4.8bn.
County NatWest has reduced its 1992 forecast to a fall of 4 per cent in
German car registrations from 12 per cent previously. Sales in the first
quarter sales have been strong and it expects a rise in the second half to
beat a VAT increase.
Among car stocks, Volkswagen was up DM1.70 to DM370.70 while BMW advanced
DM2 to DM582.50. Daimler rose to a year's high of DM785.80 before falling
back on news that the European Commission was to seek repayment of DM33.8m
in state aid received for the purchase of a site in Berlin. Its shares
closed DM2.30 firmer at DM781.50.
Continental put on 3.4 per cent after positive news from rival tyremakers
Michelin of France and Goodyear of the US. Both companies reported improved
prospects for 1992. Continental closed up DM8.60 at DM263.00
Siemens was actively traded following a buy note from Deutsche Bank which
forecast that Earnings Per Share will rise in 1993 to DM53 from an estimated
DM45 this year and DM43 in 1991. Siemens advanced DM4.60 to DM684.20, but
off an intraday high of DM686.
Altana, which said that it expects a 6 per cent increase in group sales in
1992, gained DM7 to DM700.
MILAN drifted lower ahead of the close of the April trading account today.
Dealers said that a rise in interest rates by some banks dampened the
market. The Comit index fell 1.63 to 499.16 in turnover estimated at less
than Monday's L66.6bn. Dealers said that 80 per cent of the monthly call
options were abandoned on Monday so there was little selling pressure
yesterday.
Generali and Mediobanca were the day's few gainers. Generali added L90 to
L28,800, while Mediobanca, which revealed that it now held a 12.8 per cent
stake in the insurer, gained L60 to L13,300.
Trading in Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura was suspended twice because of
an order imbalance on the sell side following news that the bank's
non-performing loans had risen 6.2 per cent to L802bn. But the stock finally
closed at L4,650, down just L100, as friendly parties came to its defence.
The Consob was due to meet yesterday to discuss additions to the
screen-based trading system. Another 25 stocks are expected to be listed by
July.
ZURICH rose in quiet trade with gains in the chemical sector helped by the
stronger dollar. The SMI index advanced 13.2 to 1,853.8.
Roche certificates put on SFr40 to SFr3,150 and Ciba-Geigy registered shares
were up SFr10 at SFr3,460.
Georg Fischer bearers rose SFr15 to SFr965 after the group announced a 11
per cent rise in first quarter sales and said that it planned further
cost-cutting measures in 1992.
AMSTERDAM rose slightly with little news to excite interest. The CBS
Tendency Index closed up 0.6 at 125.5 in turnover of Fl 439m.
Amev, which reports 1991 earnings today, gained 60 cents to Fl 56.
BRUSSELS closed higher, as the Bel-20 index rose 5.50 to 1,184.21. Petrofina
gained BFr25 to BFr10.500.

FT  15 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on
index-linked buying
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
THE Nikkei average closed higher after a volatile session dominated by
index-linked activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index finally closed up 202.93 at 17,439.58. It fell below the
17,000 mark in the morning on arbitrage unwinding, declining to the day's
low of 16,879.97, but later rose in the afternoon on index-linked buying and
bargain-hunting, reaching the day's high of 17,607.69.
Volume fell to 250m shares from 280m. Advances outnumbered declines by 563
to 411, with 160 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 19.19 to 1,288.80. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
rose 5.45 to 1,047.22.
Traders said the volatility was caused by last week's increase in margins on
Nikkei 225 stock futures transactions by the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange. Futures trading on Simex has been under criticism
recently for distorting the cash stock market in Tokyo. The initial margin
on futures trading on the Simex was raised from Y1m to Y1.25m, while
additional margin was raised from Y800,000 to Y1m.
Activity centred on speculative issues. Stocks with an Aids theme were
sought by short-term investors, with Okamoto, the condom maker, up Y120 to
Y1,180 and Meiji Milk Products advancing Y45 to Y775. Speculative favourites
also firmed, with Nippon Carbon surging Y100 to Y651.
Bank shares were higher on short-covering. Industrial Bank of Japan added
Y100 to Y1,710 and Mitsubishi Bank rose Y150 to Y1,750.
Sega Enterprises, the video game manufacturer, fell Y110 to Y8,840,
following Monday's Y1,000 plunge. Investors sold the issue on a US court
finding against Sega for alleged patent infringement. Market participants
sought Nintendo, Sega's rival, which added Y290 to Y9,600.
High-technology issues were higher on small-lot bargain hunting by
individuals and foreigners. Fujitsu rose Y20 to Y680 and Sony advanced Y30
to Y4,110.
Car stocks were mixed: Nissan Motor fell Y8 to Y590, while Honda Motor rose
Y50 to Y1,630 on active buying. Traders said that rumours that an US car
group was accumulating Honda shares triggered speculative activity. Mr
Andrew Blair-Smith, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the company's large
exposure to the US following an expected upturn in the US car market, also
encouraged investors.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 238.94 to 19,344.30 in volume of 13.4m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday. Bombay was closed.
HONG KONG closed weaker with the announcement by HSBC Holdings of its merger
terms for Midland Bank of the UK coming after the market had closed. HSBC
ended 25 cents down at HKDollars 39.25. The Hang Seng index declined 5.61 to
4,883.53 in turnover of HKDollars 1.52bn.
SINGAPORE finished higher but trading was quiet in the absence of corporate
news. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 3.46 to 1,377.32 in volume of
19.8m shares.
SEOUL fell slightly. The composite index lost 2.63 to 575.56 in turnover of
Won252.88bn.
TAIWAN rose in early trading before falling back slightly. The weighted
index ended 56.54 higher at 4,461.98 in turnover of TDollars 17.56bn.
MANILA rose after the government announced it was cutting fuel prices. The
composite index gained 13.15 to 1,149.24 in turnover of 94.6m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR extended Monday's losses. The composite index fell 3.0 to
564.51 in volume of 24.1m shares.
AUSTRALIA fell slightly in quiet trade. The All Ordinaries index closed down
4.5 at 1,565.6 in turnover of ADollars 114.4m. Volume was 53.8m shares, the
lowest since January 1991.

FT  15 APR 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES firmed slightly across the board, despite sterling's steady climb
against the D-Mark.
The markets were increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of a rate cut
and marked the key three-month interbank rate up from 10 3/8 per cent
yesterday to 10 1/2 per cent. 'Even though the currency continued to
strengthen . . . the market will wait until sterling is closer to the
central rate (of the EMS) before it goes bananas about a rate cut,' said one
trader.
The June short sterling contract on the futures exchange held steady at its
opening level of 89.81, implying a base rate of 10.19 per cent. This was a
touch higher than the rate implied by the 89.85 level at last night's close.
The rates were pushed firmer, partly by the large shortage left in the
market at the end of the day.
Market players had opposing views as to the motives behind the shortage.
Some suggested the Bank of England had deliberately refrained from generous
market operations to dampen Monday's brief enthusiasm over a rate cut.
However, those in the discount houses said the Bank had been prepared to
take all the paper that was offered. The problem had been that traders were
either not prepared or unable to sell the bills. One suggested that market
players might be holding on to bills to get maximum profits from the
forthcoming four-day Easter weekend, when the Bank might have to hold on to
paper for a bit longer.
The initial forecast for a shortage of Pounds 1.65bn was revised to Pounds
1.75bn.
The central bank made an early round of offers with Pounds 249m taken up by
the market. The Bank purchased bands one, three and four bills, and band
four local authority paper at rates of 10 3/8 , 10 5/32 , and 10 1/16 per
cent. Later dealings resulted in Pounds 264m assistance, comprised of band
one and four bank bills at 10 3/8 and 10 1/16 per cent. A nominal repurchase
agreement of Pounds 14m falling due on May 5 was pitched at 10 7/16 per
cent.
The Bank took just Pounds 491m of the shortage out after lunch, while late
assistance of Pounds 360m left the market with an estimated Pounds 390m
shortage.
In Germany, call rates held firm at 9.65 per cent despite the injection of
emergency funds by the Bundesbank. In the US, Federal funds traded at 3 3/4
per cent, on par with the new presumed target.

FT  15 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling holds centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING was riding high yesterday on the back of better than expected UK
statistics, reports Peggy Hollinger.
February manufacturing output, forecast to have been flat, jumped by 1.1 per
cent.
This helped sterling to nudge the DM2.92 level in the morning, although it
closed 50 points down at DM2.9125, due to profit-taking late in the day.
Traders said, however, that a strong underlying demand remained for
sterling.
Demand was fuelled by the strong market sentiment that British authorities
would not rush to cut rates, at least not before sterling moved above
DM2.95. This is the point at which sterling moves into the narrow band of
the exchange rate mechanism.
Noises coming from European central bankers meeting in Basle helped to
reinforce this view on UK rates, said Dr Gerard Lyons, economist with DKB
International.
The Committee of European Central Bankers had supported the Bundesbank's
efforts to maintain a tight monetary policy, encouraging the view that
German rates would remain high for some time to come. Since German monetary
policy is often cited as the key to European rate moves, the 'message for
sterling is that rates will remain firm', said Dr Lyons.
The D-Mark slowed its slide against other currencies supported by the views
on stable German rates.
The currency held steady against the yen at Y80.45 per D-Mark and fell just
one pfennig against the dollar to close at DM1.6445.
The dollar had an uncertain day, with depressed retail sales figures
bringing a recent strong run of economic indicators to an end. The market
was beginning to take the view that economic recovery in the US would be
sluggish, said Dr Lyons. This was likely to be reflected in further
statistics due out this week, such as industrial production.
Dollar trading was muted ahead of the Easter weekend, said Mr Nick Parsons
of CIBC. He added that there was no incentive to have a strategic position
on the dollar vs D-Mark, given the uncertainty surrounding events in Russia.
The yen continued to enjoy a measure of stability despite the Nikkei's
troubles. The markets appear to be taking the view that Japanese banks will
have to repatriate foreign assets to meet capital requirements. Although
this is not yet happening, said Dr Lyons, the market view was having some
effect. The yen closed slightly stronger in London at Y132.75 against the
dollar, compared with Y133.25.
Within the ERM, sterling kept its distance from the floor at the expense of
the Danish Kroner. The peseta continued to rise on the coat tails of
sterling, and strengthened against the D-Mark from Pta 62.62 to Pta 62.57.

FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK milk board submits plan to
become co-op
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILK Marketing Board for England and Wales yesterday submitted to the
government its proposals to become a single voluntary co-operative with
pooled prices.
The UK Agriculture Ministry late last year began to increase pressure on the
MMB to reform itself, and set an Easter deadline for plans to be submitted.
Once past the ministry the proposal will go before the European Commission.
The MMB plans, originally announced in January, include spinning off Dairy
Crest, its wholly-owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent share of the UK's
manufactured dairy products market. Shares in Dairy Crest will be
transferred to dairy farmers on the basis of milk supplied in the past over
a given period.
Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the MMB, said: 'Implementation of our proposal is
subject to discussion with the Dairy Trade Federation, Maff (the ministry)
and UK regulatory bodies and the EC. We will do all we can to avoid
unnecessary delays to achieve our objectives'.
The DTF, which represents dairies and processors, welcomed 'the end of
uncertainty', but said that any changes to the MMB 'must lead to a genuinely
free market in raw milk'.

GOLD declined on the London bullion market as profit taking set in after the
release of the US retail sales data, which was exactly in line with
forecasts. News that the Russian Congress had approved in principle a
declaration that would allow the government's radical economic reforms to
continue was seen as mildly bearish. Rising political tension between the
Congress and President Yeltsin's government had been seen as supportive for
gold. PLATINUM futures on Nymex were lower at midday as the market braced
for more selling by Japanese investors, analysts said. Light selling by the
Japanese overnight was enough to keep the metal in the doldrums. A decline
in GM car sales from April 1 to 10 also undercut sentiment. On the LME
ALUMINIUM lost ground in the afternoon as an early rise to a nine-month high
of Dollars 1,373 a tonne for three-month metal proved unsustainable. New
York arabica COFFEE futures were mostly firmer at midday. However, analysts
said coffee remained under siege, citing disappointment that the ICO last
week did not hammer out a new price-supporting pact, high supplies and a
seasonal decline in consumption.

crop in years

<TEXT>
CUBA IS straining to finish what could be its worst sugar harvest in recent
years because it says it needs every tonne to help keep its crisis-hit
economy afloat, reports Reuter from Havana.
After maintaining a virtual news blackout on the 1991-1992 sugar crop for
five months, the Caribbean island's government is now making the harvest a
national public issue. 'Our sole option. . . is not to lose a single tonne
of sugar,' it said.
The government urged the country's sugar workers to make a maximum effort
over the next few weeks, a message reinforced by daily television propaganda
spots focusing on the harvest.
The official media describe the current season as one of the most difficult
ever experienced by Cuba, which has traditionally been the world's biggest
exporter of sugar.
The 1991-1992 harvest started late and has been bedevilled by shortages of
oil, lubricants and spare parts that are essential to keep mechanical
harvesters and mills running.
Adding to the urgency is the possible onset of spring rains in May which
could disrupt a late-finishing harvest.
Even more worrying for Cuba, the difficulties come at a time when it needs
every tonne of sugar it can produce to exchange for vital imports of oil,
machinery spares and food.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Bonds: Cool reception for Austrian offering
amid heavy CDollars issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BATCH of new issues in Canadian dollars dominated activity in the Eurobond
market yesterday. Also, two more UK companies tapped the sterling market,
still buoyant after last week's election win for the Conservative party.
The three Canadian dollar Eurobonds, totalling CDollars 525m, met a mixed
reception. A CDollars 250m 10-year offering for the Republic of Austria was
widely criticised for its aggressive pricing. The bonds, launched by
Paribas, were priced to yield 30 basis points above the 10-year Canadian
government bond, as much as 10 basis points too tight, according to dealers.
The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate yen.
There is little outstanding 10-year paper in the sector, making the deal
more difficult to price. Paribas also pointed out that Austria had no
outstanding paper in the Canadian dollar sector, adding some rarity value to
the transaction.
But the deal suffered by comparison with another 10-year offering, by the
Municipality of Toronto. The CDollars 125m deal via RBC Dominion Securities
was priced to yield 87 basis points above the 10-year Canadian government
bond. The deal met strong demand from European fund managers, and was sold
out by the end of the day.
However, Ontario-Hydro's global offering of 10-year bonds is currently
trading at 90 basis points over the curve, and it would have been difficult
to price Toronto far inside that spread, traders said.
The half-point yield differential between Toronto and Austria, both triple-A
rated, highlighted the aggressive pricing of the latter. Nevertheless,
Paribas said the deal had met reasonable demand to close 99.72 bid, just
below its fixed reoffer level of 99.78.
Also in the sector, Mobil Oil Canada launched a CDollars 150m five-year deal
via Goldman Sachs, priced at 62 basis points above the Canadian government
bond yield curve. The deal is expected to take a while to place, since it is
aimed at retail as well as institutional investors.
In the sterling sector, John Lewis launched a Pounds 100m six-year deal via
NatWest Capital Markets. It met strong demand from UK investors, who are
familiar with the credit and therefore not deterred by the lack of an
official rating. The deal was priced at 79 basis points above the 9 3/4 per
cent gilt due 1998. The proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance
borrowings under a multiple option facility which matures in the following
year.
A Pounds 125m long-dated issue for P&amp;O arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd
also met demand mainly from UK institutions.
For both companies, the rally in the gilts market following the election
brought their funding target levels within reach. A number of other UK
companies are also eyeing the market, as absolute funding levels fall.
However, unattractive swap rates are likely to continue to deter
non-sterling based borrowers.
Meanwhile, a Dollars 100m convertible bond offering for Korea's Samsung
Electronics met a less than enthusiastic reception. The poor performance of
east Asian stock markets deterred investors.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: French brokers incur losses
of FFr600m in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S stockbrokers experienced yet another year of heavy losses in 1991
because of low turnover and intense competition, according to the
Association Francaise des Societes de la Bourse.
The latest figures from the AFSB suggest that the 55 French stockbroking
firms made collective losses of FFr600m (Dollars 107.14m) last year. This
represents a slight improvement on the total losses of FFr666m in 1990.
All but a handful of France's stockbrokers, most of which are owned by the
big French banks or by foreign securities groups, are losing money. Even the
few profitable firms faced a difficult year in 1991.
Cholet Dupont, for instance, the subsidiary of the Credit Lyonnais banking
group, generally seen as one of the most successful players on the Paris
stock market, disclosed last week that its net profits had fallen to FFr34m
in 1991, from FFr51m in 1990.
One problem of the French stock markets is poor liquidity. The power of the
state - which continues to control large chunks of French industry and also
the pension and savings system - means there is not only a shortage of
tradable equity, but also of private sector investment.
The market is also weakened by the large number of broking firms chasing the
limited pool of business. A number of heavily loss-making brokers are
supported by powerful parent companies, notably the French banks, thereby
weakening the whole industry.
Last year, the French brokers were spared any debacles as serious as the
collapse of Tuffier, one of the most prominent Paris brokers, in 1990.
However, many firms were forced to cut costs and shed staff in an attempt to
stem losses. There were 480 job losses in French broking, as the workforce
fell from 5,340 to 4,860.
The outlook seems a little brighter, given that the French government's
plans to sell off minority stakes in some state companies and to reform the
pension system should help to alleviate the liquidity problem. The AFSB also
advocates the abolition of the tax on share dealings.

CHRISTIANIA Bank and Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's two biggest banks, were
not likely to break even in 1992, according to a report by Moody's Investor
Services, the US-based debt rating company.
Last year Christiania was acquired by the government when its share capital
was wiped out. DnB also received a massive state cash injection, but is
still at risk to a government takeover because of high losses.
Moody's says although the government's measures would be vital in sustaining
the banks' debt ratings, in the near term they did not insure that
Christiania and DnB would 'find it easy to bolster basic financial
fundamentals and begin to restore equity'.
Christiania has senior debt obligations rated A3 by Moody's and DnB senior
at A2.
Last year Christiania suffered net losses of NKr9.17bn (Dollars 1.4bn)
against NKr1.85bn. Credit losses more than doubled to NKr5.99bn from
NKr2.68bn.
DnB saw net losses swell three-fold to NKr4.32bn, as credit losses ballooned
by NKr1.77bn to NKr5.58bn.
To qualify for state support, both banks agreed to seek a break-even result,
after credit losses, in 1992. They are also subject to more regulation.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Sweet scent of success in
L'Oreal's figures - The French cosmetics company's 19.7% rise in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every L'Oreal executive is a 'professional worrier' according to Mr Lindsay
Owen-Jones, the chairman.
This time last year he and his colleagues looked as though they had a lot to
worry about. The world's largest cosmetics company not only faced the
short-term pressures of the economic slowdown and the upheaval of the Gulf
war, but the longer term threat of fierce competition from powerful
companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Kao and Shiseido which were
all expanding within cosmetics.
Despite this L'Oreal has emerged unscathed. Yesterday it reported a 19.7 per
cent increase in net profits for 1991 on sales which rose by 10.2 per cent.
Mr Owen-Jones sees this achievement as a vindication of the aggressive
strategy L'Oreal has pursued since he became chairman almost five years ago.
Something of an anomaly in the French business world, at 46 he is much
younger than most of his counterparts. And, as a Welshman, he is one of the
very few foreigners to have broken into the nepotistic ranks of France's top
industrialists.
When he became chairman of L'Oreal, with its 80-year history, it was
established as a bastion of French industry and as a powerful player in the
global cosmetics market. It has since become markedly more aggressive
through a combination of rigorous cost control - the number of employees has
risen by 1 per cent during five years of average annual sales growth of 12
per cent - and increased investment in research and marketing.
'For the past five years we have had very tight cost control in all areas,'
said Mr Owen-Jones. 'That has not only helped us to improve short-term
profits but has enabled us to increase our long-term investment in research
and advertising."
Research has always been central to L'Oreal, which has historically devoted
3 per cent of sales - twice the cosmetics industry average  - to it. That
proportion has risen under Mr Owen-Jones to reach 3.2 per cent last year.
Mr Owen-Jones has also stepped up L'Oreal's investment in marketing to
increase market share, thereby making the most of the economies of scale
inherent in the capital intensive cosmetics industry. Tresor, the new
Lancome fragrance, has been lavishly promoted since its launch two years ago
and is now one of the world's top five perfumes.
The pressure on L'Oreal's research and marketing budgets seems set to
intensify in the future. The level of legislative intervention in the
cosmetics industry is increasing. Moreover L'Oreal's new competitors,
notably P&amp;G and Unilever, have historically been more aggressive in both
research and marketing.
Mr Owen-Jones claims the impact of P&amp;G and Unilever's expansion has been
exaggerated. 'There is a well-entrenched myth that this industry has not
been competitive in the past,' he said. 'There has always been strong
competition. It is just that the names of the competitors have changed."
But most observers are convinced that the level of competition in cosmetics
is increasing thanks to the larger scale and professional management style
of the new players.
L'Oreal has been expanding - so far with mixed results. L'Oreal, which has
no debt, is clearly in a position to make further acquisitions or
investments, should suitable opportunities arise.
In the meantime Mr Owen-Jones sees its biggest challenge as proving that
'being a big company does not mean you can not be innovative. This is an
industry where things change very, very quickly. It is all about six people
sitting around a table and saying 'Let's do it'.'

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Japan Tobacco enters the
overseas market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN Tobacco, the Japanese tobacco monopoly, has made its first
international acquisition with the purchase of The Manchester Tobacco
Company, a small British cigarette maker whose Kings and Regatta brands
account for about 1 per cent of the UK market.
Japan Tobacco is about 135 times bigger than Manchester, with 1990 sales of
Y2,701.8bn (Dollars 20.27bn) against about Pounds 89m (Dollars 153m) for the
British company last year.
It is putting Pounds 5m into the acquisition, including the purchase of
equity and a commitment to buy new equipment to improve the quality of the
operation. Mr Fursa Hogan, Manchester Tobacco chairman, will stay on as
managing director.
Although Japan Tobacco says its long-term strategy is to expand
internationally, this initial acquisition appears more like a test of the
waters rather than the opening gambit of a big expansion strategy. About 3.5
per cent of Japan Tobacco's production is exported.
The company said yesterday it had no plans to expand the Manchester
business, to increase exports, or to use the company to channel imports of
Japan Tobacco's best-selling Mild Seven brand.
The Japanese government plans a public offering of Japan Tobacco shares
later this year, although nothing concrete has been announced.
The structure of Japan Tobacco was changed from a government bureau to a
joint stock company in 1985, after which its financial performance has
improved considerably. The company reported profits of Y93.2bn, up 88 per
cent since the change in structure. Inventories of tobacco leaves have also
fallen sharply following a programme to reduce acreage.
The Japanese cigarette market has expanded in recent years after earlier
declines. In the six months to last September sales grew by 2.5 per cent,
compared with a year earlier, to 167bn cigarettes.
Imported cigarette sales have grown more quickly than domestic brands, and
now account for about 16 per cent of the market.
The company has diversified into a wide range of fields and has an extensive
research programme. Its research scientists recently discovered a chemical
substance that stimulates the portion of the brain that causes the sensation
of hunger.
The company has suggested that the substance may be used to treat anorexia
nervosa, and is already being used to fatten up geese to obtain livers used
to make pate de foie gras.

The group, with more than NZDollars 5bn of funds under management, is

not the last,' said Mr Graham Lewis, chief executive.
'We are looking ahead with confidence and optimism.'

YAMAICHI Securities, one of Japan's big four brokers, yesterday appointed Mr
Atsuo Miki, 56, to become its president in June this year.
The move comes at a time when Japanese securities houses have not been able
to restore their marred images from last year's stock scandals, and face
faltering profits due to the ongoing slump in the stock market.
Yamaichi is the only member of the big four - Nomura Securities, Daiwa
Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi - to project a pre-tax earnings
loss, the first since the company was restructured in the 1960s during a
stock market crisis. The company expects a pre-tax loss of Y34bn (Dollars
255m) and a net loss of Y52bn.
Mr Miki, currently vice-president of Yamaichi, will replace Mr Tsugio
Yukihira, who will become chairman. With Yamaichi's shift in management, all
of the presidents of the big four have been replaced within the past year.
Mr Miki said he intends to place special focus on staff education and retail
business to overcome current difficulties.

7.5bn of Nissan debt

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL troubles of Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest vehicle
maker, were yesterday underscored when Moody's Investor Service, the US
rating agency, lowered its credit rating for Dollars 7.5bn of Nissan debt.
Moody's said it expected Nissan's operating returns and other financial
measures would remain under pressure in the medium term. The downgrading
amounted to a conclusion that Nissan's corporate strategy for the past five
years - which included heavy spending to improve the product line-up - had
failed to deliver any financial benefits to the company.
Although Nissan has managed in Japan to polish its stodgy image among
consumers by launching a series of radically styled cars, other car
companies have followed a similar strategy and have neutralised any
potential benefit for Nissan. As a result its market share stopped declining
in Japan about five years ago, but has not improved.
Moody's said it did 'not expect Nissan to significantly strengthen its
market position in the coming years. As a result, Nissan's profitability and
cash generating ability, which have been pressured by soft market
conditions, are likely to remain depressed during the intermediate term.'
Moody's said Nissan's aggressive research and development and capital
investment have led to increased levels of debt. Nissan's capital structure
could be weakened further should the spending continue, unless Nissan finds
a way to improve cash generation.
Nissan none the less had strong balance sheet liquidity, with cash and
short-term investments of over Y800bn (Dollars 6bn), and large unrealised
gains on its short-term investment portfolio. As a result of these
considerations, Moody's lowered Nissan's long-term debt rating from A1 to
A2.

TADIRAN, a leading Israeli electronics company preparing for a Dollars 110m
stock offering in New York later this year, yesterday announced a net profit
of Dollars 30.2m in 1991, its first profit since 1986 when it lapsed into a
prolonged financial crisis.
The slump at Tadiran, which hit bottom with a Dollars 145m loss in 1989, was
an important factor in the parallel debt crisis at its parent, Koor
Industries, the big trade union-affiliated conglomerate which was rescued
from collapse by a restructuring and write-off deal with its creditors last
year.
Tadiran is now reaping the benefit of its expensive restructuring programme,
which accounted for most of its losses in the past three years. Although
total sales were down from Dollars 800m in 1990 to Dollars 726m last year,
the company said the underlying trend was ahead after the disposal of
subsidiaries was taken into account.
Half of sales were overseas, while products for civilian use accounted for
56 per cent, reflecting the shift away from Tadiran's traditional reliance
on the military sector.
The workforce was trimmed to 6,710 employees, down from more than 8,000 two
years ago. Sales per employee rose to Dollars 106,000, compared with Dollars
96,000 in 1990.
Bank debt was down by Dollars 74m to Dollars 171m.
Koor intends to capitalise on Tadiran's recovery by floating about one third
of its stock on one of the New York markets where a select band of Israeli
high-tech stocks have performed strongly recently.
Merrill Lynch has been appointed as lead underwriter.

<TEXT>
ALCOA of Australia yesterday blamed depressed metal prices for a 41 per cent
reduction in net profits to ADollars 64m (USDollars 49.2m) for the first
quarter to end March. Sales revenue was down 27 per cent to ADollars 478m.
The company said aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange rose by
USDollars 122 per tonne to an average of USDollars 1,266 during the quarter,
well down on the average price of USDollars 1,537 during the first quarter
of the previous year.
Mr Robert Sleagle, managing director, said there had been some improvement
in the company's US and European order books, and noted that metal
inventories in the hands of producers had fallen in March for the first time
in many months.
Mr Sleagle said the industry was 'still bouncing along the bottom'. He said
the company's first-quarter profit was adequate in the circumstances.
The directors said conditions in the industry were particularly difficult,
and forecast that it would be some time before conditions improved. As a
result, full-year profits would be below last year's level.
Alcoa paid a first-quarter dividend of ADollars 60m in March, compared with

Alcoa of Australia is 51 per cent owned by the Aluminium Company of America,
and 48.25 per cent by Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resources
group. The balance is owned by QBE Insurance.

<TEXT>
A RECOVERY in advertising revenue and lower newsprint costs helped The New
York Times to more than double net profits to Dollars 13.9m in the first
three months of 1992.
The profits rise, which translates into earnings of 18 cents per share,
against 7 cents in the first quarter of 1991, was struck on revenues of
Dollars 440.4m, up by 5.6 per cent.
The company attributed the much higher 1992 advertising revenues in its
newspaper and magazine divisions partly to the weakness experienced during
the opening months of last year, when advertising in US media was generally
depressed by the mood associated with the war against Iraq.
Increased advertising rates also helped revenues.
The flagship New York Times, together with 32 regional papers and a 50 per
cent stake in the International Herald Tribune, turned in an operating
profit of Dollars 32.2m in the first quarter, up sharply from Dollars 18.6m
in the first quarter of 1991.
The group's magazines division made an operating profit of just under
Dollars 2m in the first quarter of 1992, compared with a Dollars 2.4m loss
in the same period last year.
The broadcasting and information services division of the group benefited
from higher advertising revenues and achieved operating income of Dollars
2.9m in the opening quarter of 1992, against Dollars 2m a year ago.
Net interest expenses declined to Dollars 6.5m in the first quarter, from
Dollars 7.9m for the same period a year ago.

ALCOA, the world's largest producer of aluminium, suffered a drop in profits
and revenue in the first quarter. It reported a decline in the quarter's
earnings to Dollars 76m, or 89 cents per share, from Dollars 97m, or Dollars
1.14 per share, last year.
Revenues were Dollars 2.3bn, down 7 per cent, from Dollars 2.4bn in the
first quarter of 1991.
Although shipments increased to 666,000 metric tons from 648,000 metric tons
a year ago, the first-quarter earnings decline reflects lower prices for
alumina, ingot and most fabricated aluminium products.
Alcoa said markets this year were not expected to improve until aluminium
from the former Soviet Union, which went to exports last year, was
redirected to internal uses and western economies improved.
First-quarter results included Dollars 8m, or 10 cents per share, from the
sale of investments in Venezuela. The comparative quarter in 1991 included
exchange and other adjustments of Dollars 10.2m, or 12 cents per share,
related to operations in Norway.
Return on shareholders' equity dropped to 6.1 per cent during the first
quarter, compared with 7.5 per cent last year. But the company said that,
excluding special charges in the fourth quarter of 1991, the first-quarter
results were better than those of the preceding period.
Alcoa said its effective tax rate for this year would be lower than in 1991,
before special charges, due largely to favourable settlements of prior
years' taxes by Alcoa Aluminnio in Brazil and tax law changes in Norway.
The company's earnings in 1991 fell 79 per cent to Dollars 62.7m as the
price for aluminium plunged to approximately 50 cents per pound, its lowest
in real terms.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the US group whose interests range from power systems to
financial services, unveiled a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter net
earnings, to Dollars 1.06bn from Dollars 999m a year earlier.
Earnings per share advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 1.23 from Dollars 1.15,
reflecting a five-year Dollars 10bn share repurchase programme. Revenues
grew 2 per cent to Dollars 13.5bn from Dollars 13.3bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said the company expected good results in 1992 in
spite of the continued fragility of the global economy. He cited an upturn
in US short-cycle order trends, continued productivity and improvements in
cash generation.
Mr Welch said the company's power systems, medical systems and financial
services operations had contributed to the improvement in the first quarter.
GE's NBC broadcasting operations also recorded better first-quarter results.
However, the recession's impact on short-cycle, high-margin business was
reflected in a decline in operating margins, to 11.7 per cent in the quarter
from 12.1 per cent.
Sharply higher underwriting and retail investor activity at Kidder Peabody,
its stockbroking arm, also contributed to the improvement.
First-quarter operating profits fell in GE's aircraft engines, aerospace,
appliances and materials businesses. In addition, the group's industrial
operating profit was much lower, reflecting a drop in first-quarter
locomotive shipments and continuing recessionary pressure on electrical
distribution and control.

AMERITECH, one of the seven Baby Bells, said its first-quarter results
revealed signs that the Midwest's economy was emerging from the national
recession.
Its net income for the first quarter was Dollars 337m, up 19.1 per cent over
last year's Dollars 283m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.26 for the three
months ended March 31, compared with Dollars 1.07 a year ago.
Mr William Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said the rate of line growth was
improving and that customers were using the telephones more.
'We are increasingly optimistic that the Midwest economy is on the mend,' he
said.
Net income for the first quarter also included Dollars 28m, or about 10
cents per share, from interest income on a settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service.
Without the IRS settlement's interest, earnings per share were Dollars 1.16,
or an increase of 8.4 per cent.
Revenues for the quarter rose 2.4 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn and the number
of customer lines in service increased to 16.7m, or 2 per cent compared with
last year.
The number of mobile telephone customers shot up 34.8 per cent to 494,000
over the same period a year ago.
Ameritech had to postpone the release of its quarterly results until
yesterday because of flooding in Chicago on Monday, which also forced it to
move the venue of its annual meeting to its suburban offices.
Ameritech is the parent company of the Bell companies serving Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

BOISE CASCADE, the US forest products group, remained in the red during the
first three months of 1992, reporting an after-tax loss of Dollars 42.9m.
This compares with a Dollars 16.8m deficit in the same period a year

Boise, based in Idaho, blamed 'severely depressed prices' for some of its
key paper grades for the loss.
It said that prices for most grades of pulp and paper were down on a year
ago, while prices for its most important products fell 'substantially' from
already-depressed fourth quarter levels.
This latter category includes coated and uncoated business and printing
papers and newsprint.
Boise Cascade shares fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20 5/8 .

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Nikkei decline triggers warning
on Japan banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE banking industry leader yesterday expressed concern that the
country's hard-pressed banks would face difficulties meeting international
standards for capital adequacy.
The recent plunge in the Tokyo stock market would make it difficult for
Japanese banks to meet rules set down by the Bank for International
Settlements, said Mr Kenichi Suematsu, chairman of the Federation of
Bankers' Associations of Japan.
Mr Suematsu's comments, although cautiously framed, were a blunt assessment
of Japanese banks' prospects of meeting standards that will come into effect
in March 1993.
Under BIS rules, Japanese banks are allowed to count as capital a portion of
unrealised gains on stock portfolios. However, the fall in equities has
wiped away much of these profits.
The Nikkei index of leading shares closed yesterday at 17,439.58, up 202.93
points, but down more than 50 per cent from its peak.
Mr Suematsu, who is also president of Sakura Bank, said that banks would be
likely to meet the BIS standard of an 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio -
as long as the Nikkei rebounded to 20,000.
However, banks could not reach a ratio of 8.5 per cent - allowing a margin
of safety - unless the Nikkei recovered to 23,000.
Asked whether banks would cut loans to meet BIS standards, Mr Suematsu said
it was more natural for banks to try to increase capital and to attempt to
cut assets other than loans - for example, currency-dealing operations.
He added that the current weak demand for loans in Japan was helping banks
reach their desired ratios.
Mr Suematsu's remarks beg the question of what might happen if banks fail to
meet BIS ratios. The international agreement covering capital adequacy
carries no sanctions and is not binding on the countries that signed it, let
alone on individual banks. It is left to the regulatory authorities in each
country to decide what to do with banks that fail to meet the standards. In
Japan, this means the Ministry of Finance.
Given the complexity of the rules determining how to account for assets and
capital, the ministry has some flexibility. However, it could not bend
regulations blatantly since this could arouse complaints from other
countries. It would also undermine confidence in the banks - and so be
counter-productive.
However, as IBCA, a London-based rating agency, says in a report it would be
in nobody's interest for the Ministry of Finance to become 'rigidly
doctrinaire' and demand that banks should reach BIS standards whatever the
cost.
To a large extent, BIS has already achieved its purpose in devising the
ratios. The mere publication of the data has forced banks to be more prudent
in managing their assets - well before the rules formally come into effect.
US and European banks, which hoped the rules would curb the runaway
international expansion of Japanese banks, have also seen their aim
fulfilled, albeit more drastically than they had expected.

FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Michelin cuts loss to FFr699m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre maker, yesterday saw its shares rise
sharply after it announced a hefty reduction in net losses to FFr699m in
1991, from FFr4.81bn (Dollars 858m) in 1990.
The group, which late last year 'rewarded' its shareholders for their
loyalty through a period of losses by giving them free warrants, returned to
profit at the operating level last year with operating profits of FFr780m,
against losses of FFr1.13bn for 1990.
Michelin attributed the improvement in its performance to a radical
restructuring programme - including tighter stock control and job losses -
accompanied by price rises and lower raw material costs. The company's
shares firmed FFr11.60 to FFr181.30 on the Paris stock market,
It reduced its workforce by 8,500 in 1991, as part of a two-year programme
intended to shed 16,000 jobs. The group also reduced investment from FFr12bn
in 1990 to FFr3.9bn in 1991 and brought its stock levels down to 22.5 per
cent of turnover, well below its target of 25 per cent.
The cost of restructuring fell from FFr3.44bn in 1990 to FFr1.42bn last
year. Michelin has now made full provision for its restructuring programme,
so no further cost should be incurred.
Michelin, in common with its competitors, suffered from the impact of the
economic slowdown on demand for tyres and from the problems of its customers
in the motor industry.
Group turnover rose to FFr67.65bn from FFr62.74bn during the year, but this
was due to the first full contribution from Uniroyal-Goodrich in the US.
The underlying level of sales growth was 2.2 per cent, as a slight
improvement in demand from consumers - and higher prices  - compensated for
reduced sales to motor manufacturers.
Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said the tyre business
had got off to a 'good start' in 1992, with the first quarter showing an
improvement over the same period in 1991, when demand was disrupted by the
Gulf war. Volume sales of tyres fell by 3 per cent in 1991.
Michelin managed to reduce its debt by FFr700m to FFr27.8bn last year.
Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere signalled that the group may try to raise
capital to accelerate debt reduction. This served to confirm long-standing
stock market speculation that Michelin might be forced to stage a rights
issue.

SOCIETE Generale, one of France's biggest private sector banks, returned to
profits growth last year with net profits rising by 25.8 per cent to
FFr3.37bn (Dollars 601m), from FFr2.68bn in 1990.
The result from the group, which recorded a fall in profits in the previous
year because of a steep increase in provisions on debts and securities,
comes towards the end of a season of mixed results from the French banking
sector.
Banque Nationale de Paris also reported a return to profits growth for 1991
after a difficult year in 1990. However, Paribas, the investment banking
group, posted its first loss of FFr200m in 1991, and last week Credit
Lyonnais announced a fall in profits after a dramatic increase in client
risk provisions from FFr4.2bn to FFr9.5bn.
Societe Generale, after sustaining a sharp rise in write-offs to FFr6.79bn
in 1990, managed to reduce its provisions by 19.1 per cent to FFr5.49bn in
1991. The balance sheet total increased by 8.6 per cent to FFr1.22bn during
the year, from FFr1.12bn.
The bank said yesterday that, 'despite the difficult economic environment'
last year, it had benefited from a strong performance from its market
trading activities and from its operations in New York and Tokyo.
The general level of demand for credit in France was dampened last year by
high interest rates, but Societe Generale said that demand from commercial
customers had been higher than that from individuals.
The group's net banking income rose by 9 per cent to FFr35.41bn from
FFr32.49bn, and gross profits increased 16.4 per cent to FFr10.51bn, from
FFr9.03bn.
Societe Generale saw gross profits from its domestic banking interests rise
to FFr5.7bn from FFr5.3bn, and from its international interests to FFr2.6bn
from FFr1.6bn .
The property management division made static gross profits of FFr500m, and
the group's income from market trading moved from a loss of FFr300m into
gross profits of FFr600m. The specialist financial division saw gross
profits fall to FFr1.8bn from FFr2.1bn .
The board proposed holding the dividend, for the third year in succession,
at FFr15 a share. Societe Generale's 'A' shares were stable yesterday at
FFr533.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jan Erik Langangen, the president of the Norwegian insurer Uni
Storebrand, yesterday gave further details of his planned international
expansion programme.
He said that if approval was granted for the newly announced deal with
Skandia, Sweden's leading insurance company, he would seek an international
partner or raise up to NKr1bn (Dollars 155m) in fresh equity before the end
of 1993 to expand the group's international reinsurance business.
As part of the deal, announced last Thursday, Skandia would acquire Hafnia,
the troubled Danish insurer. A new company - Christiania International
Insurance - would then be created, combining the international business of
Uni Storebrand and non-US reinsurance business of Skandia.
Christiania International would become one of the world's leading
reinsurers, the Uni Storebrand president said.
Uni's acquisition of Skandia's non-US reinsurance business represents
tangible and liquid assets valued at NKr3bn.
Mr Langangen explained that the acquisition also represented an additional
NKr1bn in 'embedded value' from Skandia's life reinsurance portfolio and
from the net present value of investment income related to Skandia's non-US
reinsurance business.
Embedded value comprises shareholders' net equity assets and the present
value of future surpluses - net of taxes  - expected to arise from the
existing portfolio of the life insurance business.
According to the terms of the deal, Uni is exchanging 18.2m Skandia shares
valued at an estimated Nkr4bn for the Skandia assets which are valued at
about the same.
Mr Langangen said all risk attached to business written before June 30 this
year would remain with Skandia. 'This means that Uni Storebrand has acquired
an option for Skandia's non-US reinsurance market positions. Since the
financial transaction provides full coverage for the shares, the strategic
transaction can be seen as free of charge for Uni Storebrand,' he said.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Expanded Farnell slightly lower at Pounds
33m - Manufacturing demand down as companies reduce spending on capital
equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in interest income led to Farnell Electronics reporting a slight
decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 32.7m, for the year
to February 2.
The electronic equipment distributor received interest payments of Pounds
500,000 compared with Pounds 3.8m because of its recent acquisition of STC's
distribution division for Pounds 61m.
A further Pounds 3m was spent on buying Cayson Engineering.
In the first seven months STC contributed Pounds 5m to operating profits
which rose to Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 30m) on sales of Pounds 205m (Pounds
164m).
Farnell's main division, electronic component distribution, increased its
pre-tax profit by 28 per cent, from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 30.5m. Margins
increased as less customers made use of the discount for larger volumes.
Electronic equipment manufacturing saw its pre-tax profits fall from Pounds
7.03m to Pounds 2.52m. Demand from the division's biggest customers, such as
BT and IBM, was significantly down on the previous year. 'There has been
marked reluctance from companies to spend on capital equipment', said Mr
Raymond Kidd, chairman.
Last year's net cash of Pounds 29.5m has been transformed into borrowings of
Pounds 13m associated with the group's acquisition of STC. Gearing has been
reduced from 36 per cent, when STC was acquired in July, to 17 per cent.
Earnings per share increased to 16.5p (16.3p). A recommended final dividend
of 3.2p makes a total of 5.8p (5.5p).
Mr Richard Hanwell, who joined the board as a non-executive director in
January, is to succeed Mr Kidd as chairman in August when he retires at the
end of his service contract.
COMMENT
These were better results than analysts had forecast, which has become
something of a rare event in the last year. Farnell's acquisition of STC's
distribution division, questioned by some commentators at the time who
feared the company had paid too much, is beginning to look the good buy the
company said it was after contributing Pounds 5m operating profits in the
first seven months. With the lossmaking German enterprise in mind there is
bound to be some uneasiness over the group's decision to expand its European
operations. A sales office has opened in the Netherlands with France tipped
as the next country for Farnell's continental expansion. The group has,
however, halved the loss at its German business, from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds
800,000. With forecasts of pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.5m, the shares are
on a prospective multiple of 15.7, slightly above the sector average. The
shares still look undemanding.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cronite receives Pounds 7.3m agreed cash
bid from French engineer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRONITE GROUP, the Birmingham-based engineer and steel stockholder, has
received a Pounds 7.3m cash offer from AFE, a quoted French engineering
company.
The offer is being recommended by most of the board, except for Mr David
Pinsent, a former chairman of the company.
He said the offer was untimely and did not fully value the company. It
disregarded the potential benefits of closing loss-making subsidiaries and
the reduction in debt following the Pounds 3.5m sale of Cronite Steels.
He advised shareholders to reject the offer and said he would be writing to
them.
The majority of the directors said that there were limits to the growth
which could be achieved on the back of an improvement in the UK economy and
increasing exports.
They added that it was likely that any large expansion would require
investment. Becoming part of a larger group would enhance the prospects for
development.
AFE is offering 45p a share and has received undertakings to accept in
respect of 2.4m shares or 14.8 per cent of the equity. Cronite's shares rose
15p to close at 44p.
In the year to September 30 pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.22m
profits) on turnover of Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 46.7m). Gearing at the year end
was 117 per cent.
Following closure of loss-making businesses the company expects to return to
profits in the present year.

Metsec staged an improvement to finish 1991 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds
257,000, after recording Pounds 285,000 in the opening half. The dividend is
held at 6.4p as directors feel that prospects are good.
The loss came from turnover of Pounds 79.8m, and compared with a profit of
Pounds 4.15m on sales of Pounds 83.2m previously.
USM-traded Metsec, which serves the building products, electronic products,
engineering and construction industries, started 1992 with an upward trend
in order books and increasing profitability in overall performance, reported
Mr Keith Hirst, chairman.
The loss-making businesses of 1991 had either been closed or were operating
at break-even or better this year. They would only be maintained where
present performance could be improved during 1992 and good recovery
potential was present.
Losses per share were 2.07p (earnings 17.18p). The proposed final dividend
is 3.7p.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Tight control helps Shani lift margins
London Page 23
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tight control of overheads and production costs enabled Shani Group to
produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 770,000 for the half year to January 31
1992, compared with Pounds 764,000.
This USM-traded maker of women's and children's clothes saw its margins
increase as turnover fell from Pounds 5.92m to Pounds 5.09m. Liquidity
during the period remained healthy.
Earnings per share improved to 3.6p (3.5p) and the interim dividend is again
1.6p.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Herring Baker static with Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Herring Baker Harris, the chartered surveyor, increased turnover by 6 per
cent and pre-tax profit by 1 per cent in the year to January 31.
The figures did not include any contribution from Baker Harris Saunders,
with which Herring merged in January.
Turnover came out at Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 12.7m) and pre-tax profit at
Pounds 3.51m (Pounds 3.49m). Mr Nick Owen, chairman, said: 'The property
industry has been a disaster area for unwary investors. Against that
backdrop these results are an outstanding achievement.'
Benefits came from 'the geographical spread and an exceptionally strong
professional work load.' Across the country the first benefits of work from
the 1990 rating revaluation had been seen.
Earnings per share declined to 19.16p (19.47p). The proposed final dividend
is 3.75p for a total of 7p (6.5p).

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Erith cuts dividend as profits slide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ERITH, the builders' merchants, just stayed in profit for 1991. It is
cutting the total dividend from 3.9p to 2p.
Turnover fell to Pounds 67.5m (Pounds 77.7m) from which a pre-tax profit of
only Pounds 24,000 (Pounds 2.24m) was generated. The group's problems were
aggravated by a bad and doubtful debts provision of Pounds 1.7m,
representing 2.6 per cent of sales against a normal 0.4 per cent.
Mr Graham Davies, chairman, said the poor result came despite a stringent
cost-reduction programme during the most difficult year for the building and
construction industry.
Earnings per share reached only 0.09p (3.83p). The recommended final
dividend is cut from 2.6p to 0.7p.
Mr Davies will retire as chairman on May 21, at the conclusion of the annual
meeting. Mr Bryan Castledine will become chairman and managing director.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Henry Boot marches ahead to Pounds 6.77m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of depressed conditions across its activities, Henry Boot &amp; Sons,
the Sheffield-based construction and property group, reported a satisfactory
performance from all divisions in the 1991 year.
Pre-tax profits showed a 6 per cent advance, from Pounds 6.36m to Pounds
6.77m, and came from turnover down by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 129.9m.
Mr David Boot, chairman, said that in construction, competition had been
fierce throughout the year, but a reasonable performance had been achieved.
Despite over-capacity and depressed rates, plant hire had also remained
profitable.
Private housing development had seen difficult trading conditions persist
throughout the year. The average selling price of properties had risen to
Pounds 69,500 against Pounds 64,000.
In property development and investment sufficient earnings were generated
through rental income, land sales and mineral exploitation to produce a
satisfactory profit, Mr Boot added.
With cash reserves of Pounds 14.6m the group is well-placed to exploit
opportunities once the recession shows signs of abatement, Mr Boot said.
'There seemed to be a lack of political determination to improve either the
country's overall infrastructure or the climate generally for commercial and
residential developments and this did not augur well for the industry in the
immediate future', he said.
The final dividend is raised to 19.5p making a total of 27p (25p), payable
from earnings per share up from 76.1p to 91.9p.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: DacEasy buy behind Sage's rise to Pounds
4.34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAGE GROUP, the Newcastle-based business software company, yesterday
reported a 44 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.34m for the
six months to March 31, boosted by last year's large acquisition in the US.
The group said DacEasy of Dallas, which it bought in May for an initial
Dollars 18m (Pounds 10.4m), was trading ahead of budget and increased its
profits by 62 per cent, contributing Pounds 1.4m.
Sage shares rose 31p to 484p.
The enlarged group's turnover rose by 85 per cent to Pounds 14.5m while
earnings per share grew to 14.5p (11.6p) on share capital enlarged by last
year's rights issue.
Sage said the proportion of recurring revenues from sales of stationery,
software maintenance and training increased to 40 per cent of group sales.
Mr David Goldman, chairman, said: 'With around half of total sales arising
overseas and a large and increasing proportion of income arising from
recuring revenue, the group has become much less vulnerable to economic
conditions in the UK.'
UK software sales increased by 16 per cent in spite of the continuing
recession. The core UK business grew by 24 per cent, excluding MainLan,
which supplies software for PC networks. MainLan sales were down 42 per
cent, partly caused by a reduction in prices.
MainLan had come under strong competitive pressure. Overall, UK operating
margins fell from 38 per cent to 36 per cent, because of MainLan and extra
staffing costs.
In the US, DacEasy showed sales growth of of 14 per cent. Profitability rose
because the higher sales had been achieved without any increase in
overheads, and operating margins in the much more fragmented US market rose
from 18 per cent to 25 per cent.
Losses at MainLan Inc had been reduced to Pounds 115,000. Last year all its
activities except sales were moved from Florida to DacEasy in Dallas and it
is intended to complete the consolidation of MainLan with DacEasy, to ensure
a return to profitability for the group's sales of network products.
The interim dividend is raised to 3.02p (2.7p). Sage said its balance sheet
remained strong, with end-period cash balances of Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.6m).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR GROUP, the aerospace and defence contractor, yesterday reported profits
marginally higher despite a tough year in its commercial components
division.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 21.4m on sales down
slightly to Pounds 168.4m.
Earnings per share rose from 20.07p to 20.12p and the final dividend is
raised to 4.35p, giving a total of 6.69p (6.37p).
The group was held back by delayed orders from the UK government but the
military systems division performed reasonably well.
Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said profits had been maintained as a
result of cost cutting, increased productivity and greater management
efficiency.
'Military spending is not going to be abolished and there is increasing
business to be done in the spheres of surveillance, training and air-to-air
refuelling,' he said.
FR Aviation increased sales and profits, winning contracts with the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries to provide surveillance of UK waters and with
the Ministry of Defence to continue target towing services.
FR's Mk32 air-to-air refuelling pod is now in production for the Royal Air
Force VC10 and the company is negotiating to supply a variant to the US Air
Force.
Flight refuelling, unmanned targets and special flying services now account
for about half of group sales and profits.
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 7.8m, up from Pounds 5.8m
but net interest earned fell Pounds 800,000.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Laird calls for Pounds 41m after 27% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAIRD GROUP yesterday reported profits down Pounds 10.5m after high start up
costs in Germany and Spain. The automotive supplier also announced a 1-for-4
rights issue at 220p to raise Pounds 41.4m for continued growth.
The market took the rights issue in its stride and Laird's shares rose 1p to
275p.
Laird said it had spent two years and Pounds 60m on investments in existing
businesses, including the two new plants supplying car door seals for new
Golf and Astra models and that further investment was planned.
It also planned to expand the computer and building industry divisions in
the UK and printing, packaging and plastics in the US.
Broadly in line with expectations, pre-tax profits fell 27 per cent, from
Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 28.4m on sales ahead 7 per cent at Pounds 523.8m.
The profits came after Pounds 3m of start up costs in Germany and Spain and
Pounds 2.2m for redundancy in France and the UK.
In sealing systems for cars, operating profits fell from Pounds 18m to
Pounds 13.8m reflecting lower demand in France, pressure on margins on seals
for older car models and some loss of sales as Volkswagen changed from the
old Golf to its new model.
Mr Ian Arnott, managing director, said Laird would this year enjoy the
benefit of higher market share and higher margins on sales of its new seals
from the new plants.
Profits in the services division were almost unchanged at Pounds 10.2m,
buoyed by continued rapid growth in the Fullarton Fabrication computer plant
in Scotland.
In the industrial products division, which includes the French auto supply
companies, profits fell from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 12.9m partly as a result
of the redundancies.
Earnings per share fell from 24.4p to 17.5p and a final dividend of 6.2p
gives a total of 10.2p (10p).
Mr Arnott said the rights issue would reduce gearing from a year-end level
of 44 per cent, up from a 40 per cent a year earlier, to the mid teens.
COMMENT
Laird's metamorphosis over 20 years from shipbuilding, through steel, to
transport systems and now to high-tech rubber and plastics for the auto
industry has been remarkable. Judging by the market's reaction to
yesterday's call for Pounds 41m to do more of the same, shareholders like
what they are getting. The company is increasing both market share and value
added in the European car market and so long as the industry keeps demanding
higher specification parts, shareholders will not be disappointed. Laird's
problem, if it has one, is that its auto side is so strong that efforts to
grow the 46 per cent of sales in non-auto to provide greater balance are
constantly hindered. That is not, however, an immediate problem. This year
the group is likely to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 39m, giving 21.3p of
earnings and an undemanding multiple of 13.

FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hammerson net asset value falls to 637p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMMERSON, the UK's third largest property group, yesterday announced that
its net asset value fell by 23 per cent, from 832p to 637p per share, in
1991.
Pre-tax profits fell 21 per cent, from Pounds 70.7m to Pounds 55.5m.
Although operating profits increased from Pounds 53.6m to Pounds 55.4m,
property trading profits fell from Pounds 17.1m to just Pounds 100,000.
An extraordinary item of Pounds 96.6m resulted principally from a write-off
against a development property in Fifth Avenue in New York.
Mr Sydney Mason, chairman, was cautious. 'The majority of the property
markets worldwide in which the group operates are experiencing the most
depressed conditions in living memory. The substantial oversupply of unlet
accommodation means that recovery will be slow and will lag by some time an
improvement in world economies,' he said.
Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 824m, which taken with the
fall in property values, resulted in an increase in gearing from 54 per cent
to 78 per cent.
UK net rental income rose by more than 12 per cent to Pounds 52.3m. Net
rental income overseas increased by 6 per cent.
The underlying value of the group's properties fell 15.9 per cent to Pounds
1.98bn at the year end.
Earnings per share fell 27 per cent from 31p to 22.5p. A final dividend of
17p makes an unchanged total of 20.5p.
COMMENT
Hammerson can rightly boast the best geographically diversified portfolio of
any UK property company, with strong cash flow, excellent tenants and a
relatively small development programme. But this is small comfort in the
world's worst property slump, as demonstrated by the 45 per cent fall in its
net asset value in the past two years. The deflation of property values will
probably continue this year, with analysts pencilling in a further 10 per
cent fall in net asset value. Canada, where Hammerson has 26 per cent of its
assets, is a particular concern thanks to the predicament of Olympia &amp; York,
the cash-strapped Canadian developer. The unfurling of O&amp;Y's problems,
combined with fears - which proved accurate  - about the asset values in
this set of results, has pushed Hammerson's share price down in recent days.
After a further 6p fall to 356p yesterday, the shares are on a discount to
net assets of 38 per cent, assuming a net asset value of 574p next year.
With such a yawning discount and a dividend yield of 8.4 per cent, there are
no compelling reasons to sell the shares. But given the depressed sentiment
towards property and the remote prospects of recovery, enthusiasm is in
equally short supply.

reflecting disposal of the loss-making paper activities, totalled just

Earnings per share dipped to 5.78p (9.06p). The final dividend is halved to
3p making 6p (9p).

Alexandra Workwear, Europe's largest workwear supplier, incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 500,000 over the 12 months to February 1.
The outcome - struck after exceptional rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.5m
incurred in the first half - compared with a profit of Pounds 5.3m last
time, a figure restated from Pounds 6.6m to reclassify extraordinary items
above the line.
The group has now completed a three-year capital investment programme. Mr
John Prior, chairman and chief executive, said this would allow it to expand
its customer base, sales and services.
Turnover declined to Pounds 57.2m (Pounds 63.1m). Interest charges increased
to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.3m). Gearing stood at 73 per cent (69 per cent) at
the year-end.
Losses per share emerged at 0.8p (earnings of 10.8p). The final dividend is
cut to 1.8p bringing the total for the year to 3.6p (5p).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property, the leading property investment company in
Scotland, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 840,000 for the half year to
February 15 mainly because of significantly higher interest.
In the comparative period there was a profit of Pounds 2.72m, but that
turned into a deficit of Pounds 8.37m for the full year after exceptional
charges of Pounds 11.6m.
Interest charges amounted to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 6.6m). Only Pounds 860,000
of interest was capitalised, compared to Pounds 5.5m, following completion
of the group's development programme.
Mr Scott Cairns, who was appointed managing director in January, said the
accounting policy was not to capitalise interest beyond practical completion
of a development.
The group is taking Pounds 1.5m from reserves to pay an interim dividend of
1.5p. This is a cut from the previous 2.53p but it intends to maintain the
total at 4.4p.
Second half trading was likely to continue to show a loss, albeit a much
smaller one. Mr Cairns said some 11 unlet properties could bring in another
Pounds 7m if tenants were found.
Net revenues from properties rose 11.5 per cent, from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds
10.6m.
The group was expected to become more of a Scottish company with up to three
quarters of its properties based north of the border, compared with the
current 60 per cent.
Total borrowings were Pounds 190m compared with Pounds 201m at August 15.
Gearing fell from 142 per cent to 137 per cent.
Losses per share were 1.38p (earnings 1.86p).

FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: London the headquarters but much
independence at a local level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DESIGN for the enlarged HSBC Holdings after the takeover of Midland Bank
is disarmingly simple and represents an application to international banking
of the management idea: 'think global, act local.'
The holding company will pool all of the transnational aspects of the two
main bank's activities - international customers, investment banking,
treasury and technology - while the key operating units will remain
relatively independent to pursue growth within their borders.
Regulation and logic require that the 'brain' of the new bank be in one
place, London. London will be the headquarters of the holding company and
the residence of the senior executives who will hold the main
responsibilities.
The board of HSBC will be internationalised to include not only the top
executives from the main operating arms - Hongkong Bank and Midland Bank -
but, in due course, non-executives directors from the US, Europe and Asia.
The boards of the main operating banks will further be localised.
But while the rationale for the takeover is growth through increased
business, Mr William Purves, HSBC Holdings' chairman, believes there will be
considerable scope for rationalisation and the effect of that increased
efficiency on the combined banks bottom line.
He also forecasts synergy in a number of activities:
Trade finance. Hongkong Bank started in trade finance in 1865 and is
regarded as one of the best in the field. Mr Purves believes that his bank
has much which it can teach Midland about trade finance and that should have
benefits for Midland in European trade and trade between Europe and the rest
of the world. Technology. Last year the combined banks spent about Pounds
625m on information technology and Hongkong Bank believes economies can be
achieved not only in the acquisition of new technology but in the processing
of information, systems development and maintenance.
The issues before the enlarged bank are the creation of a five year plan to
improve Midland's technological capability and, in Mr Purves's words 'the
need to get the two banks' computers talking to each other better than they
are.'
The treasury area offers big scope for rationalisation and the banks plan to
merge their two treasury operations. These will also be enlarged to take in
dealings in government securities as well the more usual foreign exchange,
money market, and derivative products.
The problems Hongkong Bank has had in negotiating swaps with other financial
institutions that have a post 1997 maturity will disappear with the merger -
leading, theoretically, at least, to a lower cost of finance. Investment
banking is another area ripe for rationalisation. While the separate
identities of Samuel Montagu, James Capel, Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt,
Euromobiliare and Wardley will be retained, the plan is to run investment
banking as a global business where overlapping activities are rationalised.

FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: Regulator likely to be Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is likely to become the main regulator of HSBC Holdings
if Hongkong Bank's acquisition of Midland Bank is successful.
However, most of the operations will remain outside the scope of the Bank of
England's direct regulatory supervision - an arrangement believed to be
unique for a UK-based banking group.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, said yesterday that the Bank
would supervise the holding company, while its subsidiary banks will remain
regulated by the monetary authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are
headquartered.
A formal application has been made to the Bank of England. Informal
discussions have continued with the Bank since Hongkong Bank first showed an
interest in Midland, and the Bank is believed to have agreed in principle to
take responsibility.
The Bank of England's role as lead regulator springs from the fact that the
group will be run from London, rather than simply that it is legally
incorporated in the UK.
Mr Purves said the regulator wanted 'to know where the mind and management
(of the bank) is.' For HSBC Holdings that place will be London where,
eventually, the bank's chairman and chief executive will reside.
The Bank's responsibility for the group holding company, though, will not
give it direct responsibility for most of its operations. While Midland will
continue to be overseen by the Bank of England, Hongkong Bank will remain
under the supervision of Mr David Carse, Hong Kong's banking commissioner.
This arrangement differs markedly from that of Standard Chartered, the
UK-based overseas bank which offers the closest parallel. The main operating
arm of Standard Chartered is located in the UK, with other operations around
the world run as branches or subsidiaries owned by the UK bank. This gives
the Bank of England a direct interest in the supervision of operations
overseas.
Mr Carse, who is technically on secondment in Hong Kong, having previously
worked in the Bank of England's supervision department, said the decision to
have the Bank as the key regulator was in line with international
supervisory principles.
The Bank of England has in the past been responsible for Hongkong Bank's
branch operations in the UK. It will for the first time become responsible
for the group's capital position and the fitness and properness of its
directors.

FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: HSBC tax shift to cost Pounds 200m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC HOLDINGS, the London holding company of the Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank's worldwide assets, will incur an unexpected Pounds 200m (Dollars 344m)
provision against additional tax charges by becoming UK resident for tax
purposes after the takeover of the Midland Bank, it was disclosed yesterday.
The change of tax status has been carefully planned to ensure that taxpayers
outside the UK will not suffer reduced dividends.
Mr William Purves, HSBC chairman, said that he expected that the impact of
higher UK corporate taxation on the London-registered holding company would
be neutral by the third year after the takeover.
HSBC is already incorporated in the UK, but is currently non-resident for UK
tax purposes as it is still substantially managed from Hong Kong. That may
change on January 1 1993, with the relocation of 'appropriate group
functions' - including the chairman's office  - to the UK.
A number of HSBC subsidiaries already pay UK corporation tax - or the rate
applicable in the country in which they operate.
Dividends to the holding company, which are presently taxed at local rates,
will now be liable at the UK level.
The Hong Kong corporate tax rate is being raised by 1 per cent to 17.5 per
cent, but remains mild compared with the UK rate of 33 per cent.
Mr Purves said the Pounds 200m provision was conservative and he expected no
additional tax burden for the enlarged group.
UK corporation tax is payable on dividends from non-UK subsidiaries of HSBC.
These would be transferred in order to pay the holding company's own
dividends. UK tax would also be incurred on capital gains registered by
HSBC.
Mr Purves said: 'There are many sources from which we can pay HSBC Holdings
dividends, without cleaning out its own subsidiaries.' That will depend
largely on the performance of the non-Hong Kong operations.
In 1991, out of HSBC's HKDollars 12.8bn fully disclosed profit before tax,
HKDollars 11.1bn was generated in Hong Kong, which has no double taxation
treaty with the UK.
A substantial pick-up in earnings from Midland and Marine Midland, HSBC's US
banking subsidiary, would neutralise the impact of UK taxation; the US has a
double taxation treaty, while there will be no change in Midland's own tax
treatment.

FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: Plans for treasury and investment hide
series of stern tasks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLANS for the treasury and investment banking operations of Hongkong
Bank and Midland Bank appear on the surface a model of simplicity. In
practice, however, rationalising these parts of the two group's operations
is likely to be among the most difficult tasks facing the new management.
The treasury businesses will be run as a single, worldwide operation with a
significant presence in London, Tokyo and New York, according to yesterday's
offer document from Hongkong Bank.
The combined market presence of the two groups, and the capital strength of
Hongkong Bank, would give the treasury additional muscle and would offer
economies of scale.
Investment banking, on the other hand, would be run almost as a series of
cottage industries, by several brand names.
On the one hand, that would involve James Capel and Wardley, the Hongkong
Bank's UK securities house and Far East investment bank; and on the other,
Samuel Montagu and Greenwell Montagu, Midland's merchant bank and UK
government securities specialist.
The proposed new group's structure, and recent changes to each group's
investment banking operations, suggest that this simplistic model may prove
difficult to follow.
Attempts to manage treasury at a global level may encounter difficulties,
given the organisation of the group into separate banking operating
companies in different centres.
Transfer pricing - the process of allocating profits between different
centres, already one of the main problems for the management of global
treasury operations - would be complicated by this.
In London, the merging of the two treasury businesses also highlights a
strategic difference: Hongkong Bank runs treasury as part of its branch
operations, while Midland has located the business in Midland Montagu, its
investment banking arm.
Such differences permeate the two groups: Hongkong Bank, for instance, runs
all its fixed income businesses through the main bank, while Midland has the
successful Greenwell Montagu, part of Midland Montagu.
Fitting together other investment banking operations may also cause
difficulties.
There is a clear split between the corporate finance businesses of Wardley
and Samuel Montagu, which operate in the Far East and Europe respectively:
each could remain under the control of its current parent bank. However,
James Capel, the London-based securities arm of Hongkong bank, does not fit
the pattern.
Steps have been taken to integrate it progressively into Hongkong Bank,
which suggests that the collection of independently run companies envisaged
in the offer document may not be the final outcome.
Capel would logically fit under the Midland umbrella, since it is based in
London.
Midland has nevertheless tended to look askance at the equities business,
Capel's main base, since it pulled out of equities itself after London's Big
Bang in the mid-1980s.

FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: The beginning of an era of change for Hong
Kong investors - The impact of the Hongkong Bank's takeover of the UK
clearer on the colony's banking sector
</HEADLINE>

INVESTMENT analysis in Hong Kong will never be quite the same again. HSBC
Holdings, parent of Hongkong Bank, yesterday ended years of speculation with
the revelation of its secret inner reserves.
The final figure caused few surprises, amounting to HKDollars 16.6bn (Pounds
1.2bn), before minority interests, with an additional HKDollars 8.7bn
surplus on the value of its long- term investments and proper- ties.
Hongkong Bank still, however, stuck by its rule of valuing its interest in
Hang Seng bank at its 1965 acquisition price of HKDollars 51m. Today that
shareholding is worth about HKDollars 33bn.
The new figures emphasised the profitability of the bank's Hong Kong
operations - the colony accounted for 45 per cent of the bank's assets and
87 per cent of its profits before tax in 1991 - but underline the risks
inherent in its expansion away from its main profit centre.
The latest figures, accompanying HSBC's recommended offer for Midland Bank,
come as an enlightening post-script to the bank's recently announced 1991
profits.
For the first time investors caught a glimpse of the banking group's genuine
earnings over the past three financial years and the numbers are impressive.
The strength of HSBC's local operations was highlighted in the fact that it
transferred HKDollars 1.58bn to its inner reserves in 1990, one of the
toughest years in recent banking history. While 1991's HKDollars 6.77bn
group profit (before minority interests), understated the actual figure by
HKDollars 3.52bn.
The total amount transferred by HSBC to its inner reserves over the past
three years amounted to HKDollars 8.5bn.
HSBC's announcement was accompanied by its 62 per cent-owned local
subsidiary Hang Seng Bank declaring inner reserves. These amounted to
HKDollars 7.06bn at December 31 1991, and compares with its shareholders'
funds of HKDollars 23.16bn.
The impact of the Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng's revelations are profound for
the Hong Kong banking sector. Today the Hong Kong market will be trading
banking stocks on unequal information. The colony's two biggest banks will
be trading on a fully disclosed basis while others, notably the Bank of East
Asia, Dao Heng Bank and Wing Lung Bank, will be trading on information which
includes transfers to inner reserves.
Analysts believe that Hongkong Bank's actions will force other listed Hong
Kong banks to follow suit. The banking sector has necessarily been rated on
the basis of disclosed earnings.
In the case of Hang Seng Bank, the actual profits were 60 per cent higher
than those it had announced to shareholders in February, due to a HKDollars
1.72bn transfer to its reserves.
Analysts expected strong support for Hang Seng Bank shares as a result,
providing added incentives for the remainder of the listed banks to follow
suit and declare their true position.
Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC, said Hongkong Bank had made little use
of its inner reserves, except during the shipping crisis of the early 1980's
and in 1987, when it wrote off the goodwill from the acquisition of Marine
Midland and also marked down the US subsidiary's LDC loan exposure.
The group's inner reserves would have been revealed for 1993, as a result of
European banking legislation, but HSBC will be obliged to hard-sell its
takeover offer and the reserves provide a big positive point.
The HKDollars 16.61bn reserves represent a 20 per cent increase to its
reported capital resources, resulting in a fully disclosed net asset value
per share for HSBC of HKDollars 43.03, a premium of more than 10 per cent
compared with its closing share price in Hong Kong.
Mr Purves commented that criticism of the takeover of Midland has focused on
the fact that Hong Kong has historically provided the bulk of group earnings
and was entering a high growth period which would considerably outstrip the
European economies.
In 1990, when large banks around the world were writing off bad debts,
Hongkong Bank had no need to resort to inner reserves. Its local operations
contributed HKDollars 9.68bn to profit before tax, making up for HKDollars
2.89bn losses from its US and European operations.
Mr Purves agreed with concern voiced by Chinese officials, over the bank
stepping back from its his- toric base in Hong Kong. 'It is not in the
group's interests to diminish its interests in Southern China and in Hong
Kong. We are increas- ing our market share and will carry on doing so. We
believe the authorities in China have nothing to fear,' he said.
But in spite of his lengthy justification for the merger, there remained
considerable concern that the deal was substantially pitched to the favour
of London. One Hong Kong broker gave a 'consensus view' of the short-term
impact of the Midland offer.
'From the UK side it is not paying enough. And on the Hong Kong side it is
paying too much,' he said.
Hong Kong operations had been expected to contribute substantial earnings
growth in 1992. The impact will be diluted by the acquisition of the
still-troubled Midland. Hong Kong investors are being urged to focus on the
long-term benefits of the deal, which should come through in 1994, according
to latest brokers' estimates. But Hong Kong investors are not renowned for
their long-term outlook.
That said, there may be some short-term gain from the announcement that the
bank's prohibition on one investor owning more than 1 per cent of its stock
will go. This will enable fund managers to raise their holdings in what is
still an attractively priced international bank.

FT  15 APR 92 / Creditor confident on O&amp;Y exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce, Olympia &amp; York's biggest creditor, is
confident that the property developer's troubles will have only a limited
impact on its earnings, the bank's chairman said yesterday.
Mr Donald Fullerton said that at the worst, CIBC's exposure to O&amp;Y was 'not
of a size that's going to take more than a bite out of our earnings'. Mr
Fullerton added that all the Canadian banks, four of which have large
exposures to O&amp;Y, are in a 'reasonably strong position' compared with the
early 1980s when several of them were hit by the Third World debt crisis and
by loans to troubled western Canadian energy companies.
CIBC, Canada's second biggest bank, is believed to have an exposure to the
property developer of around CDollars 1bn (Pounds 477.5m). In 1991, it made
after-tax profits of CDollars 811m.
Mr Fullerton declined to discuss the details of O&amp;Y's negotiations with its
100 banks. Other bankers said they did not have enough information from O&amp;Y
to decide if they could accept the company's proposal to defer payments of
interest and principal on USDollars 5bn (Pounds 2.83bn) of loans to the
parent company and defer principal payments on a further USDollars 7bn of
property loans.
O&amp;Y met all the banks on Monday and will now negotiate with 12 smaller
groups. At noon yesterday, lenders to O&amp;Y's UK Canary Wharf office project
met in Toronto for their first detailed discussions.
Bankers said that before they agree to defer interest or provide new funds
to O&amp;Y, they need information on loans provided by other banks, which they
have not yet received. One banker said he could not decide whether it was
fair for his bank to provide new money until he had details of other banks'
existing loans, the security on them and the destination of those loans.
Bankers said it would take 'years' to complete the restructuring of O&amp;Y's
loans. All O&amp;Y could hope for in the next 90 days, they said, was an
agreement to provide Pounds 100m for work to continue at Canary Wharf, a
further CDollars 100m for the Canadian interests, a freeze on principal
repayments and a framework for deciding which loans would have their
interest payments deferred. But O&amp;Y cannot be certain of winning that
agreement.

FT  15 APR 92 / C &amp; W in joint venture to provide Russian networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE &amp; Wireless, the UK-based telecommunications group, has formed a joint
venture to provide long-distance and international communications networks
to Russia's main business centres. A final go-ahead for the project depends
on a study into its financial and technical feasibility.
The joint venture, Metropolitan Communications, is 50 per cent owned by C &amp;
W, and 50 per cent by Intertelecom. State-owned Intertelecom is the main
provider of long-distance and international telecommunications services in
Russia.
The aim of the joint venture is to modernise, develop and operate long
distance and international networks in Moscow, St Petersburg, the 'Golden
Ring' of large towns surrounding Moscow and Russia's main oilfield.
C &amp; W has an exclusive arrangement with Intertelecom for these geographical
areas, but the Russian carrier may form different joint ventures in other
areas. Intertelecom no longer has monopoly rights to provide
telecommunications services in Russia, although it is the largest operator.
Metropolitan Communications is one of the most ambitious joint ventures
between a western telephone company and a telephone company from the old
Soviet bloc. Over the past two years, the governments of eastern Europe have
made investment in telecommunications, which was neglected under Communist
rule, a priority.
C &amp; W refused to name its likely financial commitment to the project, but
said it would probably be looking for World Bank financing.
Lord Young, C &amp; W's chairman, said the group would only proceed with the
project if it met 'our exacting investment criteria'. The feasiblity study
will be completed by the end of the year.
C &amp; W is aiming to increase its investment in eastern Europe. It has already
started building a telecommunications network for the city of Gdansk in
Poland.
Sprint, the US telecommunications group, yesterday announced that it had
formed a joint venture with the Russian Ministry of Communications to build
a nationwide data communications network in Russia. Sprint already provides
international data communications services from Moscow and St Petersburg.

FT  15 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Taylor Woodrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many companies fritter away the proceeds of a one-for-four rights issue
within 12 months, even in property and contracting. It is thus a measure of
Taylor Woodrow's fall from grace that the company was forced to admit
yesterday that virtually all the Pounds 163m it received in last April's
cash call has now disappeared in retained losses and writedowns.
It may be that the new sense of purpose from the reshaped board, which was
partly responsible for yesterday's 8 per cent jump in the shares, will
ultimately revive Taylor's fortunes. But the immediate outlook for investors
once income funds have collected their 8 per cent yield looks distinctly
unexciting. The dividend, after all, was only held to honour the promise
made with the rights issue. Unless something very extraordinary turns up it
will have to be cut this year, perhaps from 9.5p to 7p. Even then, the
payout will be uncovered on profit forecasts which were only being upgraded
yesterday on the view that further Channel tunnel provisions will be
deferred to 1993 and that last year's US contracting losses will not be
repeated.
Taylor's big property exposure hardly looks attractive, and investors who
disagree can do better than buy a stock trading at a mere 20 per cent
discount to net assets. There are purer housebuilding plays in the market,
and though the intention is to grow this side of the business, reduced cash
flows from contracting will not leave limitless room for balance sheet
manoeuvre.

FT  15 APR 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that February's data on UK production appeared only yesterday is a
vexing reminder of how long the market will have to wait for the official
picture of the economy's response to the Budget and the election. But the
figures confirm the general impression that recovery was stirring in any
case. Manufacturing output in February was up more than 1 per cent on
January, while production of consumer goods was actually higher than a year
ago.
In keeping with that was the fact that the rate of producer price inflation
in March crept up slightly from the month before, thus confirming the mildly
disappointing figure for retail price inflation last Friday. It may be that
headline inflation will rise modestly from this point, as poll tax
distortions work their way through. In such circumstances the new government
must be seen to pursue a tight monetary policy if it is not to raise the
cost of its already formidable borrowing requirement by reviving
inflationary fears in the gilt market. With the local elections coming up
next month, there may well be a temptation to bring forward a vote-catching
cut in base rates. Wider strategy suggests the temptation should be
resisted.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The building materials sector offers a striking contrast between the
adventurism of Redland, recent victor in its battle for Steetley, and the
consistently cautious RMC Group. The latter has been a model of how to fund
a business without recourse to shareholders. Judging by the noises
accompanying yesterday's 23 per cent fall in 1991 pre-tax profits this is
not about to change. The key to the shares will be the UK, which contributed
only 17 per cent of last year's operating profits against well over half in
1989. The bad news is that the company sees little sign of a UK upturn. The
good news is that its determination to widen margins in the absence of
volume increases deserves to be taken seriously.

FT  15 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hongkong's cheap shot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something not quite right about the marriage contract between the
Midland and the Hongkong Bank. The immediate response of the Kuwait
Investment Office was to put most of its 10 per cent stake up for sale. The
stake also apparently failed to find a buyer at a price some 4 per cent
below the initial value of the HSBC offer. It all suggests a high degree of
resistance on the part of Midland holders. The latter must be doubly
disconcerted by the firmness of the HSBC share price in London dealing after
the details were announced. That hardly implies an excessive price tag.
It would be very different if HSBC were prepared to offer cash. But using
capital in this way is always difficult for a bank. The problem with a paper
offer is that acceptance involves taking a stake in an amorphous bank with
no record as a combined entity. The merger will generate only small cost
savings and there is no guarantee of new business. On top comes HSBC's
dismal record at managing its Australian and US subsidiaries. For the
institutions, there must be better ways of investing in Asian growth.
As it is, Midland investors have to consider whether the immediate increase
in return is worth the dilution of growth prospects that may make an exit
price of 378p seem a giveaway two years down the road. Not only is Midland's
loan book in relatively good shape, but its large backlog of unrelieved ACT
will swell recovering earnings, allowing a high level of retention and
pushing net worth substantially above the current 299p.
Perhaps its share price would have been firmer yesterday if the market
really expected a counterbid from the likes of Lloyds. Such a bid might make
sense because of the enormous scope for cost savings. But it seems unlikely.
It would have to be hostile and would almost certainly raise issues of
competition policy. The bidder would also be at a disadvantage because,
unlike HSBC, it would have to enter the auction without having scrutinised
Midland's books. HSBC appears to have set its price just high enough to make
that risk excessive.
So that leaves three possibilities. First, HSBC may scrape through:
Midland's management has agreed to the offer, though it did have more to
lose if the negotiations disclosed last month collapsed. Second, HSBC may
increase its offer. But that means even more dilution in the short term and
the risk of a battle with its own sceptical shareholders. Third, it will be
rebuffed. Midland's price would fall steeply in the short term, but
investors prepared to stay the course would still be able to share in the
recovery of a bank that is now clearly strong enough to stay independent.
HSBC has a tough selling job on its hands.

FT  15 APR 92 / World Court rejects Libyan plea to prevent sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS sanctions against Libya, including an arms and air embargo,
are due to take effect today in spite of last-minute efforts by Tripoli to
head off their imposition.
The World Court yesterday rejected Libya's plea that it should bar the US
and Britain from taking punitive measures to oblige Tripoli to hand over two
men suspected of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie in
Scotland.
The ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague coincided with
last-minute attempts by the Arab League to head off the imposition of
sanctions. A renewed Libyan offer to yield the two suspects to a 'neutral'
party was expected to be dismissed by the Security Council. The White House
said it was pleased with the World Court ruling.
In rejecting Libya's plea, the judges of the court said that the Security
Council Resolution 748 imposing sanctions should override all other
international agreements.
Libya defiantly isolated itself from the world yesterday by declaring a 'day
of mourning' and cutting external air and telecommunications links. The
national news agency Jana said the 'day of mourning' had nothing to do with
the sanctions threat but was a mark of respect for the 37 Libyans who died
in US bombing raids on Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986.
'The Arab people, in commemorating this anniversary, wants to reveal that
this Arab nation is the victim every day of terrorism and abhorrent racism,'
a statement issued by the Libyan embassy in Cairo said.
Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, the Arab League secretary-general, said that he hoped
an offer by Malta to accept the two accused Libyans would help to defuse the
crisis, but western officials said it was unlikely that the Security Council
would delay the imposition of sanctions.
The US and Britain are demanding the unconditional surrender of the two men
suspected of planting a bomb on the airliner which exploded over Lockerbie
killing 270 people.
France is pressing Libya to grant it access to four Libyans, including
Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning over the 1989
downing of a French UTA airliner over Niger in which all 171 passengers and
crew perished. Most Arab states indicated they would reluctantly fall into
line with the air embargo, but both Egypt and Tunisia are planning to
facilitate travel across their frontiers with Libya.
Some 30 offices of Libyan Arab Airlines were expected to be closed worldwide
and Libyan diplomatic representation will be thinned out under the terms of
the UN resolution. The sanctions will not affect Libyan oil exports or
shipping services.

FT  15 APR 92 / Letter: Business leaders appeal to governments for
successful conclusion of Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOSEPH E CONNOR and others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We the undersigned are chief executive officers of some of the world's
leading corporations and officers of leading business organisations in our
countries. Most of us have supported the Uruguay Round from its inception,
and have given advice on its contents to our governments. At the initiative
of the International Chamber of Commerce, we are writing to governments to
convey our concern that deadline after deadline for concluding the Round is
not being met and that the Round might be stalled indefinitely. Such a
prospect impels us to express our strongly felt views to our leaders once
again.
We have consistently emphasised our conviction that a successful Round is
crucial to the long-term growth prospects of our economies. A reformed and
strengthened multilateral trading system with substantially improved market
access for goods and services is the key to that success.
The industrialised countries are plagued by recession directly attributable
to a pervasive lack of business confidence impeding investment and
prolonging retrenchment. Failure to complete the Uruguay Round would be a
further serious blow to confidence. We know from our own experience and from
that of our business colleagues that the continuing stalemate over the trade
negotiations has contributed to the deterioration of the economic climate
and the postponement of many business initiatives around the world, and thus
to persistent and growing unemployment. Governments must demonstrate the
political will necessary to conclude a strong and comprehensive agreement.
In addition to the negative impact on jobs at home, we want to draw our
leaders' attention to the impact such failure to complete the negotiations
would have on the situation of the developing countries and the former
communist countries, most of which are trying to reform the structure of
their economies and work their way out of large debt burdens. The ability to

If the British are a nation of shopkeepers, the Swiss must be a nation of
used aircraft salesmen. With 1,000 commercial aircraft, some brand new,
parked in the deserts of Nevada and Arizona awaiting buyers, Swissair has
still managed to raise nearly Pounds 54m by selling off its unwanted
machines - a coup which enabled it to report a net profit in spite of a
dismal year.
The three aircraft accounting for most of the income were DC-10s - not the
world's most popular jetliners. Predictably, Swissair officials attributed
their success to the TLC lavished on their charges and the fact that they
are sold before they get too old. Otto Loepfe, Swissair's president, says
that demand in the second-hand market is stronger for the DC-10 these days
than for any other model. 'None are available now,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the Germans may be rather preoccupied with their own problems at
the moment, their finance minister Theo Waigel may turn out to be of greater
support in his role as chairman of the EBRD than Jacques Attali, its
president, may have thought.
After all, finance minister Waigel is expected to throw his weight behind
Attali, who this week threatened to stop all help for Russia if
liberalisation moves there are shelved. A wise-cracking conservative from
Swabia in southern Germany, Waigel is chairman of the Bavarian Christian
Social Union, sister party to Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats, and is
keen to expand his foreign policy expertise. Chairing the EBRD will improve
his credentials as a possible successor to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's
long-serving foreign minister.
Some of the east European states to which the EBRD is preaching the message
of tight budgetary control may, however, look askance at Waigel's own
record. Since reunification, the finance minister has been no slouch at
handing out fiscal largesse. Total net transfers from the German public
sector to east Germany are estimated at DM 180bn this year, up from DM 140bn
last year, with much of the money earmarked for social security rather than
investment.
Hardly the best example, perhaps, for the way the EBRD should be dishing out
its much more scarce resources.

The collapse of communism was swift; removing its icons takes longer. But
this week the revolution caught up with Lenin in the Central Bank.
This fine building on Neglinnaya Street near the Bolshoi Theatre, which had
housed the pre-revolutionary Moscow Stock Exchange and which for decades was
home to Gosbank, USSR, was also home to two monuments to the maker of Soviet
ideology.
One, a statue on the first floor, stood, arm outwards, as if directing
visitors to the foreign currency department. The other was a saying from
Chairman Lenin in the entrance hall, which announced, in effect, that once a
revolutionary government had control of the central bank, then the seizure
of the financial system was 90 per cent complete. Hardly suitable viewing
for the squads of world bankers who pass through the portals to huddle with
their counterparts from the Russian Central Bank.
So now it is only above the eternal flame to the state bankers who fell in
the Great Patriotic War that a little hammer and sickle attests to the past.

FT  15 APR 92 / Observer: Succession puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The great unsolved mystery about the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's bid for
Midland is who will run the enlarged group.
It seems clear that for the short term Willie Purves will be in the driving
seat. But he is already past retirement age and will stay in Hong Kong until
late 1993. Once the merger has bedded down the intention is that the group
chief executive will be London-based, and it is unlikely to be Purves.
Brian Pearse, Midland's excellent new chief executive, will get a seat at
the top table. But he'll probably not be in the running, if for no other
reason than that, at 58, he is only a couple of years younger than Purves.
The same goes for John Gray, Purves's equally good deputy. Likewise
56-year-old Bernard Asher, who runs James Capel and already sits on the
Midland board, is an unlikely candidate, because he is not a banker.
Nevertheless, the field is starting to narrow. John Strickland, 52, now
responsible for the Hongkong Bank's information technology, will join
Midland's board. John French, another Hongkong Bank veteran, has been given
the task, along with Midland's Brian Goldthorpe, of looking after credit and
risk management. These two, plus 51-year-old John Bond - currently nursing
Marine Midland back to health - and Paul Selway-Swift, 48, are the obvious
front-runners to succeed Purves.
Given the Midland's high turnover of senior staff, it looks unlikely to be
the source of the next top honcho. Brian Goldthorpe, the only real survivor
is close to retirement. Admittedly, Richard Delbridge, Midland's 49-year-old
finance director who joined from J P Morgan in 1989, gets the plum job of
group finance director plus a seat on the group board. But he would have to
perform extremely well over the next couple of years to beat the Hongkong
competition.
Indeed, it is easier to measure the losers than the winners on the Midland
bench. The obvious casualty is Gene Lockhart, Midland's 42-year-old
high-tech whizzbang. Of all the glamorous outsiders hired in Sir Kit
McMahon's heyday, he seemed destined to be a chief executive. However, the
highly-paid Lockhart has stayed out of the limelight since McMahon's
departure, and - given Strickland's promotion - his days may be numbered.
The other big unknown is George Loudon, 49-year-old chief executive of
Midland Montagu. His name has not figured in the reshuffle, although he is
in charge of the part of the business which could provide the greatest
long-term growth potential.

FT  15 APR 92 / Personal View: Culture is not to blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAWRENCE H SUMMERS and WILLIAM R EASTERLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's poor nations have made enormous progress over the past 25 years.
They have grown more rapidly than the US did during its spurt to economic
maturity, and have cut infant mortality rates in half. Much of the reason
for growth is that governments have increasingly allowed market incentives
to work. Regulations have been removed, businesses privatised, and trade
barriers reduced on every continent.
Will this progress continue? Can the formerly communist nations share in it?
Many are sceptical and cite cultural barriers as an obstacle to growth. They
say that people in the former Soviet Union lack the capitalist spirit. One
recent newspaper article on Latin America was headlined: 'Some find the
roots of the region's malaise in colonial-based cultural values.' Even the
lagging growth of the US relative to Japan is often ascribed to culture.
The idea that an inappropriate culture is primarily to blame for low growth
is a dangerous myth. The record shows that culture cannot be an important
hindrance to prosperity, for a simple reason: culture changes slowly, but
economic performance changes rapidly. Today's basket cases are tomorrow's
successes, and vice versa.
Even the most pessimistic reappraisals of Soviet growth, for example, show
income per person rising at historically impressive rates of more than 3 per
cent a year in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Although communism has since
collapsed under its own weight, the achievement of such growth with a bad
system speaks well of the productive potential of the Soviet people.
Enterprise managers who could cope with the administrative chaos of a
planned economy are likely to cope with a market economy.
In Latin America, the disasters of the 1980s make it easy to forget how well
the region was doing previously. Today's basket case of Haiti had faster
export growth than Japan in 1968-80. Over the same period, three Latin
American countries - Brazil, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic - grew
faster than any industrialised country, and 15 (including much maligned
Argentina) grew faster than the US. The collapse of Latin American growth in
the 1980s had nothing to do with cultural attitudes and everything to do
with government deficits and mismanaged foreign borrowing. Countries like
Chile and Mexico that have solved those problems have bright futures, if
huge inflows of capital and stock market booms are any indication.
The case for cultural obstacles to growth would seem to be stronger in
Africa, where many countries' per capita incomes have declined since
independence. But Africa also has the country with the world's highest per
capita growth rate over the past 25 years: Botswana. A reform wave is now
sweeping across the continent.
The idea of cultural barriers to prosperity has often been wrong in the
past. Max Weber, who formed the 'Protestant ethic' explanation for western
prosperity, derided Confucianism as anti-capitalist. The achievement by
Japan and Korea of two of the highest long-run growth rates on record now
leads some to argue that a 'Confucian ethic' has replaced the 'Protestant
ethic' as the cultural secret to success.
In 1952 an economist named Hubertus Van Mook wrote of south-east Asia: 'The
age-long influence of the west . . . failed, with only few exceptions, to
instil its economic activity and enterprise into the minds and habits of
these peoples . . . The social solidarity, the public spirit, and the
economic energy necessary for a vigorous resurgence were lacking.' Since
then, south-east Asian nations like Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and
Indonesia have tripled their per capita incomes.
Similarly, Nobel Laureate James Meade wrote of the economy of the African
island of Mauritius in 1967 that the 'outlook for peaceful developments is
poor . . . The history of the island has led to an association in the mind
of the underdog between manual work and slavery . . . Outside (producing)
sugar, to which there is a traditional devotion, enterprise and good
management are sadly lacking in Mauritius.' In 1970, the government of
Mauritius established an export-processing zone that was successful in
diversifying exports away from sugar and generating growth in manufacturing
employment of 12 per cent per year. In the 1980s, Mauritius had one of the
highest per capita growth rates in the world.
Culture cannot be too important when similar cultures perform differently in
response to different incentives. Divided countries like North and South
Korea and, formerly, East and West Germany are good examples of same
cultures, different outcomes. Russian workers' legendary sloth disappears as
they cross the border into free-market Poland, where they are reputed to be
the hardest workers.
The primacy of economic incentives over culture is good news for courageous
reformers. They face great obstacles, but cultural inertia is not one.
Peoples of even the most depressed economy have potential for future
prosperity.
Lawrence Summers is chief economist and William Easterly senior economist at
the World Bank.

FT  15 APR 92 / Beijing remains relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Formal approval by the authorities in Beijing is not needed for Hongkong
Bank to take over Midland. But with China set to assume sovereignty in 1997
of a territory in which Hongkong Bank occupies such an important role,
outright opposition would be unfortunate, writes Alexander Nicoll.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, has sought to prevent this by
keeping Beijing informed of the bank's moves at every stage.
So far, the indications are that Beijing is adopting a relaxed approach, in
spite of criticism and suspicion expressed in Hong Kong newspapers that
usually reflect the official communist line. None of the many unofficial
voices of the Chinese government commented yesterday on the terms of the
deal. However, an official government statement said that the merger of the
two banks was an internal affair for them.
The statement, issued by the Chinese Embassy in London in response to a
question, said: 'Due to the status of the Hongkong Bank in the economic
activities of Hong Kong, we hope that whatever actions the bank takes, apart
from consideration of its own needs, it should take a responsible attitude
towards Hong Kong; and we hope that it will continue to make its
contribution to the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong economy.' This
seemed the clearest sign yet that China has no intention of mounting
opposition that could put the deal in doubt or place obstacles in the path
of the merged company.
The concerns expressed by some Chinese officials and newspapers are
understandable. Hongkong Bank is not just a commercial bank. It performs
some of the functions, including issuing banknotes, of a central bank, its
chairman sits on the governor's main decision-making body, and its board
includes leading Hong Kong political figures, as well as local businessmen
who have strong relationships with the Chinese authorities.
Chief among Chinese worries is that Hongkong Bank will use the Midland
takeover to syphon assets out of Hong Kong. Businessmen, however, believe
that the bank's prominent role in backing the boom in Hong Kong business in
southern China suggests that its commitment to the area is firm - and the
bank yesterday repeated this pledge.
Perhaps the more telling criticism from the communist Chinese has been on
markedly capitalist grounds. An official of the state-run Bank of China,
which competes intensely for local business with the Hongkong Bank, attacked
it on the grounds that Midland was a poor performer and that the interests
of Hongkong Bank shareholders, including many local people, were at risk.

FT  15 APR 92 / Arts: The Pope and the Witch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have always found the Italian sense of humour somewhat elusive: the
country has many virtues, but jokes are not among them. Some of the English,
on the other hand, seem to think the Italians are funny just because they
are Italians. And that, I suspect, is what has gone wrong with this
production.
Dario Fo's The Pope and the Witch, as presented at the Comedy, is not only
unfunny; it is not even remotely satirical. If it reminds one of anything,
it is a dismal performance at the Young Vic last summer of a play by the
American, Tom Kempinski, called Sex Please, We're Italian] Although it
starred Helen Mirren and despite all the resources that were put into it,
Kempinski's piece failed to work because having English actors mimic
Italians is not funny, indeed is frequently embarrassing.
I shall list the virtues first. The Pope and the Witch is very well directed
by Jude Kelly. When several characters are required to speak together, they
do so in unison. It is very well designed by Rob Jones. The production moves
easily from the papal apartments in the Vatican to a drug rehabilitation
centre in Rome.
All the elements of the commedia dell'arte are there. When a character needs
to perform a somersault - and even when he does not  - he does so with
effortless superiority. When the Pope ascends, if not into heaven, at least
into the flies, the chandelier drops smoothly to collect him.
Even the acting is not to be faulted. Berwick Kaler is a very versatile
Pope. When he is down, he looks a bit like Neil Kinnock, though I assume
that is accidental.
Frances de la Tour is not really a witch, nor is she meant to be, just a
woman who has knocked about a bit in the third world, doesn't like abortion
much more than the Pope, but sometimes regards it as a necessary
alternative. (That is the serious part.) In the circumstances, she gives an
accomplished performance, as do several others. I liked, in particular,
Clive Merrison as Cardinal Pialli, the Pope's private secretary.
The trouble is the play and, even more so, the lines. The Banco Ambrosiano
and the Calvi scandal (the man who was found hanging under Blackfriars
Bridge) are in the background. So are third world dictators, the CIA,
drug-running, the Red Brigades, Italian politics and corruption in general.
The plot, such as it is, is that the Pope declares that drugs and
contraceptives should be legalised and made available free of charge.
As an example of the lines, we have 'Pope sanctions dope' and 'Pope no
longer firm on condoms'. In a bow to the Italian fashion industry, the Pope
introduces 'the poverty look'.
Andy de la Tour, who is responsible for the script, writes in a programme
note that he worked from a literal English translation and cut out many of
the Italian references on the ground that they would be too obscure for an
English audience. Poor Dario Fo: the English never did understand Italian
style.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Natalya Bessmertnova first danced in London with the Bolshoy Ballet in 1963.
We saw then an exceptional talent - imperishable memories remain of her
Autumn fairy in Cinderella, a flame in red chiffon - and in later years we
have admired her in the classics and in roles made by her husband, Yury
Grigorovich. She is returned now, as a couple of years ago, with a group of
Bolshoy principals, a small corps de ballet, and a repertory designed for
concert performance.
The dancers are, in the main, senior artists, and there is the faintest
whiff of grape-shot in the programme book's article about Grigorovich, in
which he talks about the necessary moment of retirement for dancers. 'Of
course it is possible for them to continue - possible to do, but impossible
to watch'.
I, for one, would have felt cheated if it were not possible still to watch
Bessmertnova. Her art offers a potent essence of movement. Physically she
retains the same exquisite style, the same intense sensibility, that she has
always brought to traditional roles. In the Wili act of Giselle, which
formed the first half of Monday night's programme, Bessmertnova seemed an
incarnation of a great Russian tradition, the ballerina as romantic icon.
The imagery - Giselle posed, arms folded across her breast; the
compassionate spirit bent towards Albrecht - recalled photographs of Pavlova
and Spessivtseva in this same scene. Her dancing, slightly - and, I found,
ravishingly  - scaled down, was translucent, vaporous as the night air. The
fruit of immense knowledge and a glorious theatre tradition, this was a
compelling reading, as luminous, poetic as the Giselle we find in Gautier's
original libretto.
From Leonid Nikonov's Albrecht, partnering of absolute security and a
sincere characterisation. From the attendant Wilis, excellently schooled
performances. A decent back-drop, good lighting - though Heaven's curse on
those follow-spots - provided a sure frame for Bessmertnova's
interpretation.
The rest of the evening comprised divertissements replete with fouettes and
yearning against white curtains; well-known participants - Natalya
Arkhipova, Mikhail Gabovich, Yury Vladimirov, Maria Bylova, Boris Yefimov -
and some new names. The ensuing catalogue of grins and spins and soulful
emoting looked all the more trumpery after the sublimities of Giselle, and
efficient though performances were, there is a limit to our taste for such
high-wire acts to a sound-track of Minkus and worse. (And a little worse
than needs be because of thin - though amplified - orchestral playing.)
Bylova and Leonid Nikonov turned acrobatics into ecstasy in Spring Waters,
and Bessmertnova and Yefimov were no less ecstatic, though more restrained,
in a duet from The Golden Age. All the fouettes were relentlessly applauded.
The Dominion must be the dreariest theatre in London, with a stygian
auditorium. The programme book has decided there are characters in Giselle
called 'Two Willisses'. You remember them, of course: they had that cottage
near the lake, and grew the most marvellous roses.
At the Dominion Theatre till April 18, then touring Britain until July 18.

Never trust a programme with an exclamation mark in its title. BBC2's new
arts magazine Artrageous] promises to celebrate work not because it is the
best, not because it is by artists judged to be the most talented, but
because it is produced by the young. Why? The frantic pursuit of yoof on
BBC2 and other parts of television is becoming pathetic (7.30).
At 8.00 on ITV, Inspector Morse fans are promised further personal details
about the beer-swilling detective with the old motor. In this final episode
of the present series, you meet his senile stepmother and his sensitive
stepsister. At this rate we should have a fully rounded portrait by about
2025 AD.
In the last of the Soul series (8.10 BBC2) Anthony Clare, presumably the
only shrink with a licence to broadcast, challenges the idea that machines

FT  15 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: The truth but not the whole
truth - Peter Knight assesses whether companies really benefit from showing
off their environmental credentials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More and more European companies are voluntarily lifting their environmental
skirts to reveal information about their green performance.
The revelations are in the form of publications aimed at the general public,
although some firms target specific groups, such as shareholders, employees
and the local communities in which they operate.
Many of the companies that have published environmental reports, however,
wonder if it is worth the trouble. The reviews are often ignored by the
public or criticised for being bland and empty by environmentalists.
The pressure to publish comes from both the public and the law.
Environmental groups and local communities are increasingly interested in
what pollutants are produced behind the factory gate. Industry - sometimes
begrudgingly - acknowledges that the public, especially local communities,
have a right to know.
Limited data on pollution are now available to the UK public under the
Environmental Protection Act. But this obligation is not as onerous as the
US's Superfund Amendment and Reauthorisation Act, and industry realises that
the quality of its voluntary responses will help determine the strength of
future laws.
Now companies are asking how much the publication of environmental data
really benefits a business. 'There seems to be a split between Americans and
Europeans on this issue,' says John Elkington of consultants SustainAbility,
who has worked with companies on their reports.
'People in the US are saying that their legal requirements to publish
information go far enough and there is no need to talk to a wider audience.
They're advising their European counterparts to throttle back on information
placed in the public domain.'
Regardless of this advice a small but highly influential group of companies
are continuing with their efforts to be more open about both the good and
bad elements of their environmental impact. Norsk Hydro's UK company led the
way two years ago with a comprehensive report, with verifying comments from
Lloyd's Register.
British Airways followed with a slimmer but highly factual report on its
Heathrow operations, compiled from a survey conducted by environmental
consultants Technica. These reports recently shared the first award on
environmental reporting by the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants.
BP produced a safety and environmental review, called New Horizons, and was
criticised for failing to publish concrete figures and clear improvement
targets. British Gas's first review is equally short on figures and talks in
general terms about the environmental issues facing the company, such as
methane leakage, derelict land and the problems of exploring in tropical
rain forests.
ICI's corporate environmental report, published last month, is more frank
than most. The company lists the number of prosecutions for environmental
transgressions worldwide (26 in 1991 and 36 in 1990) and gives data on the
amount of waste produced, the type and where it ends up.
Critics of ICI have called for greater detail, such as a breakdown of the
hazardous waste category into specific wastes. Some also question the
validity of the figures which were not audited by outsiders. Greenpeace says
ICI should publish more information about its continuing production of CFCs.
But by merely producing some figures, the company has demonstrated that the
data are collectible and can be presented in an accessible form. This puts
paid to the industry-perpetuated myth that such statistics are too difficult
to collect and impossible to present to non-specialists. 'If we are going to
gain the public's trust, then we have to publish the results,' says ICI
director Chris Hampson.
But he emphasises that the figures are indeed difficult to collect, mainly
because the process is new to the company and there are no standards. Shell
UK, which is in the process of collecting environmental information to
publish in the autumn, agrees with this argument.
Industry also feels that data on some wastes are commercially sensitive and
could be used by competitors to work out manufacturing cost and margins. The
UK's power producers use this argument to fight for the confidentiality of
information given by them to HMIP, the government's pollution agency.
But possibly more important, companies have to overcome internal resistance.
'Our people were concerned about us doing it because when you publish these
sort of figures you expect to get a lot of flak. We spent a year collecting
the data and working with the people at the plants to equip them to handle
the possible questions that might arise after publication,' says Hampson.
Chemical companies, supported by their trade associations, are making
greater efforts to talk to their employees and the communities which play
host to their plants. Dow Europe, the European arm of the US-based
multinational, is about to publish a review aimed specifically at employees.
It is also important that the companies are seen to be improving their
environmental performance, rather than only making vague promises. IBM UK,
for example, has published clear targets, including dates, of when it
intends to achieve certain goals.
Companies emphasise that their first reports represent an initial step and
that the quality of reporting will improve. 'The British Gas Review is a
statement of our current position. The next edition will be more factual and
more numerical,' says Mike Arnold, group director of safety and environment
at British Gas.
The quality of green reporting in the future depends to a large extent on
the corporate willingness to communicate both good and bad news. While there
indeed might be resistance from managers at the sharp end of the business to
reveal too much, the first round of reporting exhibits the glossy hand of
the public relations experts.
This often involves big photographs of happy, pretty people. The British Gas
report is a good example: full-page pictures of an old lady keeping warm,
and a young girl swimming in a gas-heated pool.
Rob Gray, a judge on the Chartered Association of Certified Accounts panel,
does not hold out much hope for voluntary reporting. 'I have real doubts
whether we will see regular, good and widespread reporting without
regulation. All the evidence from accountancy research shows that until
there is strong cajolery, it won't happen.'
Roger Hardman, environmental analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, agrees.
'Round promises are meaningless. Companies have been making statements in
their annual accounts about things like ethics and sexual equality for 20
years and nothing much has changed. I want to see hard evidence of
environmental improvement. And I want these reports to be written by
outsiders with a reputation for integrity.'
Steve Warshal, editor of Greenpeace Business, wants more. 'There's a big
information gap between our knowledge of what business does and what it says
it does. The ICI report, for example, does not say anything about the fact
that the company is the biggest producer of CFCs in Europe.'
While industry can be legitimately concerned about some of the commercial
drawbacks of being more open with the public, companies should take heart
from ICI's experience.
'When we completed the task of collecting and publishing the figures I asked
one of our plant managers what he would do differently,' recalls Hampson.
'He said: 'Next time I wouldn't lose so much sleep about it'.'

FT  15 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Nothing less than a green
revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'green' revolution comparable to the agricultural revolution of 10,000
years ago and the industrial revolution of the 19th century is needed to
halt global environmental degradation, according to Lester Brown, president
of the Worldwatch Institute, the Washington-based environmental research
foundation.
He is cautiously optimistic about the future of the planet even though the
institute's recent State of the World report says that the global
environment has deteriorated dangerously in the 20 years since the original
world environment conference in Stockholm.
Unlike the earlier revolutions he sees the new economic and social
transformation being compressed into a few decades. It will be based on the
need to stabilise population size to achieve a balance between humans and
the natural resources on which they depend.
The industrial revolution was made possible by exploitation of fossil fuels
but the environmental revolution will mean a shift away from these fuels
which give off carbon dioxide, the main contributor to global warming.
The annual report shows a dismal picture of continued decline in the
environment. Each year it records that forests are getting smaller, deserts
larger, topsoil is eroding, the number of plant and animal species is
diminishing, greenhouse gases increasing and stratospheric ozone depleting.
'There have been thousands of local environmental successes, many pieces of
national legislation, international agreements such as the Montreal Protocol
 -and still the trends are heading in the wrong direction,' he says. 'If all
these trends continue it will eventually undermine the global economy. We
cannot survive the continual degredation of the planet.'
He is gratified by the greater environmental awareness of many businesses.
In the early days they merely put in a public relations executive to deal
with such problems. At a later stage they began looking at their operations
 -energy efficiency, cleaner production, recycling and waste reduction.
Now, he says, some are asking if there is a place for man-made products in
an environmentally sustainable world? Brown says that for industries such as
coal the answer is no.
But in contrast there will be an enormous future for a company manufacturing
environmental technology such as high-efficiency light bulbs. 'In the 1990s
and the early 21st century there will be growth in such areas comparable to
the expansion in computers over the past two decades.' Contrary to much
current wisdom, he believes that solar energy, wind power and other
renewables will replace fossil fuels over a period of time.
'If an environmental tax on energy is adopted of the kind being proposed by
the EC we will see scales tilt dramatically and investment go into these
alternatives,' he said.
In California, where there are tax incentives for developing renewable
non-polluting energy sources, there are 1,400 megawatts of wind generating
capacity supplying more than 1m people. In addition, solar thermal energy,
using mirrors guided by computers to train sunlight on a cell, produces 400
megawatts of electricity for 500,000 people.
Cheap solar energy can also be used to separate hydrogen from water for use
as a fuel. He foresees companies in northern Europe investing in Spain and
Africa to develop these forms of energy.
Brown is encouraged by the greater environmental awareness in Britain but
points out that the UK is not a leader in energy efficiency or recycling. So
will mankind solve these problems? 'I think we can turn things around but it
will take a far greater effort than most people imagine,' he said.

FT  15 APR 92 / People: Structure demolished at Taylor Woodrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin Parsons, who took over the chairmanship of Taylor Woodrow less than a
fortnight ago after a surprise boardroom coup, has moved quickly to cut back
the proliferation of titles at the top of the loss-making construction giant
and introduce some younger faces.
He has dismantled the previous structure which included two deputy chairmen
and three joint managing directors and replaced it with a three-man senior
executive team led by himself. The other two are Tony Palmer, 55, the chief
executive, and David Green, 48, finance director, who only joined the group
in 1985.
Under the reshuffle, Peter Hedges, the 49-year-old head of the Taylor
Woodrow Property Company is stripped of his title of deputy chairman and
joint managing director, but his powerbase will be increased since he has
been given responsibility for the group's flagship St Katherine's Dock
development in London, which had previously been the preserve of Peter Drew,
the ousted chairman.
Walter Hogbin, 54, also loses the title of joint managing director, but
retains responsibility for the group's international construction business.
Meanwhile, John Topping, 62, the deputy chairman who has played a key role
in the development of the group's property interests, will retire from the
board after the annual meeting on June 12. Lord Bellwin, 69, who has been a
non-executive director for seven years, has resigned with immediate effect.
Although Taylor Woodrow has recently recruited Sir Kit McMahon, the former
chairman of Midland Bank, the group's team of non-executive directors looks
in needs of strengthening. Charles Hambro, the other non-executive director,
has sat on the board since 1962.

<TEXT>
Geoffrey Wilson, one of London's best-known developers, has given up his
executive role at Greycoat, the company he founded 14 years ago.
Wilson says he wants to oversee the company's strategic direction; it is
increasingly accepted in business that executive and non-executive roles
should be separated, he says. 'I intend to be an active and committed
non-executive chairman. There is no question of my departure.'
Although Greycoat is widely admired for its buildings, it is vulnerable to
the severe downturn in the London office market. Its shares, which stood at
397p last year, are now 33p.
Wilson, 58, says his decision has not been influenced by recent heart
surgery, from which he has totally recovered.
He will become non-executive chairman from August 1. Richard Guignard, the
company's long-serving finance director, now becomes managing director,
finance, Peter Thornton, currently joint managing director, becomes managing
director, property, and Christopher Strickland, construction director,
becomes development director. These changes take effect immediately.

If the first big announcement from Derek Wanless (above) as group chief
executive of National Westminster Bank is anything to go by the new regime
at the top of Britain's second biggest clearing bank may turn out to be less
exciting than expected.
Tom Frost, Wanless's predecessor, had already announced that Bert Morris,
57, would be replacing Roger Flemington as deputy group chief executive.
Wanless has now confirmed Morris's appointment - the only difference is that
he takes over immediately rather than at the end of May. In the past NatWest
has often operated with two deputy chief executives but it is understood
that Morris will be the sole deputy.
However, Wanless seems to be biding his time before reshuffling his team in
a more substantial way. He himself will retain responsibility for NatWest
Markets, which combines the group's corporate, investment banking and
trading operations. Meanwhile, Morris, who began his banking career in St

FT  15 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Perils clause is one-sided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEFTHERO Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Lloyd, Lord Justice Woolf and
Lord Justice Russell): April 1 1992
A CHARTERPARTY clause exempting shipowners and charterers from liability for
delay caused by specified perils including 'restraint of princes', does not
exempt charterers from demurrage liability in the absence of clear wording
to that effect, irrespective of whether the peril was operating before or
after the demurrage period began.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal from Mr Justice Evans's
decision that Voest Alpine Intertrading, charterers of the Lefthero, were
not liable for demurrage to the shipowners, Ellis Shipping Corporation.
LORD JUSTICE LLOYD said that on May 18 1983 Lefthero was chartered on Gencon
form to load and carry a cargo of steel products to Bandar Khomeini at the
head of the Persian Gulf.
The Iran-Iraq war was at its height. The dangers of sailing in those waters
were well known.
Laytime was to count continuously from arrival at the pilot station at
Bandar Abbas at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, until passing the pilot
station on the return voyage, except for actual steaming time to and from
Bandar Khomeini.
The vessel arrived at Bandar Abbas on July 7 where she gave notice of
readiness. From there vessels destined for Bushire and beyond proceeded in
convoy. Lefthero missed the first convoy but caught the next which left on
August 6.
From Bushire she continued in another convoy bound for Bandar Khomeini.
On August 10 the pilot turned back, on the ground that the vessel could not
make sufficient speed. If she had been permitted to proceed, she would have
arrived at Bandar Khomeini on August 12, with eight days laytime still in
hand.
On August 22, the vessel made a second attempt, starting four hours ahead of
convoy. Again the pilot turned back, for the same reason.
The parties agreed, without prejudice to liability, to discharge at Bushire.
Discharge was not complete until February 3 1984.
The charterers claimed damages for the owners' failure to discharge at
Bandar Khomeini.
Arbitrators rejected the owners' first defence, that Bushire was 'as near'
to Bandar Khomeini 'as the vessel could safely get' and was therefore an
alternative contractual destination. An addendum, which did not include
those words, prevailed over the printed words, which did.
The second defence was that Clause 28 of the charterparty provided that
'neither the vessel nor the owners or master nor the
charterers/shippers/receivers' should be responsible for any delay resulting
from 'Act of God, act of war, perils of the seas . . . restraint of princes
. . .'
The arbitrators held that the action of the authorities in requiring the
vessel to return to Bushire fell within 'restraint of princes'. There was no
appeal against that finding.
But then came the owners' counterclaim for demurrage. The charterers argued
that if the owners were protected by clause 28, so were they. What was sauce
for the goose was sauce for the gander.
The arbitrators said that just as the charterers' claim could not succeed
because of the 'restraint of princes' exception, the owners' demurrage claim
could not succeed to the extent that demurrage accrued due to the same
excepted cause. They said 'the owners can only recover demurrage to the
extent that it would have been incurred if the ship had been permitted to
discharge at Bandar Khomeini'.
They calculated that the vessel would have been detained 18 days beyond
laydays, which at Dollars 4,500 per day came to Dollars 81,000.
The owners appealed. Mr Justice Evans upheld the award. There was now a
further appeal.
On the face of it, the words of clause 28 were wide enough to cover
charterers' delay in discharging where it arose from restraint of princes.
If the charterers were not so protected, the clause was very one-sided.
But it had long been the law that to protect a charterer against liability
for demurrage, the language of the exceptions clause must be clearly worded
to that effect. In Kalliopi A (1988) 2 Lloyd's Rep 101 the Court of Appeal
held that 'Act of God, restraint of princes . . . unavoidable hindrances
which may prevent the loading and discharging . . . always mutually
excepted' in clause 36 of the charter did not protect charterers once
laytime had expired. Lord Justice Staughton referred to the maxim 'once on
demurrage always on demurrage', which he held was but an example of the
general principle that an ambiguous clause was no protection. Applying that
general principle he held the clause was insufficiently clear to protect the
charterers after expiry of laytime.
He quoted from The Dias (1978) 1 LLoyd's Rep 325,329 where Lord
Edmund-Davies said unless the meaning to be attached to the clause 'is
clearly the one urged by the respondents', the appeal should succeed.
The Kalliopi was followed in the Forum Craftsman (1991) 1 Lloyd's Rep 81.
There Mr Justice Hobhouse said 'the clause has to demonstrate a clear
intention that the exception should apply even when the vessel is on
demurrage'.
Mr Siberry for the charterers sought to distinguish Kalliopi. He pointed out
that the language of the two clauses was different.
But if anything clause 36 in Kalliopi was more favourable to the charterers,
since it adverted specifically to loading and discharging. Also it included
'always mutually excepted'. That might suggest the clause was intended to
protect the charterers after as well as before expiry of laytime; but that
was not the view taken by the Court of Appeal.
Mr Siberry's second submission depended on the different factual situation.
In Kalliopi Lord Justice Staughton referred to a justification for the maxim
'once on demurrage always on demurrage'.
If the vessel had discharged within her laydays, she would have been
unaffected by any subsequent cause of delay.
But if she was still discharging when the excepted peril supervened and
laydays had already expired, it could be said the cause of delay was not the
excepted peril, but the charterers' breach in failing to discharge within
laydays.
In the present case, the excepted peril, restraint of princes, operated
before laytime expired.
Mr Siberry contended that distinction was important. He said it meant that
'once on demurrage always on demurrage' did not apply - the cause of delay
was not charterers' breach, but the excepted peril.
That was, Mr Siberry contended, the true explanation of Kalliopi and Forum
Craftsman.
It was true that in Forum Craftsman the vessel was already on demurrage when
she was ordered off the berth.
But in Kalliopi the peril was in operation before the vessel came on
demurrage, so the factual situation was the same as in the present case.
There was no support for Mr Siberry's suggested distinction in Lord Justice
Staughton's judgment. He said: 'The vessel was already affected by
congestion during the laytime; the charterers' breach in failing to
discharge her within the laydays did not of itself cause her to be exposed
to any subsequent peril. However I do not regard that as a ground for
holding the general rule to be inapplicable.'
So it was clear that the court regarded the general rule as applicable even
though the vessel was not already on demurrage when the peril operated.
That disposed of Mr Siberry's second submission.
This was a case where the maxim 'once on demurrage always on demurrage', and
the various judicial explanations and justifications for the maxim, had
tended to confuse rather than clarify the issue.
If it was not already too late, it might be better if, within the general
principle stated in the Dias, the maxim were confined to the operation of
laytime exceptions, strictly so called, for example Sundays and holidays
excepted, which did not apply once laytime had expired.
The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.
For the charterers: Richard Siberry QC (Clyde &amp; Co).
For the shipowners: Timothy Young (Ince &amp; Co).

FT  15 APR 92 / Management: Long and short of being a director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abraham Lincoln, the 6'5' American president, was once asked by a heckler
how long a man's legs ought to be. 'Long enough to reach the floor,' he
said, providing the proper reply to such a question.
In an ideal world, a director's contract should also be long enough to reach
the floor - that is, long enough to get the job done. But 'just how long is
long enough?' is a question that has become central to the debate over how
to make directors more responsible to shareholders.
The Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, the panel headed
by Sir Adrian Cadbury, is expected to recommend that directors' terms be
limited to three years.
While that is too short for some of the panel's members drawn from industry,
it is far too long for those who represent investors.
Institutional shareholders have found the problem particularly worrisome
when they have tried to fire directors whose performance has been poor. A
sacked director with five years to run on a contract is an expensive
ex-director indeed, as shareholders have too often found.
Consider the case of Lasmo, the oil services company, which last year paid
Pounds 6.7m to the board of Ultramar which it acquired in a hostile bid. At
Ultramar, not only were the directors highly paid. They were also on
five-year rolling contracts, the maximum allowed under the UK Companies Act.
Contracts longer than that require special shareholder approval.
'It rather grates on shareholders that we have to pay through the nose to
get rid of incompetent management,' said Paddy Linaker, chief executive of
M&amp;G, the unit trust company and chairman-elect of the Institutional Fund
Managers Association.
'In this business, five years is not unusual and that is too long,' Linaker
said. He argues that directors should not generally be on contracts longer
than a year.
There might be exceptions: a chairman brought in to salvage a company
believed to be on the verge of bankruptcy, or one who had been poached from
a competitor, might merit a longer contract, he argues.
IFMA wants shorter contracts, not only because of cost, but because they
arguably provide greater protection against complacent directors. The group
argues that while contracts should be short-term, incentives should be
long-term. That way, good directors would have to stay longer to take
advantage of stock options and other perks that make their jobs so
attractive.
But not all shareholders take a hard line on directors' terms of office.
Some fund managers have coyly suggested that those of their colleagues who
take a softer view are themselves the beneficiaries of long-term contracts.
'You will find that the shareholder-owned companies take an easier view,'
said one fund manager at a mutually-owned life insurer. The fund manager,
who is on a one-month rolling contract, adds that his own situation is
typical of Scottish fund managers. Similarly, Linaker is on a one-year
contract while Charles Nunnelly, managing director at Robert Fleming Asset
Management and the current chairman of IFMA, is on a six-month contract.
But the Institutional Shareholders Committee, which shares offices with the
Association of British Insurers, has been far more cautious in suggesting
limits on directors' terms of office.
'We say that directors should offer themselves for re-election periodically
and we suggest that a third should be up for re-election every year,' said
one ISC member. 'And if you think that sounds thin, then I agree with you.'
Meanwhile, the ISC is arguing for greater disclosure of directors' service
contracts generally. Currently, companies are required to make the contracts
available to anyone who comes to their premises to view them during an 'open
period' lasting a few weeks each year.
But few institutional shareholders take up the offer.

FT  15 APR 92 / Management: Uniting against the rest of the world - The
restructuring of German industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A distinct chill has crept into many of Germany's boardrooms recently. The
domestic boom, caused by unification, which shielded German industry from
recession abroad, is coming to an end.
More seriously, foreign competition is increasing, not just from Japan but
also from the rest of western Europe where production costs are lower.
Companies throughout Germany have begun taking drastic action to shave costs
and strengthen their product ranges.
According to a poll by Munich's Ifo research institute, most German
companies are less satisfied with conditions at home than they were three
years ago, blaming high costs and taxes, short working weeks, and tough
environmental rules.
More than half have taken action, such as cutting their German labour force
or shifting output abroad.
Ominously, Ifo said the EC internal market and the opening up of eastern
Europe would intensify competition, not just between companies but also
between locations. Adding to industrialists' concern is the current wage
round, with claims approaching 10 per cent.
'In the past, we've been too generous with wage increases,' says Achim
Diekmann, managing director of the motor industry association (VDA). German
productivity is high, but European competitors are catching up. Moreover,
foreign labour costs are much lower; in the UK they are 60 per cent of
Germany's, in France 59 per cent, and in Japan 76 per cent.
Two companies whose actions show how German industry is facing up to the
stiff challenges are Kugelfischer, the bearings maker, and Degussa, the
precious metals, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals group. Both have experienced
steep falls in demand and are heavily dependent on non-German markets. They
also have strong ties to the motor industry, but their problems go beyond
just one sector.
KUGELFISCHER
Based in the German bearings capital of Schweinfurt in northern Bavaria, the
company has moved decisively to combat a slump in demand and disappearing
profits. Net income dropped by 42 per cent in 1990 to DM52m (Pounds 18m).
Last year, the company, which derives 60 per cent of its turnover from
abroad, made a loss of some DM80m.
It has cut its workforce and is striving to lower its fixed costs so that it
can avoid losses when operating, as now, at around 80 per cent of capacity.
Around a quarter of its west German workforce of 18,000 is on short-time
working. Order books contain enough work for less than six months, compared
with nearly eight months a year ago.
Further high wage settlements will make matters worse. 'We can't afford
settlements anywhere near last year's 7 per cent,' says Wolfgang Masuch,
commercial director. 'This will simply increase pressures on companies to
rationalise their domestic operations.'
Rationalisation is a polite word for cuts and closures. Kugelfischer has not
shut any west German plants, but it has hacked back its labour force.
Last year, it shed 5,600 employees. This included 3,400 at its new east
German bearings subsidiary where the job losses needed to improve efficiency
were increased after demand collapsed in eastern Europe.
In west Germany, most cuts were effected through early retirement and by not
replacing those leaving; there were fewer than 100 redundancies. Subsequent
losses will be more painful, and will involve up to 800 redundancies.
Kugelfischer is not only wielding the axe, however. It is also trying to
make its activities less dominated by bearings, which account for some 75
per cent of its DM4bn turnover.
This would balance its dependence on industries like vehicles and
engineering, though the textile sector - to which it sells industrial sewing
machines - is hardly buoyant either at present.
At the same time, it is upgrading production to make more sophisticated
products. 'We want to supply whole systems, not just components,' Masuch
explains.
Thus, Kugelfischer's car hub units include flanges to help lubrication and
assembly; it also makes a wheel bearing unit with sensors to monitor speed
for anti-skid brakes.
On the non-bearing side, its sewing technology has been expanded with a
hydro-cutter using a razor-thin water jet at twice the speed of sound to
slice through materials such as plastics and printed circuit boards, as well
as textiles.
DEGUSSA
With its grandly named Degussa 2000 strategy, the Frankfurt-based company
began trying to reshape itself in 1989.
Gert Becker, the chief executive, says this process has been speeded up as a
result of its declining performance, with net income down last year by 33
per cent to DM99m. 'It's an advantage that we can now say to the workforce:
'We've got to do this now'.'
Thus the company has also trimmed its labour force - by 2,200 people last
year to 33,000. A further 1,000 will go by autumn, 1993, possibly a third or
more through redundancies. For the first time, it is investing more abroad
than at home as it builds up specialty chemicals production mainly in the
US, but also in Brazil, India, Taiwan, and Belgium.
Degussa's wide product range includes materials for tyres and catalytic
converters, for animal feeds, and for environmental applications like
phosphate-free detergents.
Around 70 per cent of its DM13bn turnover comes from abroad.
It plans to float a minority stake of its expanding pharmaceutical
subsidiary, Asta Medica, on the stock exchange to raise funds, the first
time it has taken such a step.
Degussa is struggling to stem losses at Leybold, its vacuum technology unit
for which it is seeking a partner to develop products for the electronics
industry.
With the aid of McKinsey, the management consultants, Degussa has worked out
a programme to reduce central administrative and research staff and push
these functions out to the operating units; this will account for most of
the coming job losses.
Central overheads will thus be cut by about 25 per cent and research costs
will be more related to divisional needs. 'We've got to reduce the core of
Degussa and spread the group out more horizontally,' Becker says.
Examples like these abound in German industry. Kolbenschmidt, the vehicle
parts maker, plans to shift more piston output to France and Brazil.
Mercedes-Benz wants to cut car production jobs and buy more parts from
cheaper foreign sources like the UK.
MAN Roland, the printing machinery maker, is cutting its workforce by 750
people after a shrinkage in orders, although it declined to discuss this
while it was talking to the unions.
These companies know that when the world economy does finally pick up, their
competitors will still be breathing hard down their necks.
Thus the rest of the 1990s is likely to prove strenuous for managers and
workers alike as German businesses endeavour to avoid being overtaken by
their foreign rivals.

FT  15 APR 92 / Jobs: Mixed signs from employment market - Advertised demand
for managers still depressed despite pick-up for executive-search
consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST the best news. The Jobs column cannot remember when it last heard from
so many headhunters wanting posts they are offering dangled before FT
readers. What's more, not all of them are for insolvency specialists.
Indeed, the influx makes such a welcome change that to refrain from
outlining the offers right away might seem tantamount to looking a gift
horse in the mouth. But, having lately backed other horses of optimistic
colour that turned out to be the Trojan variety, I will first mention some
news which is not so good.
Its nub is in the table alongside, drawn from the MSL International
consultancy's quarterly counts of executive jobs advertised in UK national
journals. Each post so offered is counted as one, no matter how many ads for
it appear.
The table refers to the 12-month period ended on March 31 in each of the
past five years. The top part shows the 12-monthly counts for each of eight
broad categories of executive work. Next comes the total, which is then
broken down into the all-category tallies for the three-monthly periods.
As may be seen, the table gives a sadder view of advertised demand than the
preliminary results of the latest count, which MSL released for publication
as Britain went to the polls last Thursday. Those figures focused primarily
on the tally for January-March this year which showed a 13.1 per cent rise
on the previous three months.
The only trouble is that the demand almost always goes up between the last
quarter of one year and the first of the next. The average rise between them
over the dozen years since 1980 has been 19.8 per cent. So 1991-92's 13.1
per cent is not much to cheer about.
There is admittedly better news in the latest quarter's marketing and sales
tally, not given in the table, which shows a 4.4 per cent rise on
January-March last year.
In general, however, advertised demand stays low. True, it may have been
held down by recruiters waiting to see the election result. But I doubt
whether that would account for the 514 jobs by which the latest quarter fell
short of January-March 1991.
That is nevertheless perfectly compatible with the reported upturn in
business for executive-searchers and so-called contingency recruiters who
keep large registers of job-seekers in various fields. With so many good
people out of work or under threat, employers may reasonably think they can
obtain suitable recruits by such methods without advertising.
As long as those big 'buffer stocks' of candidates remain, recovery in
advertised demand is apt to be delayed. My hunch is that there will be no
marked increase until after the summer holiday.
NOW to some jobs. All are offered through recruiters who, being unable to
name their clients, promise to abide by applicants' requests not to be
identified to the employer at this stage of the hunt.
The first post, for a divisional managing director of a technical
engineering arm of a British group, is being handled by Bob Archibold of
Archibold Rae Consultants (11-13 The Broadway, Newbury, Berkshire RG13 1AS;
tel 0635 33445, fax 0635 36701.)
Based not far from London, the division has a Pounds 100m turnover and
embraces 17 companies in several countries. End-uses for its products range
from motor vehicles and farming machinery to precision electronic and
medical equipment.
Besides having a relevant degree, candidates should have built profits as
head of a Pounds 50m-Pounds 70m-turnover technical operation with branches
abroad. Acquisition experience also wanted.
Pay Pounds 100,000 or so, with car and prospect of share-options.
Next to Scotland where a UK group's subsidiary seeks a chief accountant
through Antony Taylor (Taylor and Taylor, 28 Buckingham Palace Rd, London
SW1W 0RJ; tel 071-828 7234, fax 071-630-0235).
Applicants should be qualified accountants skilled in people-management as
well as having success in the technical part of the job: to maintain tight
financial control across the multi-site company, including overseas
offshoots.
Salary about Pounds 35,000, plus car.
Thence to a marketing and sales directorship with a European group's
promotional-printing sub-sidiary in Wales, offered by Dermot Hoare of
Mandate Consultants (109 Jermyn St, London SW1Y 6HB; tel 071-586 3653, fax
071-911 0614).
On top of proven marketing and sales ability in a similar business,
candidates should have the general management skills to earn swift promotion
to chief executive.
Salary indicator Pounds 45,000 with bonus on results. Rest negotiable.
Lastly to two jobs in Hungary and another pair in Czechoslovakia, offered by
Graham Walker of Anthony Nevile International (69 Midton Rd, Ayr, Scotland
KA7 2TW; tel 0292 287969, fax 0292 611038). All are with acquisitions of a
London-based mining company.
The Czechoslovakian venture is in industrial-mineral quarrying, and needs a
general manager and a sales and marketing manager. The Hungarian centres on
quality stone for buildings, and needs a finance director and a production
manager.
Candidates must in all cases have relevant skills and industrial
backgrounds, plus appropriate language ability (German would do except in
the finance post which requires Hungarian) and overseas experience. Salaries
range upwards from UK equivalent of Pounds 45,000, with expatriate perks
where justified.

FT  15 APR 92 / Midland fined Pounds 50,000 for Dumenil failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Bank, which acts as one of the largest trustees in the UK for unit
trust investment schemes, was fined Pounds 50,000 yesterday for failing to
prevent circumstances which led to the closure of the Dumenil unit trust
group two years ago.
Administrative mistakes at Dumenil caused the price of units in its 11 unit
trusts, which covered various European markets, to be wrongly calculated.
The trusts, which at one time managed Pounds 86m for 25,000 private
investors, were subsequently wound up and investors paid out in full.
Midland, which with Coutts, a subsidiary of National Westminster, acted as
trustee to the Dumenil funds, had been responsible for ensuring the managers
of the trusts carried out their duties properly.
It has admitted three failures in its supervision of the Dumenil fund
managers, according to a statement yesterday by the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation, one of the City's self-regulatory organisations.
The bank has been ordered to pay the fine and Imro's investigation costs,
thought to amount to nearly Pounds 200,000.
Midland is one of the UK's top three trustees, being responsible for funds
under management of about Pounds 6bn, about an eighth of the UK market.
The failures to which Midland admitted are:
It did not take reasonable care to ensure the managers calculated unit
prices properly.
Its supervision of the schemes was not close enough to prevent the managers
breaching investment rules which limit the proportion of a trust's funds
that can be placed in any particular investment.
It failed to ensure a proper register was kept of the holders of six unit
trusts.
Midland yesterday called the failures 'technical rule breaches of an
administrative nature', and said it had acted to ensure its systems were
fully in compliance with Imro rules. Coutts' role in the Dumenil collapse is
thought still to be under investigation.

FT  15 APR 92 / BA counter-sues Virgin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is counter-suing its rival Virgin Atlantic, and its chairman
Mr Richard Branson, for libel over allegations that BA had used 'dirty
tricks' to win custom.
The move comes three weeks after Virgin began an action against BA for
alleged defamation. BA had asserted that the dirty tricks allegations were a
publicity stunt.
Explaining the decision to counter-sue, Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's legal
director, said: 'Virgin and Mr Branson have chosen to continue their
campaign against us by commencing legal proceedings. They have left us no
other choice.'
BA's decision followed within hours of Virgin's application for its case to
be listed for trial. Mr Justice Drake said the listing should be on June 15,
a decision which each side claimed as a victory. 'Virgin failed in its
application for a speedy trial,' said BA. Virgin replied: 'That's not true.
We applied for the earliest possible date which was June 15.'
Both sides seem entrenched in their positions. BA is not prepared to
withdraw unless Virgin does so first. Virgin said that it needed an apology
and a recantation of alleged actions to damage Virgin.
BA said it had conducted an internal review to check whether 'some corner of
the company' could be to blame for any orchestrated campaign against Virgin.
This review found nothing. It then decided to go ahead with the counter
suit, which claims that a letter dated December 11 and circulated to some BA
directors and the press was defamatory.

FT  15 APR 92 / Messages from the Titanic fetch Pounds 95,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S South Kensington raised Pounds 95,000 (against a Pounds 30,000
estimate) for a collection of 448 messages which were sent and received by
the Titanic, the luxury liner which sank in the North Atlantic on her maiden
voyage in 1912.
The top price was the Pounds 66,000 (estimate Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000)
paid by a telephone bidder for 85 signals sent and received by the Titanic
between April 12 and April 15, the morning she hit the iceberg that sank
her.
There was keen bidding for a 10-page letter by Harold Bride, a Marconi
wireless operator on board the ship, describing his experiences, which sold
for Pounds 8,250 (eight times its target). Another item that attracted
interest was a letter put up for sale by Eva Hart, one of the few survivors
still alive, which was given by her father, who went down with the ship, to
her mother, who was saved.
Christie's had been excited by the appearance of a previously unknown album
containing more than 50 drawings by Henry Fuseli. Its excitement was
justified - the album doubled its estimate at almost Pounds 750,000. The top
price was the Pounds 55,000 paid for a pen-and-pencil drawing of 'The
Massacre of the Innocents'.
The morning auction of Old Master drawings did well, totalling Pounds
687,764 and 94 per cent sold. A pastel of Princess Radziwill, painted in
1801 by Louise-Elizabeth Vigee le-Brun, just about doubled its estimate
fetching about Pounds 50,600.
The surprise of the auction was the Pounds 38,500 paid for a study of arms
attributed to the Circle of Michaelangelo. Its estimate had been Pounds
5,000. Obviously, the buyer believed it to be by the the master.

FT  15 APR 92 / School opt-out warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of one of the largest teaching unions conceded yesterday that
'opt-out' schools were 'here to stay' and had to be accepted by the
education establishment.
A rapid increase in the number of schools opting out of local authority
control lay at the heart of the Tories' election manifesto and will be a
high priority for Mr John Patten, the new education secretary.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of AMMA, the second-largest teachers'
union, warned teachers not to 'Siberianise' themselves after the election.
Teachers had to recognise that grant-maintained schools were likely to
become the norm, he said. 'They're here to stay, let's make them work,' he
said at AMMA's annual conference in Birmingham.
As yet only 213 of the 25,000 state schools in England and Wales have opted
out, with 80 seeking permission to do so.
Most of those are secondary schools. The government's short-term objective
is to encourage most of the 5,000 secondary schools to join them.
Grant-maintained schools are funded from Whitehall and have discretion over
their budgets and recruitment subject to statutory and national curriculum
requirements.
The Tory manifesto proposed that grant-maintained schools be allowed to
introduce formal selection of pupils 'if it fits in with the wider needs of
the local area'.
The conference rejected moves to link pay to performance and urged that the
plan to shift 80 per cent of teacher training to schools be delayed.

FT  15 APR 92 / Capital spending rise seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL spending by small companies in Britain rose 37 per cent in the
second half of last year, following two half-year periods of steep decline,
according to National Westminster Bank's small business investment index
published yesterday.
However, part of the increase came from businesses switching from overdrafts
to term loans. Excluding this factor the underlying upward trend was less
pronounced and did not mark a significant improvement in business
confidence, the bank said.
The rise in capital spending in the second half of last year was still only
half the level of early 1988.
The strongest recovery was in the Midlands and Wales where capital spending
rose 46 per cent compared with the first half of last year. Spending in the
south-west rose 41 per cent while the weakest upturn - 27 per cent - was in
north England.
The sharpest upturn in spending by investment category occurred in working
capital and stock. Spending rose by about 33 per cent, though from a very
low base.
The index is based on lending made under NatWest's Business Development Loan
Scheme.

FT  15 APR 92 / Fourth win bolsters hopes of long careers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE new junior ministers enter their departments for their first full day
in office today many are looking forward to long ministerial careers.
The fourth Conservative general election victory has reinforced the belief
among some former Tory backbenchers that they should not tolerate
obstruction from the Sir Humphreys of the Civil Service.
While some of those in the re-shuffle have spent almost their entire careers
in politics, others will bring business experience to bear. As long ago as
last year a few had considered 'management tactics' for their first days in
a department.
One said that though it was usual for junior ministers to go to the
permanent secretary's office to be briefed on arrival, he would insist that
the permanent secretary came to his office for the initial discussion.
He would also insist on senior officials always calling him by his
ministerial title rather than his first name, and would not allow meetings
to be put in his diary without his consent. Prospective ministers are
acutely aware of the danger of becoming bogged down in minutiae, losing
contact with the parliamentary party and lacking time to think
strategically.
Alongside the standard ploy of being particularly difficult and demanding in
the first few weeks, at least one other aspiring minister had in mind a more
detailed campaign for ensuring he got a grip on his department. This
involved identifying the most indiscreet member of his private office -
usually made up of youngish high-flyers  - and finding out which were the
dullest and worst areas of the department.
Armed with this information, he would, within the next few months, provoke a
row with the least satisfactory officials, and secure their transfer to a
backwater. 'Pour encourager les autres,' he said with a smile.
These are plans made before seeing the reality of the red boxes of
government papers. Even once they are familiar with their duties, new
ministers may be surprised at the volume of relatively unimportant but
reasonably urgent decisions they have to take. The number of unforeseen
engagements filling their days, and the briefings and draft speeches
involved, can also come as a shock.
After all, politicians have entered their ministries with brave words
before. Even if destined for long and successful careers, their time in any
junior post may be no more than about 18 months.
According to a recent report by Professor Richard Rose of the University of
Strathclyde, frequent reshuffles made many ministers 'toddlers rather than
veterans' in their departmental responsibilities.
The study said ministers' short terms in office encouraged them to
concentrate on topics that offered short-term popularity and hampered their
ability to direct government - but did make them good political ambassadors
for their departments. Yesterday's appointees have been warned.

FT  15 APR 92 / Ex-banker will bring panache to Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANTHONY NELSON, the new economic secretary to the Treasury, used his
detailed knowledge of the working of the City to press for more effective
regulation of the financial services sector during the passage of the
legislation which established the Securities and Investments Board.
Mr Nelson, MP for Chichester since October 1974, led the final stage of the
campaign for televising proceedings in the Commons and its most important
select committees.
A frequent participant in finance bill debates and a staunch advocate of
Britain's membership of the European Community, Mr Nelson will bring panache
and style to the Treasury team.
He was a merchant banker with NM Rothschild for four years before entering
the Commons and has served as a parliamentary private secretary to
middle-ranking ministers. He was also one of Mrs Virginia Bottomley's
'political minders' when she won the South West Surrey by-election in 1984.
Mr Nelson was one of the Tory backbenchers who successfully pressed Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to take action in his pre-election budget to
freeze the transitional element in the uniform business rate by ensuring
that the increase in 1992-93 did not exceed the rate of inflation.
He also had the prescience to declare his support for the whole strategy
underlying the Budget in his final speech in the last parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration and Congress are heading for another clash over the
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), the US's effort to develop a system of
anti-missile protection.
The two sides in the 'Star Wars' debate reached a compromise last year that
would have concentrated efforts on developing a limited, ground-based
anti-missile defence that would comply with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty
Under the compromise an SDI system would have been deployed at Grand Forks,
North Dakota, by 1996.
Leading senators, however, complain that the Defence Department's SDI
Organisation is still pursuing a more futuristic system of space-based
missile interceptors, using up funds needed to meet the 1996 deadline for
deploying a ground-based system.
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, clashed
last week with Mr Henry Cooper, director of the SDI Organisation, presaging
a fierce battle over the administration's request for Dollars 5.4bn (Pounds
3.13bn) of SDI funding in fiscal 1993  - an increase of nearly a third over
the Dollars 4.1bn allotted by Congress for the current year.
SDI's ambitions have dwindled from the grandiose vision of total defence
sketched out by former President Ronald Reagan. The collapse of the Soviet
Union has shifted the debate.
Today, congressmen are more concerned about an accidental or rogue launch
from the former Soviet Union or about future threats from countries such as
Iraq or Iran.
The Defence Department, however, regards the Grand Forks ground-based
interceptor system as inadequate protection. 'Such a defence would not
protect the US against the full range of threats,' the department's annual
report to Congress said.

FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: NZ looks for more trading ties with Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea is this year set to overtake the UK as New Zealand's fourth
largest trading partner, according to Mr Philip Burdon, the country's
Minister of Commerce.
The shift marks the increasing importance to New Zealand of trade in Asia,
where the country has 'a geographical advantage in servicing the dynamic
expansion of Asia's economies,' Mr Burdon noted.
Mr Burdon was speaking in London ahead of a seminar on Trade and Investment
in New Zealand. He attacked British business for missing investment
opportunities there, and complained that many in the UK retain a time-warped
impression of New Zealand as a 1950s-style appendage of the UK economy.
Over the past 20 years, in which New Zealand's farm products have been
progressively excluded from the EC market, Mr Burdon noted that Europe's
share of New Zealand exports has fallen from 49 per cent to 18 per cent. The
UK share has slumped from 36 per cent in 1970 to just 7 per cent in 1991. At
the same time, North America's share has fallen from 20 to 15 per cent.
Simultaneously, exports to Asia have leapt from 12 per cent to 36 per cent
of exports, which in 1991 totalled a provisional NZDollars 15.15bn (Pounds
4.8bn). Japan is now, after Australia, New Zealand's leading export market,
with South Korea fifth and Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong close behind. Mr
Burdon noted that South Korea buys no butter or fruit from New Zealand,
though these remain a large share of New Zealand's exports to the UK.
'We have moved from being a highly protected economy to a market economy
that complements the industrial strengths of Asia's growing economies,' Mr
Burdon said. 'Asia offers enormous opportunities to countries like ours. The
reconstructed NZ economy offers major investment opportunities in key
sectors like timber and fishing.'
These have attracted no UK investment. But investment in New Zealand from
Pacific region countries had been growing rapidly, Investment from Singapore
has grown from NZDollars 85m in 1990 to NZDollars 1.8bn in 1991. Mr Burdon
said the economy needed inward investment of about NZDollars 8bn over the
next decade.

BOEING of the US and Britain's GEC group are to study collaboration in
defence systems in response to shrinking military markets.
A broad agreement covering 'selective aerospace business opportunities' has
been signed between Boeing's defence and space division and GEC-Marconi, the
defence equipment arm of the British group.
Although described as a wide-ranging strategic alliance, the agreement is
expected to be of limited scope, at least in the early stages.
GEC-Marconi indicated that any co-operation was likely to focus initially on
maritime surveillance, with a view to upgrading or replacing the RAF's
current Nimrod patrol aircraft.
However, the two companies said they aimed to pursue possible joint projects
in a range of areas. These could include missile systems.
The precedent for an open-ended collaboration agreement of this kind between
US and British defence companies was set two years ago by British Aerospace
and General Dynamics.
However, their association has so far failed to produce significant concrete
results.

FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: EC set to take Seoul to Gatt over whisky
tax
</HEADLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC negotiators have failed to win sufficient concessions in two days of
talks on the 150 per cent liquor tax South Korea imposes on whisky, they
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Seoul.
The EC is now expected to try to take South Korea before Gatt on charges of
unfair trade practices, they added. Mr Gilles Anouil, head of the EC
Commission's Seoul delegation, said the chances of a Gatt action were
'high'. A decision was likely in May.
Seoul offered to cut the whisky tax to 120 per cent during the talks, EC
officials said. EC whisky producers say the taxes are imposed to protect
Korea's liquor industry, especially the local spirit soju, taxed at 35-50
per cent.
'We have consistently said we would take this case to Gatt,' Mr David
Wright, UK ambassador, said. 'We had hoped Seoul's request for these talks
meant they would have constructive proposals. This does not seem to be so.
We will look at the precise terms, but it looks as if we will have to carry
on to Gatt.'
If member states push for a Gatt case, the EC could ask to proceed to the
Gatt Council at its next meeting in mid-May, Mr Anouil said. 'I think there
is a high chance the (311) committee (advising the EC) will favour going to
Gatt.'
European diplomats said the paperwork for a Gatt case was virtually
completed before South Korea won an 11th hour reprieve in February by
offering talks. Spirits other than whisky carry what industry officials call
discriminatory taxes, with whisky attracting the highest duties. Other
imported spirits carry an 80 per cent tax while locally-distilled gin, vodka
and rum are taxed at 40 per cent.
Liquors carrying a tax over 80 per cent (all imported spirits qualify), also
attract a 30 per cent tax.
EC officials want to see the ad valorem method of levying tax, based on
import value, replaced by a straight tax on alcohol content. Under the ad
valorem method, the costlier the product, the higher the tax.

FT  15 APR 92 / Retail sales fall raises doubts over US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retail sales fell 0.4 per cent last month, raising doubts about the
momentum of the economic recovery.
The decline was the first since October and the largest for seven months. It
followed two months of surprisingly robust sales growth, which had raised
hopes that the economy was emerging decisively from recession.
Early estimates of car sales in April were also disappointing. In the first
10 days of the month, sales were estimated to be running at a rate of 5.8m
units a year, down from 6.1m units at the end of March which analysts
expected to hold steady.
Many analysts now view March as a period of renewed sluggishness of demand
and output. Employment hardly grew, and data for industrial production and
housing starts due later this week are expected to be weak. Most
forecasters, however, continue to expect a moderate economic recovery in the
second quarter.
The renewed signs of economic weakness - including a drop in the money
supply - prompted the Federal reserve last week to signal an unexpected
quarter point cut in short-term interest rates to 3.75 per cent.
Last month's decline in sales appears to have been broadly based. Excluding
cars - often a volatile component  - sales were down 0.6 per cent;
department store sales fell 3.1 per cent and those of building materials and
hardware declined 1.4 per cent. Sales of home furnishings, however, were up
2.1 per cent.
The sales decline in March only partially offset a sharp recovery in
consumer demand in January and February. For the first quarter as a whole,
sales were 2.9 per cent higher than in the 1991 final quarter and 4.5 per
cent higher than in the same period last year, which was artificially
depressed by the Gulf war.
The figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations but not for inflation.
Analysts remain concerned by weak employment trends. Without an increase in
jobs, personal incomes are likely to remain subdued, making a sustained
increase in consumption hard to finance.

The newspaper said Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin had told an

The head of the China Patent Office was also quoted as saying the revised
law would offer the same protection given in developed countries. The
legislative process should be completed this year, he added.

Taiwan, in an attempt to prevent trade retaliation from the US, has
submitted to the US trade representative a plan that will tighten the
island's resolve against copyright piracy, officials said, AP-DJ reports
from Taipei.
The move came after the breakdown of talks last week between the countries
on the issue of protection for intellectual property. The US demanded Taiwan
check all computer software and hardware before it is shipped from the
island. However, Taiwan rejected the request, claiming 'technical
difficulties' would hinder compliance.
Tsai Lien-sheng, department chief with the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT),
said Taiwan aimed to make the US government understand Taiwan's
determination to protect the copyrights.

FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: China still Taiwan's Gatt hurdle -
Taipei's attempt to join the world trade body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN's progress towards joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt) was given a fillip last weekend with the confirmation in Taipei by Mr
Martin Bangemann, European industry and internal market commissioner, that
the Community supports the island's application.
That Taiwan will eventually join Gatt is not in question. It is the world's
14th-largest trading nation, with a trading volume that reached Dollars
130bn in 1991. While the rest of the world wallows in recession, Taiwan's
economy is growing at about 7 per cent.
So far Taiwan's entry into Gatt has been delayed by political rivalry with
Beijing. Both governments, mortal enemies since the communists drove the
Kuomintang (nationalists) from the mainland in 1949, claim to be the
legitimate rulers of all of China.
Although both have agreed that Taiwan is to apply as the Customs Territory
of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, Beijing insists that it be admitted
first.
Political differences might not prove the only obstacle. A range of tariff
barriers and outright bans on foreign goods and services remains to trouble
Taiwan's main trading partners. Agricultural products are subject to an
average import duty of 21.6 per cent, compared with an average of just under
9 per cent of duty on all imported products, and one big sticking point has
been a ban on imports of uncured EC meat, ostensibly for fear of foot and
mouth disease.
Other restrictions include a ban on UHT (long-life) milk from the EC and a
40 per cent duty on British confectionery. Preferential tax-rates on US
beef, spirits and cigars have led to complaints of discrimination from
Australia and EC countries.
Further liberalisation of Taiwan's insurance laws is already under way, but
has not as yet been extended to foreign insurance companies. Foreign banks
are still limited in the number of their branches, and range of products
they can offer.
Foreigners are not permitted to be majority shareholders in a
Taiwan-registered company, and so far have only managed to make mutual
investments or joint ventures in certain key, high-tech industries.
But while financial services and investment show a general trend towards
liberalisation, a much more closed shop attitude prevails when it comes to
tendering for contracts in Taiwan's Dollars 300bn infrastructural
development plan, where a lack of personal contacts and knowledge of
bureaucratic shortcuts leave all but the most aggressive foreign bidders out
in the cold.
But these restrictions are insignificant compared with the progress which
must be made across the Taiwan Strait before China can accede to Gatt.
Waiting for China could still prove the greatest obstacle for Taiwan.

JAPAN'S fair trade commissioner yesterday protested at US plans to enforce
American anti-trust laws against foreign companies, AP reports from Tokyo.
US Commerce officials attending a Tokyo conference on anti-monopoly laws say
a recent decision to carry out such enforcement dates back to 1890. But the
long precedent does not impress Japanese officials, who assert they will
appeal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for
help to block the US plan.
Mr Setsuo Umezawa, Japan Fair Trade Commission chairman, said he feared
attempts to enforce US anti-trust rules against Japanese companies would
'obstruct economic relations' and damage mutual trust between the two
anti-monopoly watchdogs. 'Violations should be dealt with by the authorities
in the country where they occur.'
The US and Japan have agreed to end some differences in US and Japanese
business and legal traditions, to minimise trade friction. But Mr Umezawa
said he believed extra-territorial enforcement by the US Fair Trade
Commission would be going too far.

FT  15 APR 92 / Tehran's overtures to central Asia fall on deaf ears:
Michael Field debunks the view that Iran will export Islamic revolution to
its northern neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL FIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IRANIAN deputy minister recently led a delegation to the former Soviet
republic of Tajikistan. At the close of the talks, the two sides decided it
would be brotherly to draft the minutes in Persian - in theory, their common
language. It took a day for the Tajiks to find a Persian typewriter. Then
nobody knew how to use it, except the deputy minister. He typed the minutes.
At about the same time, a Turkish-speaking mullah from Iranian Azerbaijan
went to former Soviet Azerbaijan to give a lecture on Islam. After his talk,
his hosts served sandwiches and vodka. The mullah was horrified. He
explained that alcohol was prohibited by Islam. And then he was hurt to
discover that not only were the Azerbaijanis unaware of this, but that, on
being enlightened, lost interest in the meeting and drifted away.
Episodes such as these have taught the Iranians three things:
Central Asia and Transcaucasia have become culturally very distant from Iran
during 70 years of communism. The population there is not ripe for Islamic
revolution.
The whole area is very poor.
In the west and some conservative Arab countries there is a belief that the
Iranians have been provided with a golden opportunity by the break-up of the
Soviet Union and that they will try to export revolution and strengthen
their position to undermine pro-western regimes in the Middle East.
In Tehran, the situation looks very different.
Even though it was invaded from the north twice this century, by Russia in
1915 and the Soviet Union in 1941, Iran has had an easy relationship with
its superpower neighbour for the past 40 years. After Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who is now Iran's president, visited Moscow in 1988, the Soviet
Union became an important trading partner and a supplier of sophisticated
arms, including MiG 29 fighters.
The Iranians now suppose that their relationship with Russia, with which
they have no border, will be more distant, and, meanwhile, have been
presented with a series of challenges that they fear will underline their
weakness.
Moreover, there is no chance of exporting their revolution because it is
almost a thing of the past in Iran itself, except in official rhetoric and a
few hardline pockets in the government and religious establishments. The
former Soviet republics know about the chaos that Iran inflicted on itself
by its revolution, and can see that Iran needs nearly as much reconstruction
as they.
The Iranian mullahs would like, at least, that they, and not Saudi Arabia,
should exert the main influence in bringing the new republics back to Islam.
But they are hampered by the fact that most Iranians are unorthodox Shia
while their northern neighbours, except some Azerbaijanis, are Sunnis. Also,
Saudi Arabia has more money for building mosques.
Secular members of the government hope that Iran will be a more important
economic and social influence on central Asia and Turkey. But it will not
be. Iran is physically closer to central Asia, and it will be a route for
the republics' trade with the west, but in every other way the Turks have
the advantage.
Turkey is a secular state whose more religious inhabitants practise Sunni
Islam, which is more or less how the central Asian republics would like to
be. All the central Asians, bar the Tajiks, speak Turkish, though, at a
recent meeting of regional states in Tehran, the Turkish ambassador said he
could follow what the Azerbaijanis were saying, but that what the others
spoke was so impregnated with Russian it was 'only a form of Turkish'.
The Turks have a strong, nity, big contracting companies and good political,
financial and trading links with Europe and America. They seem much better
placed than Iran to provide the goods and economic expertise the central
Asian republics want.
It is often said outside government circles in Tehran that Iran and central
Asia lack 'complementarity.' The central Asians need capital, strong private
sectors and contact with international business, which is exactly what Iran
needs itself.
Turkey's advantages worry the Iranians: they see the Americans in the Gulf,
regard the Turks as American proxies, and fear that they are about to be
surrounded by US influence. They are resentful that the outside world seems
to have ignored their efforts to mediate in the fighting between
Azerbaijanis and Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh.
The worst prospect of all is that the emergence of independent Asian
republics could lead to Iran's own minorities starting secessionist
movements. Like many Middle Eastern countries, roughly half of Iran's
population is composed of minorities: Turkomans, Azerbaijanis, Baluchis,
Arabs, Armenians, Kurds. Many of these are Sunni Moslems. There are no Sunni
ministers and no senior officials from any of the minority groups except the
Azerbaijanis, whose potential for secession used to worry the Shah. This led
to many Azerbaijanis, who were more sophisticated than the other minorities,
being promoted, particularly in the Foreign Ministry.
Traditionally, the dominant Persian community has not tried to crush the
cultures of the minorities, as Turkey and Iraq have tried to do with the
Kurds. There has been a general acceptance that Iran is composed of a group
of races - an empire, as it was known in the Shah's day.
In only one of the minorities, the Kurds, is there any secessionist movement
at present. Among the others, the idea remains theoretical: there was no
sign of the Arabs in the south-west wanting to join Iraq when their
territory was invaded in 1980.
Still, if the present changes in the region were ever to lead to a
rearrangement of frontiers, it is quite possible to imagine the Azerbaijanis
demanding union with former Soviet Azerbaijan and/or with Turkey, and the
Turkomans wanting to join Turkmenistan. A major disincentive to secessionist
movements is the poverty of the central Asian states.
Nevertheless, the mere thought of secession in Iran increases the sense of
isolation of a nation which already feels very much on the defensive.

THE Sudanese government is torturing and detaining opponents without trial
despite a 1991 claim that it was releasing all political prisoners, the
human rights organisation Amnesty International said yesterday, Reuter
reports from London.
'Torture, brutal beatings and short-term detention in secret detention
centres. . . are the Sudan government's standard reaction to dissent,'
Amnesty said in a news release.
The government of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir came to power in a
military coup in June 1989 and announced a general amnesty for all political
prisoners in April 1991.
Nearly 300 prisoners were released, but Amnesty said more than 60 remained
in detention without trial. Others were rearrested shortly afterwards. More
dissidents had since been imprisoned without fair trials, Amnesty said.
The Sudanese government has branded critics of its human rights record as
'colonialists'.

CHINA has given loss-making state factories the power to set their own wages
in another blow to the 'iron rice bowl' system that guarantees millions of
workers a lifetime of employment, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Economic reformers led by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping have set their
faces against the system that saddles state industry with huge, unnecessary
costs.
The China Daily said yesterday that the central government had recently
issued a directive giving factory managers, instead of distant bureaucrats,
control over wages and bonuses.
The immediate aim is to create pay scales that reward individual effort and
skill - instead of length of service and political performance  - and thus
boost productivity.
Eventually, economic reformers want a free market in labour as part of wider
market-oriented changes that will give enterprises autonomy over prices and
production, and make them responsible for their own profits and losses.
Foreign investment in China is booming with the value of approved projects
in the first quarter more than doubling over the same period a year ago, the
China Daily said yesterday.

FT  15 APR 92 / N Korea delirious for Great Leader: The 80th birthday of Kim
Il Sung, cult dictator in a country weak with hunger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG gifts to mark his 80th birthday today, North Korean dictator, Kim Il
Sung, the world's longest-reigning head of state, has landed yet another
title to an impressive collection. The Great Leader, Beloved Leader and Ever
Victorious Captain of the Korean People, is now also Generalissimo.
His birthday presents include a quilt and sleeping mat stuffed with down
from the necks of 700,000 sparrows slaughtered for the occasion, 400 tonnes
of pork from China and a birthday visit from Chinese President Yang
Shangkun, aged 84. China is North Korea's closest ally, one of the few
remaining after the collapse of communism in Europe.
The Chinese president had a rapturous, flower-strewn reception from waving
crowds tens of thousands strong when he arrived in Pyongyang on Monday, the
Xinhua news agency reported. (Foreign correspondents have largely been
barred.) The drilled crowds lining the streets rhythmically chanting welcome
slogans, and the dancing in Kim Il Sung Square, were shown prominently on
Chinese television news, a reminder of how things used to be done in Beijing
before Chinese communist mythmaking about the workers' paradise gave way to
greater realism.
Diplomats say the excesses of its increasingly anachronistic ally are
something of an embarrassment to China which is endeavouring to encourage
Kim to greater moderation, an end to isolationism and a strategy of economic
reform.
The Respected and Beloved Comrade, the Greatest Genius Humankind Has Ever
Had, the Legendary Hero and Outstanding Leader of the Revolution, some of
the epithets routinely applied to Kim by North Korea's media, has ruled the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a rod of iron for nearly 44
years, coming to power in 1948 at the age of 36.
Kim's elaborate personality cult, easily a match for the cult of Mao Zedong
at its height, has littered the country with 35,000 Kim statues. Every
house, office, school, shop and labour camp displays Kim portraits. His
collected thoughts run to 37 volumes, republished in large editions to mark
the birthday celebrations.
Kim, a mild-faced, stocky, bespectacled figure with an unsightly goitre on
his neck - he refuses to submit to the surgeon's knife  - is always
portrayed a head taller than those who stand adoringly around him. Greater
love hath no man than Kim. He 'embraces in his bosom . . . even those people
who committed wrongdoings'. His 'revolutionary comradely love' is the
'pinnacle of human love'.
American officials have warned that what they see as an unpredictable
regime, megalomaniac, isolated and confronting economic collapse, is pushing
to develop a nuclear weapons capability (though the country's parliament
last week ratified an agreement signed in January with the International
Atomic Energy Agency to open its nuclear facilities to inspection).
A future government under Kim's anointed successor, his son Kim Jong-Il, may
be equally unpredictable.
The corpulent 50-year-old Dear Leader, described in foreign diplomatic
circles as 'plump, pampered and psychotic', is becoming the subject of
almost as much adulation as his father. He is even on occasion called Great
Leader, a title once reserved exclusively for the elder Kim.
Nepotism is not uncommon in communist regimes but this is the first time any
communist leader has tried to devolve power directly to a member of his own
family - it would create the world's first communist monarchy.
For the 23m who live there, the reality of North Korea is a long way from
the paradise of the relentless propaganda. The regime's response to food
shortages is to warn of the harmful effects of over-eating. Pyongyang
television recently reported, as a lesson to others, the case of a man who
died when his stomach burst because he ate too much rice.

in Tokyo today to discuss the financing of environmental protection, the
Japanese government will be relieved if the talk is of lofty ideas rather
than down-to-earth proposals.
The meeting, an important precursor to the Earth Summit in June, is an
indication of Tokyo's determination to be a leader in the debate on the
environment. However, the three-day gathering could also highlight the
contradictions of a Japanese environment policy that means well but has yet
to be given the substance of hard political decisions.
Hosted by Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, and sponsored by
the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), the
meeting will produce a 'Tokyo Declaration' intended to stimulate pre-Earth
Summit debate and provide guidelines for assisting the economies of
developing countries.
After the meeting, the eminent persons, including Mr Jimmy Carter, former US
president, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former Singapore leader, and Mr Barber Conable,
former World Bank president, will be expected to exercise an enlightened
influence on their own governments' summit proposals.
However, the meeting could provide evidence that the expectations for the
June summit are too great, and highlight the reluctance of governments to
support fine sentiment with policy changes and money.
Mr Takeshita, who still runs the largest faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic party, has previously explained that holding the conference here
reflects 'Japan's intention to play an active role'.
It is appropriate that the Keidanren, Japan's Federation of Economic
Organisations, is co-hosting the conference, as its presence will be a
reminder of the important role Japanese industry plays in influencing
official policy.
Larger Japanese companies have publicly embraced environmental themes with
enthusiasm, but their strong opposition to policies limiting domestic growth
has hampered Tokyo's role in the international debate on the environment.
The government is discussing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, but the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) opposes such a tax.
Japan has two targets for the stabilisation of carbon dioxide emissions, a
Miti target and a target set by the Environment Agency, and depending on
whom you consult, each is the 'official' target.
The Environment Agency calls for a freezing of total emissions at present
levels by the year 2000, while the Miti target allows for an 8 per cent
increase in emissions by 'freezing' at per capita levels.
Japan has gone much further than the US in the carbon dioxide debate, but
the ambiguity of these policies has contributed to lower expectations of
Tokyo's influence on the environmental debate. The country is still often
seen as more a provider of funds than of inspiration.
Miti takes the view that technology transfer is a useful Japanese
contribution to the environment. The eminent persons' conference will
discuss the delicate issue of who should pay for developed countries'
technology transfers. It is a question particularly relevant to Japan during
a period of economic slowdown. The large increases in Japanese aid during
the late 1980s were supported by the longest period of post-war economic
development, but the stock market collapse and a slowing of tax income has
put pressure on the aid budget.
Conference delegates will discuss a timetable for a gradual increase in
official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of developed countries'
gross national product (GNP), with a view to using some of the increase for
environmental protection. In Japan's case, that would mean a rise from 0.31
per cent, an increase that the finance ministry will not tolerate in the
present financial conditions.
Fujitsu, the electronics maker, yesterday announced that it will phase out
by next March the use of harmful chlorofluorocarbons in semiconductor
washing. And, a few weeks ago, Toyota Motor, the largest car maker,
announced its own Earth Charter, drafted by a newly formed Toyota
Environment Committee.
The eminent persons should applaud such corporate commitments to the
environment, but they would also be advised to emphasise to the Japanese
government that its own contribution to the debate needs to be as
unambiguous as the promise made by Fujitsu.

FT  15 APR 92 / Tokyo department store sales fell 7.8% in March

<TEXT>
SALES at Tokyo department stores fell last month fell by 7.8 per cent last
month compared with March 1991, in an indication that the economic slowdown
is spreading from industrial to consumer markets.
The decrease was the biggest since 1965, except for some months in early
1989 when the normal pattern of sales was disturbed by the introduction of a
consumption tax.
Economists warned that the figures are an imperfect guide to consumption
levels because about 20 per cent of Tokyo department stores' business is
accounted for by corporate buying of gifts and luxuries for offices. These
purchases have been badly hit by the slump in the financial markets.
However, economists say the data cannot be dismissed entirely since it
showed declines in sales across the board - by 6.3 per cent in clothing, 4.7
per cent for personal effects, and 12.7 per cent for household goods. Sales
of sundry goods, which includes many luxuries bought by companies, dropped
19.4 per cent. Food sales rose 1.1 per cent.
Meanwhile, debts of bankrupt companies have reached a record high because of
the slump in the financial and property markets. Teikoku Data Bank, a credit
research agency, reported that debts of bankrupt companies with liabilities
of over Y10m (Pounds 43,200) soared 122 per cent in the year to March to
Y7,773bn. This was well above the previous annual record of Y4,340bn, posted
in 1985.
The number of bankrupt companies rose 64 per cent to 11,767. The biggest
debt was the Y410bn left behind by the collapse of Egawa, the Osaka
restaurant operated by Ms Nui Onoue, the central figure in a loan fraud
scandal.
The agency said bankrupt property-related companies left debts of Y2,447bn
and insolvent financial investment groups Y1,478bn - both record figures.
Tokyo Shoko Research, another agency, reported a similar trend, saying that
the debts of bankrupt companies rose 148 per cent to Y8,138bn.
One piece of good news came in a report from the Bank of Japan showing that
wholesale prices in March fell 1.4 per cent, the seventh monthly decline in
a row.

NIGERIA'S President Ibrahim Babangida has established an advisory body
including former military and civilian rulers to help him tackle the
country's problems, state radio said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lagos.
'The newly reconstituted Council of State must. . . be viewed as a
constitutional artifact to help forge a common approach to the challenges of
nation building in our federal system,' Gen Babangida said at the opening on
Monday.
Nigeria's first post-independence head of state, Mr Nnamdi Azikiwe, former
military ruler Gen Yakubu Gowon and the last civilian president, Shehu
Shagari, attended the meeting in Abuja, the capital.
President Babangida said the council of state, which last met in its present
form a decade ago, was expected to smooth the path to a civilian republic by
January 2.
It will seek solutions to economic problems, including a large foreign debt
and heavy dependence on imports.

FRENCH inflation remained stable in March, and significantly below the
average of its main trading partners, according to provisional figures
released by the National Statistical Institute.
The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent in March, following similar
increases in February and January, and takes the year-on-year increase over
the past 12 months to 3.2 per cent.
The margin by which French inflation is undercutting that of Germany has
widened since the start of the year, and now stands at 1.5 percentage points
over the past 12 months.
This month the authorities expect a very slightly higher increase in the
consumer price index (up 0.4 per cent), but are forecasting a rate of
inflation for the year as a whole of only 2.8 per cent.

FT  15 APR 92 / EC bank governors sound pay warning
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL BANK governors from the European Community yesterday issued a thinly
veiled warning to Germany that it should try to contain wage inflation, for
the sake of progress towards economic and monetary union (Emu).
In their first annual report on EC monetary and financial conditions, the
central bankers' committee said their attempts to co-ordinate interest rate
policy would not be enough on their own to guarantee falling inflation and
economic convergence.
'The national authorities will not only have to rein back fiscal deficits
where they are excessive, but strong efforts should also be made to contain
wage pressures,' says the report, which the committee has to publish as part
of the Emu process.
Germany, which is currently grappling with escalating wage demands, is not
named, but the report says such respon-sibilities are particularly important
for member states 'which play a pivotal role in shaping the economic and
financial conditions in the Community'.
After yesterday's monthly meeting of central bankers, Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
head of the Bundesbank, said all his colleagues were convinced the bank was
pursuing the necessary monetary policy.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish central bank and the committee
chairman, said it was clear that many countries resented having to increase
short-term interest rates in line with Bundesbank policy. But he added: 'The
policy mix in Germany is not the sole responsibility of the German monetary
authorities.'
The report refers to the difficulties of co-ordinating monetary, wage and
fiscal policy without disturbing EC exchange rates.
'If the benefits of exchange rate stability are to be preserved, a monetary
response to shocks originating in one country. . . . would be quickly
transmitted to the other Community countries,' it points out.
EC central bankers are trying to co-ordinate interest rate policy as a
prelude to stage two of Emu, which begins in 1994 with the establishment of
a European Monetary Institute (EMI) with broadly the same tasks.
The EMI will itself be replaced by a European central bank, when a date is
set for EC members move to a single currency, no later than 1999.
Mr Hoffmeyer said yesterday that the committee had not discussed the
sensitive question of the location of the EMI and central bank, which he
said was a matter for national governments.
Separately, Mr Hoffmeyer confirmed that Sweden was discussing linking the
krona more closely to the Ecu.
He warned that there could be difficulties in arranging 'associate'
membership of the EMS, because of the new obligations that would impose on
Sweden and existing members of the system. 'The question is whether you can
find a system where there is closer co-operation short of full membership,'
he said.

FT  15 APR 92 / German public service unions call strike vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S power struggle over pay has entered a critical phase following the
collapse of negotiations between government and public service unions on
Monday night.
The four main unions involved, representing all public services, yesterday
called strike ballots for next week after rejecting the employers' final
offer of a package worth 4.8 per cent - effectively a wage freeze.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister responsible for the employers'
negotiating team, claimed the increase, payable to around 3m employees,
would cost federal, state and local governments an extra DM15bn (Pounds
5.2bn) a year.
Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the oTV union, the second largest after
the engineers' IG Metall, said the employers' proposal was an encouragement
to strike.
The offer came during resumed talks after an arbitration panel last week
proposed - and employers rejected  - a compromise increase of 5.4 per cent
plus DM600 in back-pay and holiday allowances.
The oTV, with 1.25m members, is the main force in the public services
sector. It represents a wide range of local authority employees, including
dustmen, nurses, bus and tram drivers, power and water workers. The three
other unions involved represent white collar, federal railway and postal
staff. Results are expected by Friday April 24, and the oTV threatened
immediate stoppages if the necessary 75 per cent vote for action was
achieved.
The employers' position is underpinned by determined resistance from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Bonn administration, which is committed to strict
controls on public spending and wants all available resources, including
company profits, funneled into the east German economy.
At the personal level, Mr Seiters wants to show his mettle in advance of
this autumn's cabinet reshuffle. Ms Wulf-Mathies, meanwhile, who last year
won a 6 per cent increase for her membership, faces re-election in June when
her 10-year term of office ends.
Wavering public sympathy for union demands has so far tended to favour pay
moderation, although the direct impact of disrupted public services may
influence the mood.
The previous public sector strike, which lasted three chaotic days in
February 1974, ended with employers' capitulation and an 11 per cent pay
award. All services were affected in many large towns. In the Rhineland
Palatinate, power workers cut off the state government's electricity for the
duration.

FT  15 APR 92 / Car sales edge down in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales fell to an estimated 1.34m in west Europe last month, a 1.7
per cent decline from 1.36m in March 1991. This follows three months of
small year-on-year increases.
According to industry estimates, new car demand in 17 west European markets
in the first quarter rose 0.5 per cent to 3.69m from 3.67m a year ago, when
sales were depressed by the Gulf crisis.
Despite the continuing strong recovery in Spain, where sales jumped by an
estimated 28.4 per cent, European demand was pulled down in March by the
continuing recession in Britain. New car registrations there were 15.2 per
cent lower than a year earlier, the 29th consecutive monthly year-on-year
fall. Sales weakened too in Germany from last year's record levels, with an
estimated 3.1 per cent fall.
In the other two big volume markets, demand in Italy remains at a high level
with a further increase of 1.8 per cent in March, while sales in France were
virtually unchanged.
Declines in several smaller markets were led by a drop of 30.6 per cent in
Finland. Across west Europe March sales were lower than a year ago in 10 of
the 17 markets; first quarter sales were lower in only six.
The most notable gains in the first quarter were achieved by BMW, which has
overhauled Mercedes-Benz, its arch domestic rival, for the first time. BMW
is estimated to have increased its sales volume in the first quarter by 19.6
per cent to 118,000; Mercedes-Benz sales fell by 6.3 per cent to 116,000.
BMW claimed 3.2 per cent of the market in the first quarter compared with
2.7 per cent a year ago, while Mercedes-Benz's share fell to 3.1 per cent
from 3.4 per cent.
Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, is losing ground dramatically and
suffered a 27.2 per cent fall in sales volume in the first three months.
It has been hit hard by the recession in the UK, where it continues to gain
most of its sales, but even there it is drastically under-performing the
depressed market.
Among the big six volume carmakers, Volkswagen has opened up a record lead
over its main rivals, helped by the much weaker performance of Fiat. The two
French manufacturers, Renault and the Peugeot group, which includes Citroen,
were the fastest growing volume carmakers in the first quarter, however,
with sales increases of 8.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively.

FT  15 APR 92 / Now Sweden faces being model of unemployment: The shock of
the virtually unknown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMPLOYMENT agency in Stockholm reported four vacancies in the
construction sector last week: it wanted a plumber, a construction worker, a
driver for an earth-digger and an asbestos-remover. With 4,000 unemployed
construction workers on its books, there was no shortage of applicants.
In a country which has traditionally placed great emphasis on full
employment and the right to work, the fact that unemployment has reached its
highest level since records began in the 1970s has come as a shock to many
Swedes.
The Labour Market Board, which administers the employment system, is close
to breaking point in providing retraining programmes for the jobless and the
centre-right coalition government has come under considerable pressure from
the unions to reduce the number of people out of work.
Official unemployment reached 4.2 per cent in March according to the Central
Statistics Bureau, while in addition at least 3 per cent of the workforce -
the 'hidden' unemployed - are registered in retraining schemes and temporary
jobs.
Economists forecast that open (or official) unemployment is likely to reach
between 5 and 7 per cent in 1993, putting further strains on the retraining
schemes.
'If unemployment threatens to approach 5 per cent and pressure on the
government increases as a result, unemployment could be seen as a risk for
the government's stability,' says a recent report from Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank in Sweden.
Faced with a recession both at home and in Sweden's main export markets of
Europe and the US, much of Swedish industry has been forced to reduce
production and cut costs.
SAS, the Scandinavian airline, Saab Automobile (the car company jointly
owned by General Motors of the US and Saab-Scania), and Volvo are among the
biggest names in Sweden to have cut hundreds of jobs.
A report from the National Institute of Economic Research last week warned
that nearly half the 1,862 companies it surveys have cut jobs in the first
quarter of 1992, and about 40 per cent of the companies expect to make
further cuts in the second and third quarters.
The construction sector has emerged as one of the most severely hit as the
property bubble of the 1980s has burst. Real estate prices collapsed in
1990-91 and office construction has slowed. Unemployment in the construction
sector is 17 per cent, and a high proportion of the unemployed in this
sector are men in the 16-24 year age group.
However, in the next three years there is likely to be a shift towards
increasing unemployment among public sector workers, especially women who
tend to work in the social welfare services such as nurseries and care of
the elderly.
Already, up to 25,000 of the 1.2m Swedes working in the public sector are
expected to lose their jobs in the next three years because of cuts planned
in the January 1991 budget, including railway and telephone company
employees.
The Social Democrats' determination to maintain full employment during their
administration resulted in severe wage-push inflation in the late 1980s.
Unemployment in the Stockholm region was 0.7 per cent in 1988-89, according
to Mr Per-Olof Edin, chief economist at LO, the Swedish blue-collar trade
union confederation.
'We cannot handle such an overheated situation,' says Mr Edin.
'However, I think we can handle unemployment of 2-2.5 per cent, and if we
could get down to 3 per cent (unemployment), which is realistic in one or
two years, it doesn't create a risk for wage levels.'
The danger, he admits, is that if Sweden returns to full employment, fears
that this would push up inflation would probably spark an outflow of capital
from the country.
At the moment, though, as unemployment rises, the Labour Market Board is
finding it increasingly difficult to provide retraining for the jobless.
Mr Robin Lapidus, spokesman for the board, says: 'We cannot handle
retraining for more than an average of 3 per cent (of the workforce). At the
moment we have about 165,000 out of a workforce of 4.5m - or over 3 per cent
 -on training programmes,' he says, though he adds that there are seasonal
fluctuations.
'Above 3 per cent we cannot guarantee the quality and administration of
training courses unless we get more money or more personnel.'
LO has asked the centre-right government (which came to power last autumn)
to cut unemployment by bringing forward plans for new construction projects
and by encouraging high-school students to opt for three-year (rather than
two-year) final courses.
At least, it is argued, this could provide a temporary solution until the
Swedish economy starts to pick up and companies begin to boost their
workforces again.'

FT  15 APR 92 / EBRD: East Europeans say EBRD is failing them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EAST Europeans have sharply attacked the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD) at its first annual meeting in Budapest for its
failure to meet the financing needs of the region.
The bank has responded by saying its hands are so tied by the strict
restraints of its founding charter that is unable to disperse much of the
money it already has.
In Budapest, Mr Ivan Kostov, the Bulgarian finance minister, complained that
the EBRD had approved only one investment in his country, and had none in
the pipeline. 'We need the help now; in two years it might be too late.'
The bank is nowhere near exhausting its starting capital of Ecu10bn (Pounds
7.16bn). In the words of Mr Attali the bank 'has more money than projects'.
The main difficulty is that the bank's ability to address a wide range of
economic problems is boxed in by the EBRD's founding charter and the
powerful directors shareholding countries put in place to rein in Mr
Attali's ambitions.
He came smack up against those constraints this week, when he proposed a
special restructuring facility containing a combination of soft loans and
high-risk equity. But the initiative was pushed aside by the US and other
shareholders which want the EBRD to stick to its brief.
In its first year the bank approved about 20 projects and committed Ecu620m
(Pounds 444m). But those results must be viewed against Mr Attali's
grandiose ambitions and his estimate of Ecu4,000bn for east Europe's needs.
The EBRD is thought by investment bankers, however, to have made a promising
start given its tight remit.
But isolated achievements have failed to satisfy east Europeans whose high
expectations were inflated by Mr Attali's rhetoric.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czechoslovakian finance minister, summed up the
region's reaction: 'So far the role of EBRD in our part of world has been no
more than marginal.'
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, was yesterday appointed new
chairman of the EBRD board of governors. Mr Waigel repeated Bonn's
objections to the bank offering soft loans, although he said an exception
could be made to finance urgent safety work on eastern European nuclear
reactors.

FT  15 APR 92 / Labour sets July deadline for selection of leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPENING shots in the Labour leadership battle were fired last night as
Mr Bryan Gould found himself with just 12 weeks to halt the bandwagon
rolling for his rival and odds-on favourite, Mr John Smith.
Mr Gould called for a period of reappraisal after the election defeat, while
Mr Smith presented himself as the candidate of continuity.
Both declared their candidacies yesterday while the party's national
executive agreed a compromise July 18 date for the election's conclusion -
later than Mr Smith's supporters wanted, but much earlier than the October
date favoured by the Gould camp.
Mr John Prescott, the transport spokesman, became the third candidate to
enter the race by declaring his bid for the deputy leadership, a post also
being contested by Mr Gould.
Both Mr Smith and Mr Gould called for the fullest possible participation by
union members, including balloting wherever feasible, to complement voting
by MPs and constituency parties.
Mr Smith presented himself as the natural heir to the policy reforms
undertaken by Mr Kinnock. The fundamental task for Labour, he said, would be
to build on the party's principles.
Arguing for policies to convince voters that prosperity is best advanced by
a government which works for the welfare of the whole community, he said:
'Modern government should be pluralistic, decentralised and should be
underpinned by recognition of individual rights.'
Presenting himself as the candidate for change, Mr Gould insisted that the
party needed 'a period of serious reflection about what went wrong and what
needs to be done,' and promised a 'positive and radical agenda.'
''One more heave' may have been the right response to our 1987 defeat,' Mr
Gould said, echoing pundits' claims that Mr Smith was better suited to fight
the election just past than the one to come. 'It is a wholly inadequate
response to our 1992 defeat.'
There are clear differences between the two on economic policy. Mr Gould
said it was necessary to discuss broader issues beyond the 'very narrow
terrain' of tax policy, such as Britain's weighting in the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Smith has always insisted that a Labour government would not tamper with
sterling's exchange rate.
Both stopped short of open support for a new electoral system. While Mr
Smith said he would await the Plant committee's findings, he made clear that
the Labour party 'must be free to reach its own conclusions.'
By contrast, Mr Gould said the conclusion of the Plant committee should
trigger a wider debate with all the political parties and other groups.
Neither candidate would endorse the possibility of an electoral pact or
coalition with the Liberal Democrats.
Mr David Blunkett, the local government spokesman, is acting as Mr Gould's
campaign manager. Mr Robin Cook, the health spokesman, is acting for Mr
Smith.

FT  14 APR 92 / Serbs demand private banks return their cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROWDS in Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav federal capital, yesterday
demanded the return of their savings from private banks whose licences have
been revoked by the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), writes Laura Silber.
Many people deposited their life savings with Dafiment and Jugoskandik,
private banks in Serbia, in order to receive interest rates up to 10 times
higher than the official rate on foreign currency deposits. But the NBY
revoked the licences of the banks, which were opened last year, saying they
should not have been permitted to operate at all. A western economist said
the closure appears to result from a conflict between the National Bank of
Serbia and the NBY. He said that the two private banks would most likely
continue to operate, buying up hard currency to the benefit of the Serbian
National Bank.
This most recent financial scandal is part of the overall deterioration of
the Serbian economy. Inflation has hit a monthly rate of 60 per cent and
industrial production has fallen by more than 30 per cent. The rising price
of hard currency has helped to boost the black market.

FT  14 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE stocks fell in the wake of Friday night's IRA bomb attack in the
City as financial analysts struggled to put a figure on the value of the
blast damage. Estimates varied wildly but there appeared to be some
consensus of as much as Pounds 1bn.
Commercial Union lost 4 to 425p. The company will be affected not only by
the disruption to its business but also because it owns 20 per cent of its
headquarters, which were rendered unusable by the explosion. Sun Alliance,
cushioned by reinsurance but still estimated by one analyst to be in line
for a Pounds 40m hit from the attack, fell 4 to to 262p and even General
Accident, whose exposure will be limited because of its concentration on
personal clients, lost 5 to 435p.
Mr Richard Wynne-Griffith of BZW's insurance team said: 'This is another
blow to already weakened balance sheets and unlike a hurricane it is not
necessarily a one-off incident.'
Midland advance
The London market picked up rumours sweeping Hong Kong that a 400p a share
bid for Midland would be launched on Wednesday and the UK clearing bank's
shares jumped 16 to 372p with a hefty 10m shares traded.
Observers said that Hongkong &amp; Shanghai bank's parent company, which
proposed an agreed takeover a month ago, was prepared to make an all-paper
bid valued at around 420p. There is a belief that Hongkong wants to
undermine an anticipated attempt by Lloyds Bank to make a rival offer.
County NatWest was highlighting to clients yesterday the logic of a rival
bid from Lloyds, which eased a penny to 395p after being 6 off at one stage.
Allied-Lyons weak
Comments by Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of the Office of Fair
Trading, hit Allied-Lyons particularly hard, as he questioned some of the
long-term supply agreements between national brewers and the pub-owning
groups.
Sir Gordon told the AGM of Camra, the real ale lobby group, that long-term
supply agreements between brewers and pub retailing companies were becoming
an alternative tie and that the agreement between Foster's, brewer of
Courage in the UK, and Grand Metropolitan should not be seen as a precedent
for seven-year supply agreements.
Analysts said these remarks appeared to be specifically aimed at the
Allied-Lyons deal under which it has kept a 60 per cent beer supply
agreement in pubs owned by Brent Walker. Allied shares fell 12 to 612p.
Whitbread 'A' lost 6 to 425p in sympathy. Whitbread is believed to be less
advanced than Bass in meeting the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruling
on brewing ties. Bass gained 12 to 600p.
Construction group John Mowlem rose 13 to 148p despite a crash in 1991
profits to Pounds 3m from Pounds 34m. The market was looking for around
Pounds 10m, but the shares were marked higher after Mowlem said it was
withdrawing completely from commercial property development activities.
Higgs &amp; Hill, with results due tomorrow, gained 8 to 82p in sympathy, while
building materials company Redland climbed 14 to 538p on hopes of an early
end to the recession and speculation about lower interest rates.
Worries about Barclays' exposure to Olympia &amp; York's financial problems on
the day that the Canadian property group was expected to try and persuade
its lenders to reschedule more than Pounds 2bn worth of debts prompted the
shares to drop 12 to 315p, the biggest percentage fall of any of the FT-SE
100 companies yesterday.
Turnover in Scottish Power, was a very active 18m shares, with the price
rising 2 to 98p. Scot Hydro gained 2 to 100p, taking the shares up 22p since
the election result and back to their partly paid flotation price.
The Electricity Package slipped Pounds 30 to Pounds 3010.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce surged to 8.9m and the shares initially jumped 7
after it was reported that Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific was about to
place a Pounds 300m order.
The shares closed 3 up at 170p.
Trafalgar House moved 7 forward to 132p, after its J. Brown subsidiary won a
Pounds 350m power station contract.
Turnover in Queens Moat Houses reached 10m, as the shares fell 2 to 80p.
Dealers believe that close examination of the sector after Friday's buying
spree revealed the company's earnings recovery to be lower than that of its
rivals.
BT put on 6 to 341 in high turnover of 9.2m, as investors continued to buy
stock in anticipation of 'better times', now that the threat of a Labour
government and greater regulation has faded. Reassurance about the company's
prospects and outlook following the series of analysts' visits lifted Cable
&amp; Wireless 13 to 558p. US buying continued to lift Vodafone Group. The
shares gained 7 to 356p. Kidder Peabody Runyon of the US reiterated its buy
recommendation on the stock.
Defensive chemicals companies lost ground in the wake of the general
election. BOC and Allied Colloids, which are both big dollar earners, fell
13 to 663p and 7 to 203p respectively.
Thames Television improved 7 to 168p after an announcement that it was
jointly planning the development of a new satellite television programme
service with BBC Enterprises.

FT  14 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ahead as Chemical cuts
its prime rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER last week's dramatic fluctuations, business on US stock markets was
relatively subdued yesterday, with the main indices posting modest gains in
very light trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.53 at 3,269.90, its
high for the day. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up
1.82 at 406.09, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks firmed
3.91 to 588.15. Turnover on the NYSE was extremely low at 143m shares.
Concern about political turmoil in Russia, where the government submitted
its resignation yesterday, surprise at Chemical Bank's decision to lower its
prime lending rate from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent, and a string of first
quarter earnings reports pulled market sentiment in different directions
during the morning session.
Trading was also conducted against the background of last week's unexpected
easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which in just two days
added 90 points to the Dow. Those gains were sustained yesterday by hopes
that the Fed will soon ease again to inject life into the economy.
Among individual stocks, Goodyear jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 3/4
after the group's chairman, Mr Stanley Gault, told shareholders that sales
during the first quarter would be around Dollars 2.7bn, the highest in the
company's history for the first three months of a year. Net income for the
period would come in between Dollars 60m and Dollars 65m, a substantial
improvement on the Dollars 90m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago.
Ford firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 40 1/4 in active trading after the car
manufacturer announced plans to invest almost Dollars 3bn in North America
over the next three years to design and build a new mini van, develop new
engines for future light-duty trucks and expand an existing assembly plant
for production of F-series trucks.
Among mostly firmer or steady bank stocks, Chemical eased Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 31 7/8 after the group unexpectedly cut its main lending rate. The
big banks usually change their rates simultaneously. Yesterday's rate cut by
Chemical suggests that it expects further easing from the Fed and that it is
trying to get a head start on its main rivals by offering cheaper funds to
customers.
JP Morgan eased Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 1/4 despite reporting a 10 per cent
increase in first quarter profits to Dollars 299m. The lack of reaction was
due to discounting - the market had already bid the stock up in anticipation
of strong earnings.
There was a stronger reaction to record first quarter profits at Primerica,
which owns the securities house, Smith Barney. The stock rose Dollars  7/8
to Dollars 39 1/2 in active trading.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended slightly higher in light dealings. Based on
preliminary data, the composite index rose 13.19 points, or 0.39 per cent,
to 3,389.83. Volume was 19.5m shares against 23.8m shares on Friday and
trading value was CDollars 178.4m against CDollars 260.8m.
The metals and mining sub-group posted a 2.31 per cent gain on index.
Financial services were up 1.18 per cent. Golds were up moderately.

FT  14 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rate rumours revive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION of an interest rate cut raised its head in the early hours of
yesterday's trade, prompted by sterling's strong gains on the foreign
exchanges. However, most traders felt a cut was unlikely within the next few
weeks.
Overnight rates fell as low as 7 1/2 per cent, with money available in
sufficient quantities throughout the day. However, the futures market seemed
uncertain about a rate cut, and had 'no real direction' according to one
trader.
The June contract firmed from an opening level of 89.94, implying an
interest rate of 10.06 per cent, to 89.85 at the close. This implies an
interest rate of 10.15 per cent.
Market traders, initially excited by the idea of a base rate cut, found
themselves moving to a more conservative position. 'I don't think the
Chancellor is in that much of a hurry,' said one dealer. 'A cut has got to
be done within the framework of the ERM and the DM2.95 band.'
Many speculated that the UK would move to cut base rates, and join the
narrow band of the ERM, when it assumes the presidency of the European
Community this summer.
The Bank of England seemed to fuel the rate cut speculation, however, as it
took early action to eliminate record shortages.
The Bank initially forecast a squeeze of Pounds 2.35bn and stepped in with
assistance of Pounds 2.32bn before lunch. The biggest drain came from bills
totalling Pounds 1.2bn due for repurchase by the market. Exchequer
transactions called for a further Pounds 860m, treasury bills and maturing
assistance Pounds 559m, and bankers balances below target Pounds 330m. A
Pounds 610m fall in note circulation eased some of the pressure on
liquidity.
The bulk of the Bank's morning trade was comprised of a Pounds 1.6bn repo
agreement falling due on May 1 at 10 7/16 per cent. A further Pounds 500m
repo, falling due on May 13, was pitched at 10 15/16 per cent. Other
purchases were in bands one, three and four bills at rates of 10 3/8 , 10
5/32 , and 10 1/16 per cent.
In the afternoon the shortage was revised to a record high of Pounds 2.75bn.
The Bank purchased bands one and two bills totalling Pounds 451m at 10 3/8
per cent, and offered late assistance of Pounds 40m.
In Germany, call rates firmed from 9.60/65 per cent to 9.60/70 per cent. In
the US, Federal funds traded at 3 5/8 per cent, just below the new presumed
target of 3 3/4 per cent.

FT  14 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Investors push gilts toward German yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH continued to flow into the UK government bond market, extending the
euphoria of last week's general election result and pushing sterling bond
yields closer to their German counterparts than at any time since last
summer.
With 10-year gilts gaining around half a point, the market continued to
shrug off the threat of substantial new issuance of bonds. However, many
observers expect this to return to the top of investors' agenda once the
post-election rush is over.
Apart from the net Pounds 28bn needed this year to fund the UK's public
sector borrowing requirement, there is also the danger of further issuance
if, as widely feared, the true borrowing requirement was understated for
political purposes in the run-up to the election.
The Bank of England took a step further towards hitting its funding targets
with the issue of an Pounds 800m tranche of gilts. The 10 per cent stock due
2003 - which followed two other Pounds 800m tranches issued in at the end of
last week - was reported to have sold out quickly.
Market estimates put the Bank's total gilt sales - both official and
unofficial - at anything from Pounds 3.5bn to Pounds 5.5bn since early
election results began to suggest the return of majority Conservative
government.
Yesterday, longer-dated bonds advanced strongly, while shorter-dated paper
was held back by a belief that interest rates are unlikely to be cut
immediately. The benchmark 9 3/4 per cent bonds due 2002, which opened at
103 15/32 , advanced to 104 3/32 in late afternoon trading, a yield of 9.12
per cent.
Converted to an annual yield - a comparable basis to German government bonds
 -that is equivalent to 9.33 per cent, or around 145 basis points higher
than bunds. Analysts expect any further narrowing of the yield spread to be
slow.
According to Mr Philip Tyson, an analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew: 'It's
going to have trouble coming in much more than that in the near term. We are
targetting 120 basis points for the year end.'
Gilt futures, which opened at 98.25, rose a point before falling in later
profit-taking to close to their opening, with a heavy 97,000 contracts
traded.
CONCERN about political upheaval in Russia, where the government of Boris
Yeltsin has submitted its resignation, boosted US Treasuries.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  1/4 at 101
19/32 , yielding 7.854 per cent. Prices were even firmer at the short end of
the market, with the two-year note up  1/8 at 101 3/16 and the yield down to
5.088 per cent.
In early trading, the market benefited from a 'flight to quality' by
investors, spurred by worries that uncertainty in Russia would spill over
into world financial markets. Investors traditionally favour US government
bonds during times of political turmoil, and shorter-dated securities
usually benefit more because they are regarded as safer and more liquid
financial assets.
The short end of the market was also buoyed by talk that the Federal Reserve
was buying in securities ranging from three-month bills to two-year notes.
Although there was no confirmation of the talk, analysts suggested the Fed
was probably buying the securities for a customer, usually a foreign central
bank or big international institution such as the World Bank.
The Fed stayed out of the credit markets, with Fed funds trading at 3 5/8
per cent. Some observers said the Fed's willingness to refrain from
intervening at that rate suggested its new target for Fed funds might be 3
1/2 per cent, and not 3 3/4 per cent as originally thought on Thursday when
the Fed eased monetary policy.
GERMAN government bond prices softened, with the uncertain underlying tone
of the market compounded by events in Russia.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, opened
at 8.26 but fell to a low of 88.00 and proved unable to sustain a recovery.
The contract closed at 88.04, with volume at 48,500 contracts.
In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent unity bond maturing 2002 closed
at 100.60, from 100.80 at the close on Friday, for a yield of 7.90 per cent.
The announcement from Russia reminded bund market participants that the
economic and political problems of eastern Europe could still spill over
into Germany. Recently, the market has been focused on the economic
prospects within Germany.
A positive note was sounded by a report from five German economic research
institutes which suggested economic growth of around 1 per cent in western
Germany this year, down from 3.1 per cent in 1991. A slower rate of growth
could lead to lower inflation expectations and an easing of monetary
conditions in the second half of the year.
A strike of public sector workers is likely if talks between employers and
unions fail to reach an agreement over pay. Employers have offered a five
per cent increase. The unions are claiming a settlement in line with the
average for private sector pay deals, currently around 6 per cent.
Traders said the government's determination to impose a lower wage
settlement could contribute to lower inflation and interest rates later in
the year.
JAPANESE government bond prices fell sharply overnight in Tokyo, despite
intervention by the authorities to prevent further downward pressure.
The Ministry of Finance offered to buy up to Y50bn each of the benchmark
government bond issues Nos 129, 121 and 122 - funding the purchases from a
sinking fund. The action supported bond prices for a short time, but selling
pressure returned to drive prices lower.
The benchmark issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield of 5.495 per
cent, up from 5.445 per cent on Friday. The June bond futures contract
closed at 101.61, down 0.28 of a point on the day. Volume was 35,290
contracts.
Analysts said the bond market remained cautious about the outlook for
inflation as the government looks to support both the slowing economy and
sliding stock market through fiscal expansion.

Dollars 1m

<TEXT>
MR Robert Stempel, embattled chairman of struggling US car manufacturer
General Motors, saw his salary cut by 30 per cent to Dollars 1m last year in
the wake of the company's Dollars 7bn operating loss.
The cut in salary means Mr Stempel has not enjoyed a pay rise in all his
three years at the helm of the country's biggest car producer.
According to proxy statements released by GM yesterday, Mr Stempel was not
alone in suffering a big pay cut. The company's seven most senior executives
together earned Dollars 4.4m in 1991, down sharply from the Dollars 7.5m
they earned in 1990, and less than half the Dollars 11.3m they made in 1990.
The revelation of Mr Stempel's pay cut comes just a few days after a 'palace
coup' at GM which reduced his power within the company. In a stunning move
on April 6, GM's non-executive directors, impatient at the pace of change
within the company, ousted Mr Stempel from his position as chairman of the
company's key executive committee.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Safeway posts Dollars 4.9m loss
in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, the California-based supermarket group which was subject to a
Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, yesterday reported an after-tax
loss of Dollars 4.9m in the first quarter of 1992.
The result underlines the increasingly tough competition being faced by US
food retailers.
Safeway's after-tax figure compares with a Dollars 26.7m profit in the same
period a year earlier.
Sales during the first quarter shrank slightly, from Dollars 3.4bn a year
ago to Dollars 3.39bn, and operating profits were down from Dollars 122.8m
to Dollars 102.4m.
Interest expenses fell from Dollars 86.5m to Dollars 70.3m, leaving a profit
before extraordinary items of Dollars 22.9m, compared with Dollars 26.7m in
the same period a year earlier. Safeway then incurred a Dollars 27.8m
extraordinary item related to the early repayment of debt, creating the
after-tax deficit.
The company said same-store sales had been slightly higher in the US, but
declined 1.2 per cent overall.
It blamed low level of food price inflation and heightened competition in
certain markets for the lack of progress. Safeway shares slipped Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 14 1/2 at close of trading.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia shareholders fight
Skandia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders in Hafnia Holding, the Danish insurance group,
claim to have raised sufficient shareholder support to call an extraordinary
shareholders' meeting and to block the proposed takeover of Hafnia by
Sweden's Skandia.
Opposition to Skandia has been led by the LD Fund, controlled by the Danish
trade unions.
Mr Jeppe Christiansen, the fund's investment manager, said yesterday there
was support from large and small shareholders for the extraordinary meeting.
He said such a meeting would be called when shareholders have an alternative
solution to the takeover by Skandia.
Skandia agreed to take over Hafnia last Thursday after negotiations with its
board. Hafnia has been financially weakened by an attempt, with Norway's UNI
Storebrand, to gain control of Skandia. The aim was to set up a Nordic
insurance alliance.
Skandia has made its bid conditional on acceptance by 90 per cent of the
capital and votes in Hafnia.
Analysts maintain the bid is far too low. Mr Lau Svendsen, from the
Copenhagen broking firm Fibroco, said the bid, worth about DKr2.7bn (Dollars
429m) at market value, is worth less than the book value of Hafnia Holding's
equity, which is about DKr3.1bn.
The bid takes no account of Hafnia's goodwill value or the goodwill
write-offs, worth about DKr1.2bn.
A shareholders' revolt can only succeed, said Mr Svendsen, if they can find
an alternative solution to Hafnia Holding's problems. This means they must
find a way of selling Hafnia's 14.8 per cent stake in Skandia and its 33.7
per cent stake in its domestic rival Baltica.
The stake in Baltica has created speculation that the outcome of the Hafnia
shareholders' action could be a merger between Hafnia and Baltica, a
solution which was discussed two years ago but fell through.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: La Generale's net profit falls
38% to BFr7.6bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL gloom has again hit Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's
largest holding company, which yesterday announced a 38 per cent drop in net
profits for 1991 to BFr7.6bn (Dollars 223m) from BFr12.2bn.
But the group said there were 'positive signs' of growth in 1992, and plans
to maintain its dividend at BFr84 per share as a sign of confidence in the
future.
An improved result from the group's service companies - which include
banking and insurance subsidiaries - underpinned the 1991 figures. They
recorded improved current profits of BFr6.3bn against BFr5.03bn.
But profits at many of La Generale's industrial companies slumped - in
particular at Acec-Union Miniere, the 76 per cent-owned non-ferrous metals
subsidiary, and Gechem, the chemicals subsidiary, both of which made losses.
They helped drag down the sector's contribution to just BFr800m from
BFr6.57bn. In 1989, the industrials made BFr15.2bn and the whole company
recorded net profits of BFr20.1bn.
The group said it planned to inject BFr3bn of new capital into Gechem, and
was looking for industrial partners for Acec-Union Miniere, or for any of
the group's 12 'business units'. Mr Gerard Mestrallet, La Generale's
managing director, said the holding company would be prepared to sell some
of its stake in Acec Union-Miniere, but would retain a majority interest.
The group's current result, before exceptional gains, slipped to BFr4.5bn
from BFr6.3bn. Mr Mestrallet pointed out that if Acec Union-Miniere were
excluded, group profit had actually risen slightly during 1991.
With the industrial economy in the doldrums, La Generale has been hamstrung
by its dependence on stakes in cyclical industrial groups, and in recent
months its share price has reacted most favourably to rumours that it plans
to spin off its zinc, chemicals or cement subsidiaries.
But Mr Mestrallet said yesterday: 'La Generale isn't a company which is
getting smaller and smaller, and which has to divest companies to keep
itself afloat.'
He pointed out that the estimated value of the group's holdings had nearly
doubled to BFr177bn since the end of 1987 - before Mr Carlo de Benedetti,
the Italian entrepreneur, unsuccessfully tried a takeover.
La Generale was rescued from that bid by Compagnie Financiere de Suez, which
now owns 61 per cent. Suez and Groupe AG, part of the insurance company
Fortis, have both agreed to complete the purchase of their shares in La
Generale releasing BFr11.3bn of capital.
La Generale also stands to receive a further BFr3.9bn from Accor, the French
hotels group, when the Belgian company exercises a put option and sells some
of its shares in Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism company. Accor and
La Generale mounted an agreed bid for Wagons-Lits last year.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Goodyear expects record sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last of the big US tyre-makers, yesterday said
it expected to post record first-quarter sales and put forward an
accelerated timetable to reduce its debt.
Wall Street responded enthusiastically to the news by marking Goodyear's
shares Dollars 2 1/8 higher to a 52-week high of Dollars 70 3/4 . The stock
has traded in a range of Dollars 21 to Dollars 69 1/4 in the past year.
Mr Stanley Gault, who took the helm at Goodyear last year and is widely
credited with masterminding the company's improvement, predicted
first-quarter sales of about Dollars 2.7bn with net income reaching Dollars
60m to Dollars 65m. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 90.1m a year
earlier on sales of Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Gault said Goodyear was aiming for a sustainable 10 per cent profit
margin, although this was partly dependent on an improvement in the general
economy.
'However, the priorities I have outlined for Goodyear are designed to
improve the operating performance of the company by managing it to make
money and without the benefit of strongly improving economic conditions,' Mr
Gault said.
Reducing Goodyear's debt, which the company took on in 1986 to thwart a
takeover attempt by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, is one of Mr
Gault's main concerns. At the end of 1991, Goodyear had reduced its debt by
Dollars 1bn to Dollars 2.6bn.
The company expects to have a debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio of less than 40
per cent this year, falling below 35 per cent in 1993 and below 25 per cent
by 1994. At the end of 1990, the ratio was more than 63 per cent, and stood
at 49.2 per cent at the end of 1991.
'We expect to obtain in the neighbourhood of Dollars 400m to Dollars 450m
from additional assets sales for further debt reduction,' said Mr Gault.
In addition, he said marketing agreements had increased the number of
locations selling Goodyear's tyres by 23 per cent in 1991. 'A significant
part of this new business will be incremental unit growth,' he said.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurance group, has attempted to crush rumours
about the stability of Gotabanken, Sweden's fourth largest commercial bank,
by making an offer to buy all the outstanding shares in Gota.
The bid, representing a premium of about 54 per cent over the April 10
market price of Gota's shares, was made after a week in which many small
savers in Gota withdrew money from the bank.
Trygg-Hansa's non-cash bid has the support of the Gota board. Trygg-Hansa
already owns 43.5 per cent of the shares and 48.3 per cent of the voting
rights in Gota.
The Trygg bid is the latest development in Sweden's banking crisis. Last
autumn the government was forced to make a large capital injection into
Nordbanken, the country's third-largest bank in which the state has a
dominant shareholding.
The government also has had to organise a rescue for Fvrsta Sparbanken, the
Stockholm regional savings bank.
Gota made a SKr2.13bn (Dollars 359m) operating loss in 1991, when loan loss
provisions jumped from SKr982m in 1990 to SKr3.7bn last year, equal to about
4.6 per cent of outstanding loans and guarantees.
The bank also had a SKr11bn portfolio of loans which were either
non-performing or on which the terms had been modified to lower interest
payments.
Trygg-Hansa had earlier promised to subscribe to a new share issue by Gota
in order to maintain confidence in the bank. This issue has now been
postponed.
Trygg said the merger with Gota will turn Trygg-Hansa SPP into a financial
group with a complete range of services in banking and insurance.
The group has premium income of about SKr42bn, including two mutual life
assurance companies, Trygg-Hansa Life and SPP.

DEPRESSED prices for ingot and fabricated products pushed Alcan Aluminium
into a loss for the first quarter to end-March, writes Robert Gibbens.
The first-quarter loss was USDollars 13m, or 8 cents a share, against a loss
of USDollars 1m, or 3 cents, a year earlier.
Sales and operating revenues were down 6 per cent to USDollars 1.84bn. Ingot
tonnage shipments were up, but fabricated shipments slipped.
Average price realised on primary ingot was down 22 per cent from a year
earlier. Prices in the first two months this year were at record low levels
after inflation. Company inventories were unchanged. Celanese Canada,
controlled by Hoechst of Germany, earned CDollars 8.2m (USDollars 6.9m), or
58 cents a share, in the first quarter, against CDollars 9.4m, or 67 cents a
year earlier.
Sales were CDollars 95m against CDollars 104m.

RECORD earnings from its Smith Barney securities broking subsidiary helped
Primerica, the US financial services group, yesterday report a 45 per cent
increase in first-quarter operating profits to Dollars 153.9m.
Total income for the period, however, was Dollars 220.8m, because the group
reaped Dollars 66.9m in net gains from the sale of stock in Inter-Regional
Financial, Musicland and Margaretten, the group's former mortgage banking
subsidiary sold in a public offering in January.
Smith Barney was again the star performer in the Primerica stable, riding
another buoyant quarter for Wall Street and domestic stock markets to record
profits of Dollars 56.1m, almost double the Dollars 29.3m the broking house
earned a year earlier.
Revenues were up from all of Smith Barney's main business lines, a
reflection of strong market participation by individual as well as
institutional investors, extremely high levels of new issue offerings and a
solid increase in assets under management.
Only principal trading, where revenues rose just 5 per cent, failed to match
the record pace set by the rest of the company.

USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday said it might sell shares in
its Delhi Group, including the Delhi gas pipeline and other related
companies, as part of its efforts to realise shareholder value.
The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company said it would propose issuing a
new class of common stock, called USX-Delhi Group, at its annual
shareholders meeting on May 4. The Delhi Group, currently part of USX's
Marathon gas operations, had sales of Dollars 442m, operating income of
Dollars 33m and assets of Dollars 598m in 1991.
The new stock offering is just one of several options being considered by
USX. The company may also sell assets or create a master limited
partnership, which would not require shareholder approval.
This latest effort to realise additional value for the Marathon Group
follows USX's novel stock split last year when the company bowed to pressure
from Mr Carl Icahn, the New York financier, and agreed to issue a new class
of stock.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: The 'Hoover' prepares to clean
up O&amp;Y - Nikki Tait profiles the new head of the troubled property developer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerald (Jerry) Greenwald - who was last night named by Olympia &amp; York,
the Canadian property group, as its president and deputy chief executive -
was once nicknamed 'the Hoover' because of his ability to absorb vast
quantities of information. At the rate Mr Greenwald has been travelling
recently, this can only be an asset.
Until mid-1990, Mr Greenwald seemed to have a clear, and fairly
well-defined, future. The Princeton economics graduate, who had spent the
first 22 years of his business career with Ford, was widely accepted to be
Mr Lee Iacocca's successor as chairman of Chrysler. He already held the
position of vice-chairman, and had been working at Chrysler, the smalls,
since the early 1980s.
But in June 1990, Mr Greenwald, then 54, switched course. He opted instead
to head a union-led buyout attempt at UAL, the parent company of United
Airlines. Had the deal ever come to fruition, Mr Greenwald would have run
the large but somewhat unsettled airline, replacing its chairman, Mr Stephen
Wolf.
It was a move which caused comment at the time, and observers were quick to
suggest motives. For a start, the financial terms of the deal must have
looked attractive. Mr Greenwald received a Dollars 5m bonus when he left
Chrysler, and was guaranteed another Dollars 4m if the UAL deal collapsed.
That is exactly what happened only months later, largely because of mounting
difficulties in securing bank financing for leveraged transactions. The
deal's demise left former colleagues at Chrysler to talk about 'Jerry's
Dollars 9m summer job'.
But kinder commentators also suggested that the uncertainties over
Chrysler's own future as an independent company may have influenced Mr
Greenwald's decision to depart. And they noted that the vice-chairman,
although credited with negotiating Chrysler's bailout plan, had stood in Mr
Lee Iacocca's formidable shadow for many years, and may have found the
limelight attractive. 'One doesn't last long with Iacocca, taking a
different position from his,' one Chrysler employee commented later.
At any rate, Mr Greenwald's next move was to Dillon Read, the Wall Street
investment bank, as a managing director. There, he oversaw the bank's buyout
funds and, appropriately enough, 'was involved in the firm's efforts to
provide financial assistance and advice to troubled companies.' He resigned
last week.
According to Lee Iacocca, who wrote glowingly of Mr Greenwald in his
autobiography, he is also 'an entrepreneur who can analyse a problem and
then move on to solve it'. That is a quality which will be much-tested in
the months ahead.

AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, the largest shareholder-owned insurance company in
the US, is in talks with Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buy-out
specialists, over the sale of its American Re-Insurance subsidiary.
Aetna said 'progress was being made' in the talks, but added there was no
assurance of a deal. It stressed that, apart from board approval, the
transaction was conditional on KKR's ability to find funding, and approvals
from the state-based insurance regulators.
American Re, based in Princeton, New Jersey, reinsures commercial property
and liability risks in domestic and international markets. Its premiums in
1991 were Dollars 979m, up from Dollars 871m in the previous year, although
earnings have been flat for several years, totalling Dollars 133m in 1991.
The reinsurance company warned in its annual report that pricing conditions
in the property-casualty markets could mean continued pressure on earnings
this year.
The reinsurance operation was acquired in 1979 for Dollars 389m, and is
carred on Aetna's books at Dollars 740m. It has assets of around Dollars
3.8m. Aetna did not specify the price being discussed with KKR, although
speculation has centred at around Dollars 1.4bn.
Aetna's possible sale of the business underlines the extent to which the
large US multiline insurers are restructuring their businesses through
retrenchment and asset sales, as they try to bolster capital and improve
profitability.
Aetna, which saw net profits fall from Dollars 614m to Dollars 505m last
year, has been troubled by souring real estate-related investments. It has
already pulled out of some unprofitable lines - ceasing to write auto
insurance in certain states, for example - and has sold some 'non-core'
subsidiaries, including a 43 per cent stake in La Estrella de Seguros, the
Spanish insurance business.
KKR - best-known for its massive Dollars 25bn bid for RJR Nabisco - has
shown interest in the financial services sector for some time. It gained a
toe-hold in the banking sector when it joined Fleet/Nordstar to buy the
failed Bank of New England in a Dollars 670m deal.
Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank, has more than doubled its stake in
Assicurazioni Generali, the insurer, to 12.54 per cent due to the insurer's
capital increase, Reuter reports.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: A model of efficiency in Italy's
public sector - Haig Simonian examines the success of Italgas, the state-run
gas distribution group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's state-run industrial companies seldom stand out as models of
efficiency. Their balance sheets are weighed down by debt and their general
performance compromised by political considerations.
Among the exceptions is Italgas, the public-sector gas distribution group,
which will soon report a 25 per cent leap in 1991 sales to L3,353bn (Dollars
2.721bn) and a 16.6 per cent increase in gross operating earnings to L618bn.
Along with the improvement in earnings, the group's net indebtedness is
likely to have dropped to around 32 per cent of turnover from 36 per cent in
1990.
Only a small majority of its shares are actually held by the state. Snam,
the gas distribution subsidiary of the Eni state holding group, owns 45 per
cent, while another Eni subsidiary has almost 7 per cent.
The influence of the market may be one of the reasons why Italgas has
performed so much better than many of its public-sector counterparts. Good
management and government policy encouraging the use of natural gas have
helped. Net profits in 1990 stood at L73.7bn.
Italgas's roots go back to the 19th century, when Italy's big cities were
gradually turning to gas for their lighting and heating needs. But real
growth only began after the 1940s, when significant domestic natural gas
supplies were found.
The importance of natural gas for energy-dependent Italy surged after the
first oil price shock of the early 1970s. That virtually coincided with the
building of new pipelines bringing gas from Holland and the Soviet Union.
'Suddenly, greatly increased supplies become available and demand grew very
fast,' says Mr Carlo Da Molo, Italgas's chairman.
The third boom came almost 10 years later, when a third pipeline gave the
Italians direct access to gas from Algeria. 'For the first time, we had gas
coming from the south as well as the north,' he says.
Distributing natural gas to customers in the south provided Italgas with a
new motor for growth. 'Previously, almost all our activities had been in the
north.'
The arrival of the new southern supplies coincided with two other decisive
events. Government policies introduced after the 1973 oil price shock to
stimulate the substitution of natural gas for oil were refined.
Since 1973, the share of oil in the nation's total energy consumption has
fallen by 15 per cent, matched by an identical rise in that of natural gas.
A further boost came in 1989, when a referendum halted the country's nuclear
power programme.
From 250 towns and villages in 1979, Italgas now serves 1,400 communities.
Its customers have more than doubled to almost 4.4m, while sales of natural
gas have swollen from under 2bn cu m to over 6.4bn today.
The bulk of the growth has come through building new distribution networks
in big such as Rome and Naples. Italgas now supplies five of Italy's seven
biggest cities.
However, Italgas has held back from gobbling up the smaller gas companies
which form part of Italy's patchwork of gas distribution. The business is
highly fragmented. While Eni's AGIP and Snam subsidiaries look after
exploration and wholesale supplies respectively, local and urban sales are
divided between Italgas, municipally owned companies and a myriad of private
distributors.
Italgas has around a third of the market, against 45 per cent for the
municipal companies and 21 per cent for the private sector groups. Although
it has bought some smaller suppliers, its growth has been largely organic,
explains Mr Da Molo.
'What has happened is that the overall share of natural gas has grown,' he
says.
The decision to avoid takeovers has been based on both economic and
political considerations. Acquisition prices for small private suppliers
have risen steadily in line with the growing importance of natural gas.
Moreover, potential acquisition targets only tend to become available after
family disputes or the death of a founder. Meanwhile, the big
municipally-owned companies have not been for sale.
He believes Italgas has benefitted from not becoming a monopoly. 'The
plurality of suppliers has furthered the expansion of natural gas,' he said.
In Italy's complex political scene, it is better to have a policy of 'guided
alliances' than a monopoly, he reckons.
The impetus for gas usage has also been helped by the fact that the small,
privately owned distributors often have considerable local political clout.
That has helped to bring about pro-gas policies from the government, which
have been passed with relatively little political fuss.
Italgas has not ruled out takeovers, however. It has bought a handful of
smaller competitors, notably along the Riviera. However, Mr Da Molo believes
demand will continue to grow strongly enough to avoid the need for a change
of strategy.
He admits that sales will start to slow from the mid-1990s as the country's
natural gas network is largely completed and the most important towns and
villages are connected. 'There will always be some growth, but it will be
much slower,' he says.
However, consumption should expand through more intensive marketing in towns
where natural gas is not yet widely used. Growth in Turin, where around 75
per cent of potential consumers are already connected thanks to the early
arrival of natural gas in the 1970s, will be limited. But there is still
considerable potential in Rome and Naples, where only about 50 per cent of
consumers are so far using natural gas.
Sales should also rise through gaining new markets. The completion of a
natural gas pipeline along the Riviera could pull in business from the big
horticultural trade in the region. In addition, increasingly strict clean
air legislation will force consumers to switch from oil to natural gas in
Italy's historic city centres.
Italgas is also diversifying to guarantee its future growth. It has
identified water distribution and waste management as logical additions to
the existing gas business. The company can use its established contacts with
local authorities and play on its expertise in gas distribution, which, like
water, involves underground pipework and 24-hour service.
Italgas's Acque Potabili drinking water subsidiary already has 2.5m
customers. 'The water business will start taking up the slack as the demand
for gas slows,' says Mr Da Molo. 'We have a great future in the next
century'.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the New York-based banking group, yesterday reported a 10 per
cent increase in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 299m. It attributed the
rise to strong growth in net interest income and buoyant corporate finance
revenues, which helped offset a Dollars 50m trading loss on mortgage-backed
securities (MBS).
The loss in the MBS market - incurred because of a surge in home-mortgage
refinancings and a small but unexpected increase in mortgage interest rates
 -contributed to a 63 per cent decline in securities trading revenues, to
Dollars 165m.
The trading loss led to the resignation last month of the company's senior
MBS trader.
Total earnings from trading were also hit by less favourable conditions in
global interest rate and currency markets, although revenues from trading
equities and commodities, including those related to Latin America, rose.
Despite the MBS setback and generally weaker trading figures Morgan reported
its second best quarter ever.
Lower short-term domestic interest rates and a steepening in the dollar
yield curve lifted net interest revenue 30 per cent to Dollars 414m. Morgan
also earned Dollars 10m from interest on Brazilian medium- and long-term
non-accrual loans.
Corporate finance contributed Dollars 97m during the quarter in the wake of
higher corporate debt and equity underwriting volume, especially in Latin
America. Operational service businesses delivered Dollars 99m. Investment
management fees brought in Dollars 85m.

GENERAL Electric, the US group whose interests range from power systems to
financial services, unveiled a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter net
earnings, to Dollars 1.06bn from Dollars 999m a year earlier, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
Earnings per share advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 1.23 from Dollars 1.15,
reflecting a five-year Dollars 10bn share repurchase programme. Revenues
grew 2 per cent to Dollars 13.5bn from Dollars 13.3bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said the company's power systems, medical systems
and financial services operations had contributed to the improvement. GE's
NBC broadcasting operations also had better first-quarter results.
However, the recession's impact on short-cycle, high-margin business was
reflected in a decline in operating margins, to 11.7 per cent in the quarter
from 12.1 per cent.

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Trencherwood seeks borrowing change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trencherwood, the USM-quoted housebuilder which is in refinancing talks with
its bankers, yesterday warned that the results for the year to end-October
would reveal a level of adjusted share capital and reserves substantially
worse than that reflected in the 1990 accounts.
The reduction is a result of write-downs arising from a revaluation of the
group's properties and developments, which are still subject to audit.
Under the terms of the company's articles of association, the permitted
level of group borrowings is restricted to a multiple of four times the
adjusted capital and reserves.
The company is seeking shareholder sanction, in advance of the audit, to
relax this borrowing limit to permit borrowings up to the limit of Pounds
86.85m, at which they currently stand.

Roskel, the suspended ceilings and partitions group, which moved to a full
listing last summer, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.57m for the year to
end-December.
Although that was a decline of 28 per cent on the previous year's Pounds

second-half improvement.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 43.79m (Pounds 46.22m). Pre-tax profits were
struck after taking account of a Pounds 150,000 rise in bad debts,
provisions and related costs to Pounds 930,000 and interest charges of
Pounds 586,000 (Pounds 862,000).
Earnings emerged at 7.22p (9.4p). A final dividend of 3p makes a same-again

In 1991, a year of transition, Hemingway Properties incurred a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 2.62m, compared with Pounds 6.92m. The interim loss was Pounds
2.1m.
Last August the company, formerly Marylebone Estates, was the subject of a
reverse takeover. It recapitalised through a rights issue, and introduced
new management and policies.
While the results were 'far from irrelevant', said Mr Leonard Phillips,
chairman, he believed they did not provide an accurate indication of future
performance.
Rental income rose 19 per cent to Pounds 3.69m.
The loss was struck after Pounds 725,000 reorganisation costs (Pounds 4.38m
exceptionals). Losses per share worked through at 6.02p (32.93p).
Net asset value per share had fallen from the pro-forma 37.8p to 31.4p,
because of the revenue deficit and reduction in value of certain London
properties.

Trading at Dinkie Heel - which makes shoe heels, toe-caps and Stick-a-Soles
 -improved in the second half to leave an 11 per cent overall drop in
pre-tax profit to Pounds 259,000 for 1991.
The figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 51,000 relating to
the sale of theloss-making Enterprise Group wholesale business, and interest
paid of Pounds 107,000 (Pounds 128,000).
Profit was almost halved in the opening period but Mr David Parkes,
chairman, said the improvement in orders and profits noted in his interim
statement was sustained, and margins increased.
Turnover fell to Pounds 7.29m (Pounds 7.93m) mainly because of the
Enterprise disposal.
Earnings per share in 1991 came to 1.82p (1.6p) after substantially reduced

THE Robert Maxwell name lives on in the satellite television business thanks
to France Telecom, the French telecommunications company.
Although not noticed by many people at the time, France Cables &amp; Radio, a
subsidiary of France Telecom, two months ago bought out Maxwell
Communication Corporation's 50 per cent stake in Maxwell Satellite
Communications.
The London-based company was set up to compete in the market for everything
from professional services for broadcasters to business television and data
transmission.
Following its creator's death the company's name has been telescoped to
Maxat - in what looked like an attempt to disguise its origins.
'My son is called Max. That's another reason for keeping the name,' said Mr
Julian Costley, managing director of Maxat, hopefully.
Maxat yesterday became the first outside company to move into the spare
space at the new London headquarters of Independent Television News.
The company has installed what it calls central London's first teleport -
two steerable six metre transmit and receive antennas and associated
equipment.
'We are offering broadcast and business television users London's most
accessible and advanced uplink facilities,' Mr Costley said.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT WESTERN Resources, the beleaguered oil and gas group in litigation
with its once-largest coal customer, yesterday announced that its coal
subsidiaries had filed for protection under the Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code.
The application will allow GWR to shift the jurisdiction on its legal battle
from South Carolina, where it is in dispute with South Carolina Public
Services Authority, the state public utility, to its home state of Texas.
Mr Howard Wolf, chairman of GWR, said the decision to file for Chapter 11
would speed up the outcome of a battle which has already lasted 18 months.
SCPSA, commonly known as Santee Cooper, disputes the validity of contracts
with Great Western's coal companies, and is claiming Dollars 60m (Pounds
35m) in damages. It has already had Dollars 33m in coal payments to GWR
attached by South Carolina courts.
Under US law, the Houston bankruptcy courts will now take over the legal
proceedings, and decide whether the Dollars 60m claim is appropriate.
Mr Wolf said a ruling on the amount of the Santee Cooper claim was expected
'within months . . . We will use the amount that the bankruptcy court
assigns as a key element of our reorganisation plans'.
Mr Wolf said the company had not made contingency plans in case the ruling
was in favour of Santee Cooper's Dollars 60m claim. 'It is like planning for
the planet Earth to be struck by a meteorite,' he said. 'It is so unlikely
to come to pass that we haven't devoted any significant time to deal with
it.'
The company expected to present the court with its reorganisation schedule
for the coal companies within the next 60 to 90 days.
Mr Wolf said the decision to move the subsidiary into Chapter 11 had been
taken after extensive consultation with the parent company's creditors who
are owed a total of about Dollars 70m.

FT  14 APR 92 / Brewery shares fall after OFT warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Allied-Lyons and Whitbread, the UK brewers, retreated yesterday
after a warning from Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of fair trading,
that he may take action against brewers' long-term beer supply agreements
with pub retailers.
Sir Gordon said he was concerned that such agreements were emerging as an
alternative to the brewers' tied (exclusively supplied) pub estates now
being reduced by the government beer orders.
'There are powers available to me both in the Fair Trading Act and in the
Competition Act which I will most certainly consider using if I believe that
the long-term supply agreement is being used to frustrate the loosening of
the tie,' he said.
Sir Gordon's remarks seem to be aimed at Allied-Lyons in particular. He has
already told the brewer that 734 pubs it has leased to Brent Walker, the
leisure group, will not count towards the 2,380 pubs it must release from
tied beer supplies unless it alters the terms of its seven-year supply
contract.
Allied, which has also leased 142 pubs to Burtonwood, the north-west brewer,
has indicated it is prepared to contest the issue in the courts.
Allied's shares closed 12p off at 633p yesterday. Shares in Whitbread, which
last week announced it was leasing 60 pubs to Shepherd Neame, the Kent
brewer, in the first of an expected series of short-term deals with pub
operators, closed 6p lower at 425p.
Sir Gordon said that the creation last year of Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL),
the Courage/ Grand Metropolitan pub retailing venture, should not be seen as
a precedent in the brewing industry.
Sir Gordon suggested that the effect of measures to stimulate competition in
the brewing industry could not be assessed before they had run their course.
'But that is not to say that, in the meantime, the competition authorities
should sit on their hands,' he said.
Turbulence that had resulted from government action and the response of the
brewers was damaging to some interest groups, Sir Gordon acknowledged.
However, consumers would gain from increased pressure on brewers and
publicans to provide a better mix of price, quality, and amenity.

FT  14 APR 92 / O&amp;Y confident on bank debt accord: Robert Peston and Bernard
Simon in Toronto on potential conflict among creditors over demands for new
money for Canary Wharf

OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the troubled property developer, said last
night it was confident its 100 banks would agree to proposals to restructure
its CDollars 14.3bn (Pounds 6.84bn) debt, even though it admitted all
lenders would be asked to make some sacrifice.
However, bankers said yesterday that reaching agreement might prove
difficult. Some complained the terms might be too favourable to the
Reichmann family, which founded and owns O&amp;Y. They also said they needed
time to decide whether it is fair that 50 banks, which have lent USDollars
5bn (Pounds 2.94bn) to the parent company rather than directly to the
property interests, should make the biggest sacrifices.
O&amp;Y also announced the appointment as president and deputy chief executive
of Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-chairman of Chrysler, the automotive
group which was restructured in the early 1980s.
Mr Steve Miller, another Chrysler alumnus who has been taking the lead in
negotiating with banks on O&amp;Y's behalf, said: 'We believe lenders are going
to go along with the plan'. He was speaking minutes after the end of O&amp;Y's
first meeting with all its banks. He expects the banks to give approval to
the broad outlines of the plan within weeks.
Negotiations will henceforth take place with small groups of banks. The
biggest sacrifices under the proposal will be made by banks who have lent
around USDollars 5bn to the parent company. They will be asked to defer
payments of both principal and interest. However some lenders to the US and
Canadian property interests will also be asked to defer principal.
Mr Miller said he did not regard deferal of principal as a major concession.
But he added: 'Almost all debt will play a role' in the restructuring. He
said the banks would not be offered any 'sweeteners' for making the
sacrifices.
He warned :'If there were massive refusals (to support the plan) there is a
possibility that the company could have to go through a series of
(bankruptcy) filings'. Mr Miller said that banks which have provided loans
for the construction of the Canary Wharf office development in east London
would be asked to put up Pounds 100m in new money over the next few months.
The Pounds 3bn office development needs to raise Pounds 350m over the next
two years.
Bankers warned yesterday this demand for new money was likely to lead to
conflict between two different groups of lenders to Canary Wharf. It has
emerged that four Canadian banks, including the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, have secretly lent
Pounds 450m for the Canary Wharf project. They took as security shares in
Canary Wharf companies. Bankers say that means these banks rank behind a
separate 'club' of ten banks which lent Pounds 500m for Canary Wharf at the
end of 1990. This loan is secured on O&amp;Y's assets, its buildings, rather
than on shares in the Canary Wharf companies.
Bankers in the club of ten - which include Citicorp of the US, Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, Credit Suisse, Lloyds of the UK and its rival Barclays - say
the four Canadian banks have the most to lose if the Canary Wharf project is
not completed, because the Canadian banks hold inferior security. So the
club of ten feel the Canadian banks should put up the bulk of the new money
required. However, three of the four Canadian banks are also in the club of
ten, making the conflict even more complicated.

FT  14 APR 92 / Takeover put spark into battery maker: Maggie Urry examines
the 'Hansonisation' of the Ever Ready group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be simple to characterise Hanson's sale of the UK part of Ever
Ready as yet another example of the conglomerate's habit of buying and
selling businesses.
Certainly Hanson is now selling for Pounds 132m a slice of a business bought
for Pounds 95m in 1981. It sold the European subsidiaries for Pounds 37m in
1982, and is keeping the South African operation, which makes slightly
higher profits than the UK business.
The anti-Hanson camp could use the disposal to argue that Hanson is a
churner and not a developer of businesses.
If Hanson was really a long-term investor, they might say, it could have
taken the Ever Ready business to the next stage of development.
Ever Ready has often been held up as one of the successes of the
'Hansonisation' process. Under Hanson it has invested, launched new products
and increased profits. But the crunch has come 10 years after its
acquisition. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, agrees that Hanson
must now sell Ever Ready UK if its full potential is to be realised. Ralston
Purina, the buyer, is the world's largest battery maker and, the argument
goes, Ever Ready UK will be better off joining it.
The question remains - does the Hanson method work in the long term? When
Hanson acquired Ever Ready just before Christmas 1981, the company was in
trouble. Its old management had changed the name to Berec, throwing away a
well-known brand. It had failed to move into the alkaline battery sector of
the market, the fastest-growing area. And its management was burdened with
layers of people contributing nothing.
Mr Bob Nevitt, managing director of Ever Ready UK was national sales manager
at the time of the takeover. He joined the business in 1959 and was promoted
to his present job by Hanson. He was delighted when Hanson arrived, he says.
'There were umpteen layers of management between us and the decision makers.
We were being taken apart by Duracell (the leading alkaline battery maker)
at the time and had no response.'
The change since Hanson took over has been revolutionary. For example, Mr
Nevitt says that he, the sales director, the marketing director and the
finance director share a secretary. 'She is an incredibly busy lady,' he
admits.
More seriously, he says that when Hanson moved in it discovered a
'commercial department' of 40 people. When asked what the department did,
there was no real reply and it was abolished. Head office numbers were
slashed from 550 to 75 and the office was relocated.
The company's research and development facility employed 250 people. But,
says Mr Nevitt 'they were generating nothing for us and costing a huge
amount of money'. Hanson selected the 55 or 60 people it wanted to keep and
moved them from north London to be near the main manufacturing plant in the
north-east of England. An advanced projects facility near Oxford was sold,
while the German research and development establishment, which was working
on alkaline batteries, went when the European businesses were sold -
ironically to Duracell.
Hanson's well-known financial rigour did not stop it investing in the
company, Mr Nevitt says. Hanson was 'prepared to listen to sensible
propositions requiring millions of pounds,' Mr Nevitt says. The first thing
Hanson did was bring back the Ever Ready name. Then it turned to correcting
the failure to attack the alkaline, long-life, battery market.
In less than two years from the takeover Ever Ready launched Gold Seal, now
the largest rival to Duracell in the alkaline market. Mr Nevitt claims that
Gold Seal has a 21 per cent share of that sector of the market compared with
Duracell's 55 per cent, figures Duracell has disputed.
Ever Ready still has half the zinc carbon sector - with Silver Seal and Blue
Seal - giving it a 36 per cent share of the market as a whole, worth Pounds
350m a year. Now, Mr Nevitt says, Ever Ready and Duracell just about match
each other in marketing spending, at about Pounds 7m a year each.
As well as increasing the marketing spend, Ever Ready invested in high-speed
production lines, enabling it to cut costs. Meanwhile, the slimmed-down R
and D department developed Gold Seal batteries, the Silver Seal brand which
is a longer-lasting zinc carbon battery, and worked on reducing the mercury
content of batteries.
So why is Hanson selling? Mr Nevitt says, and Mr Taylor agrees, that Ever
Ready UK needs to become part of an international business, which it was
when when Hanson acquired it. As well as selling the European businesses
back in 1982, Hanson closed the loss-making Hong Kong arm and its Nigerian
operation. Exports have also fallen as a proportion of Ever Ready UK's
sales.
Perhaps it was short-sighted to have got rid of most of the international
business? Hanson argues that the European and Nigerian companies were barely
profitable at the time, the Hong Kong business was loss-making, and, in any
case, Hanson's focus was on the UK and North America. The international
businesses - aside from that in South Africa which is run entirely
separately from the UK - did not seem to be ones capable of being developed.
The obvious answer now is to reunite Ever Ready UK with Ralston's battery
operation, which has the Eveready name in the US. The two were divided in
1914 when the original company, the American Electrical Novelty and
Manufacturing Company, floated the UK business and sold the US side to
National Carbon, which later became Union Carbide.
The logic of putting the two together was not lost on Hanson. It had tried
to buy the US business when Union Carbide sold it in 1986, but lost to
Ralston. Hanson again tried to buy the business from Ralston, but Ralston
refused. In the end the only answer was to sell to Ralston.

FT  14 APR 92 / Morgan Crucible profits rise 3% on acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the specialised industrial materials manufacturer,
yesterday reported a 3 per cent rise in profits, helped by acquisitions and
a lower interest charge,
Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the group's decision to diversify out
of the UK in the early 1980s was bearing fruit.
Pre-tax profits in the 53 weeks to January 1992, rose from Pounds 59.5m to
Pounds 61m on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 627.8m in spite of recession in
a number of its markets.
Earnings per share fell 16 per cent, from 23.8p to 19.9p, after adjusting
for last April's Pounds 96m rights issue.
The company is to pay a 6.85p final dividend, giving a total of 12.6p, up 5
per cent on the year.
Mr Farmer said Morgan would not tap shareholders for more funds before 1994
unless something extraordinary happened.
While Morgan is increasingly seen as a company well positioned to take
advantage of the emerging economic recovery in its biggest market, the US,
the market has not forgotten the Pounds 175m the company raised from two
rights issues in quick succession.
One benefit of the rights issue last year was that the interest charge fell
Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 10.5m, helping to turn a fall in operating profit into
an increase at the pre-tax level.
Following the rights issue, gearing fell at the year end to 28 per cent,
down from 65 per cent. Morgan says it is no hurry to spend the rest of the
rights proceeds although it is currently looking at potential acquisitions
in the UK, the US and Continental Europe.
While recession in the UK showed no sign of lifting, Mr Farmer said Morgan's
US, Australasian and Far Eastern markets, which account for 69 per cent of
sales, were growing.
Operating profits fell in the carbon, technical ceramics and thermal
ceramics divisions but rose in speciality materials.
Mr Farmer said the group had increased gross margins at some cost to volume,
demonstrating the strong positions it commands in its markets. 'We have not
been selling goods cheap or buying volume,' he said.
Morgan expects to pay a marginally higher tax rate of 31 per cent this year,
having enjoyed the benefits of an ACT write-back in 1991.

FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Mowlem
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market has been conspicuously unforgiving this year towards UK companies
offering bad tidings on the dividend front. It was thus consistent in
pushing John Mowlem shares 10 per cent higher yesterday on the grounds that
its final payout has been cut less than feared. In the present post-election
mood, investors may be more susceptible to the idea of a robust recovery
finally arriving. But even on the most optimistic profit forecasts a
maintained dividend will not be covered this year. There can be no guarantee
for 1993 either.
The trouble with Mowlem is that there have been too many disappointments in
the past to leave room for confidence that the group has it right this time.
The balance sheet may look relatively solid and the provisions reassuringly
conservative. But aside from its small operations in housebuilding and
equipment hire, it is a late-cycle stock which will be fully exposed to the
sharp downturn in contracting turnover and profits this year. Mowlem's
quality in this area cannot be faulted, but it will not be alone among its
peers in suffering from a drop in cash balances. At least the group's
proposed exit from commercial property development, which should be
achievable given that the related write-downs imply yields of 12-14 per
cent, means there will not be a black hole for remaining spare cash this
time.

FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was always likely to be profit-taking in Euro Disney in the run up to
last weekend's opening in Paris, whether or not it was sparked off by
cultural antagonism to Mickey Mouse. The project, after all, has reached
that inconvenient stage where actuarial modelling starts to be tested by
experience.
The question for investors is whether the shares have fallen far enough,
having dropped 15 per cent since their peak earlier this year. In the short
term it would be unwise to count on it, especially since those who
subscribed for the issue in late 1989 can get out and still double their
money. Longer term the price will presumably fluctuate with attendance
figures and spending behaviour, and how these match up with already well
discounted expectations. Investors should be prepared, incidentally. for a
rollercoaster of market rumours given that official information in the early
months is likely to be sparse.
Notwithstanding the prospect of a full financial year with operational
profits, yardsticks like the earnings multiple and yield will remain
unhelpful well into the mid 1990s. In the meantime, sentiment about the
north European weather and the capacity of family budgets to finance the
Disney experience will be more important.

FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's Pounds 132m sale of Ever Ready UK is bound to provoke a further
rash of theories on what the company is up to. Perhaps the deal is evidence
that Hanson is clearing the decks for the next megabid, now that the UK is
re-confirmed as a free market paradise. Perhaps it is an admission of
defeat, in that the Hanson method has been able to squeeze only so much out
of Ever Ready before discarding it.
Perhaps it is neither. In the context of Hanson's past deal-making, Pounds
132m is neither here nor there. As for the new Tory government holding the
door open to takeovers, Hanson has not mounted a hostile bid since 1986. It
may be that Hanson can do nothing more with Ever Ready. It is probably more
relevant that the group is increasingly concentrating on a small number of
large businesses. It would not do to exaggerate this; Hanson is still, for
instance, one of the UK's biggest suppliers of elastic bands. But it seems
at least plausible that the future of the company after Lords Hanson and
White is that of a safe, dull dispenser of basic commodities such as coal,
tobacco and gravel.
Granted, this may not be a matter of choice. In retrospect, it is possible
to see the 1980s as a period of unique opportunity for the classic
acquisitive conglomerate. The world was awash with money, mistakes were
covered up by asset inflation and equity investors were prepared to part
with a Thomas Tilling or an SCM at silly prices. In today's world of dear
money and low inflation, the risk of overpaying in a contested bid does not
stack up any more. Far better to do as Hanson did with Beazer: pick a
company crippled by debt and make the sums work by refinancing the debt at
lower rates. The acquisitive conglomerates will still do the odd deal. But
they may be buying from the banks rather than the equity market.

FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling in the frame
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not only did sterling's close yesterday of DM2.915 put it well within its
narrow band range for the first time since November, but the British
currency finally ceded bottom place in the system to the Danish krone. No
doubt there will be clamour for Mr Norman Lamont to celebrate by moving to
narrow bands and cutting interest rates. Such hopes still look premature.
Part of sterling's gain was due to D-Mark weakness on worries about
political instability in Russia. Such alarms have a habit of being
transitory, as the response to last year's abortive coup showed. It would be
dangerous, too, to base expectations for monetary policy on the latest
report of the five top German economic institutes. Their call for the
Bundesbank to cut rates later in the year is likely to go unheeded as long
as money supply is growing three percentage points above its target ceiling.
The US may have shaved its rates, but there is no reason for Japanese
financial turmoil to deflect the Bundesbank from its obsession with reducing
Germany's 4.7 per cent inflation rate.
Sterling's higher level against the D-Mark may thus prove temporary. If not,
the government will have to make up its mind on narrow bands. The step could
be taken as soon as sterling is both firm and towards the middle of its
range. It is worth recalling, though, that sterling might then be harder to
defend if pressure built up for a more general realignment. The move to
narrow bands would presumably also allow a small cut in interest rates. But
the UK's inflation and import performance still leave room for improvement,
and there is less hurry now the election is over. There is a case for
waiting, even if it deprives the market of the stimulus it craves.

FT  14 APR 92 / Cathay order for Boeings gives R-R big boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CATHAY PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-based airline, placed firm orders yesterday
for 11 Rolls-Royce-powered Boeing 777 widebodied aircraft worth Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 980m), with options to acquire an additional 11 airliners,
which would take the order to Dollars 3.4bn.
The deal is a significant boost for Rolls-Royce, currently in fierce
competition against Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US for the
new Boeing 777 wide-bodied market, and for Boeing, which wants to expand the
customer base for its latest aircraft programme.
Rolls-Royce said the order for its heavy-thrust Trent engines to power the
Cathay Pacific Boeing 777s was worth about Dollars 500m.
Rolls-Royce has undergone widespread restructuring in the past two years
with the loss of about 7,000 jobs. The latest deal is unlikely to have any
impact on employment at Derby where Rolls-Royce produces its commercial
aircraft engines.
Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company would
continue to keep a firm grip on costs and productivity to maintain its
competitive edge against its US rivals. The UK engine maker powers the
entire fleet of Cathay Pacific jets but Sir Ralph said his company had faced
tough competition from Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE.
The order is particularly important for Rolls-Royce because it has given the
UK manufacturer a strong position in the market for heavy-thrust engines to
power the new generation of wide-bodied aircraft being developed by the main
airliner manufacturers. Rolls-Royce is investing about Pounds 400m in
developing the heavy-thrust Trent variant of its RB211 engine family.
Rolls-Royce lost last year to GE in the contest for a British Airways engine
order for new Boeing 777s, but the Cathay Pacific deal has given the UK
manufacturer a 28 per cent share of the engine business of the 777.
Rolls-Royce has already won orders from Emirates, the Dubai airline, and
Thai International Airways for its Trent engines to power 777 airliners.

FT  14 APR 92 / BT presses Oftel for faster rise in line rental charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEPHONE BILLS for heavy business and residential customers could rise more
slowly if BT persuades Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, to allow
faster increases in its charges for renting lines.
The company's proposals - in a submission to Oftel, which is reviewing BT's
prices - would mean that customers who use the telephone infrequently would
see their bills increase by more than the rate of inflation. This could
affect around 7m customers.
The submission was made last month but not published until yesterday,
because BT did not wish the matter to be drawn into the general election
campaign.
Mr Malcolm Argent, BT's company secretary, repeated the company's frequently
used argument that line rental charges were artificially low and call
charges artificially high. The company estimates that the size of the
subsidy from calls to rental charges is Pounds 1.8bn a year.
Currently, BT is allowed to increase rental and connection charges by 2
percentage points above the rate of inflation each year.
The company wants the constraint on rental charges to be replaced by a
stipulation that the size of the average residential customer's bill should
not go up by more than inflation.
Mr Argent said this would mean that people paying less than the average  -
Pounds 43.57 a quarter - would see their bills increasing faster than
inflation, but that those paying more would find their bills going up at a
slower rate.
He said such a 'rebalancing' of charges would allow BT to compete fairly
against rivals such as Mercury Communications which are not under similar
regulatory constraints. It would also be good for the economy, he argued,
because lower call charges would encourage people to use the phone more.
Mr Argent refused to spell out how sharply BT wanted to increase prices,
saying he did not wish to be 'hoist on his own petard'. He said BT's poorest
customers would be protected by a scheme allowing them to pay lower rental
charges if they made very limited use of the phone.
BT is also arguing for a relaxation of its overall price cap, which requires
that the cost of a basket of services should be set at the retail price
index minus 6.25 percentage points. It believes a figure of 4.5 percentage
points should be the 'starting point for discussions' with Oftel.
BT has held several meetings with Oftel which the regulator describes as
'preliminary skirmishes'. Both sides would like to reach an agreement by the
time Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, moves to the Office of
Fair Trading in mid-June.

A letter in yesterday's Guardian alleging that supporters of John Smith had
plotted to manoeuvre him into the Labour leadership if Neil Kinnock lost the
election has set the cat among the pigeons. The letter was from Colin Byrne,
the former Labour party press officer who left Walworth Road after a spat
with John Underwood, Peter Mandelson's successor as campaign supremo.
What makes the allegations more pertinent to the leadership campaign is that
Byrne is still - as the phrase goes - close to the Kinnock camp. He lives
with Kinnock's press secretary Julie Hall; they are soon to be married. Can
we assume, therefore, that the bile in Byrne's comments on Smith's
shortcomings is shared by Kinnock himself?
After all, wasn't it Smith's plan for taxing Essex men that lost Kinnock
their votes?

stock-price manipulation would lack coherence.
Quite a different view is understandably taken by the police, whose growing
frustration has led to the passing of laws designed to dismantle the
yakuza's complex and ritual-laden organisations. Even so, the system has
been flexible enough to provide for public hearings where several gang
bosses have defended their 'rights of assembly' and 'freedom of expression'.
According to one of them, what they lead is not gangs but 'chivalrous
groups' upholding Japanese traditions against modern materialism and evil. A
second boss, whose minders wore the characteristic hairstyle known as the
punch perm, said his organisation was a 'law-abiding institution', which
regretted that its methods and members had been 'misunderstood'.
The hearings were intended to give the gangs a right of reply before the
inevitable police crackdown. The police know the gangsters and the gangsters
know the police, so there's no rush to arrest the yakuza, who are now banned
from such lucrative activities as 'debt collection' and 'brokering civil
disputes'.
A further boss promised to 'accept the new law with modesty' - though
whether that meant actually abiding by it, he didn't explain. Meanwhile
another prominent gang member has offered Washington a choice of either
defending the rights of yakuza, or having them boycott the Cadillacs and
other US gas-guzzlers so much in vogue as an imported symbol of Japanese
gangster tradition.

FT  14 APR 92 / Observer: Hanson quits the turf
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not just Britain's horsy set which looks on the first Wednesday in
June as one of the most important dates in the year. Derby Day is marked in
red on a lot of proletarian calendars too.
So there is bound to be widespread unease at the news that those well known
turf accountants, Lords Hanson and White, are selling the Ever Ready battery
company - proud sponsors of the Derby for the last six years.
Is nothing sacred? Although Hanson has always insisted that sponsoring the
Derby helped the group by re-vitalising its battery business's brand name,
everyone knows that horse-racing is Lord White's favourite hobby. Last
year's arrival on the Hanson board of champion jockey Chris Collins added
weight to suspicion that the Derby was the one hobby horse that Hanson's
hard-headed accountants were happy to feed. Yet Hanson is now selling Ever
Ready to the world's biggest pet-food company . . .
Hanson insists the deal has no strings attached to it that will permit the
group's horse-loving directors to hang on to their Derby Day privileges. But
buyer Ralston Purina says it has promised to honour Ever Ready's commitment
to sponsor the event until 1994.
Be that as it may, the future of the Hanson Coronation cup race in Derby
week looks cloudy after this year. Moreover, there is little chance of Lord
White hosting another Ever Ready Derby lunch, and still less of Epsom's new
stand being named after him.
Perhaps it's all for the best. Hanson has not been having much luck with
sport. Not only has its investment in race-horses proved a financial and PR
disaster, but its Tommy Armour golf club subsidiary stopped sponsoring Fred
Couples less than four months before his weekend Masters tournament win.

FT  14 APR 92 / Kinnock leaves an empty legacy to successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Opposition is shut down for re-pairs. These may take some time. I hope
they do. A hasty patch-up following the devastating defeat of Labour last
Thursday is unlikely to save the people's party from permanent electoral
frustration and eventual extinction. A quick fix with the Liberal Democrats,
who also did less well than expected, would have all the chances of success
of two drowning parties clinging together.
We must wait awhile. Politicians of a left-wing persuasion must be given
time to think. The trouncing received at the hands of the Conservatives
under Mr John Major has not yet begun to sink in. Labour could not manage to
attract more than 35 per cent of the votes in mid recession after a campaign
universally hailed as smoothly professional. If not then, when? The Lib Dems
could not hold their optimum support when it became apparent that to plump
for them would be to let Labour in. That was true in 1987 and 1992; who is
to say that it will not hold good in 1996 or 1997?
Certainly not Mr Neil Kinnock. The outgoing Labour leader, who announced his
resignation yesterday, deserves full credit for reconstructing the party,
but it has to be said that the legacy he leaves his successor is an empty
one. This may be harsh, but it is the truth. He achieved a great deal, but
in terms of winning the next election, it is as if it were nothing. A little
reminder of recent history will show what I mean. When Mr Kinnock took over
in October 1983, Labour was in ruins, shattered by the leadership of Mr
Michael Foot and the consequential defection of many of its middle-class
supporters to the Social Democrats. Its vote in that year's election was
less than 28 per cent; last week it was seven percentage points higher.
That is the most accurate measure of Mr Kinnock's bequest to his successor.
There are other, perhaps more valuable heirlooms. Labour is no longer in
favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European
Community, or the wholesale nationalisation of industry. During the past
three years, it has devoted itself to becoming less frightening to
middle-of-the-road voters. It has tried to emulate the continental social
democrats it so admires. It has begun, ever so gingerly, to detach itself
from the lethal embrace of the trade unions. Mr Kinnock worked hard on this
successful transformation of a ragged and inchoate movement into a
structured political machine. He demanded discipline of his followers and
set a personal example of self-control.
Yesterday's outburst against the Tory tabloids may have been imprudent, but
you have only to recall their combined ferocity to understand his position.
It would, however, be fatal for Labour to convince itself that it was
defeated by the Daily Mail, the Daily Express and the Sun. It might have
been less badly beaten without them, but the fears upon which these papers
played - of higher mortgages, higher taxes and a prolongation of the
recession - were genuinely felt by many voters. The arguments had to have
some semblance of rationality to succeed.
It would also be a mistake to assume that another four or five years of
Kinnock-style modifications of party policy will be rewarded by victory next
time. This is the trap inherent in the apparently unstoppable movement to
elect Mr John Smith as successor. I have frequently expressed admiration for
Mr Smith's political personality. He has handled the task of shadowing the
chancellor with immense skill. What is being questioned, not least by those
who would prefer a different leader, is his tactical judgment.
This requires some explanation. A few weeks ago, I thought that his
proto-budget, taxing higher earners and spreading the benefits, might have
neutralised the political effect of the real Budget presented by Mr Norman
Lamont. Now, with hindsight, it must be acknowledged that Labour fell into a
trap. Once Mr Lamont had introduced his 20 per cent band for low earners,
Messrs Kinnock and Smith felt obliged to find tax cuts of their own, however
small. They therefore put aside all thought of phasing-in their proposed top
rates. This gave verisimilitude to the Conservative charge that there would
be higher taxes for all under Labour. It gave the black tabloids a basis of
fact upon which to build their propaganda.
Mr Smith would nevertheless be the leader best able to steady the
opposition's nerve after last week's shock. Some Labour folk fear a further
haemorrhage of support over the next few months, taking the party down to
where Mr Kinnock found it. Mr Smith might be able to stop that by his mere
presence. There is, however, a catch. Under present plans, the leadership
election will take place before the end of June, using existing party rules.
That means 40 per cent of the vote is in the hands of trade unions. This is
the wrong way to elect a party leader for the 1990s. It would hamstring Mr
Smith from the start.
Worse, such a quick election could perpetuate the myth that the maintenance
of party unity is of paramount importance. That would perpetuate unity all
right - the unity of the political graveyard. For Labour is still hypnotised
by its history. It continues to believe that it is a great party, with a
noble destiny. Not so. Last week's 35 per cent popular vote strongly
suggests that unless it makes a break with its own history it has no future.
In short, the new Labour leader must risk disunity if he is to save the
party. For everything must be questioned, and much must be changed. The
divorce from the unions must be absolute. Reducing the block vote at annual
conferences from 87 per cent to 70 per cent or even 50 per cent is no good.
The correct figure is zero. Some of the dearest beliefs of the Labour
movement must be re-examined. Mr Roy Hattersley has stuck doggedly to his
belief that equality is of greater importance than anything else; he is now
to retire without further hope of office. The proper level of taxation, the
role of regulation in the market, the nature of the state - all need to be
rethought, with the mental focus shifted away from the past century and
towards the likely needs of the next.
It may be that the conclusion is that so much would have to be altered that
there would be no purpose in continuing with the Labour party. That is the
Liberal Democrats' dream; they are as vultures perched. But they too live in
a fantasy world. The debate within the non-Conservative parties should be
accompanied by debate between them.
Mr Kinnock's successor must reach out - to the Lib Dems and beyond - for
ideas, shared principles, alliances, partners, supporters. Mr Tony Blair
could do that, perhaps after a spell of apprenticeship under Mr Smith, or
possibly as his deputy. Do not mistake me. Mr Smith would have been an
excellent leader this year. The question remains - does he appreciate the
scale of change now needed? Mr Kinnock never quite kept ahead of changing
opinions. The policies that failed on Thursday might have succeeded in 1987.
The danger for the opposition is that the next election will be fought by
Labour, in fruitless half-hearted partnership with the Lib Dems, on policies
that might have won last week.

FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: Time to ban opinion polls during elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr D W PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, From merely anecdotal evidence (no stratified sampling, I'm afraid), I
tend to conclude that I am not alone in wishing that opinion polls should be
banned during electioneering. It is not only that they turn what should be a
tug-of-war into something more like the Boat Race, with all the misleading
consequences that that entails. They are also a colossal bore.
Your contributor Joe Rogaly's articles over the past few weeks have devoted
more space to analysing and commenting on the polls than they have to the
parties, policies and personalities concerned. That, at any rate, is the
impression they make on one constant reader (myself).
If Mr Rogaly is still writing for you at the next general election, and if
the polls have not been banned, I hope that he will ignore them, and write
about what the poll-bemused politicians frequently referred to last night as
'the real world'.

FT  14 APR 92 / Machines in need of maintenance: Andrew Baxter explores the
response of UK engineering companies to recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reinvigoration of British industry has been pushed towards the top of
the political agenda by the Conservatives' general election victory. Mr
Michael Heseltine's appointment as secretary of an enlarged Trade and
Industry Department heralds a more interventionist stance by a traditionally
free-market government and a rejection of the DTI's recent minimalist role.
Nowhere will this shift be felt more keenly than in the engineering sector,
which is finding recovery hard after 20 years of decline compounded by 18
months of recession. So protracted has been the weakening of the industry
and so severe the damage to its competitiveness that government help may be
needed to foster a revival.
The appointment of Mr Heseltine, who is committed to focusing the 'averted
gaze' of government back on to industry, has met with a welcome response.
'We believe this will invigorate the DTI and help it find a strategy for
industry,' said a senior executive at one engineering group yesterday.
But the broad economic background does not look encouraging: engineering
output has fallen from 11.8 per cent of the UK's gross domestic product in
1970 to about 8 per cent, and most engineering sectors grew at a lower rate
than GDP from 1979-1989. Two recessions have reduced employment in
engineering from 3.3m in 1979 to below 1.9m, and jobs are still being shed.
The UK balance of trade in the main engineering sectors plummeted from a
Pounds 4.32bn surplus in 1980 to a Pounds 5.34bn deficit in 1990. It
recovered last year to a small surplus of Pounds 240m, according to an
estimate by the Engineering Employers' Federation, as the recession choked
off demand for imports.
On a brighter note, UK engineering workers improved their productivity -
average annual growth of real output per person - by 5.1 per cent from
1979-1989, a better performance than their Italian, French and German
counterparts, but still lagging behind improvements in Japan and the US.
So what is the future for Britain's engineering companies? A Financial Times
series over the next 18 months will try to answer that question by tracking
regularly the performance of six different engineering companies.
The companies were asked how they have responded to the current recession
and what lessons they have applied from the previous 1980-81 downturn; what
is the short-term outlook for their UK business; and what might be the
long-term effects of the recession on their ability to compete in domestic
and international markets.
The initial conclusions are decidedly mixed: five of the companies do not
expect a real recovery in their UK markets until next year, either because
they see no signs of life in the domestic or because the evidence of
recovery is too slight.
However, a better-managed industry has learnt lessons from the recession of
the early 1980s and responded more quickly to a downturn of unprecedented
severity. 'No corner has been left unexamined,' says Mr Gilbert Johnston,
chief executive of JCB.
The recession has forced companies to examine businesses and investments
with a more critical eye. 'Like a rough sea, it shows where all the leaks
are,' says Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group. However, the
longer the recession persists, the greater the risk that business will
stabilise permanently at its current low levels as the customer base is
eroded. None of the six companies in the survey believes that has happened -
yet.
In contrast, all six paint a rosy picture of long-term growth. But, given
the record of the UK's engineering decline, their confidence raises the
question of whether they will be able to manage their way through the
recession without sacrificing long-term prospects.
The responses from the six companies suggest that the evidence is broadly
positive:
Extent and severity of recession.
Operating in a variety of markets, the six went into recession at differing
times and speeds. Weakening demand in the UK truck market hit the component
business of Bloxwich Engineering as early as 1989 while Fenner marks the
start of the UK recession at November 1990.
At Senior's engineering products division, the UK market has been flat for
10 months, says Mr John Bell, divisional chief executive, while other
companies 'hit bottom' only last autumn.
A number of companies were surprised by the sudden onset of the recession,
and had to grapple with a market decline that has been steeper, and lasted
longer, than in 1980-1981. JCB's production volume has fallen by 40 per cent
over two years from the heady levels of 1987 to early 1989. In the three
years from 1980-1982, the decline was only 22 per cent, says Mr Johnston.
Cost-cutting responses.
All the companies have taken action in this area. UK workforces have been
cut by an average 20-25 per cent, and every aspect of cost has been
examined. But cutting jobs without causing serious long-term damage has been
a concern for many companies.
At Fenner, the UK headcount has been reduced by 20 per cent over the current
recession. Mr Peter Barker, chairman, points out that 'there has been a
steeper rate of decline than in the previous recession, and not so much to
cut at'. But Fenner and others believe they have made such cuts without
impairing their long-term research and development efforts.
Other cuts have been made 'behind-the-scenes' in a way that does not affect
long-term customer relationships. The 600 Group no longer makes its
Colchester lathes in the Essex town and has switched production to its
Harrison lathe plant in west Yorkshire, with the loss of 280 jobs. But the
marketing network has remained unchanged.
Strategic responses.
The larger companies are trying to expand their sales overseas, especially
in continental Europe, either because of relatively better market conditions
 -such as in JCB's case - or to change the long-term balance between UK and
international earnings so as to diversify income sources and reduce
dependence on the UK economy.
Senior's recent Dollars 40m acquisition of Flexonics, the largest US
manufacturer of metallic flexible hose assemblies, exemplifies this trend.
Although cyclical, the US market is less of a roller-coaster than the UK.
Others have responded by taking advantage of non-recurring opportunities. At
Fenner, production of some low-value added power transmission components has
moved to Hong Kong - a response as much to a long-term shift in terms of
trade as to the recession.
Among the smaller companies, Posiva has learnt from its reliance on
supplying the textile industry during the previous recession. This time it
has moved quickly to supply gears to crane manufacturers and other
industrial sectors, says Mr Reg Bricknell, chief executive.
Capital spending.
Here the picture is mixed. Posiva has benefited from the capital spending of
its German parent company, while JCB, says Mr Johnston, has slowed its
capital expenditure because of heavy investment in 1988 and 1989 which gave
it a manufacturing capacity of 20,000 units a year, compared with current
production levels of 10,000 units.
But all six companies agree that the investment tap cannot be turned off in
a recession. 'In engineering, if you do not invest to keep up to date, all
you are going to do is go under in the next century,' says Mr Peter Burton,
chief executive of Bloxwich Engineering. His company has invested in
training and new machinery aimed at providing more quality in its vehicle
components.
Implications for long-term competitiveness.
There is little doubt that if the six had not developed responses to the
recession, the implications for their long-term competitiveness would have
been severe. That is due as much to the length as to the depth of the
downturn.
Collectively, the six serve virtually every sector of UK industry, and have
seen customers collapse, or struggle, under the weight of the recession. Mr
Barker hopes the erosion of the UK customer base will be nothing like the 20
per cent reduction seen in 1980-81.
To protect against such an eventuality, Fenner, along with the other
companies, is redoubling efforts to internationalise. The recession, says Mr
Johnston at JCB, has strengthened the company's determination to expand in
Europe - particularly in the rapidly expanding German market. At Senior, Mr
Bell says that 'the longer the UK recession goes on, you have to start
wondering whether something more structural is happening. I don't believe it
has thus far. It has not changed our perception of what things will return
to.' But just as some customers have disappeared, so some of the companies'
UK rivals have collapsed or been weakened. And, at least in JCB's sector of
construction equipment, foreign rivals have become charier of entering a UK
market described as 'perfectly ghastly' last year by one independent
analyst.
In contrast, the smallest company of the six, Posiva, is virtually
restricted to selling in the UK and Ireland. But it recovered more quickly
than larger competitors from a poor year in 1990.
In response to a sharp fall in demand, Mr Bricknell cut the workforce from
24 to 18. Now, however, he is taking on two more salespeople 'to get more of
a smaller cake'. Small engineering companies, it seems, can survive the
vagaries of the UK market with a responsive management.
Although some of the cuts may have been painful, the results may come
through eventually in higher profits - an important factor for the sector's
long-term competitiveness. Mr Gaskell at 600 Group says recessions do not
have to be as deep as the present one to force companies to examine their
cost base, but his company will be Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m more profitable when
business recovers because it has cut costs and strengthened management.
Similar benefits are expected across the companies surveyed.
The only trouble is that the upturn has not arrived yet. And only when it
does will it be possible to judge whether the companies have done enough, or
cut too much, to exploit it. Subsequent articles in the series will
establish when that recovery arrives, and whether the companies' long-term
confidence is well-founded or just bluster.
For now there is a glimmer of light. JCB said last week it is taking on 97
more employees in preparation for an expected increase in orders. Like its
counterparts across the engineering sector, it will be hoping the light will
not again be extinguished by recession.
This is the first article in a series on the six engineering companies.

FT  14 APR 92 / Leading Article: Bridging the final Gatt gap
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANY MIGHT have concluded by now that all Gatt deadlines
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
including the latest one, for Easter, set by the Gatt's director-general, Mr
Arthur Dunkel - are equally meaningless. Not so. One deadline is crucial:
the end of the American president's ability to use his Congressional
'fast-track' authority at the beginning of March 1993. With no provision for
its renewal, that is when the more than five year old Uruguay round of
multilateral trade negotiations will turn into a pumpkin.
That deadline does not leave as much time as might be thought. Even after
agreement on agriculture is finally reached, it will take at least two
months to reach consensus on other outstanding issues. Some improvements
will be required in the texts presented by Mr Dunkel last December. Chief
among the outstanding issues will be market access, including services and
public procurement, as well as the lowering of tariffs. For the world
economy, these agreements will be of enormous importance, probably more
important than agriculture.
That does not make agriculture less pivotal. It is too important to too many
countries for a global deal to be possible without it. But such a deal
depends first on agreement between the US and the European Community. It has
been tantalisingly close since the end of last year.
Another chance is created by the regular meeting between Mr George Bush and
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, on April 22. With Mr
Helmut Kohl pressing for a Gatt deal to be reached before the summit of the
group of seven industrial countries in Munich this summer, with the
re-election of Mr John Major and the elevation in France of the economically
hard-headed Mr Pierre Beregovoy, Mr Delors has the opportunity to strike the
deal.
Distorting effect
The obstacles should not be insuperable. Agreement is close, for example, on
the idea that the EC's payments to farmers in compensation for the lower
prices proposed by Mr Ray MacSharry, the farm commissioner, would not have
to be reduced for six years, even though they are seen as having a
distorting effect on trade and production. Similarly, the EC's demand for
'rebalancing' - raising the low tariffs on imports of cereal substitutes
already bound within the Gatt - seems to have faded away.
Difficulties remain, however, over the EC's idea of quantitative limits on
imports from the US of certain cereal substitutes - corn gluten especially.
Equally problematic is the EC demand for a commitment by the US that EC
subsidies would not be challenged under US law.
US opposition
More fundamental is the adamant US opposition to the EC's desire to change
parts of the text put forward by Mr Dunkel last December. It too would like
to make changes, but rightly fears that once one bit of the text is
challenged, the entire document could unravel.
The most worrying feature of current discussion - apart, that is, from the
continued failure to reach agreement - is the tendency to think in terms of
quantitative limits, be it on subsidised exports or on cheap imports. Such
limits may seem expedient, but they contradict fundamentally the thrust of
liberalisation. It would be better to focus on reductions in assistance,
letting quantities go where they will.
Behind the inability to reach agreement seems to be a belief by the EC that
the Dunkel text contradicts Mr MacSharry's proposed reductions in internal
support. But once consequent reductions in output are taken into account,
the MacSharry plan would probably meet the requirements of the text. At
most, it would need only simple modifications.
For over a year it has been true that once reform of the common agricultural
policy can be broached, there is no reason in principle why a Gatt agreement
should not be reached. Such an agreement is overwhelmingly in the economic
and political interests of all parties, including the EC. Europe needs to
solve the farm policy problem. Mr Delors knows that well. He should take the
opportunity now before him to turn that knowledge into action, so meeting
the final deadline of the Uruguay round.

FT  14 APR 92 / Leading Article: Mr Heseltine at industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SECRETARY OF STATE for trade and industry may not have been the crown Mr
Michael Heseltine most fondly dreamed of wearing during his years in the
political wilderness, but it is one for which he is singularly well
prepared.
Following his resignation from the Thatcher government in 1986 over the
Westland affair, Mr Heseltine set out in explicit terms his preferred job
description.
It is an interventionist view which will be welcomed in many British
boardrooms, not least for its primary assertion that government must worry
hard about the health of manufacturing industry. Much less clear is the
extent to which Mr Heseltine will seek or be allowed to implement a personal
manifesto which contrasts so sharply with the official version published one
month ago.
The party manifesto, bearing the mark of his free market predecessor, has
almost nothing to say about manufacturing, beyond a commitment to further
deregulation and tax cutting. It also proposes that the DTI take over the
powers of the energy department.
Mr Heseltine's credo is that since all governments, in one way or another,
make decisions that have a large effect on business, it is best to shape
those policies into an industrial strategy.
He has advocated 'a new partnership' between government and industry, in
which government thinks more carefully about the industrial impact of all
its decisions, including procurement, taxation, overseas representation,
science, education and employment law. Without French interventionism, he
says, Europe would have no commercial aircraft industry. It is difficult to
imagine Mr Heseltine privatising part of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department or the British Technology Group - both acts of the last
Thatcher/Major government.
Employee dialogue
He is also in favour of a revived National Economic Development Council, a
creation of Harold Macmillan which, he argues, has 'never fulfilled its
potential'. He has proposed that the industry secretary rather than the
chancellor should chair this tripartite body and that its membership include
the financial institutions which own most British industry.
More controversially, he has said that any company with more than 500
employees should be required to demonstrate that it has effective mechanisms
for dialogue with its workforce. It is thus difficult to see why Mr
Heseltine would want to resist the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty,
something which Mr Major has made an article of faith.
And so on. He favours strong fiscal incentives for business investment, such
as the soon to be discontinued Business Expansion Scheme, and worries about
too much foreign investment. The future of the Rover group, a 1987 book
says, is necessarily 'a matter for the government', not least because of the
'ominous increase in foreign ownership and control' of the UK motor
industry. He proposes a 'positive benefits' test for mergers, which has more
in common with the Labour party's ideas than the Tebbit-Lilley doctrines
which still officially hold sway.
Potential conflict
At his most ambitious, Mr Heseltine has sounded like a would-be minister of
the supply side economy, buttressed by a Cabinet-level industry committee.
Even denied this, he faces potentially serious conflict with the Treasury
and the competition directorate of the European Commission, run by a fellow
Westland victim, Sir Leon Brittan. Clear policy identity can only emerge
from this muddle when compromise, brokered by the prime minister, has
occurred.
Meanwhile, some urgent priorities lie on the non-industry side of Mr
Heseltine's brief: the Gatt round, the opening of western European markets
to east European goods, the privatisation of the coal industry and the need
to introduce stronger market pressures into the energy utilities.
As for the 'partnership' agenda, it is by no means to be dismissed out of
hand. A revived Nedo capable of trenchant policy analysis and
ideas-generation is much to be desired. Corporate governance does need to
reflect a wider view of ownership. If Mr Heseltine can balance this with an
enhanced regard for competition policy and expunge from his thinking a trace
of outdated nationalism, the DTI could yet prove to be his finest hour.

FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: Chester Mystery Plays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chester Mystery Plays, first mentioned in Chester in 1422, have always
sought an international connection.
Their supposed originator, 'Done Rondall, moonke of Chester Abbe', lobbied
at Rome three times 'before he could obtaine leave of the Pope to have them
in the English tongue.' The knotty vernacular text survives in five
manuscripts (1592-1607). That text, abridged and part translated into
Portuguese, forms the basis of a bi-lingual performance of the Mystery Cycle
in the largest Anglo-Portuguese theatre collaboration to date.
The result is a worthwhile production of great enterprise. Sixteen actors
from four companies tour for six weeks in Portugal (Braga, Evora, Porto,
Lisbon), finishing at the Mermaid Theatre, London. The production unites
actors from the Companhia de Teatro de Braga, the Centro Dramatico de Evora
and the Seiva Trupe of Porto under the aegis of the London Theatre Ensemble.
The Portuguese companies had not worked with English actors before; and
neither - such is the structure and culture of theatre in Portugal - had
they worked with each other. The project also attests to the degree of
collaboration possible between state and private funding bodies in England
and Portugal. The Gulbenkian Foundation, The Secretaria de Estado da Cultura
and the British Government (through British Council and Arts Council grants)
each provided 30 per cent of the budget.
The shared religious and cultural experience makes an apt choice for such a
joint venture. The Cycle celebrates rather than enacts the biblical
narrative. On stage at Evora, the second leg of the tour, the Cycle shows
both the scope and limits of bi-lingual collaboration. One hears alternate
lines or speeches in English and Portuguese; the effect at first dislocates
and then focuses the attention; one recognises parts of the Catholic litany,
familiar in Latin or English, but now intelligible in Portuguese.
The two languages, switched and intercut on stage, produce tense effects:
Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, Gabriel and Mary at the Annunciation,
Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Resurrection; all these pairs successfully
play their scenes in Portuguese and English, where only a bi-lingual speaker
would know exactly what is happening.
When language is not fundamental or available, the staged gesture and
positioning need to be more obvious and explicit. Here, the company's
preparatory workshops on non-verbal communication have helped stress the
dramatic rather than verbal interchange; but perhaps even more can be done.
A common language of gesture began to emerge throughout the Cycle at Evora;
the cast needs to be fluent in it.
While this five-hour Cycle is a cultural and logistical success for the
producer David Westhead, the action on stage could still benefit from more
of the energy which put it there. There are moments of achieved potential in
a magical Creation, where God looks into the dark under a glowing filament
and decides to create light, and in the making of man and woman from clay
models; later, stage effects, gesture, movement and tone create a tense Last
Supper and Betrayal and a complex debate with Pilate. The Scourging and
Crucifixion of Christ are both harrowing, they speak and show the language
of violence and grief. As the production matures, it should become more
muscular and robust.
Mark Dornford-May's direction eschews music and special effects, bringing
the action down to exchanges between individuals. He avoids the temptation
of the anarchic approach in keeping with the street setting of the original
Mystery plays, and so keeps confusion at bay. But a formulaic approach would
have made some scenes (the Temptation, the raising of Lazarus) more
accessible.
The design (by Claudia Mayer) is simple and uncluttered: a bare stage with a
grey backdrop and a huge sun; it absorbs quick changes and entrances, a door
becomes a tomb, a table an ark or a sepulchre. While the lighting remains
clear and plain, the costumes provide the colour and variety as each actor
appears in several roles.
The 1607 Chester text introduces the plays with a note that when one Sir
Henry Francis of Chester Abbey (another supposed author), staged the plays,
he 'obtained of Pope Clemens a thousand daies of pardon for every person
that resorted peaceably to see the same playes.' Wherever he may be now, Sir
Henry should be confident about this latest production.
London, Mermaid Theatre (071) 410 0000, from April 22 to May 2

FT  14 APR 92 / People: Thorn executive switches to B&amp;J
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the shareholder-inspired board room shake-up at Brown and Jackson in
February, the group, which runs the Poundstretcher discount retail chain,
has now appointed a new finance director. He is Robert Ellis, who used to
work for the rental division of Thorn EMI, the consumer electronics company.
It can be no coincidence that Ian Gray, who was brought in as chief
executive in February by institutional shareholders, was formerly in charge
of Thorn's UK rental division. Gray says B&amp;J now has 'the management
structure, the skills and the experience' to exploit the group's strengths.
The former finance director, Mike Kerrison, is staying on the board, and
Henry Bliss is dropping the post of corporate development director but
taking up a new role in the group.

FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: IRA bomb attack on Staples Corner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOMB attack on Staples Corner, one of Britain's busiest road junctions,
marks a new phase in the IRA's campaign against the capital's transport
system, Richard Tomkins writes.
Earlier attacks have involved relatively small devices on London Underground
or at main British Rail stations.
Attacking a key element of the trunk-road network disrupts the journeys of a
wider cross-section of the public, including many business and industrial
road users. The sheer size of the explosion means disruption not just for
days but for weeks and possibly months.
The explosion took place at the point where the M1 motorway and A5 trunk
road, two of the main traffic arteries to the north, disgorge their traffic
into the London road system.

FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Challenge to sustain commercial heartbeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTECTING the image of London's commercial heart was the Corporation of
London's toughest challenge after the explosion that damaged 200 buildings.
The bombing of the Stock Exchange a year ago made it clear to the
Corporation that faith in the City as a place to do business could be shaken
by a terrorist attack.
Within 60 hours of Friday's bomb it had contacted nearly all the 36
companies known to be affected and helped arrange relocation. Yesterday at
9.30am most were operating.
The clubbiness for which the Square Mile is often criticised worked to its
advantage. Mr Peter Tudball, chairman of the Baltic Exchange, could visit
his friend Sir Brian Jenkins, the lord mayor, and brief him over a gin and
tonic.
Sir Brian was able to put him in touch with another friend, Mr David
Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, the insurance market, to talk about
alternative accommodation for the Baltic Exchange. Sir Brian said: 'That's
what the City is all about.' Sir Brian was at dinner when police contacted
him about the explosion.
He went to the scene where he met another old friend, Mr Owen Kelly,
commissioner of the City police, who had a list of businesses affected. The
lord mayor passed this to Mr Ted Harthill, the City surveyor, who was able
to put displaced businesses in touch with surveyors who had office space.

FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Stopgap offices open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, CATHERINE MILTON and KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS OF City workers arrived yesterday at unfamiliar offices to try to
ensure business carried on as normal after Friday's IRA bomb had damaged
their familiar workplaces.
'It's an odd feeling to wake up in the morning and not knowing where you are
going to work,' said Mr Hugh Scott, assistant secretary of Fosfa, a trading
association for commodities' brokers and a refugee from the third floor of
the wrecked Baltic Exchange.
'The bomb has put things in perspective for me,' he said. 'All those
deadlines that seemed so important have passed without comment. It is going
to be very difficult to pick things up again.
'At the moment we cannot access our fax machine, telephones or address
system. We are out of touch with 600 member companies.'
Ingenuity and effort over the weekend meant most displaced workers had
somewhere to go. Up to 100 staff of James Capel, the securities house,
worked through the weekend to construct a replacement dealing room from
scratch. Commercial Union, the insurance company worst hit by the blast, was
trading as normal.
James Capel installed phones, computers and office furniture in spare
premises on Devonshire Square in time to provide a full dealing service by
7am yesterday.
The Stock Exchange loaned 35 Topic screens carrying its share dealing
information service while Reuters provided trading screens and the Midland
Bank offered office equipment including fax machines, desks and chairs.
'Everyone was incredibly co-operative,' said Mr Peter Letley, finance
director. 'I really don't know who paid.'
All Capel's 1,000 employees were called on Sunday night and told whether and
where to go yesterday. The settlement department moved to the Devonshire
Square site, but many staff were allowed back into Bevis Marks.
'Both buildings are running smoothly,' said Mr Letley. 'We should be back to
normal by Wednesday. Our clients have been very supportive. One faxed me to
congratulate us and send best wishes to the staff.' The Baltic Exchange,
which arranges most of the world's freight chartering and more than half of
world-wide ship sales, was even able to publish last night its Baltic
Freight Index, the futures index recognised worldwide as a barometer of the
freight market.
Mr Peter Tudball, the exchange chairman, said: 'There has been no business
lost on the London market. In fact, I think more people have been using the
London market today because of this tragic incident than probably would have
done last week.'
Other companies took a variety of steps to continue operating. Staff from
Shaw &amp; Croft, the solicitors, moved yesterday to the Great Eastern Hotel,
and will transfer later in the week to premises in Gracechurch Street which
they will occupy for three to six months.
In the wine bars and coffee shops of the City yesterday, all talk was of the
effects of the blast. One broker - whose business had not been affected -
said: 'Hitler could not shake the spirit of the City and it will take more
than a few bombs from the IRA.'
A receptionist from St Paul Fire and Marine Insurance, which was operating
in damaged premises on Lime Street, said: 'It is frightening. All the bomb
scares make me very apprehensive. I am just wondering where the next one
will be. But I will carry on business as normal - you can't let them stop
you.'
The regional director of a major UK clearing bank, puffing on his cigar,
said cynically: 'I have seen it before, hurricanes, train strikes and so on.
It will be the Dunkirk spirit for a day and then it will all die down. We
need to capitalise on it today to get the bulk of the work done.'
One office-less executive added angrily: 'Whatever the IRA do they are not
going to threaten the viability of London as a major financial centre. It
will continue to make a valuable contribution to the invisible earnings of
the UK.'
Mr David Swinglad, an employee with Trinity Insurance, located opposite the
Commercial Union building, said: 'I had a window on my desk when I came in
this morning, so I just changed desks and hoovered up and carried on.'

FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Fears over foreign opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE acres of vacant office space in the City proved a blessing to overseas
institutions made homeless by Friday's bombing. Most found new premises
before the financial markets opened yesterday.
The practical problems were quickly solved, but a wider question is whether
foreign banks and securities houses will reconsider locating in London in
the light of continued terrorist activity. Institutions affected by Friday's
bomb said that terrorism would make no difference.
Mr Kaneo Muromachi, general manager of Sanwa Bank in London, said: 'We are
certainly angry and frustrated, but this does not change anything
fundamental. There are many factors to consider. This is not critical.'
But terrorist attacks could have a long-term effect on the thinking of
senior banking executives abroad. The attack, in which 19 Japanese bank
workers were injured, was given extensive coverage on Japanese television.
Sanwa Bank, previously on the seventh floor of the Commercial Union building
devasted in Friday's attack, has moved to Bucklersbury House, Walbrook,
occupied until earlier this year by Industrial Bank of Japan.
Daiwa Bank, which occupied the 11th floor of the Commercial Union tower, has
moved to the King Street offices formerly occupied by Mitsubishi Bank. Daiwa
Capital Management, the bank's capital markets operation, has moved into
Monument Street offices that housed Nomura International until last year.
Both said securities trading had suffered only slight disruption because
duplicate records of securities holdings and settlements were stored away
from the main offices.
Daiwa Capital Management said that most securities in settlement had been
located by the end of the day. 'There are only a few bits and pieces
missing.'
Ten years ago a bomb in the City could have crippled financial institutions
by destroying computers. However, soaring rents and falling telephone
tariffs in the 1980s persuaded finance directors to send data-processing
departments out of town.
Staff at Robertson Hiscox, a Lloyd's agency affected by the attack, worked
through the weekend to restore computer services. 'We carried out some
machines by hand. The casings were damaged by shards of glass but software
has survived,' said Mr Bob Bates, the data processing manager. 'Our disaster
plan worked extremely well.'

200 buildings damaged

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE City, where one in every five office buildings is empty, is well placed
to accommodate the 40 or so companies displaced by Friday's bombing.
There was even reluctant acknowledgement that putting 1m sq ft of office
space temporarily out of action could help the depressed property industry.
Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of troubled property company Speyhawk, said:
'There will be some benefit to the market. This means a number of occupiers
are seeking space and urgently.'
Speyhawk's Exchequer Court building in St Mary Axe will cost 'tens of
millions' to repair and may need to be demolished, according to Mr Osborne.
But as it is fully insured and may have difficulty finding tenants, delay in
its completion could take some pressure off the company.
The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, said no
buildings would need to be demolished. However, 10 buildings in St Mary Axe,
including the Baltic Exchange, the Chamber of Shipping and Royal Bank of
Scotland were severely damaged.
A total of 200 buildings were damaged, with 100 badly affected. The damage
and associated losses may reach Pounds 300m, and replacing glass will take a
month or more.
Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments worked through the weekend to find
accommodation for tenants - such as Commercial Union Asset Management, the
European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, and Quilter Goodison - in
its Broadgate complex at rents of Pounds 40 per sq ft.
Mr Kevin McGovern of Rosehaugh said: 'We are not looking to exploit the
circumstances. We want to dispel any notion that this is a strategic
long-term solution for us. We are just trying to get people back to work.'
On Saturday The Corporation of London set up a help line manned by surveyors
to find accommodation for displaced firms.

STAFF at James Capel, the securities house, worked through the weekend to
construct a replacement dealing room after surveying damage to its building
from the IRA's bomb, Andrew Jack writes.
Telephones, computers and furniture were installed in spare premises in
Devonshire Square to provide a full dealing service by 7am yesterday.
James Capel said: 'It was a Herculean task but we built a whole separate
dealing room on the chance we would not be allowed back into our premises.'
Twenty staff assessed damage at the Bevis Marks site on Friday evening, and
up to 100 people were involved around the clock at the weekend.
The Stock Exchange loaned 35 Topic screens carrying its share-dealing
information service, while Reuters provided trading screens and Midland Bank
offered office equipment, including fax machines, desks and chairs.
Capel directors met at Sunday lunchtime to decide which departments should
be reduced in number and which staff would be essential to permit trading at
normal levels.
A team of staff called all Capel's 1,000 employees on Sunday night with
instructions on where to attend in the morning. About 200 were told to
remain at home. The settlement department moved to the Devonshire Square
site, but many staff were allowed to go back to work in Bevis Marks.
Mr Peter Letley, finance director, said: 'Both buildings are running
smoothly.'

FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Insurers braced for large claims -
Insurers face claims of Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON insurers could face claims of up to Pounds 1bn as a result of the
weekend's bomb blasts, according to industry analysts last night.
Damage to property in the City has been estimated at about Pounds 300m, but
claims from business interruption and loss of profits could more than double
the total loss to insurers. Analysts stress that 'BI' claims were an
important element of the Pounds 120m claim from the fire at the London
Underwriting Centre in August last year - the UK's biggest property loss
hitherto.
In addition to a number of very large claims from the owners of the
Commercial Union tower and the Baltic Exchange, there is likely to be a
plethora of smaller claims to pay for damage resulting from shock waves
caused by the explosion in the City and the subsequent one at Staples Corner
in north London.
Mr Nicholas Balcombe, managing director of Balcombe Group, a loss assessor
acting on behalf of some of the companies affected by the Staples Corner
blast, said: 'We haven't seen this sort of damage before in England.'
A number of factories up to a quarter of a mile away from Staples Corner
have sustained heavy damage.
Mr Balcombe said: 'On the outside it looks as if there is no damage but you
walk in and the place is crumbling about you. Inside the roof lights are
broken and the suspended ceilings and partition walls have collapsed.'
Overall losses are likely to be widely spread across the London market, but
the UK composite (general and life) companies could be badly hit.
Claims will aggravate the difficulties of insurers who have recently
completed reporting pre-tax losses in excess of Pounds 1bn for last year.
Loss adjusters Robins, Davies &amp; Little are still examining the extent of
damage to the CU tower, but brokers estimated yesterday that the cost of
physical damage alone could amount to more than Pounds 200m.
In the City the firmest indications of losses have come from the Baltic
Exchange, the ship freight market badly damaged by the first blast on Friday
night. Rebuilding costs will amount to Pounds 150m, according to Mr Peter
Tudball, its chairman.
Royal Insurance confirmed that it led the exchange's insurance placement.
Its exposure though is unlikely to amount to more than 10 per cent of the
total.
Insurers are also likely to face dozens of more modest claims from tenants
of scores of buildings in the vicinity.
Damage to windows and to the interiors of a number of offices has been
surprisingly severe.
Mr Michael Wade, chairman of brokers Holman Wade which occupies a building
on Camomile Street overlooking the Baltic Exchange, said that his company's
claims for replaced windows alone will amount to more than Pounds 100,000.
At Staples Corner, the site of the second blast, claims amounting to more
than Pounds 50m are expected from the owners of as many as 15 factories and
warehouses.
A superstore owned by B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself supplier, was destroyed by the
blast. It was adjacent to the the explosion, but most other properties are
over a quarter of a mile away on an industrial estate.

FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Experts warn cities to prepare for further
attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TERRORISM experts yesterday warned London and other cities to brace
themselves for further IRA attacks, but said it was impossible to predict
the precise tactics the terrorists might use.
The explosions in the City and at Staples Corner in north London on Friday
were the first IRA car bombs on the mainland since the Harrods bombing in
1983.
Some experts had suggested that this attack could mark a return to the use
of imprecisely aimed large bombs rather than the smaller devices and
firebombs used on the transport system and in shops. But Mr Ian Geldard,
editor of Conflict International, a journal which monitors international
terrorism, said: 'I do think we are going to see more actions, but it is
impossible to predict what tactics they may use and where.'
The City, with its narrow streets, tall buildings - which tend to magnify
the effect of explosions - and large areas of unsecured glass, has been
shown to be a particularly vulnerable target.
Mr Geldard, however, said this did not necessarily mean it would suffer
repeat attacks. 'The IRA is constantly changing its strategy and tactics.
They have moved from targeting military bases to letter bombs, mortar bombs,
and smaller devices aimed at transport, and now they've reverted to car
bombs. They try to keep everyone guessing.'
Experts believe the primary aim of Friday's bomb was to cause widespread
damage and disruption, and that the large number of civilian casualties may
have been the result of a miscalculation by the IRA, which was not expecting
so many people still to be in the City in the evening.
'If they had really wanted to to cause massive civilian casualties they
could have timed the bomb to go off at lunchtime,' said one specialist.
The timing of the Staples Corner explosion lent weight to the theory that
causing damage rather than casualties was the main objective.
In the short term, Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner of the City of London police,
said yesterday that he would increase the number of officers on hecks of
vehicles and people.
In the longer term, experts conceded little could be done to make a large
area safe against car or parcel-type bombs without intruding into privacy.
Moreover, if such intrusion became commonplace, the terrorists could be said
to have succeeded in their aim of causing disruption.
Mr David Fletcher, chief executive of the British Security Industry
Association, suggested that City companies could set up a network of video
cameras constantly recording movements in surrounding streets. Many banks
and building societies already monitor their premises with closed-circuit
television and other companies might be persuaded to follow suit to produce
near City-wide cover.
Mr Fletcher said the threat of being caught was one of the few effective
deterrents to terrorists. 'If someone sees a camera and knows he might be
recorded doing what he is doing, then he might decide not to do it.'
Friday's bombing also highlighted how badly prepared the City was for such
an attack.

FT  14 APR 92 / Narrow vote in favour of Rover changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER workers have voted by a very narrow margin in favour of reforms to
working practices and bargaining procedures through which the company aims
to transform efficiency. The package has been strongly endorsed by union
leaders.
The vote in the ballot of 28,000 union members was 11,961 to 11,793. While
the company intends to go ahead with the reforms, the narrowness of the vote
suggests that Rover faces a hard task in persuading its workforce to adopt
the changes wholeheartedly.
Union leaders had praised Rover for its willingness to negotiate and for its
attempts to involve workers more fully in decision-making.
Shopfloor resentment is thought to have stemmed in part from the company's
failure to offer any cash inducement to accept the package. Other carmakers
seeking change have tended to make such offers. Rover had sought to sweeten
its package through such measures as increasing job security by suggesting
it would not implement compulsory redundancies, and by improving holiday and
sick-pay arrangements for blue-collar workers.
While welcoming these proposals, some workers were concerned about measures
such as the phasing out of 'clocking-on' arrangements and payment of wages
by credit transfer rather than in cash. The company's intention of removing
all demarcations between jobs will have raised fears about increased
workloads.
Other aspects of the package include 'single-table' bargaining procedures at
which leaders of white-collar and blue-collar unions will negotiate on pay
together; the extension of team working; and a mechanism for binding
arbitration in disputes, providing both sides agree to it.
Rover said the package was so broad that it was inevitable there would be
concerns. It would attempt to allay fears as it introduced the changes.

FT  14 APR 92 / Clowes ordered to pay Pounds 6m damages to DTI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER CLOWES, the jailed fraudster, and his wife Pamela were yesterday
ordered to make an immediate interim payment of Pounds 6m damages to the
Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI took over the claims of investors
who lost money in the collapse of the Barlow Clowes investment group.
The High Court order by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, follows a
judge's ruling last month that the couple had 'no defence' to the damages
claim launched by the DTI to recoup what it can.
The exact amount of damages has yet to be assessed by the court, but the
judge said it was 'inevitable' that the figure would exceed Pounds 10m.
Mr and Mrs Clowes had argued that they should not be ordered to make an
interim payment because they did not have the means to pay. The liquidators
of Barlow Clowes have made claims against all of Mr Clowes's assets.
Sir Donald said this case was 'far removed from the run-of-the-mill' and
there was nothing unjust in ordering an interim payment, even if the amount
was beyond the couple's means and had the 'extreme consequence' of bringing
bankruptcy on them.
Interest is to run on the interim payment, but the judge granted a stay of
his order pending an appeal by Mr and Mrs Clowes.
Mr Clowes, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for fraud, was in court
for the brief hearing. He and his wife, who was not present, are receiving
legal aid.
The DTI claim is one of many against Mr Clowes, 49, who cheated investors of
an estimated Pounds 113m by promising to invest in gilt-edged securities
while spending the money on a yacht, an executive jet, expensive cars and
various business enterprises.

FT  14 APR 92 / BBC urged to end recognition of unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN END to automatic union recognition by the BBC has been suggested by one
of the internal task forces on the future of the corporation.
The proposal is one of the recommendations of the employers' task force
which recommends that the clause in the BBC's Royal Charter providing for
union recognition should be removed in the new charter which will run from
the beginning of 1997.
The proposals make it clear that the members of the employers' task force
would like the BBC to move towards more direct negotiations with its
employees. Under such a scheme BBC employees would still be able to join
unions. However, those unions fear they could be derecognised for the
purposes of collective bargaining. The introduction of individual personal
contracts has become common in the media industries, particularly in
national newspapers, in recent years.
The proposals on future recognition of unions at the BBC are among those
expected to be leaked by Bectu, the broadcasting union, today.
The union is believed to have detailed information on all of the
recommendations made by the task force. They are due to be considered next
month by the BBC board of man-agement and the governors.
Some individual task-force proposals have already been rejected. One
committee suggested that the corporation should review the potential for
contracting out of BBC services. However, Sir Michael Checkland,
director-general of the BBC, has said that no such policy would be
implemented.

FT  14 APR 92 / NHS, Hospital trusts to spend 1.6bn on building improvements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service and hospital trusts are to spend Pounds 1.6bn on
building improvements as a consequence of the lifting of Crown immunity from
hospital properties, a survey of health authorities says, Daniel Green
writes.
Most of the work is to conform with fire regulations. NHS Crown immunity was
lifted a year ago. Until then planning regulations did not apply to
hospitals. One authority has been quoted Pounds 40m to upgrade its five
hospitals.
The Audit Commission yesterday described the findings of the survey as
'reasonable'.
One fifth of health authorities and hospital trusts were asked by Building
Intelligence Digest, a consultancy, how much they planned to spend to
conform to regulations. Nearly two thirds had earmarked Pounds 2m with one
in seven planning to spend more than Pounds 10m.

FT  14 APR 92 / Builders predict more job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE construction industry has raised its expectations of job losses suffered
in the three-year recession. It fears that more than 300,000 jobs will have
gone by the end of this year in spite of signs that indicators of future
activity are continuing to improve.
Mr John Smith, chairman of the Building Employers Confederation, said
yesterday: 'There is still no sign of renewed growth in output, so 1992 will
be another extremely tough year for construction firms and their employees.'
Mr Smith was commenting on the confederation's latest state-of-trade
inquiry, which gives a gloomy picture of trading prospects for the UK
building industry. Construction output fell 9 per cent last year, but Mr
Smith warned that the consensus of industry forecasts indicating a further
fall in output of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent this year may prove too
optimistic.
Until the end of last year the confederation had expected the fall in
employment since mid 1989 to be between 200,000 and 250,000. But the
recession has forced it to revise its forecast. Mr Smith said: 'The jobless
figure looks like continuing to rise for the rest of 1992 and into 1993.' He
described a reduction of 300,000 jobs as 'disastrous' for the industry
because of the loss of skilled craftsmen.
The confederation draws some encouragement from an easing in the decline of
inquiries for work and from an increase in optimism about future workloads.
Mr Smith also noted optimism among smaller and medium-sized builders
involved in refurbishment work. He was 'greatly concerned', however, that
the amount of work in hand among bigger construction companies continued to
fall. 'I am afraid that this reflects the gradual completion of large
projects which are not being replaced by new orders.' It also emerged from
the inquiry that the proportion of construction companies operating at less
than half capacity has risen to 25 per cent.
Mr Smith urged the government to use the opportunity created by the general
election result to stimulate the housing market by abolishing stamp duty -
which has been temporarily suspended - and to bring more stability to
prices.
The 600 companies involved in the inquiry were taken from the
confederation's 8,000 members. They were asked to list three top priorities
for stimulating construction demand.

FT  14 APR 92 / Power station to go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric, the privatised electricity generator and supply
company, and Norweb, the regional electricity supply company, are to build
jointly a 660MW gas-fired power station at Keadby, south Humberside. The
companies yesterday completed financing for the Pounds 400m station, which
will open in January 1995.
New power stations such as Keadby, which will be buying gas from British
Gas, have faced opposition since gas prices were increased by about 15 per
cent to 20 per cent in September. Critics said this meant the projects would
produce expensive electricity, which regional companies would then sell to
captive domestic customers.
Mr Malcolm Faulkner, Norweb's managing director, said Keadby would supply
competitive power. He said the high price reflected flexible supply terms.
Only about 60 per cent of gas will be supplied by British Gas. Mobil Gas
Marketing will be another supplier.
The Keadby station will use the latest turbine technology. John Brown
Engineering, which will build the station, said the deal was its largest
order of its type from the UK.
A UK, US, and Japanese consortium will build a Pounds 230m 660MW power
station on the Isle of Grain in Kent. TBV Power, which is jointly owned by
Tarmac and Black and Veatch, a US construction company, will join Marubeni,
the Japanese trading company, to design and build the station.
The government should triple or quadruple its target for introducing
renewable energy such as wind, wave and solar power, according to a report
from MPs the Commons energy select committee yesterday.

Mrs Heather Ryan, president of Amma - the third-largest teachers' union -

breaking point' by the government's 'muddled planning and impossible

She added: 'Politicians and Civil Service advisers have approached education
like vivisectionists, using schools as laboratories for doctrinaire
curriculum, assessment and funding techniques, squeezing the life and
creativity out of the education service.'

LEADERS of the RMT transport union said yesterday that they would ballot
members at London Underground over industrial action in protest at plans to

The ballot will be over the principle of management refusing to deal with
change through bargaining procedures. The union said London Underground was

London Underground said it was trying to agree negotiating machinery which
would be as local as possible. It said some changes to management grades

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRIAN Hayes, a former permanent secretary at the Department of Trade and
Industry, is to head a 14-member committee set up by the Securities and
Investments Board to work on the creation of a regulatory watchdog to
protect private investors.
Other members of the committee include Mr Peter Taylor, general manager of
Sun Alliance Life Division, Mr Jeremy Mitchell, director of the
International Consumer Policy Bureau, and Ms Barbara Saunders, a consumer
con-sultant who specialises in European Community legislation.
The creation of a self-regulating organisation (SRO) for retail investment
was the main recommendation last month of a report by Sir Kenneth Clucas.
Sir Kenneth was appointed by SIB in October last year to examine the need
for replacing the present complex and fragmented system of regulation of
retail investment by four different SROs, SIB itself and a number of
professional bodies.
Sir Kenneth suggested in his report that the new self-regulating
organisation should include all activities at present regulated by Lautro,
the life-assurance watchdog, and Fimbra, the regulator for financial
salesmen, managers and brokers, as well as some of those of Imro, the
pension-fund managers watchdog, and a few of those from the Securities and
Futures Association.
Sir Brian said yesterday that the committee planned to keep to a target date
of April next year by which the new SRO should be operational.
The committee will begin its detailed work at the end of this month.
Its terms of reference include designing the constitution of the new SRO and
determining the scope of its activities and its resource and financing
needs.
It will also decide the way in which it would obtain recognition under the
Financial Services Act and absorb the functions of the existing watchdogs.

FT  14 APR 92 / Air traffic stages a modest recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK AIR traffic staged a very modest recovery in the first quarter of this
year after last year's slump caused by the Gulf war and the recession.
Passenger traffic at airports in the south-east run by BAA, the airports
operator, increased by 19 per cent to 13.6m passengers in the first quarter,
against 11.4m in the same period last year at the height of the Gulf
conflict.
The BAA figures, published yesterday, show traffic increased by barely 1 per
cent compared with the first quarter of 1990. Passenger traffic last month
rose 12 per cent on March last year and was flat compared with March 1990.
The small recovery compared with 1990 reflects the continuing impact of the
recession. Traffic at London's Heathrow showed the strongest improvement,
but Gatwick is still struggling to recover former passenger levels.

FT  14 APR 92 / Slowdown seen in management salary rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL rates of pay increases for managers have slowed to an average of less
than 10 per cent, according to the latest executive-pay index produced by
the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries.
The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions, as well
as salaries and bonuses. It is based on the group's regular pay surveys, and
is calculated each quarter for the Financial Times.
The most recent survey, which covered 419 companies, shows that on April 1
the average for managers of all levels of seniority was Pounds 77,793. This
was 8.6 per cent up on the Pounds 71,633 average on the same date last year.
The corresponding increase between 1990 and last year was 13.6 per cent.
Over the latest 12 months the salary component of the total pay package has
increased on average by 8.8 per cent to Pounds 55,240, while bonuses have
risen by only 4.2 per cent to Pounds 4,421. The pensions element is 18.4 per
cent higher at Pounds 8,305, with company cars up by 2.1 per cent to Pounds
8,508, and other benefits by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 1,319.

FT  14 APR 92 / 'An essential act of leadership'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The text of Mr Kinnock's statement read:
In the wake of the election defeat, I am taking action which in my judgment
as leader will serve in the best interests of the Labour party.
I trust that members and supporters will readily come to understand and
support the course which I am going to follow. The decisions which I have
made will require rapid change. Those decisions have not, however, been
taken hastily. They result from rational consideration which I have given
over a period of time to the future of the Labour party.
I will not be seeking re- election as leader of the Labour party. In order
to ensure that new leadership elections can be completed without delay, I
will be proposing to the national executive committee meeting tomorrow that
the elections be held as quickly as proper organisation allows. The
elections will, therefore, take place in the second half of June.
My resignation from the position of leader of the Labour party will take
effect from the date of the elections. The deputy leader, Roy Hattersley,
shares my view of the course which must be followed and will act
accordingly. This timetable will make it possible for the parliamentary
Labour party to elect a new shadow cabinet well before the summer recess.
In providing for these developments I am seeking to ensure the Labour party
can get on with its work with maximum speed and effectiveness. This will
prove to be particularly important when the government has a small majority
and faces the continuing and very deep economic difficulties it has caused
for the country. In these circumstances I am certain it would not be right
for the Labour party to wait for the six months until October before
establishing the leadership team and the political course which must be
followed.
As the election process opens I have only one piece of advice for the Labour
movement at every level: do not feed and do not believe the press and
broadcasting media in their reporting of these events. The Labour party must
conduct its own democratic election and do it in a way that brings credit
and strength to the party. That was done in 1983. I am sure it will be done
again.
I am taking the opportunity of this statement to notify the Labour party of
my intention to seek election to the constituency section of the national
executive committee at this year's annual conference. My purpose in doing
that is to try to continue to play an active and supportive part in
sustaining the advances in democracy and policy which I believe to be vital
to the future success of the party.
I want to record my heartfelt thanks to Roy Hattersley, the rest of the
shadow cabinet and the national executive committee for their loyalty, their
hard work and the personal and political qualities which have been a source
of strength in the recent campaign and for a very long time before that.
I also want to express my admiration for members of the Labour party, old
and new, whose dedication to the progress of the party and to the well-being
of the community makes me proud of them and confident that our cause of
democratic socialism will prevail. I want them and the many others who have
sent countless numbers of moving messages of support to Glenys and myself in
the last three days to know I deeply appreciate their great kindness.
I assure them very firmly the action I am taking is an essential act of
leadership. It is not to do with any personal sensitivity - it arises
entirely from my desire to see that the Labour party will gain further
strength and be better able to serve the people of Britain and the wider
world community.
This is an appropriate time for me to ask all those who wanted Labour to win
to join the Labour party and add to the breadth of its support. In the wake
of the general election many people want to express their feeling of
determined commitment to the politics of mercy and justice and to policies
of economic renewal. Joining the Labour party will give them a practical way
of making those feelings count.
There will be many opportunities to consider the causes and consequences of
last Thursday's election result. I will not dwell on them here.
I will content myself, for the moment, with drawing attention to the words
of the former treasurer of the Conservative party, Lord McAlpine, in
yesterday's Sunday Telegraph: 'The heroes of this campaign,' said Lord
McAlpine, 'were Sir David English (editor of the Daily Mail), Sir Nicholas
Lloyd (editor of the Daily Express), Kelvin MacKenzie (editor of The Sun)
and the other editors of the grander Tory press. Never in the past nine
elections have they come out so strongly in favour of the Conservatives.
'Never has their attack on the Labour party been so comprehensive. . . This
was how the election was won, and if the politicians, elated in their hour
of victory, are tempted to believe otherwise, they are in very real trouble
next time.'
Lord McAlpine could not be expected to acknowledge the degree of
misinformation and disinformation employed in the attacks on the Labour
party, but in all other respects his assessment is correct.
The government elected on 9 April 1992 does not have, and will not develop,
the policies necessary to strengthen the British economy, and will not try
to address the injustices in British society. My great regret is that I
failed to ensure that enough people understood that, and the implications
which it has for the future.
My sorrow is that millions, particularly those who do not have the strength
to defend themselves, will suffer because of the election of another
Conservative government.
I make, and I seek, no excuses, and I express no bitterness when I say that
the Conservative-supporting press has enabled the Tory party to win yet
again when the Conservative party could not have secured victory for itself
on the basis of its record, its programme or its character.
The relationship between the Conservative party and those newspapers which
Lord McAlpine describes as being edited by 'heroes' is a fact of British
political life.
I did think that it would be possible this time to succeed in achieving
change in spite of that. Clearly it wasn't. Success will therefore have to
wait. But it will come, and I will work for it.
The text of Mr Hattersley's letter to Mr Kinnock is:
Dear Neil,
I have written to Larry Whitty telling him I propose to resign the deputy
leadership of the Labour party with effect from the special conference which
elects a new leadership team.
In the weeks and months ahead I shall play a full part in the debate about
Labour's future. Today, I do no more than offer you my thanks for your
friendship during the years in which we have served together and express my
admiration for the wayin which you have led theparty.
When you became leader there was a real fear that Labour could never
challenge for government again. Your constitutional and policy reforms
brought us back into the mainstream of politics.
No-one else could have achieved so much during the last difficult eight
years. When Labour wins the general election - as will clearly be within our
power in four to five years time - much of the credit for that victory will
be owed to you.
Yours, Roy.

<TEXT>
In one edition of the Financial Times on April 10, the result of the
election in the constituency of Chelmsford was given incorrectly. The
correct figures are:
Simon Burns (Conservative), 39,043; Hugh Nicholson (Liberal Democrat)
20,783; Dr Roy Chad (Labour) 10,010; Ms Eleanor Burgess (Green 769). Mr
Burns retained the seat with an increased majority of 18,260 on a turnout of
84.61 per cent.

FT  14 APR 92 / Waddington to become governor of Bermuda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD WADDINGTON, who left the cabinet at the weekend, is to become governor
of Bermuda, Downing Street announced yesterday.
The former leader of the House of Lords, who made way for Mr John Wakeham,
the former energy secretary and election campaign 'fixer', will take up his
new post late in the summer. The governorship carries an annual salary
equivalent to Dollars 115,000 (Pounds 65,280).
Mr John Major, the prime minister, spent some time yesterday consulting Mr
Richard Ryder, the chief whip, about the reshuffle of junior ministers. Most
of those changes will be announced today. Other senior colleagues were
consulted on Saturday when the cabinet posts were allocated.
There are about 40 places to be filled. The middle ranks of ministers have
been depleted, both by promotions to the cabinet and by those who have lost
their seats, including Mr Francis Maude, Mr John Maples, Mrs Lynda Chalker
and Mr Michael Fallon.
Among ministers tipped for advancement are Mr Stephen Dorrell, the junior
health minister, Sir George Young, the housing minister, and Mr John
Redwood, the corporate affairs minister. In the Lords, Baroness Blatch, the
environment minister, may also receive promotion.
Of those who are in the whips' office or are parliamentary private
secretaries - the first rung on the ministerial ladder - candidates for
office include Mr William Hague, parliamentary private secretary to Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr David Davis, a whip.
Although the new intake of Tory MPs contains many who have already been
associated with the government, such as Mrs Judith Chaplin, who was Mr
Major's political secretary, and Mr David Willetts, who was director of the
Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think tank, it is unlikely that any
of those entering the Commons for the first time would be given office
immediately.

FT  14 APR 92 / Labour steps back to the good-old bad-old days: Ivo Dawnay
says the party is suffering from a bout of recrimination and self-pity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR JOHN SMITH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
prematurely hailed as chief architect of an historic Labour victory - found
himself labelled yesterday into a creature of the 'union barons', a
beneficiary of a conspiracy and a stooge of the party establishment.
In the meantime, the election was not lost by Labour, but, according to its
outgoing leader, won by the Tory tabloid press. Only one thing, as they say
in the lager ads, can do this: a Labour election disaster and the onset of a
party leadership contest. Nobody can deny a party's right to a little
recrimination and self-pity in defeat; but then nobody exhibits it so
publicly and with such gothic hyperbole and suicidal skill as Labour.
Yesterday it was like old times. The day began with the claims of Mr Colin
Byrne - until last year Labour's chief press officer - in a letter to The
Guardian.
Mr Byrne charged that Mr Smith had 'cost the party dear' with his tax plans
and sat on his hands through all the tough decision-making of the Kinnock
years.
Unnamed conspirators, he added, 'had been manouvering (sic) John Smith into
position to walk into the leadership should Labour lose and orchestrated the
ruthless undermining and behind-the-hand rubbishing of perceived rivals in a
future contest'.
In other words, over all these years, when people like Mr Byrne were
insisting all was sweetness and light in the Labour team, it had in fact
been business as usual.
Much of this stems from Mr Neil Kinnock's now infamous dinner with
journalists at Luigi's restaurant, Covent Garden, in January. Some in the
Kinnock camp claim Mr Smith's office then briefed against the leader,
contradicting his suggestion that higher tax and National Insurance
contributions might be 'phased-in'.
In this particular demonology, therefore, it is only a small (if simplistic)
leap for the fanatically loyal to claim that it was Mr Smith's intransigence
on tax that lost Labour the election. The truth is probably less
conspiratorial.
Mr Smith was indeed widely believed to have been irritated by his leader's
dinnertime indiscretions, as he wished to keep back the option of phasing in
tax rises should it be needed. But to suggest this was all part of an
elaborate plot aimed at engineering Mr Smith a smooth passage to the Labour
leadership is laughable. Hearing Mr Byrne inveigh against 'spin-doctors' in
his lunchtime interviews yesterday caused a good deal of mirth in the
Commons' press gallery. As Labour's chief press officer for three years
under the communications directorship of Mr Peter Mandelson, Mr Byrne was
himself - arguably quite properly - a professional interpreter of events to
the media.
The second charge against the Smith camp - that it is steamrollering the
shadow chancellor into the leadership - is also only half the story. After
all, it is Mr Kinnock's determination to go that is pressing a quick
decision - although it must be admitted that this is not to Mr Smith's
disadvantage.
As for the role of the 'union barons' in the election, it will be the same
in June or July as it will be in October. There is also an irony in the
outrage among some of Labour's best known leftwingers - some of whom worked
hard to get the unions the biggest possible say in leadership elections at
the expense of MPs and constituency parties - that they intend to exercise
that right.
Is Labour back in the days of fierce ideological schism? It should not be,
yet it is in danger of becoming so. The differences between Mr Bryan Gould
and Mr Smith are complex, but they defy the simple categories of left versus
right.
There are distinct differences on attitudes to Europe and the economy. But
the key to Mr Gould's campaign is going to be putting a case for a new
appeal and a fresh style, aimed at attracting the southern middle-class that
Labour so signally failed to win over last week. His implicit argument in a
weekend interview was that the shadow chancellor had underestimated the poor
reaction to his tax plans among the 'aspiring' classes and that he lacked
the 'zeal and the passion' needed to woo the public away from 'pocket-book
issues'.
Some in the party, however, seem determined to try to transform Mr Gould
into the left's candidate and to portray the more traditional Mr Smith as an
advocate of a no longer valid 'steady-as-she-goes' policy. Mr Ken
Livingstone, the MP for Brent East, was yesterday among several leftwingers
who argued that the rightwing shadow chancellor had been too tough on
middle-income taxpayers.
What is clear is that before the election is held, Mr Smith will have to
fill in the blank sections of his ideological curriculum vitae to counter
the 'lack of vision' charges. So far Mr Smith is known, almost exclusively,
for his cautious bank-manager style.
In some respects it is his misfortune that what now looks more than likely
to be a foreshortened leadership contest will leave him almost inevitably
vulnerable to the accusation that he has been elected by a discredited
system.
His only plausible response to that is to follow Mr Gould's lead and promise
to accelerate changes in the party constitution to ensure that future
elections are conducted on the basis of one member, one vote.
Meanwhile, attention in Westminster has turned to the race for the deputy
leadership, which might be a dress rehearsal for the next leadership battle.
The decision by Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the
Treasury, not to run has mystified some of her supporters. With the
advantages of being a woman, English and leftwing, she is the ideal
complement to Scottish Mr Smith and may be persuaded to change her mind.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, is thought certain to run, as
may either or both Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, respectively the trade
and industry and employment spokesmen - and dubbed by the acerbic Mr
Prescott as the 'beautiful people'.
With official declarations expected to begin tomorrow, the triumphant Tories
 -now basking in their election victory - are anticipating a highly
enjoyable summer.

FT  14 APR 92 / Mayhew to meet Irish minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the new Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday made clear
that there was no place at talks on the province's political future for
those who support violence.
In spite of assertions by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, during
the election campaign that it would have to be included at some stage, Sir
Patrick said: 'The position of the British government has been made
abundantly clear. There never is a place for anybody at any table who
resorts to violence.'
On his first day in office in Belfast Sir Patrick outlined his immediate
priorities. These include meetings as soon as possible with Mr David
Andrews, the Irish foreign affairs minister, and with Northern Ireland's
political leaders. Sir Patrick will also meet unionist and nationalist
leaders.
He is expected to meet Mr Andrews at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting in
Belfast shortly after Easter. A formal suspension of conference sessions may
be announced at that meeting so that inter-party talks on the future
government of the province can be reconvened.
Unionists have welcomed the appointment of Sir Patrick to the Northern
Ireland office.
The new Ulster secretary was given a series of intensive briefings by
political and security advisers at Stormont Castle yesterday.
Sir Patrick yesterday dismissed potential Nationalist concern over his
alleged refusal to prosecute police officers at the centre of the so-called
shoot-to-kill investigations. The former attorney-general said the decision
had not been his and that he had left the past behind him.

FT  14 APR 92 / Activists fear 'union barons' will decide leadership race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGHT of union leaders queueing to endorse Mr John Smith as successor to
Mr Neil Kinnock has been 'very bad for Labour's image', Mr Mike Craven, head
of the Labour Co-ordinating Committee, the constituency party pressure
group, said yesterday.
The worry for Mr Craven, and others, is that 'union barons in smoked-filled
rooms' will decide the election after little consultation with their
members, giving further credence to the idea of Labour as a plaything of
unrepresentative union leaders.
The unions, representing 40 per cent of the votes in Labour's electoral
college, prefer Mr Smith as successor to Mr Kinnock. The leadership of three
main unions, the GMB and TGWU general unions and the AEEU, the craft union
merged from the AEU and the EETPU, have already declared for Mr Smith.
However, in spite of the tight timetable, the main unions will probably
ballot their members.
Membership ballots would at least give Mr Bryan Gould, or any other
candidate, the chance to challenge that recommendation. Mr Gould may also
win backing from Nupe, the public-service union, the National Communications
Union and other smaller unions.
In the previous elections the unions have used a wide variety of methods to
consult their members. Some have balloted members. Others have consulted
through union branches, and a third group has left it to their executives or
annual conferences to decide.
Although there now appears to be pressure for balloting, not all unions will
be able to, or want to, conform. The tight timetable makes balloting
difficult to arrange, the cost could be considerable and cannot - like some
other ballots - be recouped from the government.
The MSF technical union will 'consult as widely as possible through the
branches' says Mr Roger Lyons, general-secretary designate. Mr Tony Clarke,
deputy general secretary of the UCW postal union, says: 'We will consult
through branches. A postal ballot would cost Pounds 30,000 and, judging from
union elections, the turnout would be about 20 per cent. Democracy would not
necessarily be served.'
Ballots in the TGWU and the AEEU could cost more than Pounds 100,000. Mr
Nigel Harris, a member of both the AEU executive and Labour's national
executive, supports a quick election. 'I do not think we could have had a
situation in which the party was in limbo for six months,' he said.

Kelvin McKenzie
The Sun
His views were made known in a typically trenchant manner yesterday. An aide
said the claim that the press cost Mr Kinnock his election victory was an
insult to the 14m people who voted Conservative. The Sun says today that the
difference between it and Mr Kinnock is that its message is 'one of good
humour' and his 'one of vindictiveness'.
Sir Nicholas Lloyd
Daily Express
He dismissed Mr Kinnock's remarks about the press as 'a case of sour
grapes'. He said Mr Kinnock had not mentioned the vitriolic campaign mounted
against Mr John Major by the Daily Mirror. Sir Nicholas added: 'He doesn't
mention The Guardian, The Independent - or the Financial Times, which
advised its readers to vote Labour.'
Sir David English
Daily Mail
'The Mail is a campaigning Tory newspaper which examined very closely the
weaknesses of the Labour position and made sure our readers knew about them.
To suggest, as Mr Kinnock has done, that the Daily Mail single-handedly won
the election for the Conservatives . . . ascribes far more influence to us
than we would give ourselves.'

FT  14 APR 92 / US gene research supremo resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of controversial efforts to patent human genes won a victory at
the weekend with the resignation of Mr James Watson as head of the US
government's human gene research project.
Mr Watson, a Nobel prize winner for his part in discovering the DNA double
helix, is an outspoken opponent of recent attempts to patent pieces of human
genes.
The issue has divided scientific communities in the US, Japan and Europe
which are mapping all 100,000 genes in the human body. At stake is the
potential for billions of dollars of revenue from buyers of genetic
information, such as drug companies
Mr Watson was director of the Human Genome Project, the Washington-based
federal research organisation. The project is part of the National Institute
of Health (NIH), the US federal agency which is spending more than Dollars
150m (Pounds 87.2m) a year on the 20-year programme. The EC and Japan are
each putting in about one fifth as much again into the same project at local
research establishments.
Mr Watson's resignation comes at the same time as an inquiry by the NIH
ethics officer into a potential conflict of interest because of his
shareholdings in biotechnology companies. However, many believe he left
because of policy differences with Ms Bernadine Healy, who became director
of the NIH last year.
Mr Watson handed in his resignation on Friday saying it would allow Ms Healy
'to appoint her own director' of the Genome project.
Debate over the patenting of human genes reached a head last summer after a
US laboratory filed, under the auspices of the NIH, 347 patents for pieces
of human DNA.
'Virtually all scientists have opposed this,' said Sir Walter Bodmer,
president of the Human Genome Organisation, which co-ordinates human genome
research globally.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FLOOD in Chicago's underground tunnel system yesterday plunged the city
into chaos.
Trading was halted at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the world's two largest futures markets, and thousands of office
workers and hotel guests were evacuated.
Flooding began at about 6:30am after the rupture of a passageway in the
city's 93-year-old underground tunnel system. Although not officially
confirmed, it is believed a construction crew working near the Kinzie Street
bridge over the Chicago River accidentally punctured the wall while sinking
pilings.
Water poured into the underground tunnel system, originally built for coal
delivery and rubbish removal but now mainly used for freight and
telecommunications cables. A third of the downtown area, known as the Loop,
lost electricity in the early morning and further cuts were expected. No
injuries were reported.
The mass transit system was paralysed downtown and the city hall was
flooded.
By mid-day, despite pumping, the water level was still rising. Emergency
crews struggled to slow the water flow into the tunnels and plug the hole.
The Army Corps of Engineers was working to lower the level of the Chicago
River, which flows through the centre of the city, by closing a series of
locks connecting the river and Lake Michigan.
Although the futures exchanges, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the
largest US options market, and other businesses hoped to reopen this
morning, by late yesterday afternoon it remained unclear how soon the
tunnels could be cleared.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Bank, the New York-based banking group, cut its prime lending rate
yesterday from 6.5 to 6.25 per cent in an apparent attempt to get a head
start on rivals in the US commercial banking market, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The rate cut by Chemical was an unusual move. The big US commercial banks
traditionally change their prime rates in unison.
Chemical's decision to reduce the amount it charges on loans to favoured
customers follows the Fed's unexpected easing of monetary policy last
Thursday when the central bank signalled it wanted the federal funds rate -
at which banks borrow from each other - cut by a quarter of a percentage
point to 3.75 per cent.
A reduction in the Fed funds rate does not usually trigger cuts in prime
rates by big US commercial banks, which normally wait for the Fed to lower
the more important discount rate, at which the Fed charges banks for loans.
The discount rate is the Fed's most important monetary policy tool.

FT  14 APR 92 / Fujimori shuns easy route for 'revolution': Peru's president
faces a tough task despite his absolute powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori's overthrow of democracy in Peru last week was
not just another textbook Latin American coup.
First, Mr Fujimori is not a puppet of power-hungry generals. It is becoming
clear he plotted for months with an inner circle of advisers before striking
down Congress and the judiciary on April 5. 'This was a palace decision,
with the military brought in at the last moment,' an ambassador in Lima
says.
Secondly, the coup was bloodless and there were only a handful of arrests.
Press censorship was lifted after 48 hours. The president is basking in
opinion polls giving him more than 70 per cent support, and few Peruvians
appear to be mourning democracy's demise.
Yet the events in Peru pose a moral and policy dilemma for an international
community contemplating sanctions against Mr Fujimori's military-backed
dictatorship.
No one could fault his stated objectives: to rid his country of terrorism,
drug trafficking and corruption. What is open to question is whether Mr
Fujimori, as he claims, had no option but to shut down Congress and the
judiciary and whether he can succeed in his aims, having taken absolute
power.
The Organisation of American States (OAS), which met yesterday in
Washington, hopes to turn back the clock by sending a diplomatic mission to
Lima to reconcile Mr Fujimori and the disbanded Congress. The mission is
unlikely to succeed, but it will buy time for the US as it weighs the
political costs of isolating Peru and withdrawing its anti-narcotics agents
and military advisers.
The hiatus will also give Mr Fujimori a breathing space in which to persuade
creditor nations, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that his
'emergency government' is merely temporary. He will be sending Mr Carlos
Bolona, his finance minister, and other members of his cabinet on a world
tour to plead for resumed aid flows, which are pivotal to the economic
stabilisation programme.
Many doubt whether Mr Fujimori will stick to his two-year timetable for the
restoration of democracy. 'Fujimori planned this coup almost from the day he
was elected,' says an intelligence officer close to the president. 'It will
be more like 18 years before he relinquishes power.'
The president owes little to the political class he has overthrown or to the
business establishment now trying to win his favour. He is an outsider, the
son of Japanese immigrants whose rallying call of 'austerity, probity and
sacrifice' struck a chord with millions of Peruvians desperate for change.
The coup was forged with a campaign to discredit judges and politicians. In
this the president needed little help; most Peruvians already believed
judges to be corrupt and Congress irrelevant. He then nurtured the armed
forces, promoting officers loyal to him and raising salaries.
'Fujimori then deliberately engineered a crisis with Congress,' says Mrs
Lourdes Flores, a deputy of the conservative Popular Christian party. 'He
refused to negotiate draft laws with the opposition and, lacking a majority
in parliament, took every amendment as a personal insult.'
The president accused Congress of busting the 1992 budget and sabotaging his
economic reforms. In fact the Conservatives and the left offered little
effective opposition to reforms.
'How can a president who issued more than 53,000 norms and decrees in 22
months accuse Congress of obstruction?' asks Mrs Flores.
The timing of the coup - a day before parliament was due to resume work
after its summer recess - appears to indicate that Mr Fujimori feared a more
hostile opposition led by Mr Alan Garca, Peru's former president and leader
of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (Apra), the largest party in
Congress. Mr Garca is now in hiding.
It is unclear how the new regime will aid the military's 12-year war against
Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) Maoist guerrillas. Emergency powers already
give the armed forces freedom of action over 40 per cent of Peru's
territory. The real constraint comes from a chronic shortage of resources -
a situation exacerbated by the suspension of US military aid.
The armed forces may take comfort from Mr Fujimori's pledges to reform the
judicial system. The government says that judges, intimidated by the Sendero
Luminoso, have freed thousands of guerrilla suspects.
But while Mr Fujimori says he will sack 'corrupt' judges, he has said
nothing about stopping Sendero vengeance.
He has also announced measures to crack down on Peru's drugs trade. But
while the armed forces remain his main ally, Mr Fujimori might be reluctant
to purge military officers known to be involved in the drugs business.
Like most authoritarian leaders, he boasts of leading a 'popular revolution'
that will build 'a new democracy'. As a technocrat, he admires the economic
transformation wrought by Gen Augusto Pinochet in Chile.
His success will depend on winning the war against Sendero and drugs, and on
the continued backing of creditor nations and multilateral agencies. On all
three counts Mr Fujimori stood a better chance had he chosen to reform
Peru's institutions within a democratic framework.
'Mr Fujimori's popularity may start to evaporate once Peruvians begin to
count the cost of international isolation,' says Mr Hernando de Soto, a
leading economist and former aide to the president.
MR James Baker, US secretary of state, yesterday warned President Alberto
Fujimori of Peru that the US would not accept the destruction of democracy
in his country, but stopped short of recommending economic sanctions, writes
George Graham in Washington.
'The US understands the difficulties that Peru has faced and is facing; both
the economic difficulties and the security difficulties. But having said
that, I think we have to recognise that you do not destroy democracy in
order to save it,' Mr Baker said.
He was speaking ahead of a meeting in Washington of the Organisation of
American States to discuss what action to take over Mr Fujimori's decision
last week to suspend Peru's constitution. The OAS was expected to hear both
Mr Augusto Blacker Miller, Peru's foreign minister representing the Fujimori
government, and vice-president Maximo San Roman, who has joined the
opposition to the president.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, yesterday denied he was
ready to endorse the presidential candidacy of Mr Bill Clinton, the
favourite for the Democratic party's presidential nomination.
Over the weekend Mr Brown repeated what he said after last Tuesday's New
York primary election - that he would offer his support to the nominee. This
was interpreted as an implicit recognition that he could not catch Mr
Clinton in the remaining primaries.
However, he is now attaching terms to that support, specifically acceptance
of strict limits on financial support - Mr Brown only takes sums of up to
Dollars 100 from individual contributors - and agreement to work for the
populist initiative limiting the terms of elected officials.
He added he did not think the governor of Arkansas would win the nomination.
'The latest polls show him slipping precipitously behind President Bush,' he
said. 'We're going to fight for a fair and open convention.'
Mr Clinton returned to the campaign trail after taking a rest to relieve an
overworked voice. He did so comforted by news that the executive board of
the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, had recommended endorsing his
candidacy.
Coming from a state with an anti-union tradition, Mr Clinton had not been
the first choice of labour, which initially preferred Senator Tom Harkin of
Iowa and latterly has been heavily courted by Mr Brown.
However, many individual unions, including the ladies' garment workers, the
biggest in New York, and the public service employees, have come out for
him.
Mr Clinton was also encouraged by reports from the latest Virginia caucuses,
which showed him winning more than half the state's delegates, compared to
about a third for an uncommitted slate and only 15 per cent for Mr Brown.
He also continued to pick up useful endorsements from, among others,
Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who ran for the nomination in
1988, and Governor Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, considered a possible
candidate this year. Both men are among those mentioned as possible
alternatives to Mr Clinton in the event of a brokered convention in New York
in July.

TURKEY WILL today seek to revive a five-year-old border security agreement
with Syria in the latest diplomatic effort to curb the rebel activity of the
Kurdish Workers party (PKK).
During a two-day visit to Damascus, Mr Ismet Sezgin, Turkey's interior
minister, is expected to press the Syrians to reduce their support for the
PKK, which is fighting for the independence of south-east Turkey using
training camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in Lebanon.
The move reflects a government desire to paint the PKK as an external threat
despite growing evidence that the rebels enjoy broad support inside Turkey.
It also underlines growing impatience with the Syrians over a number of
bilateral issues including disputes over the Euphrates river and Syrian
claims on Hatay, the border province ceded to Turkey in 1938 when Syria was
still under French mandate.
Mr Sezgin's visit is part of a broader diplomatic initiative to win regional
co-operation against the PKK following German and EC criticism of its
handling of recent unrest in the south when more than 100 demonstrators died
in clashes with security forces.
Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the Iraqi Kurds, gave an implicit undertaking
to Ankara last week to clear the border area with Iraq where the PKK has
exploited a power vacuum.
Turkey reportedly won Egyptian assistance in putting pressure on the Syrians
during a visit to Ankara last week by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak.
In Turkey's and Syria's last agreed on a shortlived border security
agreement of 1987, On that occasion Syria insisted on linking the border
security agreement with a dealon allocation of Euphrates water. Turkish
officials insist this time water will not be discussed. Instead Mr Sezgin
will present what officials say is documentary evidence of Syrian complicity
in PKK actions.

FT  14 APR 92 / Rafsanjani widens margin of victory in Iran elections

IRANIAN President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has widened his margin of
victory in Friday's parliamentary elections and looks set to dominate Iran's
incoming parliament.
Half of the votes in Tehran have so far been counted, with Mr Rafsanjani's
supporters taking 29 of the 30 leading positions.
The extent of the landslide is a surprise, despite vetting before the poll
which disqualified several hardline rivals of the president: not even
Hojatoleslam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, figurehead of the hardliners, could
guarantee himself a seat.
However, even outside parliament, the hardliners could still plague Mr
Rafsanjani. 'They can make life more difficult for the government,' said an
Iranian official. 'They have a lot of influence on the students.'
Hardliners could also still gain more seats in the 270-seat Majlis
(parliament). A second round of voting will be held for the more tightly
contested seats.
Supporters of Mr Rafsanjani are seen as moderates outside Iran. They have
forged closer ties with the west and seek to end Iran's economic and
political isolation. However they are far from sentimental reformers. A
diplomat in Tehran said: 'They are pragmatic. They know they need the west.
They need its money and they need its technology.'
Inside the country, the rival organisations appeared so similar that many
voters could not identify candidates from each side.
With more than 2,000 candidates standing, voters seemed to rely on
individual familiarity rather than political affiliation. Most of Tehran's
voters plumped for a very familiar face: Mr Syed Ali Akbar Hosseini, host of
a popular 'agony aunt' television show.
The pragmatists had orchestrated their campaign tightly, depending on the
frequent exposure of their candidates at religious services and political
meetings. They contracted the Post Office to deliver political pamphlets
with regular mail.
'They have been working at least for the past year,' said an Iranian
official.
By contrast, the hardliners mobilised late, holding public meetings only
during the week before the elections.
More important for the west, Mr Rafsanjani's Iran is emerging from its
isolation; the revolution is coming of age. There is a cautious optimism in
the air: ordinary Iranians express their opinion openly to strangers;
foreign journalists are allowed independence.
And while some Iranians still mouth anti-capitalist rhetoric against the
west, they happily fork out for the latest Sony or Panasonic from Tehran's
high-tech bazaar.
Mr Rafsanjani will use his new parliamentary muscle to expand his economic
reform, but his government will have little room for manoeuvre. It will be
under pressure to increase state salaries in line with rampant inflation
while keeping subsidies on basic foods.
Petrol rationing, imposed during Iran's eight-year war with Iraq, was lifted
in February 1991, but subsidies on chicken and eggs were only partially
removed later last year.
Mr Rafsanjani has placed great emphasis on cutting Iran's almost total
economic dependence on oil exports. Since he came to power in 1989 the
percentage of GDP earned from non-oil industries has increased to 8 per cent
from 2 per cent. Non-oil exports doubled in two years, reaching a record
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.45bn) in the year to March 1992.
But the price of reform has been high. Imports rose to Dollars 17bn last
year, only just short of an all-time high, and prices have soared.
Iranians are not happy with the government's record on the economy. In
protest, many in Tehran refused to vote. At the moment, they are not
seriously disaffected; they will give Mr Rafsanjani more time.
However after a year, if the economy has not grown and prices have not
dropped, the hardliners' fiery talk of independence and revolution may seem
much more attractive.

THE US has given Israel the go-ahead to continue developing the Arrow
missile, a costly ballistic missile interceptor mainly funded under the US
Strategic Defence Initiative.
The approval comes despite recent concerns in Washington over alleged
illicit transfer of US weapons technology by Israel to third countries.
Israel Aircraft Industries, a state-owned company making the Arrow, said it
had received an order to carry out the second phase of the missile's
development following Pentagon approval.
The US government is to fund 72 per cent of the Dollars 322m (Pounds 187m)
cost of the 45-month second phase, intended to bring the weapon close to
battlefield readiness. Israel will fund the remainder.
The Arrow is designed to succeed the Patriot missile, made by Raytheon of
the US and deployed against Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf war. The
first phase of its development, which has been delayed by technical hitches
during test launching, began in 1988 and has so far cost Dollars 158m, 85
per cent borne by the US.
IAI also announced plans to establish a public company later this year to
develop and manufacture its Amos communications satellite.

FT  14 APR 92 / Libya proposes to turn over alleged Lockerbie bombers

<TEXT>
In an 11th-hour bid to forestall sanctions, Libya has proposed turning the
two alleged Lockerbie bombers over to Malta, according to diplomats at the
United Nations, AP reports from New York. But the Security Council is
unlikely to approve the Libyan proposal, which was offered through the Arab
League, the diplomats said.
'The latest proposal is to turn them over to Malta, to postpone sanctions
and hold negotiations,' Venezuelan Ambassador Diego Arria said. 'But I don't
think it will fly,' he said. He described the Libyan offer 'as a dilatory
tactic to endlessly postpone sanctions.'
There was no word whether Malta would accept the proposal and take custody
of the two men. The US and Britain are demanding that the two suspects be
handed over for trial in the west, but do not object if intermediaries are
involved.
Mr Arria said that Libya also had asked him whether Venezuela might be
willing to take custody of the men. But the Caracas government had refused
to do this, he said.
Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Libya last night urged its Arab neighbours to
disregard the UN sanctions, which are due to take effect at a minute after
midnight New York time tomorrow. after Libya's refusal to hand over two men
accused of the 1988 bombing of a US airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, Tony
Walker reports.
Major Abdel-Salam Jalloud, Libya's second-in-command, bluntly told Arab
labour ministers in Tripoli, that 'the Arabs should not implement resolution
748'.
It was Libya's most pointed call to its fellow Arabs to ignore the UN
sanctions resolution, which calls for an air and arms embargo, and a
downgrading of Libyan representation abroad.
Libyan prepared for the sanctions deadline by declaring a day of 'mourning'
today, during which communications with the west were cut off, against a
background of continuing and apparently futile Arab diplomatic efforts to
defuse the crisis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS TIME ticks away to the imposition tomorrow of United Nations-imposed
sanctions against Libya, Arab states are wrestling with the knotty problem
of how they might react.
Egypt, the Gulf states and Jordan have indicated they will probably fall
reluctantly into line with the sanctions provisions, but it is not clear how
Libya's North Africa's neighbours or such countries as Syria will respond.
The Arab League, which has passed three resolutions in an effort to defuse
the crisis, has not outlined a collective stand in the event of sanctions,
and, given divisions within the league, it may prove difficult for it to do
so.
However, Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, the league's secretary-general did tell
reporters last month that in his view the Arabs should not impose sanctions.
This was perhaps surprising coming from Dr Meguid, a cautious
lawyer-turned-diplomat, who served as Egypt's UN representative for more
than a decade throughout the turbulent 1970s.
Arab League officials say no date has been set for a special foreign
ministers' session to consider a collective response; but Mr Adnan Omran, a
deputy secretary-general, indicated there were pressures for one to be held
soon, although he acknowledged it would not necessarily be easy to forge a
consensus.
Broad agreement was achieved in the three league resolutions aimed at
defusing the Libya crisis - these were acclaimed on December 5, January 16
and March 22 - but discussion of how in fact to respond to sanctions
themselves may prove divisive.
Pro-western states such as Egypt, which is heavily dependent on US aid, will
not wish to adopt a stance which runs counter to US interests, even at the
risk of being accused of being in Washington's thrall.
The Libyan situation would seem to be tailor-made for Iraq which will almost
certainly try to use the crisis to help it regain its voice in Arab
councils. Iraqi representatives are already arguing that 'first it was us,
now it is Libya, who next among the Arabs?'
Mr Omran was highly critical of the western approach to forcing Libya to
disgorge its nationals suspected of the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner, insisting that resort to the UN sanctions, including an air and
arms embargo, was hasty and ill-conceived.
'This kind of policy,' he said, 'is an encouragement to extremism. Mr Saddam
Hussein must be very happy with American policy now.'
Western officials acknowledge the Libyan crisis has become 'messy', in the
words of one. 'No matter how hard we try to explain the situation reactions
are emotional,' he said. 'People believe what they want to believe.'
Egypt, which has led the Arab diplomatic drive to prevent Libya's further
isolation, appeared early this week to have resigned itself to the sanctions
coming into force, and for this in turn to lead to complications regionally.
President Hosni Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on his way back to Cairo
from Tripoli on Sunday that Egypt had done all it could to defuse the
crisis. The implication was that nothing much more could be achieved unless
Libya was willing to consider seriously handing over its nationals.
Interestingly, an Egyptian official newspaper yesterday hinted at criticism
of Libya. Al Akhbar described the Libyan leadership as 'hesitant' and
'lacking decisiveness in confronting the problem'.
Egypt's official Middle East news agency, MENA, quoted Mr Mubarak as warning
that Libya must take the necessary steps to protect itself from the
repercussions of the crisis. This hardly amounted to an Egyptian pledge to
go all the way with Tripoli.

MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), said
yesterday that he and his wife, Mrs Winnie Mandela, had decided to separate
after 33 years.
The move follows renewed allegations that Mrs Mandela viciously beat four
young men in her Johannesburg home in 1988. One subsequently died. Mrs
Mandela's lawyers yesterday denied the allegations and Mr Mandela said they
had nothing to do with his decision to seek a separation.
Mr Mandela's voice broke with emotion when he read out a statement
announcing the separation. He praised his wife's role in opposing apartheid
and in resisting government harassment during the ANC leader's 27 years in
jail.
'My love for her remains undiminished,' he said. However, the couple decided
to separate because tensions had arisen 'owing to differences between
ourselves on a number of issues'. Mrs Mandela takes a more radical political
stand than her husband.

<TEXT>
INLAND Steel and a division of Bethlehem Steel yesterday filed unfair trade
complaints against producers in the UK, Brazil, France and Germany, charging
them with dumping heavily subsidised steel products on the US market.
The complaints, lodged with the Commerce Department and the US International
Trade Commission, assert that leaded and bismuth steel products from the
four countries have been substantially subsidised and sold in the US below
prices in home markets or below the cost of production.
The companies claim they have suffered material injury from this and say
duties to eliminate the effects would exceed 128 per cent for Brazil, 69 per
cent for France, 79 per cent for Germany and 53 per cent for the UK.
The US steel makers are also requesting that countervailing duties be
imposed to address subsidisation of 20 per cent for France, 25 per cent for
Germany and 10 per cent for the UK. Insufficient information about Brazil's
subsidies made an estimate of this duty impossible, they said.
The Commerce Department and ITC must determine whether the charges are
justified. If the complaints are deemed reasonable, they will be
investigated.
The move comes after the lapse at the end of March of voluntary restraint
agreements on steel imports and a failed attempt to reach a multilateral
steel accord.

<TEXT>
FRENCH farmers are confident that despite his faith in free markets, Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, will resist pressure for deep
cuts in farm subsidies to unblock the stalled Gatt world trade talks, Reuter
reports from Paris.
'Beregovoy is more sensitive to pressure from industrial and financial
circles than (former Premier Edith) Cresson, but there is no reason to fear
a shift in position on Gatt,' an official of FNSEA, the main French farmers'
union, said.
France, as the EC's biggest farm producer and exporter, holds the key to
farm reform. The reappointment of Mr Louis Mermaz as farm minister is seen
as a sign that Paris plans to continue to resist any new concessions in the
Gatt talks.
The April 22 meeting between US President George Bush and Mr Jacques Delors,
EC president, is seen as one of the last chances for a breakthrough in the
deadlocked talks.
French farmers see more need to worry about talks under way to reform the
EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which they fear could lead to
production quotas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE officials acknowledged yesterday that the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalising talks has run out of steam.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, told a meeting of the top-level
Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) that without shifts in position by the
major traders, the Round could not be concluded successfully.
After 'a promising start', country-by-country negotiations in Geneva on
improving market access for foreign goods and services were losing momentum,
he said.
Mr Germain Denis, chairman of the market access negotiations, said good
prospects existed for a substantial package of trade liberalisation
measures, with many countries indicating they would meet or go beyond the
one-third target cut in overall tariffs.
But a political breakthrough was needed in the main bilateral market access
negotiations (by implication, those between the US and the EC), to unblock
the talks on both agriculture and industrial goods.
In addition, several countries have refused to convert import curbs on
certain farm products into tariffs as required by the draft Uruguay Round
text on agriculture.
This point was amply illustrated yesterday when much of the meeting was
taken up with a heated debate over the EC's recent decision on banana
imports, which protects high-cost Caribbean and north African bananas at the
expense of Central American producers.
The EC decision means it will not replace banana import quotas with tariffs,
a move which could prop open the door for other countries to exempt from
tariffication products they consider especially sensitive, notably rice for
Japan and South Korea.
In services, Mr Dunkel singled out the widespread exemptions from the
non-discriminatory most-favoured-nation principle being sought by the US as
a major hurdle.
Mr Dunkel said he would hold consultations with negotiators after Easter, to
decide how to tackle what he hoped would be the last leg of the negotiating
process.
Another TNC meeting is likely towards the end of April, after what is seen
as a key meeting between President Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, EC president,
on April 22.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Red Army Faction (RAF), Germany's much-feared urban terrorist group,
claimed yesterday it was giving up violence in its 20-year-old war on the
west German establishment.
'We have decided to withdraw from the escalation. That means we will now
stop attacks on leading representatives of business and state,' the RAF said
in a letter delivered to the Bonn office of the French news agency, Agence
France-Presse.
The offer of peace came just over a year after an RAF sniper shot dead Mr
Detlev Rohwedder, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, through a
window at his home in Dusseldorf. In July 1990, Mr Hans Neusel, responsible
for security in the interior ministry, narrowly escaped a bomb attack. A
year earlier, Mr Alfred Herrhausen, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, was
killed by a car bomb on his way to work.
The letter, which officials said bore the hallmarks of earlier 'official'
communications, added that the RAF felt it necessary to think over where it
had gone wrong. Violence had weakened rather than strengthened its political
support.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, justice minister, said it was 'heartening and hopeful that
the RAF for the first time wants to turn away from violence'. The government
was ready for reconciliation within certain constraints.
It is not certain, however, that the authorities would be prepared to go as
far as freeing imprisoned members of the RAF, as demanded in the letter. The
note warned that violence would resume if the state 'does not allow us,
fighting for a humane society, to live'.
Security officials were guarded in their response, since there was no way of
knowing if the letter represented the views of all members of the
organisation.
The RAF, committed to an 'armed struggle against imperialism' and mobilising
the masses for revolution, is a shadowy extreme left-wing movement modelled
on Latin American urban guerrilla groups.
Rooted in the Baader-Meinhoff group, formed after the student revolts of the
late 1960s, its philosophies seem to have lost any appeal they might have
had to youth disenchanted with the capitalist system.
During the late 1980s, several members decided to leave the group and went
to the former East Germany, helped by the Stasi security police. They have
since been returned to the west German authorities.

Spain's 0.4 per cent rise in the consumer price index (CPI) for March was
better than expected and could pave the way for easier interest rates but
the government will be hard-pressed to meet its 5 per cent target for the
year, economists said, Reuters reports from Madrid.
The March rise gave a year-on-year rise of 6.9 per cent, up on February's
6.8 per cent. Many analysts had expected this rate to accelerate to 7 per
cent with a month's rise of 0.5 to 0.7 per cent.
The figure was additionally positive because it included the annual
adjustment for government-controlled rents.

FT  14 APR 92 / East German workforce slashed: Post-communist job market
devastated by economic realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT the end of 1989, when it was still widely rated to be among the world's
top 10 economies, the German Democratic Republic boasted a workforce of
almost 10m. Since unification with the west in October, 1990, that number
has shrunk to 6m and some 1.4m of those are officially unemployed. At least
1m more are on short-time, or labour in work creation schemes.
Unleashing market forces has worked to devastating effect on the basic
inefficiencies of the old command economy. And there the process has all but
stopped.
'So far massive transfers and support measures have failed to spark the
expected powerful, self-supporting, recovery process,' west Germany's five
leading economic institutes reported yesterday. In the first overall
independent view of conditions in the east, the institutes accept the
conventional view that the bottom has been reached - after a 14 per cent
fall in output in 1990 and 30 per cent last year.
But they also underline the weaknesses of the new foundations. The number of
new company registrations has fallen from 25,000 a month at the end of 1990
to around 20,000 now. Company failures, meanwhile, have risen from 6,000 to
10,000 a month. Net growth in the number of independent businesses slowed to
1.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Less than 60 per cent of
newly-registered companies are actually doing business, the institutes said.
The Treuhand privatisation agency is given credit for its successes so far.
Chopping up large combines into smaller units has resulted in a sixth of all
sales being made to management buy-out teams. outside Germany led to 74
companies being sold to foreigners in January and February, compared with
248 all last year.
However, the agency still has around 6,000 businesses to dispose of, and,
according to the report, the sale of up to 90 per cent of these is blocked
by uncertainty over their ownership. While attempts are being made to speed
up processing claims from people dispossessed by the Nazis and, later, the
communists, the report stresses that shortages of expert manpower are still
hampering progress. So far, only 5 per cent of the 2m claims put in for
companies, land and buildings have been cleared.
Meanwhile, the death toll mounts. By the end of last year, the Treuhand had
closed 983 hopeless-case businesses; 1,000 will go this year.
Builders, aggregate- and cement-makers, suppliers of reinforcing steel and
construction equipment, have all benefited from the rebuilding boom which
will be largely responsible for this year's expected 10.5 per cent increase
in east German economic output. But the institutes report either no
improvement or deterioration in other once-vital industries such as iron
production, foundries, precision engineering and textiles. 'Overall, the
manufacturing sector. . . . still faces serious adaptation problems,' they
say.
But if the east faces 'adaptation' difficulties, so too does the west. As
the institutes make clear, pay and public spending in the old west Germany
cannot continue to rise without stark consequences: first for recovery in
the east and ultimately for the country as a whole.
Of the DM155bn (Pounds 54.30bn) in financial transfers from the west's
public purse this year, just DM2.5bn will come directly from the coffers of
the individual states. According to the institutes, federal spending should
be frozen in real terms, local authorities over-stepping the mark must be
reined in with 'fines'.
Tax cuts and other fiscal concessions should by paid for by savings
elsewhere. People in the west must expect less real pay.
Germany's OTV public service workers union is to call a strike ballot after
rejecting a new government pay offer of 4.8 per cent, Reuter reports from
Stuttgart. The vote is expected next week. If the strike goes ahead, it will
be the first by German public service workers for 18 years.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission is today expected to approve an Ecu850m (Pounds
609m) action plan to encourage European wide-screen television services, the
first step towards full high-definition television (HDTV).
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the telecommunications commissioner, and Mr Jean
Dondelinger, responsible for audiovisual affairs, aim to persuade
commissioners that broadcasters, satellite operators and manufacturers need
financial incentives if they are to back wide-screen television.
Final approval of the five-year financial package will be up to member
states. Telecommunications ministers have already decided on a liberal
strategy to meet the challenge of US and Japanese competition.
Last year they agreed on a compulsory EC transmission standard for new
satellite TV services - tied to a wide-screen format - but safeguarded
existing services broadcast in other standards.
About a quarter of the Ecu850m incentive money would be earmarked for
programme-makers, and the rest would help develop the technology.
Officials said the cash would not involve direct manufacturing subsidies,
and would be weighted towards the beginning of the five-year period.
The Commission and industry representatives are still negotiating a parallel
industrial strategy, based on a legally-binding memorandum of understanding.

FT  14 APR 92 / Earthquake shuts German nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REACTOR block in the Biblis nuclear power station in the state of Hesse
was closed 'as a security precaution' yesterday after an earthquake before
dawn shook a huge area around the Dutch-German border, writes Christopher
Parkes.
Widespread damage and panic was reported after the 15-second shock.
Unusually powerful for western Europe, it measured 5.5 on the Richter scale.
Although the Biblis reactor was believed not to be severely damaged, many
houses in the area around the epicentre, Roermond in The Netherlands, were
expected to be declared unsafe and demolished.
Reports of injuries, mainly caused by falling masonry and roof tiles to
people running out into the streets, suggested around 50 people had been
hurt. One elderly woman in Bonn was reported to have died of a heart attack.

FT  14 APR 92 / Insurers may see heavy bomb claims
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK INSURERS, already facing the worst losses in their history, could have
claims of Pounds 1bn as a result of Friday's bomb damage to the City.
Britain's leading five composite insurers, which reported pre-tax losses of
more than Pounds 1.2bn in 1991 and Pounds 650m in 1990, will be among those
hit. The loss, however, is widely spread in the London insurance market.
Two hundred buildings were affected, half of which sustained structural
damage. Damage and associated losses amount to up to Pounds 300m and glass
replacement will take at least a month.
Claims for business interruption and loss of profits, for which most
companies insure, could swell the total.
Repair work began as the City struggled to restore some normality amid the
wreckage. New windows at the 23-storey Commercial Union building, the
tallest in the City when it was built in 1969, will cost Pounds 1.5m and
take at least 15 weeks to instal.
Pilkington, the glass manufacturer, was working round the clock transporting
glass from St Helens.
The Corporation of London said no buildings would need to be demolished.
However, 10 buildings in St Mary Axe, including the Baltic Exchange, the
Chamber of Shipping and the Royal Bank of Scotland, were classed as severely
damaged.
The Baltic Exchange and CU, which bore the brunt of the blast in which three
people died, were both returning to normal trading.
The CU was to have held its annual and extraordinary general meetings in the
Baltic Exchange today. The meetings will now take place this afternoon at
The Brewery, Chiswell Street.
The 650 staff who work in the CU tower have been relocated, some to other
London offices and about 400, including senior management, to four CU
buildings in Croydon.
The Baltic Exchange, the headquarters of which was wrecked by the bomb,
pledged to restart trading tomorrow in the Lloyd's of London building. It
intends to resotre its ornate Edwardian building - which Mr Peter Tudball,
the chairman, described as 'one of the most beautiful in the City of
London'.
Staff at James Capel, the securities house, worked through the weekend to
construct a replacement dealing room from scratch.
A soldier leaving an Army careers office in Derby was shot and critically
wounded by three young men yesterday. Police were keeping an open mind about
a terrorist connection.

FT  14 APR 92 / Ever Ready sold by Hanson for Pounds 123m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has sold Ever Ready, the UK dry cell
battery manufacturer, for Pounds 132m to Ralston Purina, the diversified
US-based food group.
The move was described yesterday by one of Hanson's financial advisers as a
'tidying-up exercise' before making a larger acquisition.
Ralston's purchase of Ever Ready, a brand it already owns in most countries
outside the UK, confirms it as the world's largest manufacturer of dry cell
batteries, adding annual sales of about Dollars 154.1m (Pounds 89.5m) to the
Dollars 1.6bn which its existing battery division reported for the year to
September 30.
The financial adviser also said the exercise was 'aimed at providing the
group with more cash to enable it to pounce on the next big target. I think
that Hanson will now look to sell its 2.8 per cent shareholding in ICI
before making its expected big acquisition'.
There has been speculation that Hanson would sell its ICI holding since Lord
Hanson told shareholders in February that the group had no plans for bidding
for the chemicals group. Hanson bought its shares for an average price of
1,194p, they closed yesterday at 1,315p.
In the long-running debate over Hanson's ability to run companies, the
group's actions at Ever Ready have given ammunition to supporters and
critics alike.
When Hanson bought Berec (which included Ever Ready) in 1981 its profits had
declined to a third of their 1970s peak, partly because it had missed the
shift to long-life alkaline batteries.
Hanson ruthlessly cut costs and sold assets, including most of the European
operations to Duracell, its US competitor. The disposals realised half the
purchase price of Pounds 95m. Operating profits rebounded to a peak of
Pounds 23.4m in 1989 but fell back to Pounds 18.5m in 1991 on sales of
Pounds 87.1m.
But Hanson came to realise in the late 1980s that Ever Ready could flourish
only as a multinational business. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the
group had examined buying Duracell from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall
Street firm which had taken it private in a 1988 leveraged buy-out.
Ralston had bought Eveready, the US-based bearer of the famous brand name,
from Union Carbide for Dollars 1.4bn. Hanson has since tried to buy it from
Ralston but failed. 'We originally looked at buying Duracell from KKR and
then looked at acquiring Ralston's battery business. We believe selling Ever
Ready in the UK meets the same objectives.'
Ralston Purina, whose marketshare in the UK was previously around 3 per
cent, claims that its purchase 'fills a major gap' in its geographical
coverage. Its market share in the Dollars 3bn US market is roughly
equivalent to that of Duracell but Ralston has steadily enhanced its
European presence.
Ralston claims that, after the Hanson deal, it leads the European market
overall.

FT  14 APR 92 / Party row erupts as Kinnock quits: MPs voice opposition to
early leadership contest - 'Tory press' blamed for defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACRIMONIOUS row broke out within the Labour party yesterday over plans
for a speedy change of leader after Mr Neil Kinnock stepped down following
last week's election defeat.
Several MPs, including Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment spokesman and
a likely contender, declared their strong opposition to an early contest
which could see Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor and odds-on favourite,
elected to succeed Mr Kinnock.
In a sombre statement in his Commons offices, Mr Kinnock blamed what he
called the 'Tory press' for his defeat.
'I make and I seek no excuses, and I express no bitterness when I say that
the Conservative-supporting press has enabled the Tory party to win yet
again when the Conservative party could not have secured victory for itself
on the basis of its record, its programme or its character.'
He told Labour supporters to ignore media coverage of the internal election
which the party must hold to replace him.
'I have only one piece of advice for the Labour movement at every level  -
do not feed and do not believe the press and broadcasting media in their
reporting of these events,' he said.
Tributes to his leadership flowed in from several senior party figures and
included a private message from the prime minister. Mr Kinnock made clear
that he and Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, would ask a special
meeting of the National Executive Committee today to call the elections for
late June.
Arguing that the date served the 'best interests' of the party, he said the
timetable would allow the parliamentary party to elect a new shadow cabinet
before the summer recess. With the Conservatives holding a small majority
and continuing deep economic difficulties 'it would not be right for the
Labour party to wait six months until October', he said.
Although most MPs on the NEC oppose an early contest, Mr Kinnock's timetable
is likely to be agreed, but the vote will be close. Some unions are
understood to be worried, however, at being seen to 'steamroller' through an
early contest when their dominant role in the process is the subject of
controversy.
The row was fuelled yesterday by a vituperative letter to The Guardian from
Mr Colin Byrne, Labour's chief press officer until last autumn.
Claiming that a hurried contest will cut short a full debate on how to
respond to Labour's election defeat, he wrote that Labour was 'sleepwalking
towards a leadership fix in the grubby old style with ageing trade union
barons, nods and winks about easing up on the accelerator pedal of reform
and smokefilled rooms being the main features'.
Mr Byrne also accused Mr Smith of failing to support Mr Kinnock adequately
in his party reforms. His intervention was interpreted by party insiders as
an effort to open the contest to other potential leadership candidates, not
least Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary.
But union leaders differed. Mr Bill Jordan of the engineers' countered that
the need for stability within the party meant the election should be
completed 'as soon as possible'.
The ferocity of the row provoked Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaigns
co-ordinator, to intervene with a call for self-discipline in the contest.
Supporters would not forgive MPs who 'jeopardised' Mr Kinnock's
achievements, he said.

FT  14 APR 92 / Sterling stronger as shares add to gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING moved off the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism for
the first time in five months yesterday.
The pound, buoyed by the re-election of the Conservative party, leapfrogged
the Danish krone to become the second weakest currency in the European
Monetary System.
Its better performance was due mainly to its own strength, but analysts said
the krone had weakened over fears that the country would vote against
European Monetary Union in a referendum to be held in early June.
Sterling and the dollar also strengthened against the D-Mark which came
under selling pressure. The pound closed at DM2.9150 compared with an
opening DM2.8988, putting it six pfennigs above its pre-election level and
within the 2.25 per cent fluctuation margin of the ERM.
Share prices advanced, lifting the FT-SE 100 index 18.4 to 2,591.0 for a
gain of more than 6 per cent since the election.
There was no sign of an early cut in interest rates.

FT  14 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL worries in Russia curtailed an early advance in stock index
futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FTSE started the session weak at 2609. But buyers
soon showed their hand when June quickly moved forward reaching 2,645 by
9.30 am. This proved to be the high point of the session; thereafter "a
badly handled order" sent June tumbling.
The negative mid-morning news out of Russia served to bring out more
sellers. The afternoon was said to have been dull, characterised by two-way
trading, and with a firm Wall Street said to have had no influence on
business.
June closed at 2629, up 27 on the previous session and around 6 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover was a healthy
8330 contracts.
Business in the traded options market was buoyant, with turnover reaching
49,892 lots. The FT-SE option was particularly active. It traded 15,472
contracts. Hanson was the busiest stock option and had a day's total of
4,349 lots. This was followed by the Euro FT-SE option at 2402. Some 2,335
lots were dealt in Midland Bank, and this was followed by National Power, in
which 2,014 changed hands.

FT  14 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities maintain upward momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEELING of anti-climax pervaded London's equity market yesterday, but
there was still sufficient buying interest from local and overseas investors
to produce another session of good gains across the board.
Worries about political developments in Russia, plus a fresh slide in the
Tokyo market overnight combined to take the edge off the market, as did the
sight of wreckage resulting from the terrorist bomb in the City on Friday
evening.
Dealers were wary of the market at the outset, concerned about Tokyo's
500-points plus decline, and the possibility that the huge jump in share
prices last Friday after the Tory election victory could attract a bout of
profit-taking.
Marketmakers opened the leaders around Friday's closing levels in an effort
to encourage more of the heavy two-way business that boosted turnover last
week. The move proved successful, with buyers moving in quickly and boosting
the FT-SE 100-share index to the day's best level of 2,606.5, or 33.9
higher, within an hour or so of the start of business.
Thereafter, the market traded in a narrow range, with intermittent bouts of
profit-taking followed by flurries of keen buying interest.
The Footsie future provided a measure of support for cash, holding a good
premium to the underlying market throughout the trading session.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 share index was 18.4 higher at 2,591.0. Turnover
of 629.3m shares, although sharply higher than average, fell well short of
Friday's 1,345.4m, itself way ahead of any single trading session for many
months. Statistics published by the Stock Exchange show that the value of
customer business transacted on Friday hit a massive Pounds 2.59bn, having
failed to reach Pounds 1bn on any of the previous four trading session last
week.
Damage wrought by Friday's bomb in the City was the latest disaster to
affect composite insurers although specialists said the impact would be
cushioned by reinsurance.
Midland Bank spurted ahead on rumours that merger terms in the region of
420p a share from Hongkong &amp; Shanghai would be announced mid-week. Allied
Breweries was one of the Footsie's biggest casualties after Sir Gordon
Borrie, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, criticised long-term
supply agreements between national brewers and pub retailing companies.
Shares in the construction and building materials sectors were supported
ahead of a busy week of company news, including figures from industry
leaders such as Taylor Woodrow, RMC and Tarmac.
Strategists continue to adopt a positive stance on the UK market in the wake
of the Tories' general election victory.
The Global Strategy team at US investment bank Morgan Stanley has increased
the UK equities weighting of its European Model Portfolio from 8.5 per cent
to 14 per cent at the expense of its German portfolio which now comprises 26
per cent, down from 31.5 per cent. 'The voters' verdict has made the UK one
of the best disinflationary stories in Europe; it bolsters the long term
prospects for equities and bonds,' said Morgan Stanley.

FT  14 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: European markets vault on poll results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK is a long time in politics and last week was no exception, with
elections in Italy, Germany and the UK each having an impact on their
respective markets. But Japan remained a dark shadow in the corner ready to
spring yet another surprise.
Having slipped to a five-year low at the beginning of the week, Tokyo then
fell even further before picking up 7.6 per cent on Friday. The effect on
the FT Actuaries World Index, however, was partly offset by a stronger Wall
Street, which was given a boost by a cut in the federal funds rate, and firm
European bourses.
One of the exceptions to the positive sentiment in Europe was Austria. The
resurgence of conflict in Yugoslavia and some bad corporate results
depressed investors.
OMV, the oil group, came under pressure on concerns over its exposure to
Libya, which faces the imposition of UN sanctions. Another market leader,
Universale, the construction group, also fell back after reporting losses in
its Venezuelan division.
Ireland was strong last week, although most of the gains came after the UK
election results on Friday. However, a strike at the country's four main
clearing banks, which appeared to be moving in favour of the employers, and
better-than-expected results from Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal and
ceramics group, also helped.
Mexico continued the previous week's decline as investors remained nervous
following the postponment of talks on the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Money was also being moved from equities into Treasury bonds
after the raising of interest rates.
The UK market responded to the Conservative party's return to government
with a rally on Friday that was the biggest rise in a single day since the
market crash of October 1987. For the political pollsters, however, it was
not a day for celebration - they had all got their forecasts wrong.

SHARE prices erased their initial gains as arbitrage-related selling
emerged, and the Nikkei average, which had rallied on bargain-hunting last
Friday, closed down 3.4 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 614.01 to 17,236.65. The index firmed in the
morning, hitting the day's high of 17,938.38 on buying by dealers and
investment trusts, heartened by last Friday's 7.6 per cent jump. However,
small-lot arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking depressed the average to the
day's low of 17,153.25 in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 280m shares from 380m. Declines narrowly led advances by 486
to 484 with 154 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks declined 12.95 to 1,269.61. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
declined 8.6 to 1018.97.
Traders said that last Friday's jump in the Nikkei was prompted by rumours
that the ministry of finance had advised life insurers and trust banks to
restrict lending of shares for short-selling purposes. Investors, who had
sold bank shares short, rushed to buy back on fears of these lending
restrictions.
Financials, which were sought in early trading, closed mixed. Industrial
Bank of Japan rose Y50 to Y1,610, while Sumitomo Bank lost Y50 to Y1,290. Mr
David Atkinson, financial analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said since
the average price-to-book ratios of the 11 Japanese commercial banks were
currently at 177 per cent against the 1974-83 average of 175 per cent,
Japanese bank shares were fairly valued. 'They are are now internationally
comparable,' he added.
Construction stocks fell across the board as dealers, who were seen
bargain-hunting earlier in the day, took their profits in the afternoon.
Shimizu lost Y54 to Y996 and Nishimatsu Construction fell Y50 to Y1,010.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, fell by its daily limit of Y1,000 to
Y8,950. Reports that the company has been ordered by a US federal district
court to pay over Dollars 30m in damages for its alleged patent infringement
on a colour display technology, discouraged investors.
High-technology issues, higher last week, fell on profit-taking. NEC lost
Y16 to Y984 and Sony fell Y150 to Y4,080. Despite the overall market
weakness, most industrial blue chips have remained above the mid-March lows,
and analysts believe the share prices of leading manufacturing companies are
bottoming out.
Some speculative stocks were sought by short-term players, and Nippon Carbon
rose Y13 to Y551.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 144.41 to 19,105.36 in volume of 10.4m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO'S renewed decline wiped out any early gains in the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG finished lower on a lack of buying interest. The Hang Seng index
closed down 31.97 at 4,889.14 after touching a day's high of 4,941.11 in the
morning. Turnover fell to HKDollars 1.5bn from HKDollars 2.8bn. Most
actively traded was HSBC Holdings which finished 25 cents higher at
HKDollars 39.50.
SEOUL ended slightly higher on rumours that the government and Hyundai Group
were looking for some kind of compromise. The composite index rose 2.08 to
578.19 in turnover of Won200.5bn after Saturday's half-day Won164.8bn.
AUSTRALIA was unable to hold on to early gains and headed downwards as soon
as Tokyo resumed its decline. The All-Ordinaries index closed 12 lower at
1570.1, above the day's low of 1,567, in turnover of ADollars 212.2m.
Government indications of an interest rate cut after the release of the
March quarter consumer price data later this month failed to support the
equity market, although credit markets rallied on the news.
SINGAPORE closed mostly lower in thin trading. The Straits Times Industrial
index closed 7.06 lower at 1,373.86 in volume of 26.4m shares, down from
38.6m.
Interest centred on shares involved in a takeover bid for Malayan Credit.
Cycle and Carriage and Hotel Properties, which are jointly trying to acquire
Malayan Credit, rose 5 and 7 cents each to SDollars 5.75 and SDollars 1.81
respectively. Malayan Credit rose 8 cents to SDollars 2.17, still below
SDollars 2.25 per share offered by Cycle and Carriage and Hotel Properties.
TAIWAN extended its early declines to finish lower on weak financials. The
weighted index finished 82.18 or 1.8 per cent lower at 4,405.44 as turnover
rose to TDollars 18.96bn from TDollars 13.2bn.
KUALA LUMPUR closed lower on a lack of follow-through support. The composite
index fell 3.80 to 567.51, after an early high of 573.94.
NEW ZEALAND failed to build on early gains, closing only slightly up. The
NZSE 40 index closed at 1,392.29, up 5.03, in low turnover of NZDollars 12m.
MANILA ended marginally higher in listless trading, due to a severe power
shortage in the city. The composite index crept up 1.26 to 1,136.09.
BOMBAY fell ahead of a local holiday. The BSE Index fell 143.41 or 3.3 per
cent to 4,163.02.

FT  14 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Russian cabinet resignation
unsettles bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that the Russian government had offered its resignation to President
Boris Yeltsin unsettled bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT began the session quietly, unperturbed by the overnight fall in
Tokyo. The only element to excite dealers in early trading was press
speculation that Daimler-Benz planned to increase its 1991 dividend. The
group declined to comment, saying that a decision would be made later this
month. The DAX index closed down 8.33 at 1,727.74 while the FAZ index,
calculated at midsession, rose 0.16 to 706.83. Turnover fell to DM4.8bn from
DM6.2bn.
Analysts said that Daimler was likely to increase its dividend, in the
region of DM1 to DM13, but that this would be coupled with a rights issue.
Daimler climbed to an intraday high of DM785.50 before the news from Russia
sent the market broadly lower. Its shares closed just DM1.20 higher at
DM779.20.
Other leading stocks affected by the Russian developments included Deutsche
Bank which has one of the biggest exposures to debt from the former Soviet
Union. It closed down DM6.50 at DM709. Siemens was DM4.2 lower at DM679.60,
Schering declined DM8.20 to DM800 and Volkswagen was off DM5.3 at DM369.
PARIS fell back, the CAC-40 index losing 10.79 to 1,963.27 in light turnover
of FFr1.62bn.
Euro Disney fell FFr1 to FFr139.90 in active trading of 775,550 shares after
the opening of the theme park was hindered by a rail strike. A block of
100,000 shares was put through the market but the identity of the parties
involved was hidden by a recent change in the trading system.
Alcatel was also active, falling FFr6 to FFr619 on profit-taking after last
week's gains. There were concerns that Alcatel's earnings would not grow as
strongly in 1992 compared with 1991. After the close, Alcatel said it
planned to sell 2m existing shares via American Depositary Shares in the US.
LVMH dropped FFr116 to FFr4,373 on reports that the company had confirmed in
a letter to shareholders that sales of its luxury items in Japan were
slowing down.
STOCKHOLM closed lower in thin trading. The Affarsvarlden general index fell
5.2 to 970.4 as turnover declined to SKr339m from SKr568m.
Shares in Gota soared after its majority owner Trygg-Hansa unveiled a full
bid for the banking group through a share swap. Gota A jumped SKr6 to SKr23
but Trygg-Hansa B free fell SKr11 to SKr79 as investors worried about the
financial implications of Trygg-Hansa's involvement in Gota.
The construction and real estate index jumped 3.3 per cent on the weekend
news that the government plans to scrap a tax on commercial real estate.
MILAN closed little changed in dull trading. The Comit index eased 0.37 to
500.79 in turnover estimated at less than Friday's L89bn. Most monthly call
options, which expired yesterday, were not taken up.
Smaller stocks were active. Gemina, whose RCS Editore publishing unit
reported a lower-than-expected L50bn in 1991 net profit, lost L10 to L1,165
while the engineering group Focchi rose L30 to L12,920 on news of a 50 per
cent rise in net profit to L21.1bn.
ZURICH fell in late trading. The SMI index closed down 7.4 at 1,840.6.
The chemical sector was active: Roche certificates declined SFr30 to
SFr3,110, while Ciba-Geigy, which reported a 17 per cent increase in first
quarter group sales, saw its bearers lose SFr30 to SFr3,430 and certificates
fall SFr10 to SFr3,450.
Banks were generally stronger: CS Holding bearers gained SFr45 to SFr1,990
and Union Bank added SFr100 to SFr3,890.
AMSTERDAM was barely changed in the absence of corporate news. The CBS
Tendency index closed up 0.2 at 124.9 in turnover of Fl 426.6m.
An earthquake yesterday, which caused some devastation in northern Europe,
had its epicentre near DSM's main chemical plant. However, the group
reported that there was no damage to the facility and the shares rose 10
cents to Fl 107.60.
VNU, which said sales in 1992 so far showed little improvement from the
previous year, slipped 80 cents to Fl 81.10. After the market closed it said
that it was planning an expansion programme.
Other publishers were strong: Elsevier gained 70 cents to Fl 114.20 and
Wolters Kluwer was up 80 cents at Fl 71.70.
Unilever was active with analysts noting a switch out of its UK shares into
the Dutch paper. It closed Fl 2 ahead at Fl 184.20.
MADRID fell back after its strong performance last Friday. The general index
fell 2.17 to 247.67 in low turnover of some Pta7bn. March inflation figures,
in line with expectations, had little effect on sentiment. Union Fenosa was
actively traded, falling Pta11 to Pta557, after a negative analysts meeting
last week.
BRUSSELS closed flat in quiet trading. The Bel-20 index closed up 0.14 to
1,178.91 in low turnover of BFr550m.
ISTANBUL rose on selective buying. The index rose 41.86 to 4,027.64.

FT  14 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound forges ahead vs D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING dealt a double blow to the remaining UK bears yesterday as it
pulled itself off the floor of the exchange rate mechanism and rose to a
five-month high against the D-Mark, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The UK currency ended the day in London at DM2.9150, three pfennigs higher
than Friday's close. Traders said the strong performance was due both to
post-election euphoria, and the problems assailing the D-Mark. Most dealers
expected the pound to start testing DM2.95 in the short-term.
Sterling's inherent strength was likely to continue, according to Dr Mark
Austin, economist with HongKong Bank. 'Compared with the rest of Europe
there is the combination of political stability and an economy which looks
as if it might rebound quite sharply in the short-term,' he said.
This outlook would encourage the fund managers who, until now, had
deliberately kept themselves light of sterling due to political uncertainty
since the begining of the year. Within the European Monetary System,
sterling traded places with the Danish Kroner to finish the day at 22 per
cent of its permitted swing below the central rate.
This was the first time the pound had left the floor of the grid since early
November, and prompted speculation of an early interest rate cut.
However, most traders suspected that since the political impetus of a rate
cut had disappeared, a reduction was not likely within the next couple of
months. 'The government will want to save the potential stimulus until it
sees if the post-election boom fades away,' said Dr Austin.
The D-Mark took severe blows from both the pound's strength and an overnight
report from a German think tank that growth would be much slower than
expected.
Finally, news that the Russian government had offered to resign in a bid to
force the Supreme Legislature to change tack on reform was more than D-Mark
investors could stand.
A flurry of D-Mark selling gave a fillip to most European currencies,
including the Ecu which came close to its theoretical level for the first
time, said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank.
The peseta was let off the leash by sterling's sharp rise within the EMS. It
also took heart from Spanish finance minister Mr Carlos Solchaga's statement
that an interest rate cut was not imminent. The peseta rose from 62.88/95
per D-Mark to 62.61/63.
The dollar also took a boost from the weaker D-Mark, although some of the
shine is likely to disappear tomorrow when retail sales figures are
published. These are expected to be 0.4 per cent weaker in March, while
industrial production is likely to be flat.
The US currency rose from DM1.6360 on Friday to DM1.6545 at the close last
night in in London.

FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amax plans aluminium smelter in
Iceland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMAX, THIRD-LARGEST of the US aluminium producers, is determined to build a
Dollars 1bn, 210,000-tonnes-a-year smelter in Iceland, said Mr Alan Born,
chairman.
He said Amax would need the metal for its fabricating operations in Europe.
At present the US group swaps primary aluminium with European producers who
need metal in the States so that Amax can avoid paying the 6 per cent tariff
levied by the European Community.
Mr Born said it was clear that the opportunity for metal swaps would become
more limited as demand for aluminium grew in Europe but production capacity
remained static.
Aluminium from the so-called Atlantal smelter would enter the EC free of
tariff under present arrangements with Iceland.
The future of the Atlantal project has been in some doubt since last
November when it was shelved because of low aluminium prices and because
finance was not available on acceptable terms.
However, Mr Born told the Association of Mining Analysts in London: 'The
question is not if we will build the smelter but when we will build it.' He
suggested construction would start between 1995 and 1997, depending on
market conditions.
Amax has a 40 per cent stake in the Atlantal consortium with Hoogovens
Aluminium of the Netherlands and Granges, part of Sweden's Electrolux group,
each owning 30 per cent.
Mr Born suggested conditions in the aluminium market would improve gradually
but that there would be little further improvement in prices until London
Metal Exchange stocks were substantially reduced and 'we have hard evidence
that Russian metal exports are decreasing'.
Unless the aluminium price increased by another 10 cents a lb fairly soon,
more European capacity would have to close, he said.
Mr Born said consumption of aluminium by the automotive industry was
increasing and conservative estimates suggested this would boost demand by
1m tonnes annual by the year 2,000. That would require five new smelters.
Amax based its estimates on an assumption that the use of aluminium in the
average north American car would increase from 160 lb to 240 lb.

FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble on pact
disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES tumbled in both London and New York yesterday as the markets
registered their disappointment at last week's International Coffee
Organisation meeting.
Lengthy squabbling over the make-up of the ICO negotiating group led only to
an announcement that the council would meet again on June 22 to start
discussions on a new international coffee agreement with economic clauses.
As one weary delegate said on Friday evening: 'If it's taken us this long to
agree on something as insignificant as this, how on earth are we going to
agree on export quotas'.
Much of the argument was over form, one delegate said yesterday. 'There were
no major breakthroughs. The awkward and sensitive issues have still to be
addressed.'
The July robusta contract on the London Futures and Options Exchange closed
yesterday at Dollars 828 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 36. In late trading in
New York the July arabica contract was more than 3 cents down at 68.10 cents
a lb.
Observers pointed to remarks by Mr Arnoldo Lopez, chairman of the ICO
Council, which effectively pushed the timetable for any economic measures to
support the coffee markets back to September next year.
Many people in the market, particularly in New York, were convinced that
last month's decision by Brazil, the world's biggest coffee exporter, to
back a new coffee agreement would lead to something more concrete emerging
from last week's meeting.
But Mr Lawrence Eagles, analysts with GNI, the London futures brokers, said
yesterday that the markets now realised there was 'a lot of time and a lot
of coffee to be sold before the ICO can even contemplate approving a quota
system'.
This was not necessarily bad for the prospects of an agreement, however.
'There is nothing like economic pain to forge a new agreement,' he said.
The abandonment of export quotas in July 1989 is thought to have cost Latin
American coffee producers about Dollars 6bn in lost revenues.

ZINC and ALUMINIUM prices were unable to hang on to early gains on the LME.
Zinc ran into profit taking and resistance when the three-month price neared
Dollars 1,300 a tonne. The early gains in aluminium followed news that
Russia's government had offered to resign, prompting short covering, with
traders concerned over possible disruptions to metal shipments. However,
there was no follow-through buying. A rise of up to 4,000 tonnes is expected
today in LME warehouse stocks. GOLD also lost early gains made on the London
bullion market on the Russian news. But US selling had undermined support in
the Dollars 342 a troy ounce area, dealers said. The metal is expected to
hold roughly between Dollars 338 and Dollars 343 ahead of the Easter
holiday. On Comex gold futures were weaker at midsession after Chemical Bank
lowered its prime rate. London COCOA edged ahead after news that the UK
cocoa grind was 21.1 per cent up in the first quarter at 39,831 tonnes. Last
week analysts were forecasting a gain of 8 per cent. 'It's always good to
see a higher figure, but when you see the amount of cocoa which has still to
be sold by origin countries, it's a bearish market,' one trader said.

FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian rubber output
forecast to fall by 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY OFFICIALS expect Indonesian rubber output to fall by about 25 per
cent in the first six months of 1992 as a result of low prices and natural
disasters that have forced many producers out of business, reports Reuter
from Jakarta.
'Unfair pricing in the world market, and tight money and natural causes at
home made producers think the business is no longer lucrative. Lower output
is inevitable,' said Mr OK Cornel, chairman of Gapkindo, the Indonesian
Rubber Association.
Of about 90 processing plants in the country, 20 are no longer active. The
rest have reduced their working hours.
Indonesia, the world's second largest natural rubber producer, produced
1.26m tonnes last year.
Mr Cornel said first-half output by smallholders, who account for 80 per
cent of production, would fall as much as 25 per cent. That of state
plantations would probably drop no more than 10 per cent, however, because
they had better facilities.
Haze from forest fires in the past few months had hampered photosynthesis
which in turn reduced rubber production, he said.
Output has also been hit in some areas by drought which lowered the level of
rivers which smallholders use for soaking and transport.
Another Gapkindo official said many growers had given up land to developers
for real estate and golf courses.
'There's nothing that can stop them but better prices, otherwise forget it.
They need more cash to survive,' he said.
Many processing plants are producing at only half capacity. Indonesia's
two-year-old tight money policy has raised processing costs by up to 35 per
cent and the recent rise in fuel prices added another 15 per cent.
'It is really a burden. Many more processors will cut production or shut
down. Results in the second half are likely to be worse,' the Gapkindo
official said.
Traders said prices for Standard Indonesian Rubber 20, the country's main
export grade, had risen by 6 to 7 cents to 84 cents a kilogram because of
shortages in the past few weeks.

FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian aluminium production
outstrips demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN aluminium industry closed the 1991-92 season last month with
unsold stocks of more than 50,000 tonnes; and the total would have been
twice as high had the industry not exported more than 50,000 tonnes at a
loss. According to Mr AK Agarwala, president of Hindalco Industries, India's
largest private sector producer of aluminium, the unsold stocks are largely
attributable to reduced demand from the cable and conductor manufacturers.
The electrical sector accounts for nearly 45 per cent of the Indian
aluminium consumption.
Demand for the metal from the other major sectors - transport, construction,
packaging and domestic appliances - was sluggish because of the general
recession in the economy. Domestic offtake of about 425,000 tonnes in
1991-92 fell short of the expected level by about 45,000 tonnes.
Indian aluminium consumption in 1990-91 was 450,000 tonnes. In spite of the
infrastructure bottleneck, the Indian industry produced 512,000 tonnes last
year, beating its target of 500,000 tonnes and 1989-90's actual production
of 449,328 tonnes. The installed capacity of the industry is 610,000 tonnes.
Mr Agarwala points out that demand growth has been deterred by the high duty
on aluminium, which constitutes nearly 40 per cent of the final price of the
metal, much higher than is paid on other non-ferrous metals, like copper,
zinc and lead, which are mostly imported. The Federal Ministry of Mines has
backed the aluminium industry's plea for the duty to be reduced, but the
Ministry of Finance has to agree. A strong case is also being made for
lowering import duties on hard pitch and calcined petroleum coke, two
important inputs for aluminium production.
Aluminium Industry officials expect that following the launch on April 1 of
the eighth five year plan, which lays considerable stress on the creation of
new power generation capacity, there will be strong growth in demand for
aluminium. The working group on the plan projected 8 per cent annual growth
in aluminium demand during the plan period.
Mr Agarwala believes that if the primary metal producers undertake market
development work in earnest domestic aluminium demand could easily be raised
to 1m tonnes by the end of the century. At present Indian per capita
consumption of the metal, at 500 grams is one of the lowest in the world.
It is only recently that the Indian authorities have come to appreciate the
value of aluminium's recyclability. Being highly dependent on fuel imports,
India is expected to encourage the use of this light metal in the transport
sector. Mr Agarwala thinks that transport, packaging, automobile and
construction sectors will provide the main surge in demand in the future.
But, as there is not much new capacity in the pipeline, India will once
again be a net importer of the metal in a few years' time. In 1987-88, India
imported nearly 65,000 tonnes of aluminium. In the current year, however, it
is planning to export 70,000 tonnes of primary metal and semi-fabricated
products.
To be a successful exporter, India will have to improve the quality of
'semis', which will mean importing technology.
HINDALCO INDUSTRIES, India's largest private sector producer of aluminium
has decided to build a 200,000 tonnes-a-year smelter on a greenfield site,
writes Kunal Bose. A 500,000 tonnes-a-year alumina (aluminium oxide) plant
is also to be set up to feed the proposed smelter. A decision on the
location of the project will be taken once Hindalco has signed a lease
agreement for mining bauxite (aluminium ore).
According to Mr AK Agarwala, Hindalco's president, the company is looking at
bauxite reserves in Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The cost of
setting up the smelter and alumina plant will be about Rs40bn (Pounds 870m).
Although Hindalco has been producing aluminium for nearly three decades, for
the proposed new plant it will be seeking the latest technology from the
west. Mr Agarwala, has identified Pechiney of France, Hydro of Norway and
Kaiser and Reynolds of the US as possible sources of the technology. The
supplier of the technology is likely to be asked to participate in the
equity capital of a company being floated to implement the project.
Meanwhile Hindalco is raising capacity at its Renukoot plant in Uttar
Pradesh by 55,000 tonnes to 210,000 tonnes a year. Alumina capacity is also

cost of the expansion will be Rs7bn.

FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Brussels
kills off slaughterhouse profits - Closures are multiplying as Britain's
abattoir industry is forced to raise standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUPLE of months ago, the local commission agent for a quality meat scheme
came to our farm to see if we were interested in a premium price for the
last of our 1991 lambs. He had heard that the 100 or so animals we had left
from the previous season had been fed entirely on turnips and sugar beet
tops through the winter, and that they had been given no concentrate feed.
This meant, he told us, that, provided they were of sufficient quality, they
would qualify for a 6 per cent premium over average market price.
You don't get many offers like that in farming these days, so we were bound
to take him seriously. Even so, we took the precaution of checking on the
credit-worthiness of the eventual buyers and talking to a few farmers who
had previously supplied them to ensure there had been no payment problems.
All seemed well, and we agreed to sell the lambs at the said premium.
Two days later, the lorry arrived to collect the lambs, and off they went to
the abattoir. Two days after that, it was announced on the BBC's early
morning farming radio programme that the company which had taken them had
called in the receiver.
Now, two months after that, we are still waiting to hear if we are likely to
be paid anything for the lambs, and, if so, what proportion of their total
value of close to Pounds 4,000. I am not optimistic.
Because of the relatively modest amount of money involved, we are unlikely
to be dragged down in the classic domino effect that characterises such
business failures. But we were relatively lucky. Another Norfolk farmer
stands to lose Pounds 72,000 from the same collapse, and yet another Pounds
260,000 from the bankruptcy of an even bigger meat company that went under a
few weeks later. I am not sure how they will cope.
It is estimated, in fact, that about 90 UK abattoirs have closed in the last
12 months, and, according to a new report by the Meat and Livestock
Commission, a further 350 are likely to go out of business within the next
two years. That implies that about half of the 700 or so abattoirs in
operation at the moment will go. Only 12 years ago, this country had almost
1,200 abattoirs.
The slaughter industry is, in fact, squeezed between the costs of complying
with European Community regulations and the reluctance, or more accurately,
refusal, of the big wholesale buyers to pay more for meat. Moreover, 1992 is
a crunch year, because, by January 1, 1993, all UK abattoirs must comply
with the European Commission's Fresh Meat Directive, which requires that the
standard of all slaughtering facilities throughout the community be
harmonised.
That is not to say, as the MLC report makes clear, that standards currently
imposed in the UK are any danger to public health. Indeed, all abattoirs
have had to be licensed, inspected and approved regularly by local
authorities for many years. The EC now requires, however, that so-called
'export standards' be met, even when the meat is for domestic consumption.
It is the expense involved in bringing plants up to this level that is
causing many of the closures.
In the past only a small proportion of the abattoirs in the UK were
export-approved. This was because, historically, the UK had been an
importer, rather than an exporter, of meat, and few abattoir-owners felt it
worthwhile to spend the significant sums required to be otherwise. Now they
have to do so or go out of business.
Indeed, some abattoir-owners have recently taken the necessary measures.
They have brought their plants up to the required standard and, in many
cases, have increased their capacity in order to justify the expenditure.
This means they are now forced to buy additional prime stock to keep their
slaughter lines running.
But in the meantime a shortage of supplies has occurred. Poor profitability
last year led to a reduction in the pig-breeding herd. Then the dreaded
blue-ear disease cut the numbers reaching maturity this year, both here in
Britain and in other EC countries that normally export to the UK. The
disease is still decimating herds in some regions, and now another, equally
serious, flu-like virus, which can also be fatal to small pigs, is adding to
farmers' and abattoir-owners' problems.
Inevitably, given the keen demand from expanded abattoirs, combined with the
shortage of stock, the price of those pigs that are available has risen,
much to the satisfaction, I might add, of farmers who have managed to stay
free of disease. But the supermarkets, who are the main customers of many of
the upgraded abattoirs, have declined to pay extra for their supplies on the
grounds that this would force them to raise retail prices and risk provoking
consumer resistance.
Similarly, although the ex-farm price of fresh English lamb is still
insufficient to provide a reasonable profit for sheep farmers, now that the
EC variable premium has been abolished, supermarkets find that they can buy
frozen New Zealand lamb much cheaper and are turning to these imports in
increasing quantities in order, they say, to help the housewife economise.
The number of home-produced lambs has also fallen slightly this year in
response to EC measures to restrict the size of flocks by limiting ewe
headage payments to 500 head per farmer. All of which is bad news for the
abattoir industry.
In the short term, at least, it is also bad news for farmers like me. For,
although I accept that the rationalisation of the UK slaughtering sector may
be long overdue, I am now faced with the unpalatable possibility of not
being paid for animals I have taken months or years to rear.
Indeed, I may well be forced to accept lower prices for those animals from
abattoirs I know to be solvent, instead of trying to strike the best
possible bargain. And, in case you were wondering, the cost of credit
insurance against abattoir failure has become prohibitive, always assuming
you can actually find someone willing to write it.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE decline puts
pressure on Eurobond dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets would be among the most seriously hit if the collapse
in Tokyo equity prices halts the flow of Japanese investment into overseas
financial markets.
Traders already report net selling of UK government bonds by Japanese
investors, taking advantage of the rally which followed the general election
last week. Views are mixed, though, on whether this will turn into sustained
selling.
Whereas Japanese investors directed much of their cash during the 1980s into
US government bonds, the past two years has seen a shift in emphasis, with
European markets benefiting far more from the Japanese capital surplus.
US dollar bonds still account for the bulk of Japanese investors' overseas
financial assets: roughly Dollars 400bn, according to Mr Mark Cliffe of
Nomura Research Institute in London. However, net new investment overseas is
increasingly being diverted elsewhere.
The chart records a fall-off in net new US bond investment from the peak of
1989, and a simultaneous growth in European investment. The quarterly
figures for 1991 - shown on an annual basis - exaggerate the fall in the US,
since they reflect in part a seasonal investment pattern. However, the shift
in favour of European bond markets is clear.
The trend is even more exaggerated if Eurodollar investments are excluded.
According to figures produced by the Japanese Securities Dealers
Association, Eurobond investments - mainly in Eurodollar instruments - last
year totalled Dollars 32bn. Leaving these aside, the Japanese made roughly
the same net investment in UK and US bonds, of Dollars 13bn each.
The extent of Japanese repatriation of capital has been modest so far, most
traders say. Japanese banks and life assurance companies find themselves in
very different positions.
For banks, with a pressing need to shrink balance sheets, selling foreign
bond holdings appears attractive. However, as Mr Cliffe of NRI points out,
such holdings are among the highest-yielding assets the banks hold. The
pressure to improve margins means they would be loathe to sell.
Although insurance companies may not be directly hit by the Tokyo stock
market collapse, as providers of subordinated loans they have in the past
provided one of the props to banks in times of capital need. If life
companies are still willing and able to provide subordinated debt to banks -
and if they choose to finance it through the sale of foreign investments
rather than depressed Japanese ones - overseas selling could follow.
Whether or not the Japanese sell bonds, they are unlikely to buy so many new
ones in the months ahead. The gilts market could suffer more than most.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Grenfell to set up
unit in Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Grenfell, the UK merchant bank controlled by Deutsche Bank, is
stepping up its continental European activities with a new operation in
Milan. It will complement existing offices in London, Frankfurt, Paris and
Madrid.
The new unit, to be headed by Mr Dante Razzano, formerly head of Citibank's
Italian corporate finance unit, will concentrate on mergers and
acquisitions. It is expected to co-operate closely with Deutsche Bank and
Banca d'America e d'Italia, the German bank's big Italian subsidiary.
The arrival of Morgan Grenfell represents a further increase in the UK
merchant banking presence in Milan, following the establishment of offices
by Warburg, Rothschild, Schroder and Baring in the past three years.
Like its counterparts, Morgan Grenfell expects growing mergers and
acquisitions business in Italy, particularly cross-border deals. It may also
hope to win business from the country's so far cautious privatisation
programme.
Mr Guy Dawson, Morgan Grenfell's head of corporate finance, said Italy
represented an area of 'considerable opportunity' for M&amp;A. 'We have now
plugged a final and very important gap.'
The departure of Mr Razzano and three other executives will mark a blow to
Citibank, which, following retrenchment elsewhere, had concentrated its M&amp;A
activities in Milan, along with much smaller operations in Germany and
France.
Those operations, and the remaining members of its Milan-based M&amp;A team, are
now expected to be integrated more closely into its advisory and financing
activities.
Morgan Grenfell, which had a 5 per cent stake in Sviluppo, a Milanese
merchant bank, already has a small Italian office, specialising in trade
finance. That will now be expanded to accommodate the new team.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Bonds: Borrowers take advantage of demand for
sterling issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO more borrowers took advantage of strong demand for sterling bonds, in
the wake of last week's UK election victory by the ruling Conservative
party, to add tranches to existing bond issues.
The Woolwich Building Society and Hypobank, the German bank, each raised
Pounds 50m of 10-year and five-year bonds respectively. On Friday, two UK
companies, BAA and Cable &amp; Wireless, launched a total of Pounds 200m of
bonds.
The Woolwich issue consists of subordinated bonds, which qualify as Tier 2
capital under Basle capital adequacy guidelines. The bonds, priced to yield
145 basis points more than the 10-year gilt, met demand mainly from UK
institutions which liked the relatively high yield and are allowed to hold
subordinated paper. A number of UK companies are eyeing the market. However,
many corporate treasurers are hesitating because they expect UK interest
rates to be cut soon. For many of them, funding levels of under 10 per cent
are a likely trigger point. Most companies are not in urgent need of funds,
since investment is running at a low level, but there is a continuing trend
of refinancing bank debt.
Activity is likely to be concentrated among UK companies which need to raise
sterling. Overseas borrowers are likely to be able to fund more cheaply
elsewhere, since sterling swap rates are not looking attractive.
Yield spreads of Eurosterling bonds relative to the gilts market have
remained stable, in spite of a five-point rally in the gilts market last
week. Eurobond prices normally lag movements in the government bond market,
causing spreads to widen when the government bond market rallies.
Dealers said there was virtually no Eurosterling paper around, since the
primary market had been very quiet in the run-up to the election. The heavy
fresh supply of gilts has not yet dinted demand for sterling paper, dealers
said.
Elsewhere, Ferrovie, the Italian railway, raised L700bn of 10-year
floating-rate notes.

THE Hong Kong Stock Exchange has called an extraordinary general meeting of
its members on May 6 to vote on a proposed capital reduction and change to
its rules.
The meeting is a milestone in the reform of the exchange and follows an
agreement reached by the exchange with the Securities and Futures
Commission, the colony's financial markets watchdog, late last year over the
governance of the stock market.
Members of the exchange will be asked to approve a capital reduction whereby
943 shares in the exchange worth HKDollars 100,000 (USDollars 12,930) each
will be reduced to HKDollars 1 and the remaining HKDollars 99,999 remitted
to shareholders.
Members will also be asked to approve the reintroduction of 'block voting'.
A member who votes in elections for the stock exchange council must cast all
the votes to which he is entitled if his vote is to be regarded as valid.
Exchange members will also be asked to vote their assent to a High Court
ruling of last October which found that several general meetings of the
exchange were invalidly called.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Building a presence in Germany -
The push by Korean construction equipment groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Korean construction equipment makers are mounting a belated push into the
German market to ensure they do not miss the remaining opportunities from
reunification.
Two of the big three Korean producers, Samsung Heavy Industries and Hyundai
Construction Equipment, are negotiating with German entrepreneurs to set up
dealer networks. Germany accounts for about 37 per cent of the European
construction equipment market.
The Korean producers have been reluctant to enter the German market because
of the strength - and number - of domestic manufacturers, and the fear that
German customers would be reluctant to accept their products.
The moves by the two companies will be viewed with some unease by western
producers.
After the inroads made by the Japanese companies into the European market in
the 1980s, the activities of the Koreans could further intensify competition
in Europe.
Daewoo has been producing excavators at a factory near Mons in Belgium since
late 1990, establishing, like the Japanese, a manufacturing presence ahead
of the European single market reforms.
Mr Sang-Kyu Kim, Euro Daewoo's director of planning and international
sourcing, said the product range at the Mons factory would be steadily
increased from the current two models to five by the end of 1993.
Samsung entered the European market only three years ago, 13 years after
Daewoo, and sold just 100 crawler excavators last year.
This year, however, the company hopes to raise sales to 280. Mr Ki-Jeh Cho,
head of overseas marketing at Samsung's construction equipment division,
said manufacturing in Europe would be viable once sales reached about 500
units.
A special team in Korea is studying whether Samsung should manufacture in
Europe through a joint venture, by acquisition, or by building a greenfield
site.
Mr Cho expects a decision next year with production beginning, perhaps, in
1994.
The third big Korean producer, Hyundai Construction Equipment, began selling
in Europe in early 1990.
However, it has also been looking for manufacturing sites, and has come
close to a decision at least once.
The German initiatives by Samsung and Daewoo reflect a growing confidence
that their machines will be accepted there, having been proven elsewhere in
Europe.
Hyundai is taking a more cautious approach, selling small numbers of
machines in Germany via its Belgian dealer.
The Koreans recognise they need to respond to reunification and its
implications for Germany's relative position in the European market.
The UK has long been Daewoo's biggest European market, but has been badly
hit by recession.
Korean construction equipment technology is often underestimated by western
rivals, and the three producers' overseas expansion - like that of the
Japanese before them - has been underpinned by their stranglehold on a
strong domestic market.
Some observers, however, criticise them for being slow to take decisions,
especially on overseas manufacturing.
The assault on Germany may already have missed the best of the growth in the
market since reunification.
Daewoo is looking to establish dealer networks in Germany and Italy, and has
had proposals from some manufacturers for product exchange deals.
Samsung is talking with many prospective dealers in Germany, and also to
importers. Mr Cho said deals were imminent.
Historically, Daewoo and Samsung have tended to sell machines in Europe at 5
to 10 per cent below prices for western and Japanese equipment, in an
attempt to establish a presence.
Now, said Mr Cho, prices relative to Japanese machines are being raised, a
further sign of the Koreans' increasing confidence.

NZ Steel
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW Zealand Steel, a company set up with government backing in the 1960s to
give the country independence from British and Australian suppliers, was
yesterday sold to one of its greatest rivals, Australia's BHP.
New Zealand's Overseas Investments Commission became the final statutory
authority to agree to the sale. Earlier approvals came from the New Zealand
Commerce Commission and the Australian Trade Practices Commission.
NZ Steel was established to take advantage of the country's ironsand and
coal deposits. It was set up according to the then government's policies of
saving overseas exchange, import substitution and creating employment.
New Zealand became the world leader in developing high technology to convert
ironsand to steel, and, helped by tariff barriers, the company became highly
profitable. In 1981 the National Party government under Sir Robert Muldoon
made steel production a 'Think Big' job creation project, and invested
around NZDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 1.36bn) to enlarge the plant and make it a
power in the Pacific region.
However in 1984 the reformist Labour government earmarked the plant for
early sale, did away with all tax and import protection, and injected
NZDollars 1.5bn to make it saleable. After a number of bids, it was finally
sold to Equiticorp in 1987.
Equiticorp promptly fell into financial difficulties which it blamed on
problems at NZ Steel and its merchant banking operations in Britain.
In 1989, NZ Steel passed into the effective control of its greatest Pacific
rival, BHP, a company which had fought ruthlessly to stop it becoming
established.
However statutory requirements prohibited BHP from owning more than 31 per
cent of the ordinary shares. This requirement was lifted yesterday.
The two New Zealand-based shareholders in NZ Steel, Fisher &amp; Paykel and
Steel &amp; Tube - which is 49 per cent controlled by BHP - yesterday confirmed
they would sell their respective 50 per cent holdings of ordinary shares to
BHP. They had earlier sold their preference shareholdings.
However, ANZ Banking Group, which has the remaining 19 per cent of NZ Steel,
said it may continue as a minority shareholder.
Mr Jeff Pitt, spokesman, said the bank was looking closely at the
investment.
Both Fisher &amp; Paykel, a founder of the company, and Steel &amp; Tube said they
did not wish to invest more money at this stage.
BHP paid NZDollars 13.8m for the ordinary shares and a further NZDollars
73.7m for the non-voting ordinary shares.
BHP intends to invest substantially in the plant, which is meeting all
performance standards and achieving record production.
However the deep recession in New Zealand is forcing it to export around 70
per cent of its production to Australia and Asia.

QUEBECOR Printing, North America's second-biggest commercial printer, has
raised CDollars 220.5m (Dollars 185.2m) by selling 14m shares to a group of
underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities for distribution in Canada,
Europe and the US.
Proceeds of the issue, comprising subordinate voting shares at CDollars
15.75 a share, are being used to reduce debt and put the company in a
position to seize acquisition opportunities, said Mr Charles Cavell,
president.
Analysts believe the company might expand next into Europe.
Quebecor Printing, until now, has been fully owned by Quebecor, the
Montreal-based publishing and printing group.
It more than doubled in size two years ago by taking over the late Mr Robert
Maxwell's Maxwell Graphics in the US for more than CDollars 500m. Later
Quebecor bought out the remaining 20 per cent Maxwell minority holding.
As a result of the new issue, Quebecor Printing will be about 20 per cent
publicly held on a fully diluted basis.
Western Canada's family owned Bentall property group has sold a 23.5 per
cent equity interest for CDollars 40m to Prudential of America and a British
Columbia government pension fund.
Direct public participation will follow within the next few years. The
Bentall portfolio is valued at CDollars 1.1bn and expansion is planned in
British Columbia, Washington State and California.
Four Seasons Hotels plan to raise CDollars 45m by the sale of 25m shares at
CDollars 18.75 each to underwriters. The proceeds are to reduce debt.

THREE BIDS for First Capital Life Insurance Company, the ailing San
Diego-based life insurer, had been received by last week's deadline.
The company was seized by the Californian regulators in May after its parent
company went into bankruptcy and a run by policyholders had developed.
The separate proposals came from Transamerica Life Occidental Insurance
Company; Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company; and from Leucadia National
Corporation, the New York-based conglomerate, in conjunction with First
Capital's creditors' committee.
The three proposals pose alternatives to a rehabilitation scheme, entailing
a Dollars 50m capital injection, put forward by Shearson Lehman Brothers,
the investment banking subsidiary of American Express.
Shearson was closely involved with First Capital, holding a 28 per cent
stake in the parent company, First Capital Holdings, and selling First
Capital policies to its own clients. The bidders have until April 17 to
revise offers.

WACHOVIA, the south-eastern regional US banking group, reported
first-quarter net income yesterday of Dollars 106.1m, up 26 per cent from
the Dollars 84.1m earned a year ago, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The improvement resulted largely from higher net interest income and other
service revenues, coupled with tighter controls on operating expenses.
The company said total non-performing assets at the end of the first quarter
amounted to Dollars 306m, up from Dollars 271m a year ago.

<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has sold just over 66 per cent of Banoro for Dollars
366m. This is equivalent to 3.95 times the bank's book value and a little
more than eight times last year's earnings.
Banoro is the 15th bank to be privatised in Mexico.
The three remaining government-owned banks that have to be sold by the
middle of this year are Banco Internacional, Banco del Centro and Banco del
Norte.
The bank was bought by a syndicate of about 600 investors headed by Mr
Rodolfo Esquer, Mr Fernando Obregon and Mr Juan Antonio Beltran.
The group comprises the main stockholders and clients of Estrategia
Bursatil, one of Mexico's oldest brokerage firms.
According to the finance ministry, the winning group intends to form an
integrated financial group based in north-western Mexico, an area where
Banoro has traditionally operated.
Only two groups bid for Banoro, both of them led by well-known regional
businessmen.
The winning group offered almost 20 per cent more that its rival.
The group paid 3,096.08 pesos per share (about Dollars 1).
However, this compared with the losing group's offer of 2,587 pesos per
share.

Hilton Hotels to Dollars 22.2m

<TEXT>
A TENTATIVE upturn in the fortunes of the beleaguered US hotel and lodging
industry was evident yesterday when Hilton Hotels, the California-based
chain, announced after-tax profits of Dollars 22.2m in the three months to
end-March.
This compared with the Dollars 12.3m in the same period a year earlier and
was scored on total revenues of Dollars 276.3m - a 4 per cent improvement
over the January-March period in 1991.
Hilton acknowledged that part of the progress had come from strong results
at its Las Vegas-based gaming operations. Operating profits on the gaming
side advanced from Dollars 33.7m a year earlier to Dollars 40.8m.
The company said the Flamingo Hilton-Reno had realised its first profit for
the first quarter, and that a smaller win percentage at the Las Vegas Hilton
had been more than offset by a lower bad-debt experience and reduced
operating expenses.
The group is expanding into riverboat gambling in New Orleans, and has
talked of a Dollars 2bn gaming centre in Chicago, although this project
faces uncertainties.
On the hotels side, Hilton reported operating profits of Dollars 13.2m. This
is a considerable improvement on the Dollars 8.5m figure for the previous
year, but results in 1991 were badly hit by the Gulf war, which depressed
travel generally.
However, hotel occupancy rates averaged 62 per cent, compared with 59 per
cent a year ago.
Commenting on the results, Mr Barron Hilton, chairman, said the group was
encouraged by improvements in certain markets such as Hawaii and New
Orleans, but the continuing recession and an oversupply of hotel space were
still hampering progress.

RECORD earnings from its Smith Barney securities broking subsidiary helped
Primerica, the US financial services group, yesterday report a 45 per cent
increase in first-quarter operating profits to Dollars 153.9m.
Total income for the period, however, was Dollars 220.8m, because the group
reaped Dollars 66.9m in net gains from the sale of stock in Inter-Regional
Financial, Musicland and Margaretten, the group's former mortgage banking
subsidiary sold in a public offering in January.
Smith Barney was again the star performer in the Primerica stable, riding
another buoyant quarter for Wall Street and domestic stock markets to record
profits of Dollars 56.1m, almost double the Dollars 29.3m the broking house
earned a year earlier.
Revenues were up from all of Smith Barney's main business lines, a
reflection of strong market participation by individual as well as
institutional investors, extremely high levels of new issue offerings and a
solid increase in assets under management.
Only principal trading, where revenues rose just 5 per cent, failed to match
the record pace set by the rest of the company.
Primerica Financial Services, the insurance and mutual funds unit, reported
earnings of Dollars 46.1m, a slight improvement on a year ago. Although
sales of new life insurance were down on the first quarter of 1991 at
Dollars 11.1bn (compared with Dollars 14.3bn), they were about even with the
levels report-ed in the previous two quarters.
Earnings from the consumer services businesses rose 10 per cent to Dollars
44.7m, despite lower levels of consumer borrowing and the continued
unfavourable economic climate. Primerica credited the improvement to high
credit standards and tight control of expenses.

<TEXT>
USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday said it might sell shares in
its Delhi Group, including the Delhi gas pipeline and other related
companies, as part of its efforts to realise shareholder value.
The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company said it would propose issuing a
new class of common stock, called USX-Delhi Group, at its annual
shareholders meeting on May 4. The Delhi Group, currently part of USX's
Marathon gas operations, had sales of Dollars 442m, operating income of
Dollars 33m and assets of Dollars 598m in 1991.
The new stock offering is just one of several options being considered by
USX. The company may also sell assets or create a master limited
partnership, which would not require shareholder approval.
This latest effort to realise additional value for the Marathon Group
follows USX's novel stock split last year when the company bowed to pressure
from Mr Carl Icahn, the New York financier, and agreed to issue a new class
of stock to reflect the performance of its steel and diversified businesses.
Mr Icahn, who started to acquire USX stock in 1986 and had claimed that the
company should float its less-profitable steel business separately from its
Marathon oil and gas operations, sold his entire stake at the time of the
stock split.

FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Ford plans Dollars 3bn
investment in North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the second largest US vehicle manufacturer, said yesterday that it
planned to invest Dollars 3bn in North America over the next three years,
partly to fund development of a new minivan.
Ford, which reported a record Dollars 2.3bn loss last year, said that about
a third of the funds - more than Dollars 900m - would go towards retooling
and re-equiping its Oakville assembly plant near Toronto, where the minivan
would be produced.
Minivans, among which Ford's current Aerostar is a leading competitor, are
one of the few North American light vehicle growth sectors, and have assumed
critical importance for General Motors and Chrysler, as well as Ford.
Ford's decision to make such large investments at Oakville serves to allay
Canadian fears of an increasing withdrawal by US vehicle makers as a result
of trade frictions between the two countries.
Ford added that about Dollars 400m has been spent on a new paint facility at
the plant. One production shift at the Ontario truck plant, next to
Oakville, would be discontinued in 1993, and about 700 workers transferred
to Oakville for production of the minivan.
Eventually, some 400 additional employees would be required, and Ford said
it would offer jobs to other workers on indefinite lay-off at other Ontario
plants. Production of the minivan would begin in late 1993, and it would be
on the market in 1994.
A further Dollars 650m is to be spent on expanding the Kentucky Truck Plant
in Louisville, for the production of F-Series trucks. There are plans for
1,300 additional jobs by 1995, when full production is reached. Close to
Dollars 1bn will be spent on the equipping of the Windsor engine plant in
Ontario, where a new family of truck engines is due to be produced in 1995.
The Dollars 3bn investment, although large, is only a portion of Ford's
annual expenditure on retooling and production-related changes.
The Detroit carmaker, for example, said that it spent about Dollars 5.6bn
last year on changes to production facilities in order to bring new products
to the market.

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Irish milkmen discover talent for butchery
 -Tim Coone analyses the shifts of alignment shaking up the Republic's food
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVENTIONAL wisdom says: 'One man's meat is another man's poison.' Some 10
years ago, this was true of the Irish food sector, where meat and dairy
processing have traditionally been two distinct and separate industries.
Each has evolved isolated from the other.
However last week's acquisition by Avonmore Foods, the Irish dairy group, of
Barretts &amp; Baird, the UK meat processing group, reflects the steady
transformation taking place in the Irish food industry and the gradual
abandonment of old corporate prejudices.
The IPounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) Irish milk processing industry, once highly
fragmented and characterised by a proliferation of small farmers'
co-operatives, has in the past decade become concentrated through mergers
and acquisitions. It is now dominated by five companies, four of them quoted
on the Dublin Stock Exchange.
Their growing financial muscle and management expertise, has converted them
into an emerging force in the European market. The recognition of the need
for diversification out of their home markets and into new and complementary
product lines has given them a voracious appetite for acquisition both at
home and abroad.
Last month, the collapse of United Meat Packers (UMP), the Republic's second
largest meat processor, presented them with an important opportunity. That
company is now in receivership, and tenders closed last Friday for the
purchase of its six plants in Ireland. Mr John Donnelly, the receiver, says
that more than two dozen tenders have been received, four times the number
he had expected. Several of the dairy processors are believed to have made
bids.
The IPounds 1bn beef industry is undergoing what is probably its biggest
shake-up since Ireland joined the EC in 1973 when the Common Agricultural
Policy's intervention payments system (a price-supbecame the engine for the
sector's growth. What began as a mechanism to mop up surpluses though,
became the central pillar of support for the industry, and eventually its
greatest weakness.
EC beef intervention stocks reached a record high of 800,000 tonnes in 1991,
342,000 tonnes coming from Ireland. More than three quarters of Irish beef
steers are now being sold into intervention. The Irish Livestock &amp; Meat
Board says cattle slaughterings at export plants reached 1.5m head in 1991,
an all-time high.
Two companies had come to dominate the Irish meat-processing industry -
Goodman International and UMP. Both are privately run, and both have
developed a reputation of intense secrecy over their management and
operations. The lack of public scrutiny of their finances caused the big
Irish banks and institutional investors to steer clear of any deep
involvement. 'The Irish banks have skilfully tiptoed around the meat
processing industry,' says one market analyst. Foreign banks are the
principal creditors to the industry.
With the help of foreign credit and government export guarantee insurance,
the two companies developed important markets in the Middle East in the
1980s.
However, these collapsed with the Gulf war and the scare over bovine
spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow disease'. Thrown back onto
intervention buying, where profit margins are very tight at around 2 per
cent, the big beef processors faced a squeeze. Voracious users of working
capital and burdened with heavy interest charges for capital investment in
plant, the strains soon began to show.
In August 1990, a High Court examiner was appointed to Mr Larry Goodman's
Goodman International, Europe's largest meat processor, when it transpired
that the company could not meet payments on more than IPounds 650m owed to
its creditor banks. Agreed debt restructuring is now underway, but the
company's future remains in doubt, not least because of a litany of alleged
fraud and malpractice at Goodman plants. This is now the focus of a lengthy
and expensive investigation by a High Court-appointed Beef Tribunal.
Together with the placing of UMP into receivership, this signifies that 60
per cent of Ireland's beef and meat processing capacity faces a possible
carve-up.
In stark contrast to the private Goodman and UMP, the publicly-quoted Kerry
Group last month reported a 25 per cent rise in profits and a 30 per cent
increase in turnover, largely on the back of a diversification from its
dairy interests into meat processing. Acquiring plants in the UK, US and
Ireland, together with distribution networks through supermarket chains,
Kerry has led the restructuring of Ireland's food processing industry. Some
50 per cent of its turnover now comes from meat processing. The other major
dairy processors, such as Avonmore and Waterford Foods, are following suit.
Public companies such as these, with a strong track record and solid support
from institutional investors, should have little problem in raising cash
from the equity market to dominate eventually the meat processing industry.
For some time Dublin stockbrokers have been singing the praises of Ireland's
largest food companies, pointing to their good value and low price/earnings
ratios, and their diversification into the US and European markets.
One potential obstacle to their long-term growth though, is their hybrid
co-operative/plc structure. Their parent co-operatives, made up of milk
producers, hold the majority stake in each company and their articles of
association currently prevent that stake from falling below 50 per cent.
The psychological barrier for these co-operatives, to cede control to
institutional shareholders in the interest of longer-term diversification
and expansion, will be a difficult one to break.
Analysts believe that Kerry is the first likely to do so, as the parent
co-operative stake is now only 57 per cent following a recent rights issue.
Once that barrier is broken, it will mark a watershed in the Irish food
industry, paving the way for others to follow and for the Irish companies to
become important players in the European food market.
What has been made clear by the UMP and Goodman crises, is that Ireland's
beef industry has been long due for change, and that as a stand-alone
industry, dependent upon intervention and concentrated in the hands of
highly geared, privately run companies, it is not viable.
The diversifying dairy companies, with their strong retail outlets and
access to the equity market, have pointed the way forward and are likely to
be the ones who will now carve the beef industry into more competitive units
with a stronger institutional base.
Such consolidation will be both logical and healthy for Ireland's
agriculture and food industry, which exports IPounds 3.5bn of products
annually, or 21 per cent of the total.

<TEXT>
FROST Group, which through its Save and Look service stations is one of
Britain's largest independent petrol retailers, yesterday released its first
results since relisting on the stock exchange last October.
The company announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 2.5m
on turnover of Pounds 82.8m (Pounds 101.5m) for the year to December 31.
However, Frost said the two periods were not comparable because of the
company's previous status as a subsidiary of Norfolk House, the property
group which went into receivership in March last year after buying Frost in
1990.
Under Norfolk House's management, service station sites had been sold, and
these changes were now being reversed.
Earnings fell to 13.4p (24.2p) but the company is recommending a dividend of
2p (nil).
Mr James Frost, chairman, said the company had increased the number of
service station sites to more than 100 with 23 acquisitions, and more
purchases were expected.

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Macmillan seeks freeze on Berlitz shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HOLDING OF 56 per cent in Berlitz, the language school, was transferred by
Macmillan, the publisher, to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private company
in the Maxwell group, on November 5 1990, exactly 12 months before the death
of Mr Robert Maxwell, the High Court was told yesterday.
Mr David Oliver QC, for Macmillan, the main publishing subsidiary of Maxwell
Communication Corporation, said the transfer had been instigated by Mr
Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell. Mr David Shaffer, a Macmillan director
and appointee to the Berlitz board, was also shown as having been present at
the meeting 'but denies ever having been there', Mr Oliver said.
Macmillan is asking the court to grant injunctions preventing four banks,
which hold 9.6m of the 10.6m shares involved, dealing with them pending full
trial in the autumn of a dispute over their ownership. The banks had taken
them as collateral for loans to Maxwell entities.
Mr Justice Hoffmann refused a plea by Mr Oliver for Macmillan's opposed
application to be heard in private.
Mr Oliver said that only the 'legal estate', not the beneficial interest, in
the holding had been transferred to BIT, which had been purely a nominee.
Between March 11 and October 15 last year BIT had transferred 9.6m shares
into the name of Cede, nominee for the Depository Trust Company.
The remaining 1m shares had been comprised in two certificates. BIT held one
and had 'all but acknowledged they are ours,' Mr Oliver said. The other
certificate had been transferred by BIT to Credit Suisse on September 27
1991.
Mr Oliver said that of the shares transferred to Cede 1.9m had since been
registered in the name of Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings, Swiss Volksbank
held 2.4m, Credit Suisse 2m and Morgan Stanley Trust Company 3.3m.
Mr Oliver said that Morgan Stanley itself made no claim to the shares. It
believed it might be holding some for Bishopsgate Investment Management,
which managed certain Maxwell company pension funds. BIM had failed to claim
the shares, although it had refused to acknowledge it had no claim, he said.
The hearing continues today.

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn to sell shipping arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWELL DUFFRYN, the distribution, storage and engineering group, has sold a
60 per cent stake in its Stephenson Clarke subsidiary, one of the most
famous names in the British shipping industry.
In a deal which values the fleet at Pounds 19m, Powell Duffryn has sold the
stake to unidentified private clients of Hambros Bank, which financed the
purchase.
Powell Duffryn has received a total of Pounds 16.6m in cash, comprising
Pounds 5.9m for the shares and Pounds 10.7m repayment of inter-company debt.
It has also been released from external obligations of Pounds 1.2m.
The buyers will eventually acquire the remaining 40 per cent of Stephenson
Clarke when Powell Duffryn has received a maximum of Pounds 6m from its
share of the shipping company's profits.
Powell Duffryn will remain in shipping services, but this deal is the latest
in a series of disposals and acquisitions which has seen it increasingly
focus on engineering activities.
Last week the group completed the sale of its remaining foundry interests -
Powell Duffryn Castings and Ham-worthy Precision Machining  - to European
Automotive Components for Pounds 4.8m in cash.
In October the group received Pounds 30m from the dissolution of its
quarrying and brickmaking joint venture with Hanson, the UK conglomerate.
Mr Bill Andrews, chief executive of Powell Duffryn, said these cash inflows
would help reduce group gearing from a percentage in the low 40s at its
half-year at the end of September to about the low 20s.
On the engineering side, Mr Andrews said he intended to both invest and
consider further acquisitions in com-bustion technology, railway bogies and
marine products such as pumps and compressors.
He wished to concentrate on businesses where the group had at least a
European position, and preferably could become world players.
Last May Powell Duffryn bought the combustion operations of Dresser Holmes
from Dresser Industries of Dallas for Pounds 5m, and last month it paid
Pounds 4.5m for another combustion technology company, Peabody Engineering
of Connecticut.
Powell Duffryn has also recently invested Pounds 13.7m in the consortium it
leads which in December successfully bid Pounds 180m for control of the Tees
and Hartlepool Port Authority, the first major trust port to be privatised.
In spite of this continuing restructuring, Mr Andrews said Powell Duffryn
was happy to stick with its fuel distribution and storage businesses, which
last year produced the bulk of the group's trading profits.
The Stephenson Clarke management team in Newcastle will continue to operate
the fleet under the non-executive chairmanship of Mr Geoffrey Walker, the
managing director of Powell Duffryn Shipping, which continues to own Cory
Brothers and the group's other shipping services interests.
Stephenson Clarke made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m in the year to March
31 and its fleet had a net book value of Pounds 22.4m.

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Poor buying behind Vivat fall to
'unacceptable' Pounds 0.68m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTOPHER Burnett, the new chairman of Vivat Holdings, yesterday
rebuked the previous management's 'poor buying decisions' and its
diversification from the core business.
These, he said, were responsible for turning a pre-tax profit into a loss,
which translated into losses after tax and extraordinary items of Pounds
12.5m.
For the year to December 31 the Lee Cooper Jeans manufacturer, 29.9 per cent
owned by Wing Tai, the Singapore clothing company, reported a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 678,000 (profit Pounds 3.65m). This was struck on turnover 14 per
cent down at Pounds 89.1m (Pounds 103.7m).
Mr Burnett, who took over in October, described the results as
'unacceptable' and said it was a 'sad reflection' on the way the group had
been managed.
However, he added that the current first-half trading had so far been
encouraging, although it was too early to say whether the group would move
back into the black.
The exceptional item of Pounds 559,000 related to the relocation of the
group's headquarters from Paris, where the chief executive and finance
director had been based, to London.
A further Pounds 11.9m was taken as an extraordinary item. This related
mainly to lease obligations to Grant Seward, Vivat's former retail
subsidiary sold in 1988 to Chelsea Man which subsequently went into
liquidation.
The extraordinary item was swollen by the writing-off of two years' payments
from sale and lease-backs of trade marks; bank borrowings to Otto Albert,
its German subsidiary which was put into receivership, and losses arising
from the disposal of a small Spanish subsidiary.
This reduced shareholders' funds by Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 15.1m, increasing
gearing to 73 per cent.
Net borrowings were Pounds 11m at the end of the year.
Losses per share emerged at 1.2p (earnings 8.3p). The final dividend has
been passed (0.5p), leaving no payment for the year (0.5p).

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Talks allow Cabra to lift threat to wind up
Chelsea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CABRA ESTATES, the heavily-indebted property company, yesterday lifted its
threat to seek the winding-up of Chelsea football club, saying talks on the
future of the club's west London ground had made satisfactory progress.
The heads of an agreement have been signed, whereby the club will buy its
Stamford Bridge ground from Cabra for about Pounds 13m in cash.
Crucially, the property company has been assured that Chelsea has access to
bank funds and now hopes that a formal agreement can be signed within weeks.
Part of the deal would involve Chelsea relieving Cabra of its obligation to
pay Fulham football club roughly Pounds 8m to leave its Craven Cottage
ground (to share Stamford Bridge) to clear the way for redevelopment.
Cabra warned that Chelsea might have to be wound up after the club did not
come up with the Pounds 22.85m purchase price for Stamford Bridge by last
week's deadline, set as part of a contract backed by recent High Court and
Court of Appeal rulings.

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Banks persuaded not to drop Aitch -
Stitching together a clothing company's rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LADIES at Aitch Holding's shirt factory in Lurgen, Northern Ireland,
hardly ever seem to pause for breath.
Fleet of finger at the best of times - they are paid on a piece work basis -
they are also acutely aware that Coats Viyella, a much larger competitor,
has cut 900 jobs in Northern Ireland in the year, 566 of them last week.
Lurgen's ladies would not, however, be working today were it not for the
many hundreds of hours put in by Aitch's bankers and its new management,
dedicated to putting together a rescue plan, as well as the intervention of
a government department and the Bank of England.
The Aitch rescue, which its shareholders were yesterday asked to approve
along with a name change to Dunkeld Group, may not rank in size alongside
the refinancings of Brent Walker or News International. But it is an example
of banks, faced with huge losses, taking the responsible route of allowing
management to work out a bad loan, thereby saving jobs, rather than putting
the company in the hands of receivers.
But it was a close decision. Hill Samuel, Aitch's bankers had begun to put
in the receivers last September, ending a sad and expensive episode for Mr
Harry Rogers, its founder. Following the reversal of Mr Rogers' private
clothes company into the quoted Munton group in 1988, Aitch was producing in
Northern Ireland and London, it had sales offices in Belgium and a buying
office in the Far East.
It was also losing unknown amounts of money in Northern Ireland, and from a
raft of smaller companies in a wide range of garment related businesses.
The concentration by the Northern Ireland operation on short production runs
of branded shirts, including the Ben Sherman, Pierre Balmain, Tern and
Panache labels, meant costs were excessively high by comparison with
manufacturers in the Far East. Combined with operational problems at the
contract shirts operations in Northern Ireland, the company was heading for
the rocks.
By early last year, it was clear that losses in these areas were not going
to be offset by and Gottfried &amp; Paul ladies leisurewear businesses and that
ordinary trading would not reduce debts. Hill Samuel, owed Pounds 9.5m, and
FennoScandia, owed Pounds 2.5m, were getting nervous.
Just how badly the company had fallen was demonstrated in February when it
reported losses after tax and extraordinary items of Pounds 18.73m in the
year to November 1991, taking the company far into negative shareholders'
funds territory . At its peak in 1989, Aitch had commanded a market
capitalisation of only Pounds 13m.
With this track record, it took escapology worthy of Harry Houdini for Aitch
to unwind Hill Samuel's decision to send in the receivers.
Over one stress-filled night, Mr Michael Green, a corporate doctor and
entrepreneur appointed by the board to sort out the problems in Northern
Ireland, and Mr Jon Sachs, a director of the Bank of Ireland, managed to
amass enough of an argument to convince Hill Samuel to hold off the
receivers for two weeks until the new management team had put together a
recovery plan.
Mr Sachs says the subsequent efforts to get the restructuring to stand up
was something of an 'Indian rope trick'. It rested partly on the argument
that the banks simply should not be walking away from 700 group jobs without
fully investigating whether there was an alternative.
This was one of a number of less than conventional interventions in the
ensuing months, not the least of which was the role the Bank of England
played in acting as a mediator between Hill Samuel and FennoScandia.
Equally important was the role of the Industrial Development Board of
Northern Ireland. Mr Green's proposed restructuring, the Province's
development bank argued, would not only secure jobs but would lead to a
group that could be viable.
The IDB, which has recently become much more hard nosed about backing viable
concerns and not just large employers, took the important step of backing
the restructuring with Pounds 500,000 of new capital.
But Aitch's stay of execution had as much to do with the fact that it was
entering a trading period during which it would be pulling in more cash than
it would spend, making the banks no worse off for not pulling the plug
immediately.
This breathing space allowed Mr Green to pull together the business plan.
From the beginning he argued that Aitch was never going to trade its way out
of trouble and would need to build a few of its better businesses for sale.
In addition the banks would have to grant management three years grace to do
this.
Mr Green convinced the banks this was the right way forward. Following many
more hours of 'last minute hitches', Hill Samuel and FennoScandia have taken
a 9.9 per cent stake, while the new management has nearly 17 per cent.
As the group emerges from the restructuring, Mr Green says profitability of
all four of Aitch's labels will rise and that unprofitable businesses have
been sold.
Northern Ireland now fulfils almost nothing but contract orders of shirts,
the branded business is almost solely supplied from imports.
There remains, however, the matter of a Pounds 8.2m deficit on shareholders'
funds as of last November, after taking into account sales of businesses and
the conversion of bank debt in to equity.
To climb out from under this weight and return to the dividend list, Aitch
will almost certainly have to build one of its remaining businesses and then
sell it. Only then can its employees in Lurgen be certain they will not go
the way of the employees at Coats Viyella.

BURGER KING, the Grand Metropolitan fast food subsidiary, is selling its
in-house distribution business to the Canadian-based ONEX Corporation for an
estimated Dollars 100m (Pounds 58.1m).
Burger King Distribution Services distributes food and paper products to all

for the worldwide business.
Mr Barry Gibbons, Burger King's chief executive, said the BKDS sale was
another step in Burger King's strategy of focusing on building the global
Burger King brand. It follows the appointment last week of Restaurant
Services (RSI), a joint venture with US franchisees, as sole purchasing
agency in the US.
BKDS employs 1,500 people and operates 21 distribution centres throughout
the US.
Mr Gerald Schwartz, president and chief operating officer of ONEX, said: 'We
see significant North American and international growth opportunities with
Burger King'.

BIH will make a cash payment of DM40m (Pounds 14m) to IBH together with

In addition, as a consequence of the settlement, BIH will be entitled to
file a claim of DM40m in the bankruptcy of IBH. Its receiver has indicated
that this may give rise to an unsecured dividend of some 15 per cent of the

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible pins its hopes on the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the industrial materials maker that yesterday reported
profits up 3 per cent last year, is in an enviable position as the US begins
to edge out of recession.
With 45 per cent of its profits deriving from North America, the company is
confident it can ride the economic recovery that should be emerging by the
time President Bush seeks re-election later this year.
While continental Europe is a possible problem area, with recession at least
a possibility, Morgan should enjoy the benefits of its decision 10 years ago
to reduce its reliance on the UK and to spread into world markets.
Shareholders would be forgiven, however, for wondering if Morgan might not
spring yet another rights issue for more acquisitions. Last April's Pounds
96m rights issue was dropped on a market still digesting a Pounds 79m call
some 10 months earlier.
While Morgan has not lost its appetite to acquire, it still has about half
the latest rights proceeds on deposit and Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive,
has said that unless something extraordinary happens, shareholders will not
be tapped again this year or in 1993.
Morgan is therefore left to enjoy, not only the interest on their pile but
the fruits of its four US acquisitions last year, all of which look as
though they will immediately enhance earnings.
In the absence of a faltering in US growth - an occurrence Mr Bush will do
his darndest to avoid - Morgan should make pre-tax profits of Pounds 71m
this year, giving earnings of 22p which put the shares on an undemanding
prospective multiple of 13.

FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem plunges to Pounds 3m and sheds
property side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MOWLEM, the UK construction group, yesterday continued the trend of
disappointing results from the sector and announced a sharp fall in profits
mainly due to poor figures from its scaffolding subsidiary SGB.
Mowlem also announced more than Pounds 20m of extraordinary and exceptional
provisions to cover its withdrawal from commercial property development and
the termination of two housing joint ventures, although it will continue its
wholly owned housing business John Mowlem Homes.
The company reported a pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 34m to Pounds 3m in
the year to December 31. This follows a more than 50 per cent fall at the
interim stage, when no provisions were made, from Pounds 18m to Pounds 7m.
But Sir Philip Beck, chairman, hoped for improved performances this year
from housing and tool hire. 'We're encouraged by the election and hope the
housing market will now begin to grow and lead to a recovery for the whole
construction industry,' he said.
Mowlem is recommending cutting its total dividend to 10.5p (21p), which is
uncovered, after a final dividend of 4.85p (15.35p). Analysts expected a
heftier dividend cut and the shares gained 13p to 148p on the news.
Turnover fell to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.52bn) due to lower sales from
contracting and scaffolding. Operating profits fell to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds
41.6m) after accounting for redundancy and restructuring costs of Pounds
5.2m.
Hardest hit was scaffolding, where operating profits dropped to Pounds 8.8m
(Pounds 37.7m) due to volume and margin pressure. Staff numbers have been
reduced by 25 per cent, taking about Pounds 8m out of overheads, and further
reductions are planned if volumes continue to fall.
Contracting increased operating profits to Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 5.9m). There
would have been no increase without Pounds 3m of bad debt charges in 1990.
The division's order book has continued to decline, to Pounds 700m from
about Pounds 1.1bn two years ago.
Sir Philip remained optimistic for London City Airport, in which Mowlem
holds a 90 per cent stake, despite uncertainty about the extension of the
Jubilee Line following property developer Olympia &amp; York's debt refinancing
talks.
Housebuilding was affected by recession throughout the sector and average
prices fell from Pounds 86,000 to Pounds 72,000. Nevertheless, the company
maintained sales of 400 units and the division returned to a profit of
Pounds 1.6m (loss Pounds 2.4m).
Net interest payable fell sharply to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 8.2m). Interest
receivable increased to Pounds 12.7m, helped by the proceeds of last year's
Pounds 46m rights issue.
Mowlem made exceptional provisions for losses of Pounds 7.2m, of which
Pounds 3m related to the termination of the joint venture property
developments. There was also a Pounds 2m deficit in the accounts of a French
subsidiary, which the company will seek to recover, and Pounds 2.2m of
previously concealed prior year losses. Mowlem refused to comment further,
saying the matter is sub judice.
The company is making an extraordinary provision, less taxation, of Pounds
13.3m to cover the withdrawal from commercial property. There was a loss per
ordinary share of 2.2p (earnings 23.7p).
Losses attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 15.4m
profit) and, combined with the interest bill, a Pounds 26.6m transfer from
reserves was needed.

FT  14 APR 92 / Russia gripped by power struggle: Cabinet members storm out
of Congress after taunts by Speaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Russia's reformist government hung in the balance last night as
its power struggle with the parliament reached its final stages.
Cabinet members stormed out of yesterday's session of the Congress of
People's Deputies after Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the ambitious parliamentary
Speaker, described the government as 'kids who lost their nerve'. Mr
Khasbulatov was taunting the government for its decision to quit unless
deputies gave it a vote of confidence and withdrew demands for increased
social spending, tax cuts and a continuation of subsidies for the energy
sector.
As ministers accused the Speaker of reneging on a compromise worked out with
parliamentary leaders on Sunday, talks resumed behind the scenes to try to
find a new agreement.
The stakes are high should they fail. If the government carries out its
threat - the resignation letter is lying on President Boris Yeltsin's desk -
the country faces yet another political upheaval and a new set of economic
promises. It would also face the possible withdrawal of a Dollars 24bn
western aid package announced only two weeks ago.
Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, said the bank would halt all financial assistance to Russia if
the reforms were postponed and sent a message to Moscow urging the
government to press on.
A suspension of western aid would further alienate a public exhausted by
political squabbling and the hardships of economic reforms already under
way.
Having damaged Mr Yeltsin's standing, the conservative parliament, elected
two years ago under an antiquated electoral system, could also find itself
in a political vacuum. In the absence of a developed parliamentary system
with strong parties, it is dependent on leaders such as Mr Yeltsin, who may
choose to dissolve parliament or go to the country with a referendum.
A furious Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, who has
masterminded the economic reforms which the west is pledging to help, said:
'We expected more responsibility from the deputies for the fate of the
country.'
In a four-page statement, Mr Gaidar said their demands were mutually
contradictory, hyper-inflationary and would cause the west to withdraw
assistance. Although his presence has proved decisive in swaying rebellious
deputies in the past, Mr Yeltsin stayed away from parliament yesterday,
letting it be known he would speak only at the end of the congress. This
suggested that Mr Yeltsin is still anxious to avoid confrontation.

FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: Short-term view is a threat to Britain's energy R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof IAN FELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Central Electricity Generating Board took its responsibilities for
pursuing generic R&amp;D in energy supply seriously, if a little heavy-handedly.
Its successors, as Clive Cookson points out (Technology: 'A shock to the
system', April 9), have abandoned this responsibility, no doubt with, as
always, the shareholders in mind. The power manufacturing industry is
equally bad; the result of kow-towing to the CEGB for many years and
expecting the CEGB to pay for any research they did.
So who is to be responsible for long-term R&amp;D in future; the regulator? He
has more than enough on his plate. The Department of Energy might have done,
but that, according to the Conservatives' manifesto, is to disappear into
the maw of Department of Trade and Industry.
We are in serious danger of becoming an offshore energy 'banana republic',
buying licences from European colleagues who have the good sense to take a
long-term view rather than rely on market-led, short-termism as an 'energy
strategy'.

FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: More qualified view of EC social security
entitlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PHILIPPA WATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I found your article 'Innocents Abroad' (April 3) most informative.
However, some statements made therein might be misinterpreted and should be
clarified.
First, the co-ordination of social security systems was achieved in 1958.
Consequently it is misleading to state that 'some progress' was made on the
co-ordination of social security systems in the early 1970s.
It is equally misleading to state, without qualification, that: 'A British
worker claiming unemployment benefit in France is entitled to the same
treatment as a Frenchman.'
To qualify for French unemployment benefit, such a worker would have to be
insured under French law immediately prior to becoming unemployed. In
addition, he would have to fulfil all the conditions for entitlement to this
benefit under French law.
An unemployed British worker who wishes to go to France to seek employment
has no right to French unemployment benefit but could have his UK benefit
exported to him there for a period of three months.
With respect to pensions, there is no obligation imposed upon the country of
origin of the migrant worker to pay a proportionate amount of his pension.
Still less does community law create a system of 'winners and losers'. The
system is designed to ensure that beneficiaries receive those benefits which
they and their employers have paid for. A pensioner gets, from each of the
member states in which he has been insured, a pension the amount of which is
calculated in accordance with the number of contributions he has paid under
the law of that state.
Your article might be interpreted as meaning that the pension entitlement of
a migrant worker is that of the country in which he retires regardless of
where he has worked.
Finally, while the portability of occupational welfare schemes is a problem,
it is not correct to state that 'efforts to harmonise such schemes were
scuppered last year by the EC'.
It is not the intention of the Community to harmonise either social security
or occupational welfare schemes. Its ambitions are confined to achieving the
portability of benefits, a matter which does not require harmonisation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You quite rightly drew attention in your editorial on 10 April ('A
deepening German crisis') to the difficulties the German government has in
responding quickly and effectively to rapidly changing economic
circumstances - to the disadvantage of Germany's partners in the EC. This
slow response is an inevitable result of the coalition government which has
meant that, in a number of respects, Germany has failed to deal with long
standing issues. For example, with little privatisation in the former West
Germany, the German tax payer continues to pour huge sums of money into
hopelessly inefficient coal mines (to enable them to provide unfair
competition with efficient British mines).
Your editorial analysis of Germany's paralysed political system failed to
identify one of the reasons for it - Chancellor Kohl's having to depend upon
the support of the Free Democrats in coalition. l know that your newspaper
has a strong predilection for proportional representation, but doesn't your
own editorial on April 10 undermine the case for it?

<TEXT>
Sir, Is there not a risk that Barclays and the other creditors of Olympia &amp;
York and Heron may allow a close professional relationship to sweeten the
terms of the debt reschedulings, leading to a further squeeze on the banks'
other customers, both borrowers and lenders? Since presumably there is no
automatic right to reschedule, it will be in the long-term interests of
those customers if the banks demand, in addition, some participation in the
equity or assets of those companies, even to the point of foreclosure, which
in itself could leave a salutary lesson for the next property boom.

FT  14 APR 92 / Personal View: Tipping the CAP to Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY JOSLING and STEFAN TANGERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big reason for the European Community's resistance to proposals by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt's director-general, for a compromise on agriculture
in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is fear that they
might force unacceptable changes in the CAP - in particular that they might
require cuts in support both to agriculture and to exports of farm products.
The Community is currently discussing internal reform of its agricultural
policies on the basis of the plan proposed by its farm commissioner, Mr Ray
MacSharry. There are concerns, however, that even these sweeping changes
might not be enough to meet the requirements of Mr Dunkel's draft.
Whether such fears are justified depends on the precise implications of the
Gatt proposals. We have estimated the development of EC prices and markets
under the MacSharry Plan, comparing it with the Dunkel proposal. The result
of our estimates, based on data used for the schedules the EC submitted to
the Gatt in March, is that the MacSharry Plan would easily allow the
Community to meet the constraints proposed by Mr Dunkel.
For example, EC wheat production would be reduced as a result of the price
cuts and the acreage set-asides included in the MacSharry package. At the
same time, lower prices would increase EC wheat use, in particular for feed.
This would lead to wheat exports well below the volume of subsidised exports
allowed under the Dunkel proposal. Equally, export subsidy expenditure would
remain safely below that allowed under the prospective Gatt agreement.
It may be more surprising that the total level of domestic support, as
measured by the so-called Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS), would also
remain comfortably within the Dunkel constraint, even if Mr MacSharry's
compensation payments to farmers were included.
This result is explained by the reduction in EC production under Mr
MacSharry's proposal. That reduction would lower aggregate assistance by
more than just the cut in prices. The compensation payments would cover only
the effects of price reduction. In addition, the EC has reduced its cereals
prices significantly since the base period for defining the Gatt constraints
(1986-88). Tariffication would also not be any threat, since the tariff
allowed under the Dunkel proposal would be more than sufficient to protect
the EC wheat price that results from the MacSharry Plan.
It is difficult, therefore, to understand why the EC thinks it should not
accept the agricultural agreement proposed by Mr Dunkel. Even with a
somewhat watered down version of the MacSharry Plan for CAP reform, it would
still have enough room for manoeuvre. Indeed, the Community should work
constructively towards a Gatt agreement that would be in line with its own
attempts to rationalise the CAP. The question of whether MacSharry's
compensation payments are included as allowable subsidies - the so-called
'green box' - is far less important than now appears in the negotiations.
At the same time, certain amendments could be made to the Dunkel proposal.
Since the constraint on domestic support will not bind a reformed CAP, the
EC could even take the initiative by proposing a cut in aggregate support
larger than the 20 per cent proposed by Mr Dunkel. As US agricultural
policies make heavy use of domestic subsidies, a larger cut in domestic
support would impose a more binding constraint on the US and so reduce the
EC's temptation to argue that US deficiency payments on exported produce
should be treated like export subsidies.
In addition, to leave a little time for the changes in agricultural policy
instruments that are required if they are to be more neutral in their
effects on production - and hence eligible for the green box - the latter
might be defined somewhat more generously for the first few years.
Thereafter, requirements for inclusion in the green box might be tightened.
Too tight a constraint on the volume of subsidised exports during the period
of adjustment would also be dangerous, since it would push governments
towards domestic supply control, this being a move away from, rather than
towards, a more market-oriented agriculture.
Both the MacSharry Plan and the Dunkel proposal can stand on their own
merits. The MacSharry Plan would correct some of the deficiencies of the
CAP. Meanwhile, the Dunkel proposal would begin the needed process of
integrating world agricultural trade into the global trading system.
The combination of the MacSharry Plan with the Dunkel proposal would
represent mutually reinforcing policies. The MacSharry Plan allows the
Community to accept a successful conclusion of the Gatt round. The EC should
welcome the chance now offered, rather than fear the constraints it appears
to impose.

FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: I Musici de Montreal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are now rather too many bands called I Musici, but the Montreal team
of that name deserve serious attention. Their conductor, the cellist Yuli
Turovsky, is an alumnus of Rudolf Barshai's Moscow Chamber Orchestra who
emigrated to Montreal in 1977; and with his violinist wife Eleonora as
leader, he has re-created something like the Barshai band in French Canada.
They are an exciting tonic.
It is usual for small, ambitious bands to claim extravagantly that their
members are 'all soloists', but Turovsky's players go a long way towards
making the claim good. Their second-violin boast no less pith and character
than their firsts (granted Mme Turovsky's flamboyant pre-eminence as
leader); their violas make a full-throated trio, and so do their celli and
bass.
In the programme I heard them deliver in Montreal recently, every player was
not only alert but brilliantly assured. It is hard to do justice to the
effect of such playing, vividly committed from top to bottom: try to imagine
a string band put together exclusively from eager prizewinners, every
man-jack determined not to waste a single note.
Britain has some excellent string orchestras, but I doubt if any could
easily muster the unhesitating, up-front attack of these Quebec players. It
may be to do with native tem-perament (French-Canadians are volatile where
English-Canadians play safe), but probably more to do with the Turovskys'
own vivid example. Even in Nielsen's pawky little Petite Suite these strings
were gutsy and unabashed, though clever, and in Barshai's arrangements of
some of Prokofiev's Visions fugitives (originally for piano) they achieved a
range of unnerving effects without a slip.
Like Barshai's original band they stood up in a semicircle to play, except
when accompanying Mendelssohn's Double Concerto - for violin and piano,
written when he was 14. Though they sounded slightly duller there, the fault
was surely Mendelssohn's: the part he allotted to the orchestra suggests
that his papa could not or would not afford a competent band. Even the
1st-movement recapitulation is assigned to the soloists alone, and that
sounds less like a bold stroke than a mere ruse for keeping the band
prudently silent.
Luckily we had not only Mme Turovsky's unstinting panache (reckless, even:
she overshot some high ledger-lines) but the pianist Marc-Andre Hamelin's
stylish bravura, in a part which seems not much more than second-fiddle
accompanying until the Finale, when young Mendelssohn indulges his pianistic
finger-fervour to the limit. Hamelin made the most of that, always with
rippling grace; and in Schoenberg's scathing, anti-Hitlerian Ode to Napoleon
his incisive piano contributions were vital.
There was more to the unusual success of Schoenberg's bitter Ode, however,
than Hamelin's sterling work. Turovsky chose to play it in the composer's
own 1944 version with string orchestra, much less discouragingly gritty than
his lean first draft for solo quartet (and piano); and Kevin McMillan
declaimed Byron's text with all the right lofty scorn, not a whit diminished
by his Canadian diction. For once, a piece that even dedicated
Schoenbergians find unappetising struck home with a ring of conviction. From
many honest performances in years past, I remember none that made so
convincing a case for the musical integrity of Schoenberg's diatribe.
This is a band worth hearing, and in October St John's ought to flatter
their lean, sinewy sound.
Visiting St John's, Smith Square, London, on 27 October

FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: Rossini on the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rossini the comic opera composer gets at least a measure of his due in
Britain; Rossini the creator of a treasure trove of serious operas is still
a largely unknown figure here. In particular, the nine that he wrote to
honour an eight-year attachment (1815-22) to the San Carlo theatre in Naples
represent terra incognita for our opera houses. In them, he experimented
with combinations of ornate vocal style and formal adventurousness that
brought increasingly powerful results.
Just how powerful was revealed during Friday's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert
performance (broadcast live on Radio 3) of Ermione by the Orchestra of the
Age of Enlightenment. Dating from (1819), this formed the mid-point of the
Neapolitan series. In Rossini's own day it was unsuccessful, never revised
or revived; until a 1977 Siena concert performance it had counted as a lost
work. On Friday it burst over a packed QEH with the force of a thunderclap;
noisy cheering greeted several of the numbers and ovations the finale.
It was, indeed, an extremely exciting performance - played and sung with
biting attack and limpid phrasing by the OAE and New Company Chorus, and
conducted with dazzling skill and fervent sympathy by Mark Elder. But beyond
all the individual pleasures it was the work itself that provided the
feeling of revelation: a high-wire mixture, perfectly balanced, of Classical
forms and Romantic passions that keeps the drama unfolding at fever pitch.
The raw material was Racine's Andromaque, from which the composer's regular
collaborator Tottola achieved an economical operatic text. Four principal
characters - the captive Trojan Andromache (mezzo), the king Pyrrhus
(tenor), his scorned fiancee Hermione (soprano) and her besotted admirer
Orestes (tenor) - weave a taut fabric of unrequited passion, fury, despair,
intrigue and treachery.
The tone of high drama is set in the overture, into which male choral voices
burst with bleak insistence. All the music blazes with controlled fury -
Gluckian in directness of declamation, Cherubinian in rhythmic drive, yet
purely Rossinian in its musical richness.
Surprising strokes of design, colouring and vocal com bination mark every
number; it is a long-ish work that on Friday felt short because of its
untamed urgency. The characters each emerge in the round, above all the
wildly unstable titular role (written for Rossini's muse Colbran); she is
not a lovable heroine - nor is this exactly a sweetly consoling work - but
she leaps into three-dimensional vividness.
That was certainly the impression left by the young Italian soprano Anna
Caterina Antonacci, making her British debut. She is an arresting figure
even on the concert platform, Magnani-like in darkly handsome profile and in
the mercurial change of facial expression. There were occasional rough
patches and raw details in her singing, but the overwhelming truthfulness
and intensity of the delivery tended to diminish their importance, and in
the finale Miss Antonacci's fusion of tone and word unleashed thrill upon
thrill.
The two high tenors, the electrifyingly trumpet-toned Bruce Ford (Orestes)
and the suavely stylish Keith Lewis (Pyrrhus), were excellently contrasted;
in the opera's few tender moments Judith Forst (Andromache) made skilful use
of her less compelling vocal means. All the smaller parts are important, and
here all were aptly taken; Jacek Laszczkowski (Pylades, another high tenor)
and Peter Sidhom (Phoenix, bass) particularly made their mark. I hope the
rumours of a Glyndebourne Ermione in the near future are well-founded.
* More Rossini at the Festival Hall on Sunday evening: the Stabat mater,
given by the Philharmonia and its chorus (both splendid) under Giuseppe
Sinopoli. Much more familiar Rossini, of course, but no less welcome:
indeed, in the wake of the coursing drama of Ermione, few works could be
better revived to show off the depth and seriousness of Rossini's final
compositional period.
It is a work Sinopoli conducts admirably. He captures both the chaste marble
contours and the sweetly ornate vocal details; his avoidance of
interpretative self-indulgence is refreshing.
The soloists - Maria Bayo (replacing June Anderson) Cecilia Bartoli, Justin
Lavender, Alastair Miles (replacing Simon Estes) - were all musicianly
Rossinians, not ideal in blend. The glorious Miss Bartoli sounded a mite
under form; the bright-edged tones of the Spanish soprano gave an
interesting lift to the 'Inflammatus'.
As concert-opener Sinopoli proposed a different sort of Italian music
entirely: Bruno Maderna's Quadrivium (1969), a linked series of glittering
modern-music mobiles for large, spatially disposed, percussion-dominated
orchestra. It is a composition of wit, brilliance and energy; Sinopoli
risked the ire of the large Sunday-night audience in programming it. All
praise to him]

For years the mass media have sucked up to yoof, not because the young are
more interesting than the old or have more money (generally they have less)
but because there are so many immature people in the advertising industry,
obsessed by yoof interests. Ads bring in the mazoola, so the advertising
people have dragged journalists along behind them and the result has been
the mindless rap culture of yoof which now surrounds us and bores us to
tears. But change is in the air. 'The Oldie' magazine is proving a success,
and today's 40 Minutes is about five couples, all over 65, who met and fell
in love (9.50 BBC2).
Earlier, Soul explores what seems to be a growing tendency for modern
science to encroach upon religion: studies of cosmology, evolution and the
human brain all seem to be edging into territory previously occupied by the
chaps with their collars on backwards (7.40 BBC2).
C4's increasingly impressive arts magazine, Without Walls first contributes
to the yoof craze with a tribute to Radio 1 on its 25th birthday, then
screens the last of Robert McKee's excellent lectures on film-making,
concentrating today on Ingmar Bergman.

FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: Gulf War Paintings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Keane's exhibition does nothing if not show that war sits uneasily with
the modern liberal conscience. Where once the concept of the just war might
have eased it a little - or at least accommodated some of the complexities
and contradictions of the lesser evil - we are today too cynical, or too
naive, to do other than respond to the immediate facts of death, destruction
and conspicuous waste. That such things should be brought to pass in the
name of political advantage can only make them worse.
The actuality of battle has become a commonplace on our television screens,
the analysis and recrimination under way before the last shot is fired. It
raises awkward questions: would Passchendael have been fought over as it
was, with Kate Adie in the trenches and the high command in the studio to
answer for gains and losses as they came in?
And what is the role of the artist in all this: the objective reporter of
events, or the no less objective monitor of his or her own subjective
experience and response? Or the polemicist, morally committed and
politically correct? The short answer is: any of these things and still the
artist, but a war-artist only in the first two respects. The trouble with
John Keane, on the evidence of these paintings made from the photographs he
took in the month he spent with the British Army in the Gulf, is that he
wants to be all three at once.
He may be a very good photographer, but he is not showing his photographs.
He was not, as I understand it, commissioned as a war-artist in the fashion
of the second world war, a supernumerary officer living and moving with the
army for the duration. Least of all was he a sometime combatant, as were so
many of the artists of the first world war. Keane, by contrast, was sent by
the Imperial War Museum and was evidently there on sufferance so far as the
Army was concerned, and was kept well behind the lines.
Even so, his experience of army life on active service was clearly
authentic, and, in the period before the battle especially, he produced
material that is objective enough. The best work is of this kind: a tank
under camouflage netting, for example, a soldier digging a trench, two
soldiers playing draughts to pass the time. But the larger portion of the
work has clear polemical intent, and this makes us ask whether Keane
approached his subject with an open, or at least a curious mind.
Once fighting began, Keane could only experience its awful aftermath. Only
once is his prejudice subverted, by the panic of a gas alert. The wry
portrait of himself struggling ham-fistedly into his protective suit, is the
best and most natural image of this phase. It is touching, funny in a
desperate way, and it rings true.
For the rest, we have the attitudinising of the cynical liberal mind,
convinced the whole wasteful, colossally expensive exercise was merely to
protect the oil interests of the West and of the US in particular, an
exercise in neo-colonial economic oppression.
How else can we gloss such titles as We are making a new world order, with
its sun-bespectacled soldier amid the debris of battle and blazing
oil-fields, or Mickey Mouse at the Front, with its supermarket trolley,
flaccid palm tree and implicit antagonism to all things American? And there
is the Death Squad, the body-bag detail with scarves wrapped tight against
the stench. Above all, there is the sequence Scenes on the Road to Hell, the
fleeing convoy caught and destroyed on the Basra Road.
There is nothing against an overt polemic, save only that it must escape its
limitations if it is to stand as art. We may think of Goya's Disasters of
War, but he kept his ironical distance, well knowing who the enemy was,
while making a more general and humane point. Again, we may make superficial
comparison between the desolation of Paul Nash's great canvas of The Menin
Road and Keane's New World Order: yet the one is distanced, impartial and
thus universal in its humanity, the other merely local, personal and
political.
As it happens, Sargent's once notorious painting, Gassed, of a string of
victims coming back from the front line, the blind leading the blind, hangs
in the neighbouring gallery. It too raises the question of when polemic
becomes propaganda, though avoiding the charge by its broader humanity. Also
next door, as part of the current Falklands display, is some of the work of
Linda Kitson, Keane's immediate predecessor in the commission, her brisk and
personal reportage, drawn on the spot, a direct contrast to his more
predetermined approach.
Keane is an interesting and able artist, though inclined to allow his
facility to run away with him. He would rather hurry and produce too much,
as here, it seems, than confirm and resolve too little. His greater problem,
perhaps, is philosophical: he hardly knows which side he is on.
John Keane: Gulf. Imperial War Museum, Lambeth Road SE1, to May 31.

Tarmac, Britain's biggest building materials and construction group, has
taken a further step in strengthening its board. Sir John Banham (right),
the retiring director general of the Confederation of British Industry, and
Sir Anthony Gill (far right), chairman and chief executive of Lucas
Industries, have been appointed non-executive directors.
The move to add two well-connected names to the board comes just two months
after the 58-year-old Sir Eric Pountain, Tarmac's chairman for the past 13
years, handed over the chief executive's baton to Neville Simms, 47, head of
the group's construction division.
Although there are several non-executive directors on the Tarmac board,
there has been a feeling in some circles that it could do with some
rejuvenation. The Duchess of Devonshire and Sir Nicholas Henderson, the two
outgoing non-executives, are both in their 70s and have been on the board
since the early 1980s.
Sir John, 51, became director general of the CBI in 1987 after four years as
controller of the Audit Commission. Sir Anthony, 62, who has headed Lucas
since 1987, joins the board with immediate effect. Sir John's appointment
takes effect from July when he steps down from the CBI and will also join
Sir Anthony as a non-exec at National Power.

FT  14 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Fayed disciplinary decision stands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGINA v PANEL ON TAKEOVERS AND MERGERS, EX PARTE FAYED AND OTHERS
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Scott and Lord Justice
Steyn): April 3 1992
A PERSON who is subject to disciplinary proceedings by the Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers has no legitimate expectation that the Panel will
await the outcome of pending litigation against him before conducting those
proceedings; and the court will not intervene to halt the proceedings if
there is no arguable case that they would be likely to prejudice the conduct
or trial of the litigation.
The Court of Appeal so held when refusing an application by Mr Mohammed Al
Fayed and his two brothers for leave to apply for judicial review of a
decision of the Take-Over Panel not to adjourn disciplinary proceedings
brought against the Fayed's by the Panel executive.
LORD JUSTICE NEILL said that in November 1984 the Fayed brothers acquired a
29.9 per cent stake in House of Fraser Ltd, through a subsidiary of their
Liechtenstein company.
The subsidiary, which changed its name to House of Fraser (Holdings), bought
the shares from Lonrho plc.
Lonrho had for some time been attempting to acquire control of House of
Fraser but had not been able to complete the purchase because of an
undertaking given to the secretary of state for industry not to acquire more
than 30 per cent pending determination of a reference to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
On March 4 1985, Holdings announced a cash offer for the balance of the
House of Fraser share capital.
Under the rules in the City Code on Take-Overs and Mergers, an offeror who
already held 29.9 per cent of the shares in a company was not permitted to
acquire shares in the market until seven days after announcement of the bid.
On March 11, Holdings bought sufficient shares in the market to bring its
holding to more than 50 per cent.
On March 14, the secretary of state announced that the merger would not be
referred to the MMC. As a result, Holdings was able to acquire House of
Fraser by the end of March.
On March 10 1987, Lonrho issued a writ against the Fayeds, Holdings and some
of their advisers.
It alleged that Holdings and the Fayeds induced the secretary of state to
refrain from referring the proposed acquisition to the MMC by means of false
and fraudulent representations about themselves and their background and
their source of finance. It claimed for the lost opportunity to acquire
House of Fraser by bidding for the shares without competition, and sought
damages for interference with business by unlawful means.
On April 9 1987, DTI inspectors were appointed to investigate the affairs of
Holdings, and to look at the circumstances surrounding acquisition of the
shares.
On July 23 1988, the inspectors reported to the secretary of state. On March
7 1990, the report was published. It was severely critical of the Fayeds,
and attracted publicity.
In January 1991, the director-general of the Panel wrote to Mr Fayed stating
that the report contained evidence which suggested there might have been
breaches of General Principle 12 of the City Code. He said the Panel was
focusing on the content of three press releases, and the offer document of
March 23 1985.
General principle 12 was that 'any document . . . addressed to shareholders
containing information . . . shall . . . be treated with the highest
standards of care and accuracy'.
On November 1, the date for the disciplinary hearing was agreed for December
6.
On November 11, Mr Fayed's solicitors raised the possibility that they would
seek an adjournment on the ground that the Panel's finding might prejudice
their clients' position in the 1987 litigation. They said they understood
the Panel's practice was to defer action until litigation was resolved.
On November 15 the Panel's secretary replied.
In paragraph two, his letter said there was no established practice which
automatically required the executive to defer action on potential breaches
of the Code until litigation was resolved, and that each case was determined
on its facts.
He said in the light of publication of the inspectors' findings, the
executive did not consider that a ruling by the Panel would prejudice the
Fayeds' position in the litigation.
The application for an adjournment was heard by the Panel on December 6 and
was refused. An appeal was dismissed by the appeal committee on December 18.
The Fayeds issued High Court proceedings seeking leave to apply for judicial
review. The application was dismissed.
On the present application for leave, the Fayeds' primary argument was that
the disciplinary proceedings should be adjourned until after the hearing of
the 1987 action.
The action would probably be heard early in 1994.
Mr Oliver for the Fayeds submitted that conduct and trial of the 1987 action
would be prejudiced if the disciplinary proceedings were not adjourned.
He argued inter alia that the Fayeds would be denied a legitimate
expectation based on an extract from the Panel's 1977 annual report, which
said: 'The Panel would normally consider it inappropriate to pursue an
investigation into the conduct of parties to a takeover or merger at a time
when that conduct is the subject of legal proceedings . . .'
It was said the Fayeds had a legitimate expectation that that policy would
be followed unless good reasons showed the case was exceptional, and that
there was no such reason.
The argument was flawed for a number of reasons:
(a) A general statement of the kind made in the extract from the 1977 report
could not by itself give rise to a legitimate expectation of anything. The
statement was at large and not directed to any particular group.
(b) The Panel was free to change its practice at any time without notice.
The legitimate expectation doctrine could not be used to restrict its right
to adopt what it considered the proper practice in the individual case.
(c) 'Legitimate expectation' was a particular manifestation of the duty to
act fairly. In the present case, where there were no binding rules to be
observed, a legitimate expectation could amount to no more than a right to
be treated fairly.
(d) The Panel's executive had, in fact, given a reason for not following the
'usual practice' in paragraph two of the secretary's letter of November 15
1991.
The court could intervene to prevent injustice where continuation of one set
of proceedings might prejudice the fair trial of another. But it was a power
which had to be exercised with great care, and only where there was a real
risk of serious prejudice which might lead to injustice.
There was no arguable case that there was any real risk to the conduct of
the 1987 action or to the fairness of the trial.
There were no arguable grounds for judicial review.
The application for leave for dismissed.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT concurring, accepted that generally a tribunal carrying
out a quasi-judicial function ought not to depart in an individual case from
its general rules of procedure without good reason. That proposition was
based not on 'legitimate expectation' but on the principle that a tribunal
ought in general apply the same procedural rules to similar cases unless
justified by some good reason.
The Fayeds and their advisers had known all along the reasons relied on,
namely the absence of any real risk of prejudice to the outcome of the 1987
action.
There had been no failure of due process and the Panel's departure from
normal practice did not constitute an arguable case for judicial review.
LORD JUSTICE STEYN also concurring, said the 1977 policy statement amounted
to no more than a general policy guideline. The decision whether
disciplinary proceedings should await the outcome of civil proceedings or
precede it was a matter for the unfettered discretion of the Panel.
For the Fayeds: David Oliver QC and Paul Goulding (Herbert Smith).
For the Panel: Timothy Wormington (Freshfields).

FT  14 APR 92 / People: Salomon takes gilt from Greenwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon Brothers International, on a drive to increase its share of the
gilts market, has hired 28-year-old Michael Brook, one of Greenwell Montagu
Gilt-Edged's top young salesmen as an assistant director on the gilt-edged
team.
While Salomon's gilts operation suffered after the US treasury bond rigging
scandal last year, the US investment house claims now to be rebuilding
successfully, and says it is poised to make effective use of the vastly
increased supply of gilts expected over coming months.
Bob Pearce, head of gilt sales, says of Brook: 'Money is not the over-riding
thing in this appointment. It is more the potential for career development;
if you subscribe to the idea of convergence of European bond markets on the
way to a single currency, you have to believe there will be an increasing
amount of cross-market activity. Ours is a shop where you can take full
advantage of that (because of the strong presence in other European
markets).'
Brook's departure is another blow for Greenwells which, as well as last
year's senior defections, has just lost two other gilts salesmen to Goldman
Sachs. While Greenwell's parent Midland denies that these moves will affect
its position in the marketplace, attempts to capitalise on its gilts
strength so as to develop a flourishing European bond business have so far
come to little.

FT  14 APR 92 / People: Rada's hands-off experience for Digital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'What specific experience do you have that qualifies you for this job?' If
that standard question had been put at an interview to the man just
appointed as Digital Equipment's European director of strategy, he would
have answered in one word: 'None.'
Chilean-born Dr Juan Rada, who is to take up the post on May 1 at the age of
40, has never held a full-time industrial job. His previous career has been
in management education, culminating in the director-generalship of the IMD
international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was also
professor of technology management.
'I've nevertheless worked with industry a lot, not least Digital itself,' he
says. 'And being director-general of the school involved me very much in
line-management work, including a merger.'
IMD was formed in 1988-89 by amalgamating Geneva's IMI school with the IMEDE
school in Lausanne. Oddly enough, Digital Europe's president and chief
executive Pier Carlo Falotti is chairman of IMD's advisory council.
'We've been friends for years,' adds Rada who will work closely with Falotti
as his director of strategy and new initiatives, based in Geneva. 'He's a
man who practises management as I've learned it needs to be - a process of
coaching your people to apply their own ideas and supporting them, as
opposed to just bossing them around.'
As for IMD, it is being run for the time being by Professor Xavier Gilbert
while a committee looks for Rada's replacement. 'I hear they have some very
good candidates,' he says.

FT  14 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When bankers talk in
mumbo-jumbo - Charles Batchelor reads between the lines of credit reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just three weeks after one of John James' haulage companies started doing
business with a new customer, the customer's bank pulled the plug and John
James was left with a bad debt of Pounds 21,000.
What was particularly galling was the fact that James had only started doing
business on the basis of a favourable reference from the customer's bank.
'I felt very aggrieved,' says James, chairman of Star Cargo, a Harpenden,
Hertfordshire-based transport group. 'We had asked for a bank reference to
cover Pounds 30,000 and the bank had said that the customer was acceptable.'
An exchange of letters with the bank's legal department gave no
satisfaction. 'The bank said it had no liability and suggested in so many
words that we go away,' recalls James. He believes that banks should
compensate customers when the time between a reference and the company
failing is very short.
Star Cargo's experience highlights a long-standing unease among businesses
about the value of bank references. The ferocity of the present recession
has meant that the 'shelf-life' of a reference may be very limited.
'There is often a short time-scale in business closure which can catch bank
and trade creditors unawares,' comments Pat Oakley, in charge of Lloyds
Bank's small business division. Lloyds is currently reviewing its procedures
for providing references.
'There is a degree of dissatisfaction among our members about bank
references,' says Dave Harrop, a spokesman for the Forum of Private
Business, a small business lobby group. 'On their own, bank references are
pretty unreliable.'
Among the complaints which business organisations voice about bank
references are:
They are couched in such oblique terms that, at best, they provide a very
limited view of the customer's position. At worst they mislead the inquirer.
The neutral terminology employed by the banks is used to protect their
customers' reputations and the banks' own legal position.
'The banks use mumbo-jumbo which can be misleading for those who don't
understand the terminology,' says Peter Allen, chairman of the Institute of
Credit Management. 'If they used modern-day language, it would make them
think more about the references they give.'
Businesses believe that bank managers face a conflict of interest which
means they cannot be fully honest about their customers. 'Banks don't like
to give a bad reference because sooner or later, the client will find out,'
says Allen.
'It is difficult,' acknowledges Bruce Kelsall, head of marketing
communications at Barclays Bank. 'You have to be careful not to say
something which is detrimental to the interests of the customer. There is a
delicate line between honesty and that.'
Bank managers are sometimes kept in ignorance of their customers' financial
difficulties. 'One of the last people the businessman wants to alienate is
his bank manager,' comments Philip Mellor, spokesman for Dun &amp; Bradstreet
International, a credit rating and business information group.
A bank reference is, strictly speaking, only valid at the time when it is
given, although a business is normally expecting to trade for several months
with the customer who is the subject of the inquiry. 'It is purely there for
that day. It is a snapshot,' says Lloyds Bank's Pat Oakley.
This limited view of the validity of the bank's opinion not only contrasts
with the expectations of the average business; it does not reflect the
banks' own expectations when seeking references on their own behalf. 'When
we take references for our own purposes, we would update them every six
months,' says Barclays' Bruce Kelsall. 'We would advise our customers to do
the same.'
The banks will accept no responsibility for the opinion they give.
References are unsigned (though they are given on bank headed notepaper) and
carry a disclaimer that they are 'without any guarantee or responsibility on
the part of this bank or its officials'.
Clam-Brummer, an east London manufacturer of industrial adhesives, says one
of its customers was put into receivership by its bank six days after the
bank had provided a satisfactory reference. Unfortunately, Clam-Brummer had
already made a Pounds 1,000 delivery.
It continues to use bank references on new customers as a rough filter to
weed out the unscrupulous customer but places more reliance on trade
references, says Jane Lyon, managing director.
But bank references do offer a number of advantages:
They are often the only way of checking up on the newly-started business or
the small, unincorporated business which has yet to attract the attention of
the credit reference agencies.
If the bank manager has good contacts with his customer, he may have more
up-to-date information than a credit reference agency which will only update
its files on smaller companies relatively infrequently.
They are either free or relatively cheap. TSB charges a Pounds 6 fee (plus
VAT) to inquirers; Barclays Pounds 6.50; and Lloyds Pounds 7. However
businesses which make extensive use of bank references can run up sizeable
bills. Star Cargo makes between 100 and 300 inquiries a week and spent
Pounds 10,000 in a recent quarter.
Bank references owe much of their continuing popularity to the limitations
of the alternative methods. Trade references are preferred by many companies
but they, too, are subject to manipulation. A company will only suggest
referees which it knows will give a favourable report. A back-up telephone
call can, however, fill in gaps and probe any inconsistencies.
Credit rating agencies provide a comprehensive service with a frequently
exhaustive wealth of assessments of company performance. But despite the
protestations of the agencies that they update their files regularly, many
businesses suspect that much of their information, based on accounts filed
at Companies House, is out of date.
A credit agency reference is also more expensive than a bank reference. Dun
&amp; Bradstreet says a one-off request for information would cost Pounds 45
plus VAT, though the average cost to a subscriber would be nearer Pounds 25.
D&amp;B does however also operate a more basic telephone inquiry line known as
Dunsvoice which costs Pounds 8 per call.
Despite the more thorough and impartial reports provided by the credit
rating agencies, the bank reference has retained a role. It provides a cheap
and speedy check on customers but should not be relied on as the only source
of information.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
BANK-SPEAK: WHAT THE REFERENCES REALLY MEAN
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Banks' terms
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Undoubted'                       Highest praise. Not too common
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Highly respectable'              Indication that applicant is sound and
                                  further inquiries not necessary
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Respectable ..'                  Usually qualified as below
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Respectable - considered         Satisfactory
 good for your inquiry'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Respectable but unable to        Satisfactory but never tried to the
 speak for your figure'           limit requested, ie. unknown
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Figures larger than we           Pause. Check further. Biting off a bit
 expected to see'                 much
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Unable to speak for              Damning. (Or else a new account - in
 your inquiry'                    which case why was this bank given as
                                  a reference?'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
You should always
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Specify a figure
 -Use a figure at lease 100 per cent more than necessary
 -Beware if bank reply does not use adjectives such as 'honest',
  'respectable', 'trustworthy', or similar

small businesses have suffered cash flow problems as a result of being owed
money but only 20 per cent take action to pursue this money within 10 days,
according to a survey* by REL Consultancy Group.
More than half waited until the money was at least two weeks overdue before
making contact with the debtor while three quarters continued supplying
customers who were at least 30 days late.
Half of the respondents to the survey never employed a third party such as a
debt collection agency to recover a debt.

FT  14 APR 92 / Technology: Coming soon to a screen near you - Steven Butler
explains how the old-fashioned picture tube is fighting for life against
liquid crystal displays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the great inventions of the 20th century, the cathode ray tube (CRT),
is heading towards obsolescence. The challenger in the vast and constantly
growing market for television and computer screens is liquid crystal.
The quality of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens - which are thin, flat
and portable - has leapt forward in recent years. Sharp, the Japanese
electronics company, sold the world's first calculators with LCD screens in
1973. After nearly two decades of research and development, however, LCD
panels on personal computers are still seen as a poor substitute for the
CRT.
Yet this view is quickly becoming outdated. Sharp is now marketing 8.6-inch
colour televisions in Japan with brilliant colours and fast response. NEC
last year began marketing portable computers with full-colour LCD screens
using the most sophisticated thin film transistor (TFT) technology, in which
contrast and response time are boosted by adding a transistor to each
display cell or pixel. IBM recently announced a similar product.
While brightness and the restricted viewing angle on LCD screens need to be
improved, the quality of these screens will gradually change the popular
perception that LCD is a second-rate technology. Even more important,
manufacturing yields on high-end products for this extremely difficult
device are beginning to approach respectability, raising the prospect of a
classic virtuous circle in new product technology. As yields rise,
manufacturing costs and prices are dropping rapidly. This in turn is
stimulating growth in the market, which again encourages more investment,
improved technology and lower prices still.
Japanese companies, the only significant producers, are talking about a
quadrupling of the market in a few years, compared with 1991 production of
Y255bn. Last year production grew by 40 per cent, compared with 33 per cent
average growth in the past five years. LCD screens have become one of the
few bright spots in an otherwise dull outlook for the electronics industry.
Few people, other than television picture tube manufacturers, will mourn the
decline of the CRT. Anyone who has gone home bleary-eyed after spending the
day staring into the flickering display of a personal computer knows why it
needs to go. The flickering may be faster than the eye can perceive, but it
still causes fatigue. The latest LCD screens, by contrast, display a solid,
sharp image that holds steady.
Worries about electromagnetic radiation fields surrounding the CRT, and its
effect on pregnant women, will also hasten its demise for many uses. CRTs
are bulky, heavy, use lots of electricity and cannot be made perfectly flat,
unlike LCD panels. Yet in spite of its drawbacks, the CRT will not be easy
to replace because the technology is so well established.
In the past year electronics giants such as Sharp, Matsushita, NEC, Canon,
and Toshiba and IBM (in a joint venture) have joined a race to meet growing
demand by committing hundreds of millions of dollars to manufacture colour
LCD screens.
Liquid crystals, which display properties of both solids and liquids, were
first discovered in 1888, but it was not until 1963 that scientists at RCA,
the US electronics group, discovered the principle that lies behind all LCD
displays: that an electrical charge causes liquid crystal molecules to
realign and rechannel light waves.
In simple LCD devices, known as twisted nematic (TN), liquid crystal
molecules are held in a double sandwich of polarising filters and glass
plates. The filters sit on the outside of the sandwich and are turned at 90
degrees, which blocks light passing straight through the glass.
The liquid crystal, however, is also aligned at 90 degrees by grooves in the
glass. This causes the light to twist and the filters to be neutralised. But
when electricity is applied to the liquid crystal, the molecules straighten
and the light is again blocked by the filter. The end result is that display
cells can be made to lighten or darken as their opaqueness is switched off
or on by electricity.
Unfortunately, however, when a display is increased in size the contrast
between dark and light areas of the screen tends to decline. To compensate
for this, LCD makers have sought to increase the twisting effect and thereby
heighten contrast as light is refracted.
In 'super twisted' nematic displays (STN) light is twisted by between 180
and 260 degrees, producing the blue screens familiar to portable and laptop
computer users. In 'double super twisted' nematic (DSTN) displays, two STN
cells are used, twisting the light one direction and then back, so that
light of high contrast is possible.
In a final variation of this theme, 'triple super twisted' nematic (TSTN),
refracting polymer film is applied to the STN cell, allowing thinner
displays with a high degree of contrast, thus permitting colour display when
red-blue-green filters are attached to the cells.
These elaborations on the simple LCD mechanism, however, have a range of
shortcomings. While the TN contrast ratio of 1:6 is increased to 1:20 for
TSTN, this is still insufficient to reproduce the entire range of colours
familiar in a colour picture tube. Furthermore, response times of 150
milliseconds are insufficient to keep up with moving video images, and
cannot track a mouse moving across a screen.
In answer to these shortcomings, the industry is moving in two directions.
Most companies are improving displays by adding a tiny transistor to each
cell in order to increase the charging power. This technology, called thin
film transistor, boasts a contrast ratio of 1:100, allowing for full-colour
displays and response times fast enough for video display. The result,
however, is a device of staggering complexity, including at least 10 layers
of materials, finely etched circuitry, and transistors that are shorted out
by a microscopic speck of dust.
Canon, the camera and office equipment company, is moving in a different
direction, using a proprietary technology that is likely to grab a big
section of the market for engineering workstations and desktop publishing.
Canon's 'ferroelectric' displays use a liquid crystal material which
responds more quickly to electrical charges. The molecules are more
difficult to align and control than normal liquid crystal chemicals, yet
after solving these problems Canon has developed a screen that has higher
contrast and faster response times than other simple matrix systems. The
screen also promises to be much cheaper to mass produce than TFT screens
because no transistors are required.
The relative sensitivity to shock of ferroelectric displays makes them
unsuitable for portable computers, however, and the response time is
insufficient for video. Colour reproduction is also inferior to TFT,
although photographs can be displayed with sufficient fidelity to allow easy
computer editing.
Yet the remarkable high quality and stability of the display - looking
almost like printed paper behind glass - could make it the biggest threat
yet to the CRT in offices. Indeed, when Canon finishes a new manufacturing
facility in 1994, it will enter the market at the high end, with 15-inch
screens which it hopes eventually to sell at a price similar to that of the
CRT.
The CRT looks likely to prevail for TV picture tubes larger than 15 or so
inches. This is because large LCD screens are still too difficult to make.
But beyond 36 inches LCD once again comes into its own as the core of video
projection devices, including high-definition television.
Yet the technology for LCD has been evolving so rapidly that it is difficult
to project how the market will develop. Research into a range of radically
different approaches to flat panel displays is also continuing apace. The
inherent complexity of LCD manufacture, has raised fears that it could be
made obsolete quickly by a simpler technology.
The investment by electronics companies into LCD manufacturing facilities is
an impressive sign that the technology has come of age. This commitment by
the industry itself should help the market to become established quickly.
A further article on LCD technology, addressing the manufacturing
challenges, will appear on Thursday.

FT  14 APR 92 / Technology: Making virtual reality a certainty - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A handful of laboratories around Britain, strangely garbed figures
gesticulate into empty space. They are experimenting with 'virtual reality',
an advanced form of computer simulation which many believe could make a
profound contribution to most activities where humans interact with computer
systems.
Leisure, in the form of advanced video games, is an obvious application.
Education, training and scientific research are other possibilities.
But virtual reality does itself no favours with a name redolent of science
fiction and alien worlds. The apparatus needed to make it work serves also
to drive a wedge between VR evangelists and other people. This may be the
most difficult barrier to finding general acceptance and support for a
technology which could prove as important as Apple Computer's windows and
mice in demystifying data processing.
A helmet must be worn bearing 'accelerometers' which calculate where the
eyes are looking; a pair of miniature television screens beam the correct
image directly into the eyes. A heavily wired glove must be worn to allow
tactic sensations - the feeling of moving a molecule from one site to
another like balls or a snooker table, perhaps, or holding a ray gun to zap
imaginary opponents.
W Industries, a UK-based leader in VR, calls its helmet the 'visette', its
tactile device the 'space stick' and its VR computer 'expality'.
Stripped of the science fiction aura, however, VR is simply a kind of
sophisticated computer simulation in which the UK seems especially skilled.
Well-established software houses like Admiral, for example, build
traditional simulators to train the pilots of the British and foreign air
forces.
The five-year old W Industries, founded by Jonathan Waldern and based in
Birmingham, took a year to build its first arcade game and now has 170 units
installed worldwide at more than Pounds 25,000 a system. The Trocadero
Centre in London's West End houses a number of examples of 'Virtuality', as
Waldern describes his creation. It has been funded to the tune of Pounds
2.4m by Apax Partners with a view to flotation in three years.
Division, a tiny company formed in 1989 by a group of researchers in
parallel processing, has signed an agreement with International Business
Machines to develop a computer-aided design workstation based on VR. The
idea will be to take in patterns from existing computer-aided design systems
and convert them into three-dimensional worlds.
Hull University, meanwhile, has appointed Europe's first university chair in
VR. Roy Kalawsky, a chief engineer at British Aerospace, has been appointed
visiting professor of virtual reality environments.
The astonishing thing about VR is how inexpensive it has become to create
advanced simulators. Division's transputer-based parallel processing system
starts at Pounds 30,000. W Industries's arcade machines are based on
Commodore Amiga personal computers.
The interface hardware, however, is primitive. You can call a wired helmet
and glove a visette and spacestick but it is still a cumbersome way to
communicate with a computer. The analogy has to be with the earliest
computers when the teletype was the only way to input or retrieve
information. Inevitably, there will be improvements.
The real secret of VR lies in the software. W Industries is building a
library of games to add to its jump jet, space battle and stock car racing
simulators.
Division is trying to create a new way of communicating with the computer
for as whole range of activities from business statistics to pharmaceutical
research.
Companies like Microsoft have garnered a fortune from computer interfaces a
hundredth the sophistication of what W Industries and Division are trying to
achieve. VR could be the UK's toehold in tomorrow's computing. It would be
sad if its real significance was trivialised by hyperbole and futuristic
glitter.

FT  14 APR 92 / New phase in IRA campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOMB attack on Staples Corner in north London, one of Britain's busiest
road junctions, marks a new phase in the IRA's campaign against the
capital's transport system, Richard Tomkins writes.
Earlier attacks have involved relatively small devices on the London
Underground or at main British Rail stations.
Hitting a key element of the trunk road network disrupts the journeys of a
much wider cross-section of the public, including many business and
industrial road users. The sheer size of the explosion means disruption not
just for hours or days, but for weeks and possibly months.
The explosion took place at the point where the M1 motorway and A5 trunk
road, two of the main traffic arteries to the north, disgorge their traffic
into the London road system.
As well as blowing a crater in the Staples Corner roundabout, the force of
the explosion went upwards and stripped concrete off the reinforced
box-girder bridge carrying the A5 over the junction. Highway engineers
believe it may be possible to repair the bridge by recladding it with
concrete, but are unlikely to reach a final verdict on the feasibility of
this until after Easter. Meanwhile, the bridge and half the roundabout
remain closed and traffic congestion is severe.
The difficulty in preventing a recurrence is that access to roads is even
more open than it is to the railways and the Tube. The only grounds for
suspicion may be that a vehicle is unlawfully parked. But as Scotland Yard

FT  14 APR 92 / Severn Bridge tolls to rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOLLS on the Severn Bridge, which connects England and Wales along the M4
motorway, are to rise on April 26, but will be levied only on traffic
entering Wales. The new rates are Pounds 2.80 for a car, Pounds 5.60 for
small goods vehicles and Pounds 8.40 for heavy goods vehicles and buses - up
from Pounds 1 for a car and Pounds 2 for all other vehicles.
The tolls will rise on January 1 each year by 6 per cent plus the annual
rise in the retail price index. With inflation at the present level, the
cost for a car will be Pounds 4.60 in five years and Pounds 6.10 by the turn
of the century.
On April 26, responsibility for the bridge will pass from the Department of
Transport to a company, Severn River Crossing, which is owned by John Laing,
GTM-Entrepose of France, Bank of America and Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
SRC is to build and operate the Pounds 300m second crossing of the Severn,
three miles downstream from the present bridge, due to open in 1996.

FT  14 APR 92 / Fresh approach urged for education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN END to the 'vivisection approach' to education policy, and a greater
willingness by parents to pay for school improvements, were yesterday urged
by the leader of a teaching union, Andrew Adonis writes.
Mrs Heather Ryan, president of the AMMA, told her union's annual conference
in Birmingham that teachers had 'been forced to breaking point' by the
government's 'muddled planning and impossible targets, rigidly imposed
without thought'.
She added: 'Politicians and Civil Service advisers have approached education
like vivisectionists, using schools as laboratories for doctrinaire
curriculum, assessment and funding techniques, squeezing the life and
creativity out of the education service.'
Mrs Ryan said AMMA, the third-largest teachers' union, would fight to retain
coursework in the GCSE exam and to secure a general teaching council for
England and Wales that would 'give teachers a right to influence government
on key issues on which we have the authority of our hard-won professional
expertise'.

LEADERS OF RMT, the transport union, said yesterday it would ballot its
members at London Underground over industrial action in protest at plans to
change working practices and cut up to 5,000 jobs.
The union said the ballot would be over the principle of management refusing
to deal with change through the bargaining procedures.
It added that London Underground was trying to bring in the changes through
piecemeal measures.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the union, had given London Underground
a deadline of 4pm yesterday to make changes to the way it is introducing its
new Company Plan. In a letter to London Underground, Mr Knapp had asked for
a written undertaking that it 'immediately reverse all initiatives' already
taken to change working conditions.
London Underground, which ignored the deadline, said it was trying to agree
negotiating machinery which would be as local as possible. It said some
changes to management grades which the union was objecting to fell outside
the union's remit.

FT  14 APR 92 / Air traffic stages modest recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK AIR traffic staged a very modest recovery in the first quarter of this
year after last year's slump caused by the Gulf war and the economic
recession.
Passenger traffic at airports in the south-east run by BAA, the airports
operator, increased by 19 per cent to 13.6m passengers in the first quarter,
against 11.4m in the same period last year at the height of the Gulf
conflict.
The BAA figures, published yesterday, show traffic increased by barely 1 per
cent compared with the first quarter of 1990. Passenger traffic last month
rose 12 per cent on March last year and was flat compared with March 1990.
The small recovery in passenger numbers compared with 1990 reflects the
continuing impact of the recession. Traffic at London's Heathrow airport has
shown the strongest improvement, but Gatwick is still struggling to recover
former passenger levels.
Traffic at Heathrow increased to 9.5m in the first quarter of this year from
7.7m in the same period last year and 9.2m in 1990. In contrast traffic at
Gatwick totalled 3.7m passengers in the first quarter of this year compared
with 3.5m last year and 4m in 1990.
Apart from the recession, Gatwick was hit by several airlines' decision to
transfer operations to Heathrow after the government last year scrapped
London air-traffic rules and opened access into Heathrow to all carriers.
Food at Heathrow has made impressive improvements during recent months,
while food at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris is 'disastrous' and
'abysmal', according to a report by Mr Egon Ronay, the food critic.
A survey published yesterday by Mr Ronay's magazine said of the French
airport: 'How a nation which justly prides itself on its gastronomic prowess
could tolerate what we consider is disastrous food, particularly in an
international shop window, is beyond me.'
By contrast there had been a 'remarkable and commendable transformation' at
Heathrow after an unfavourable first report. 'It is heartening to see what
can be achieved after a none-too-gentle prod,' Mr Ronay said.

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should triple or quadruple its target for introducing
renewable energy such as wind, wave and solar power, according to a report
from MPs yesterday.
The Commons energy select committee suggested a target of between 3,000MW
and 4,000MW of renewable capacity, against the present target of 1,000MW by
the year 2000.
The government should consider the environmental benefits of renewable
energy when comparing it with alternative forms of energy, the report said.
It should act immediately to establish what the environmental costs of other
forms of generation are. Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure groups, welcomed the report. Renewable Energy Systems
and regional electricity companies SWEB and Manweb will build a 6MW windfarm
near Mitchell in Cornwall. The joint venture, Wind Resources, will spend
Pounds 6.5m developing the project, which will have wind turbines and is due
to start by the end of this year.

FT  14 APR 92 / Hospitals face Pounds 1.6bn improvements bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service and hospital trusts are to spend Pounds 1.6bn on
building improvements as a consequence of the lifting of Crown immunity from
hospital properties, a survey of health authorities says.
Most of the work will be done to conform with fire regulations. Crown
immunity for health service properties was lifted a year ago.
Until then planning controls and other regulations did not apply to
hospitals.
One authority has been quoted Pounds 40m to upgrade its five hospitals.
The Audit Commission yesterday described the findings of the survey as
'reasonable'.
One fifth of regional health authorities and hospital trusts were asked by
Building Intelligence Digest, a consultancy, how much they planned to spend
to conform to regulations. Nearly two thirds had earmarked Pounds 2m with
one in seven planning to spend more than Pounds 10m.
'There are an awful lot of buildings which will need a lot of cash to put
them right,' said Mr David Hutchison, chairman of HLM Architects, which
specialises in NHS work. He questioned whether it was worth updating
buildings which could be past their useful lifespan. He singled out problems
with building materials and with the location of fire escapes.
Apart from the expense, conforming to fire regulations might interfere with
efforts to involve hospitals in the private sector. They might have to apply
for planning permission for changes of use for premises within hospitals,
for example if ambulance workshops wanted to take on private repair work or
if hospital incinerators or laundries took on private work.
Hospitals have already faced legal action over emissions from incinerators.
Some hospital pharmacies have stopped making their own treatments since they
would have to apply for manufacturing licences.
Mr John Greetham, chairman of Hospital Trust Federation, said yesterday:
'The speed of spending depends on local officials.'
He said that the hospital trusts would be in a better position than the
regional health authority hospitals to identify which buildings were worth
repairing.
He said that traditional funding methods meant that money went into
short-term patient care rather than buildings. 'Not spending money on the
buildings catches up with you in the end.'

FT  14 APR 92 / Japan reports monthly trade surplus of Dollars 11bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday reported a record monthly trade surplus of Dollars 10.98bn
(Pounds 6.3bn) for March, bringing the surplus for the full fiscal year to
Dollars 88.35bn, a 62.7 per cent increase and a potentially large source of
trade problems for the Japanese government.
The customs-cleared surplus for the year was close to the record of Dollars
89.7bn in fiscal 1986, and prompted Mr Kozo Watanabe, the trade and industry
minister, to promise to rekindle domestic growth in an attempt to halt the
expansion of exports.
Japan's economic slowdown was reflected in the 29.3 per cent increase in the
March surplus, as imports fell 8.2 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars
19.32bn, while exports rose 2.6 per cent to Dollars 30.30bn. Exports for the
year rose 8.1 per cent to Dollars 320.58bn, imports dipped 4.2 per cent to
Dollars 232.22bn.
The US Congress will note a marginal 1.2 per cent increase in Japanese
imports of US products and that the bilateral deficit rose for the first
time in five years, and query whether market opening measures have been
effective. The US deficit in bilateral trade last year was Dollars 38.46bn,
up from Dollars 38.12bn, following a 1.1 per cent increase in exports from
Japan.
However, the Ministry of Finance's seasonally adjusted figures showed that
the surge in surplus over the past few months could have peaked, with the
March surplus at Dollars 9.17bn, down from Dollars 10.43bn in February.
Exports decreased 3.8 per cent to Dollars 27.92bn, imports increased 0.9 per
cent to Dollars 18.75bn.
For the year, exports to the EC were 5.6 per cent higher at Dollars 59.76bn,
while Japan's imports from the EC declined 11.4 per cent to Dollars 31.32bn,
highlighted by a 14.3 per cent fall in imports from Italy and a 25.1 per
cent plunge in imports from France. Both countries' exports were hurt by the
slowing of demand for luxury products.
China became a lucrative market again last year for Japanese companies, with
exports 45.4 per cent higher at Dollars 9.42bn, and imports up 13.8 per cent
to Dollars 14.56bn. Exports to the rest of Asia rose 12.9 per cent to
Dollars 106.57bn and imports rose 4.1 per cent to Dollars 72.46bn.
Japan's trade with the newly industrialised economies of Asia, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea now outstrips that with the EC. Exports to
those economies rose 13.1 per cent to Dollars 67.78bn, and imports were 4.7
per cent higher at Dollars 27.35bn.
The most significant increases in Japanese exports last year were in cars
(7.7 per cent), video cameras (16.1 per cent), semiconductor equipment (12.3
per cent) and ships (22.6 per cent). Japan's machinery imports rose by only
4 per cent, and imports of cars fell 20.4 per cent by value and 25.9 per
cent by volume.

<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), said
yesterday that he and his wife, Mrs Winnie Mandela, had decided to separate
after 33 years.
The move follows renewed allegations that Mrs Mandela viciously beat four
young men in her Johannesburg home in 1988. One of them subsequently died.
Mrs Mandela yesterday denied these allegations, in a statement issued by her
lawyer, and Mr Mandela said they had nothing to do with his decision to seek
a separation.
Mr Mandela's voice broke with emotion when he read out a statement
announcing the separation. He praised his wife's role in opposing apartheid
and in resisting government harassment during the ANC leader's 27 years in
jail.
'My love for her remains undiminished,' he said. However the couple decided
to separate because tensions had arisen 'owing to differences between
ourselves on a number of issues.' Mrs Mandela takes a more radical political
stand than her husband, and her recent open marital infidelities have led to
scandal.
Though Mrs Mandela, 57, will remain head of the ANC's Department of Social
Welfare, her separation from Mr Mandela will remove a source of
embarrassment for the ANC.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TIRUPATI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S Congress party meets today for a historic three-day conference
expected to consolidate the political authority of the prime minister, Mr P
V Narasimha Rao, and to endorse his pro-market economic policies.
The plenary session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party's
main policy-making body, is the first to be held since independence in which
no member of the Nehru family will be present.
About 100,000 delegates and party supporters are gathering at this
pilgrimage centre in southern India - a location deliberately chosen by Mr
Rao to strengthen the Congress party's Hindu credentials and to woo support
from the Hindu radical Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main challenger to
the Congress.
One of the main divisions in the Congress, and expected to be on the
conference agenda, is over its approach to the BJP, which is in power in the
large northern Hindi-speaking states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya
Pradesh.
The infrequent plenary sessions of the Congress have in the past been the
occasions for signalling important shifts in doctrine. The 1955 session
proclaimed the party's commitment to industrialisation through public
ownership and the 1985 meeting under Rajiv Gandhi opened the door to
economic liberalisation.
This session will effectively bury the Congress party's commitment to
socialist central planning and the dominance of the public sector. But
because of the widespread opposition within the party to abandoning the
legacy of Nehru, Mr Rao will present his pro-market policies as an extension
of the Nehru heritage.
In spite of the party's readiness to give an overall endorsement to the new
reforms, a large section of the party remains opposed to retrenchment.
The strength of the opposition from both within the party and the unions has
led the prime minister to stall a rationalisation of the state-owned banking
system and to postpone measures making it easier for companies to reduce
their work force.
For the prime minister the plenary session is important in both
consolidating his own leadership and in establishing a hierarchy beneath
him. Mr Sharad Pawar, the minister for defence, and Mr Arjun Singh, the
minister of human resources, are expected to emerge from the meeting as the
two most likely candidates to succeed Mr Rao. Seen as a stop-gap leader when
he took power last June, Mr Rao has succeeded in neutralising challenges
from Rajiv Gandhi loyalists and from party bosses in the north.
The Gandhi faction has been marginalised by Mrs Sonia Gandhi's reluctance to
enter politics and the resurfacing of allegations that the Gandhi family
benefited from the Bofors scandal.

FT  14 APR 92 / Cloves row gives Indonesian politics a shot in the arm:
Suharto's son replies to criticisms of monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S governing political party, Golkar, has been publicly criticised
by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, a leading businessman and youngest son of
President Suharto.
The attack has given the country's political life a shot in the arm in
advance of June's general election.
Mr Putra, a majority shareholder of Humpuss Group Indonesia and chairman of
BPPC, a private agency with monopoly rights over the trading of cloves, was
responding to criticisms by senior Golkar figures of BPPC.
'The critics do not know what they are talking about,' Mr Putra told the
daily Media Indonesia at the weekend.
In the run-up to the election on June 9, local papers have identified the
monopoly as a key political issue. Golkar is widely expected to win the
election, but political pundits say the issue will test the bond between
party, the President, and his family. The Jakarta Post, a leading
English-language paper, has run two editorials within three weeks critical
of BPPC.
About 70,000 tonnes of cloves are sold each year to Indonesia's kretek
cigarette manufacturers.
Early this year, however, BPPC ran into financial trouble and the trade in
cloves ground to a halt.
Diplomats and donor officials say the monopoly runs counter to the
government's commitment to deregulation.
Mr Usman Hasan, the deputy secretary-general of Golkar, was reported as
saying BPPC should be closed down.
The agency has also been criticised by Mr Kharis Suhud, speaker of the House
of Representatives, who argues that it is hurting, not helping farmers.
Set up in 1990, BPPC has provided a floor price of Rp7,000 a kilo for
Indonesia's 3m to 4m clove farmers, twice the level of previous lows; the
agency sells on to the kretek manufacturers for about Rp12,500 per kilo.
Its problems stem from its current clove stock - 155,000 tonnes, equal to
two years production - and Mr Putra recently suggested that farmers should
burn half this year's crop to ease over-supply. BPPC officials have also
conceded that the agency will be unable to meet repayment terms on a Rp760bn
soft loan made in 1990 by the central bank.
Last week the government announced that BPPC would transfer much of the
cloves procurement to local co-operatives. The floor price would be lowered
by 7 per cent, and up to 49 per cent of the price would be retained by the
co-operatives in the form of equity funds and 'compulsory savings' for the
farmers.
BPPC will remain the exclusive supplier to kretek manufacturers, and Mr
Putra has said there will be no reduction in the selling price until its
current stock is exhausted.

FT  14 APR 92 / The amazing Mr Chung raises the stakes: Roh's government
could be forced to defuse the Hyundai row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN the fate of Hyundai is at stake in the bitter feud between the
group's founder, Mr Chung Ju Yung, and the South Korean government. Hyundai
is the country's second largest business group, with activities ranging from
cars and shipbuilding to electronics and construction, and the outcome of
the conflict could even affect the election of the country's next president
and determine the future role of big business in Korea's economic structure
and politics.
Mr Chung did the unthinkable when he recently created the Unification
National Party (UNP) to challenge the government of President Roh Tae Woo.
Business has traditionally played a subservient role to government in Korea,
providing financial contributions to the political establishment in return
for receiving corporate favours. The launch of the party upset this
equilibrium, and Mr Chung did it in a way that humiliated the government:
the party's success in last month's national assembly elections helped
deprive the government of a parliamentary majority.
The clash began in earnest last autumn, when the authorities imposed a
Dollars 181m (Pounds 105m) penalty tax on the Chung family and 14 Hyundai
subsidiaries amid speculation that the Hyundai founder was planning to form
his party. The Hyundai group subsequently complained that bank loans were
being denied to them under state pressure, while the government was blocking
approval of planned stock and bond issues.
Legal actions then escalated after the elections. Hyundai's main creditor
bank, the Korea Exchange Bank, suspended loans for industrial investments to
five key subsidiaries for six months due to violations of credit controls.
Hyundai Electronics Industries may lose its important right to unrestricted
credit access because it allegedly used bank loans to finance the UNP.
Hyundai Merchant Marine has been hit with a Won 27bn (Pounds 20m) tax
penalty and several corporate officials have been arrested for alleged tax
evasion. The state-run Korea Development Bank has suspended industrial loans
to Hyundai because it fears that the group's credit-worthiness will fall as
a result of its conflict with the government.
The lastest legal sanctions coincide with government worries about the
prospect of Mr Chung's standing in December's presidential election. Many
political analysts believe that a Chung candidacy would deny victory to the
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) in the race for the Blue House, the
presidential office: he might split the conservative vote and deliver the
election to Mr Kim Dae Jung, the likely candidate for the main opposition
Democratic Party, or even squeak through to become president. Mr Chung
proved skilful during the assembly elections in overcoming public suspicion
of the chaebol, the conglomerates that dominate the Korean economy. His
party's advertisements contrasted the international success of Hyundai with
the economic problems confronting the country as a whole, including high
inflation and a burgeoning trade deficit. The result was that the party
captured 17 per cent of the vote.
The party's goal is to reduce the government's strict economic controls. Mr
Chung, for example, wants to deregulate the financial system. The government
is using credit controls as part of an attempt to reduce the economic power
of the chaebol, while promoting the growth of small and medium-sized
business. Tighter borrowing rules have been imposed on the chaebol in the
hope that they will divest some of their widespread industrial activities,
although the policy has not been very successful. The chaebol initially grew
rapidly due to cheap loans. Mr Chung wants a return to the days of easy
credit. He argues that only the success of the chaebol can save the economy.
He has also accused the government of favouring the other chaebol. While
Hyundai benefited from Mr Chung's friendship with President Park Chung Hee
in the 1960s and 1970s, relations between Hyundai and the state have cooled.
Mr Chung has claimed that Daewoo, the country's fourth biggest conglomerate,
grew under President Chun Doo Hwan in the 1980s because it was granted tax
breaks and other privileges to take over ailing concerns. Daewoo is now
spearheading proposed corporate investment in North Korea, replacing Hyundai
in this government-sanctioned role.
'Why only us?' asks Mr Chung Mong Joon, a son of the Hyundai founder. 'The
irregularities that the authorities are charging us with are common
practices in domestic business management.' The government denies that it is
targeting Hyundai in its examination of financial practices. Officials warn
that the other chaebol are also being scrutinised for illegal practices.
Analysts wonder how long Hyundai can stand the financial pressure before it
starts suffering damage.
However, most believe that the government's goal is to frighten Hyundai away
from financing the UNP and that it has no intention of inflicting permanent
harm. The health of Hyundai is considered too important to the Korean
economy. Its 43 subsidiaries generated an unconsolidated turnover of Won 40
trillion (million million) in fiscal 1991, which was equivalent to 17 per
cent of the country's gross national product. 'I expect the government will
have to back down because of the economic consequences of a Hyundai
collapse,' says Professor Sohn Hak-Kyu of Sogang University. 'A retreat by
the government will confirm that the chaebol have grown too powerful to
control and that they are likely to play a growing role in the political
process.'
Indeed, there have been signs in the last few days that the government is
trying to defuse the situation. It suspended for a week its threat to
withdraw unrestricted credit rights from Hyundai Electronics, while a
presidential aide met with the current Hyundai chairman, the younger brother
of Mr Chung.
Although the elder Chung may emerge victorious from his battle with the
government, the other chaebol will try to prevent him from using his new
political power to benefit Hyundai. They have declared that they may band
together to combat Hyundai. Mr Chung will be closely watched to see if he
can successfully separate his business interests from his political
activity.

disturbing trends observed by Mr James Ingram, who has just retired as
director of the World Food Programme (WFP), the Rome-based organisation
responsible for United Nations food aid.
Mr Ingram, an Australian who headed the programme for 10 years, also notes a
slowing down in donor countries' responses to aid requirements and their
insistence on more conditions for assistance. The organisation is the only
multilateral body providing food assistance to developing countries,
accounting for one-fifth of all food aid shipped globally. The organisation
is also the second largest source of development assistance within the UN
system after the World Bank.
'There are enormous problems of how to allocate food aid, since the demands
are increasing while resources from donor countries are being reduced,' he
says.
The decline in resources has been in evidence since 1988, and last year the
Dollars 448m (Pounds 260.4m) committed to development projects was the
lowest in value terms since 1978. Approximately 22m people were reckoned to
have received food through the programme's development projects last year,
the bulk in food-deficit countries with per capita incomes below Dollars
1,135.
The main call upon the programme's resources has come from increased
emergency relief aid. In the two-year period 1991-92, the organisation's
total resources are expected to be Dollars 2.6bn. But the number of
unforeseen emergencies (such as helping the Kurds in Iraq and cyclone
victims in Bangladesh last year) is likely to rise.
The situation, he argues, is set to worsen: 'Donors are becoming slower in
responding. We have seen this over the recent cases of Sudan, Liberia and
Mozambique. The food pipelines are empty, and if you don't deliver now, it
becomes impossible to get the food at the right time and thus it becomes
very hard to manage the aid well.'
The increased delays are less the result of 'aid fatigue' among donor
countries than, as Mr Ingram sees it, the consequence of aid being handled
by civil servants who have too many calls on their national purses and have
to juggle tight budgets. 'They wait until the last moment, weighing their
options,' he says. 'It's understandable, but decisions can be too late.'
The organisation's current Horn of Africa appeal for Dollars 400m has so far
produced no more than Dollars 80m in promises.
Of the main donors, Mr Ingram regards the US as still the most responsive.
'The European Community has been a little disappointing,' he says. The EC
was still conditioned by 'old geopolitical, historical and colonial
considerations' and seemed insufficiently aware of the potential effects of
instability and emigration among poor countries, especially in Africa.
He also sees aid increasingly geared to serve special interests and
hedged-in by conditionalities. Food aid projects now often have to contend
with human-rights issues such as the role of women and environmental
protection, all of which affect a country's internal politics. While
developing countries are far from blameless, Mr Ingram believes too many
strings can be counter-productive: 'It is better, perhaps, to have fewer
strings and Because the organisation distributes aid directly to the
beneficiaries, it is less constrained by the nature of the governments where
it is operating. For instance, in Sudan, where the government has a poor
record on human rights, emergency food aid is distributed through
non-government organisations (NGOs). In some countries the WFP ceases to
deal with certain ministries; but, where genuine hardship exists, the
organisation seeks to be present no matter the nature of the regime.
A more delicate issue, according to Mr Ingram, is whether the organisation
should intervene when governments of potentially rich countries fail to feed
elements of their population because of poor policies such as in Brazil's
impoverished north-eastern region. He believes in principle that
resource-rich developing countries should be responsible for their own poor,
and in the case of the former Soviet Union the potential role of the WFP,
apart from offering its good offices, should be limited to some of the poor
Moslem republics.
He sees little immediate change in the production of food surpluses,
especially where there are high subsidies as in the EC. But he is convinced
that, in the longer term, greater trade liberalisation can only benefit
poorer countries. 'Trade,' he says, 'is ultimately more useful to them than
aid.'
Although the organisation last year handled a record 4.8m tonnes of food and
has extensive experience in the purchase and movement of food aid, its hands
remained tied. 'The WFP has no money to finance stocks,' says Mr Ingram. 'We
rely upon the International Emergency Food Reserve (IEFR), which is based
solely on commitments from donors - it is not a formal stock. This reserve
stands at about 500,000 tons, yet we have to distribute annually over 4m
tons.'
Mr Ingram has been succeeded by Ms Catherine Bertini, former assistant
secretary of the US Department of Agriculture.

yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The duties, equal to 16 per cent on imports from Turkey and 15 per cent on
Brazilian steel, were imposed after an investigation following a complaint
from the EC steel industry. EC governments have four months to decide
whether to make the duties permanent.
Producers said imports had increased sevenfold, their market share rising to
7.8 per cent in 1989 from 1.2 per cent in 1985.

MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, Japan's biggest consumer electronics
company, yesterday agreed to a telephone pager manufacturing joint venture
with three Chinese companies.
The venture should help Matsushita consolidate its leading position in the
Chinese market for pagers. Matsushita sold 150,000 pagers in China in 1990,
out of a total estimated market of 200,000 units, and last year sold 200,000
pagers.
Pagers in China are popular because of the slow development of the telephone
network. Rather than wait for a telephone, many Chinese are receiving
messages by pager.
The company is to be called Beijing Matsushita Communication Equipment.
Fifty per cent is to be owned by MEI and Matsushita Communication
Industrial, with the other half owned by China National Posts and
Telecommunications Industry, China National Postal and Telecommunications
Appliances, and Beijing Telecommunication Components Factory.
The company is capitalised at Dollars 2.94m (Pounds 1.7m). Production of
pagers, which will have liquid crystal displays, is to start in July.

Indian market

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA is being hailed as 'the new Mexico' at the US Export-Import Bank and
proof positive that US industry has turned the tide in its drive to regain
the edge over its foreign competitors, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington.
Mr John Macomber, Eximbank chairman, just back from an Asian trip, speaks
glowingly of the 'huge opportunities' of an Indian market newly shorn of
trade curbs. Eximbank's exposure there has leapt from Dollars 100m (Pounds
58m) to Dollars 500m in the past year, and it has on hand applications for
Dollars 1.6bn in trade credits.
'We won't get all the contracts, but we'll get a good percentage of them,'
Mr Macomber said. 'This doesn't take into account a gigantic deal for
airframes, airports and avionics which is in the works.'
Mexico has emerged as the Eximbank's biggest customer, with lending expected
to hit Dollars 7bn this year. But bank officials see India has having equal
potential; even as a candidate for 'bundling' - packaging together small
loans for sale on the capital markets.
Mr Macomber says US product quality has improved so much in the past decade
that Asian buyers are no longer 'talking down' US products. Sales are mostly
in the Dollars 50m-Dollars 75m range, including computers, avionics,
machinery, and oil and gas equipment. 'There are few areas where the
Americans aren't on top, whether it is telecommunications, advanced
materials, medicine or biology,' he said. 'No amount of monkeying with the
value of the dollar is going to make you competitive if your product is
not.'
Support for US exports has now achieved a consensus in Washington. Congress
has removed the ceiling for export guarantees, with no opposition from the
Office of Management and the Budget, and the only limit on lending is a
Dollars 612m subsidy level. The value of exports backed is expected to rise
from Dollars 12.5bn last year to Dollars 14bn in fiscal 1992.
Last week, Congress repealed the Stevenson/Byrd Act, which placed a Dollars
130m lid on lending by Eximbank to the former Soviet Union and capped loans
in the energy sector at Dollars 40m. Eximbank is finally prepared to go
ahead with almost Dollars 200m in loans, approved months ago for sales to
Russian businesses.

THE German government was challenged yesterday to spell out clearly the
country's financial situation and urged to freeze public spending.
Publishing details of financial problems and their causes would make it
easier to persuade people of the need to economise, according to Prof
Hans-Jurgen Schmahl, head of the HWWA economics institute in Hamburg. The
condition of state finances was increasingly alarming, he said at the
presentation of a review by the country's five main economics institutes.
Companies and individuals faced increased social security contributions, he
claimed, because outgoings were outstripping income.
Describing the institutes' lowered forecast of 1 per cent growth in the west
this year as 'uncertain', he urged more pay claim moderation and
renegotiation of agreements guaranteeing most east German workers pay parity
with the west by the end of 1994.

FT  14 APR 92 / Rail chief gets tough with rebel Italian engine drivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE management of Italy's loss-making state railways, FS, has carried out a
threat to deny pay increases to employees responsible for unauthorised
industrial action.
The threat had its desired effect of limiting the number of engine drivers
who carried out a 24 hour strike over the week-end.
This tough stance by Mr Lorenzo Necci, head of the FS, may mark a watershed
in industrial relations in sensitive sectors such as transportation, where
workers have traditionally been able to hold the public and employers to
ransom. Mr Necci was brought in almost two years ago to run the FS on an
emergency basis.
To limit the impact of transport strikes on the public, the government has
increasingly invoked new powers, introduced in July 1990, to enforce minimum
services; but this is the first occasion when strikers have been penalised
through the pay packet. According to the FS at least 60 per cent of the
trains were able to run normally.
The strike was called by a rebel drivers union which refused to accept a
wage and work conditions contract negotiated for all railway employees by
the three main trades union confederations. The latter have backed Mr
Necci's action.
The rebel train drivers want higher wage packets than those already
negotiated on their behalf and fear a deal behind their backs to introduce
single driver trains.
Facing cuts in government funding of the railways and under pressure to
raise productivity and achieve profitability, the FS management has little
option but dig in its heels. The FS has accumulated debts approaching
L50,000bn. (Pounds 23.25bn). Losses last year were L3,625bn despite total
state transfers of over L12,000bn.
The main problems faced by Mr Necci are an inflated payroll, the lowest
passenger fares in Europe and uncompetitive freight business.
From 209,000 employees in 1989, the number is due to fall to 168,000 this
year. But management hands are tied by a mixture of government reluctance to
endorse a major realignment of fares and the unresolved issue of how to
tackle the railways huge accumulated debts.
In addition to accumulated operating losses the FS has social security
debts, mainly related to pension payments, of L30,000bn.

<TEXT>
AT LEAST 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, the newly independent republic, adding to the 1m people
who fled the war in Croatia.
The flight continued yesterday as fresh clashes were reported in Sarajevo,
the Bosnian capital, and other towns in the republic, despite the ceasefire
agreed on Sunday among the leaders of Bosnia's 4.4m Moslems, Serbs and
Croats.
Radio Sarajevo said the federal army had reported 11 violations of the most
recent European Community-sponsored truce by mid-morning. Heavy fighting was
reported on the outskirts of Sarajevo, in Foca, a predominantly Moslem town
in south-eastern Bosnia, and in Bosanski Brod, in the north.
Ms Judith Kumin, the Belgrade representative of the United Nations High
Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), said that although it was difficult to get
a precise figure, she estimated that at least 100,000 people had fled
strife-torn towns in Bosnia. Some had escaped to other existing or former
Yugoslav republics, while others were still in Bosnia, sheltering away from
the trouble spots.
The UNHCR, the Red Cross and other international organisations are all
trying to cope with the thousands of refugees who fled their homes.
Encouragingly, relief workers tell of communities making great sacrifices in
order to give shelter to refugees despite the fact that they are in a
difficult economic situation and have already taken in thousands of people
from Croatia.
Relief workers trying to deliver food and medical supplies are confronted by
gunmen at road blocks around many towns. Ms Kumin said: 'The biggest problem
is transportation. It is very expensive to get lorry drivers to go into
Bosnia while there is fighting. They insist on UN escorts which makes the
cost even higher'.

FT  14 APR 92 / Moscow aims for foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment will be encouraged under a programme spelling out the
conditions for privatising most of Russia's vast state property holdings.
The programme also gives extensive privileges to workers in the enterprises
being privatised, but tries to end the process of 'spontaneous'
privatisation, under which enterprises are transferred to their workforces
without government permission.
The plan, thrashed out over the first months of this year, is now ready for
adoption by the government and signing by President Boris Yeltsin. But the
efforts of the Russian Congress to derail economic reform are delaying
progress.
The aim of the programme is to cut through the various laws governing
privatisation and enterprises by setting out practical steps to be taken by
authorities at all levels.
There will be no restraints on foreigners buying privatised property in most
industrial sectors - including electronics, engineering, construction,
textiles and others. In the most lucrative fields - oil and gas enterprises,
gold and diamond production and the high-technology defence sector which
accounts for much of the civilian electronics output as well - a licence
will be required from the Committee for Foreign Investments.
Foreigners can also take part in auctions to buy shops and small businesses
employing fewer than 200 people and with assets of under Rbs1m, but only
with the permission of the local authorities. Open auctions of small
businesses are now going on in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's third biggest city,
though no foreigners are participating so far.
The programme says transactions must be made in roubles; it does not say at
what rate, but that the roubles used shall be 'taken from special accounts'.
The Russian government and central bank are discussing setting a special
rate much higher than the official Rbs100 to the dollar to stop foreigners
buying assets at rock bottom prices.
Ministers and officials working on the privatisation proposals are aware of
public hostility both to privatisation as a whole and to selling assets to
foreigners. However, they want as few restrictions as possible in order to
draw in foreign capital desperately needed to renew infrastructure and
upgrade production machinery.
Goldman Sachs, the US merchant bank, has been hired to help the government
identify projects and sectors most promising for foreign investment.
Officials have stressed that they want to simplify and speed up investment
procedures as far as possible. This will partly involve re-establishing the
authority of the central government in order to cut through the layers of
local and regional bureaucracy.
The programme lays out two options for sweetening the pain of job losses
involved in privatisation: workers could either receive 25 per cent of
non-voting shares in the enterprise while buying 10 per cent of the voting
shares at a hefty discount, or they could be given the right to buy up to 51
per cent of the share capital of the enterprise. The workers could then sell
on these shares without restrictions.

FT  14 APR 92 / Greek premier hedges bets on Macedonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, yesterday sacked his
foreign minister, a strong opponent of Greek recognition of Macedonia - and
then proceeded to endorse some of his hardline views.
In a series of contradictory moves, Mr Mitsotakis appeared to have decided
to make a scapegoat out of Mr Antonis Samaras amid fears that Greece faces a
humiliating diplomatic defeat by the EC over the Macedonian question.
But he seemed to be hedging his bets by announcing he would take over the
foreign ministry himself 'to enable Greece to follow effectively and
responsibly the policy demanded by the people'.
He added that he would appoint a retired diplomat, Mr Ioannis Tzounis, as
foreign under-secretary. In recent weeks, Mr Tzounis has acted as the prime
minister's personal adviser on the issue.
Mr Mitsotakis appears to fear that Mr Samaras' rise in popularity as a
result of his strong stance on Macedonia has undermined his position at the
head of the ruling New Democracy party. He called for a parliamentary vote
of confidence to be held on Friday night.
Until yesterday, Mr Mitsotakis had let it be understood that Greece would
recognise Macedonia if its name had a prefix to distinguish it from the
northern Greek province of Macedonia, and if past claims of kinship with
Slav speakers in Greece were dropped.
Yesterday, however, he reversed his position, backing Mr Samaras' insistence
that Macedonia should find an entirely different name.
He also made public proposals by Mr Samaras which included threats to veto
EC recognition of Macedonia and to close the border between the two
countries - a move which would hurt Greek as well as Macedonian exporters.
However unrealistic these proposals may be, given that international
recognition of Macedonia under its present name could come as early as next
month, they are backed by a sizeable number of conservative deputies and a
large segment of public opinion.
Mr Mitsotakis has quarrelled with half-a-dozen cabinet ministers in the past
year. With the departure of Mr Samaras his government looks increasingly
shaky. A crushing win by the main opposition Socialists in a by-election
last week underlined the fragility of the conservatives' grip on power, with
only a one-seat majority in parliament.
Yet even if he yields to nationalist sentiment on Macedonia, Mr Mitsotakis
will still be under fire from conservatives because of the gloomy economic
outlook.
It is more than a year since Greece promised strict implementation of a
medium-term stabilisation programme in return for an Ecu1.1bn (Pounds 780m)
EC loan. But annual inflation is still stubbornly high at 18.3 per cent,
despite a public sector pay freeze, while the public debt, which amounted to
95 per cent of gross domestic product last year, shows little sign of
shrinking in 1992.

FT  14 APR 92 / EBRD threatens to stop help for Russia: Jacques Attali ties
bank's assistance to continuance of economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will halt all financial
help to Russia if economic reforms are postponed, Mr Jacques Attali, the
EBRD president, said yesterday in Budapest.
Speaking at the bank's first annual meeting, he said western assistance
should go only to those governments 'able to demonstrate that they have
embarked upon the right road to reform. It is to be hoped that the political
conditions in Russia will be such as to allow resources to be released.'
The opening session of the meeting was also marked by further disagreement
between the US and the EBRD over the scope of the bank's activities.
In referring to western help for Russia, Mr Attali had in mind the Dollars
18bn - in addition to the Dollars 6bn earmarked for a stabilisation fund -
recently announced by the Group of Seven industrial countries. 'But we would
halt all our operations too,' he said. The EBRD has so far backed two loans
to the former Soviet Union, which total Ecu28.8m (Pounds 20.62m).
Even if Russia kept to the reform path, Mr Attali warned that all the
countries of the former Soviet Union, and of eastern Europe, required extra
financial help totalling Ecu4,000bn from the west.
He said this would help ensure the region's balance of payments
requirements, finance the privatisation of viable enterprises, boost export
industries, convert the defence industry, and improve safety at nuclear
power stations.
EBRD economists have estimated that, during 1992, the balance of payments
requirements for eastern Europe alone total Ecu15bn.
The conversion of the old military sector is a key illustration of the
disagreement between the US and EBRD over the bank's role. Mr Nicholas
Brady, US treasury secretary, told the meeting that the EBRD should 'not
diffuse its mission' by moving away from its original mandate which
stipulates that the bank commit 60 per cent of its financing to the private
sector. It should not diversify away from privatisation by, for example,
recapitalising state-owned enterprises.
Mr Attali yesterday proposed setting up a special restructuring facility
aimed at converting the military-industrial sector in the former Soviet
Union (which directly, and indirectly, employs 12m) and at restructuring the
Russian nuclear power industry.
Many EBRD member countries see the need for some form of soft loans for
these industries, but the US remains opposed. The bank's board agreed to
look into the proposal, in a move to avoid further dispute.
Mr Brady, who later flew to Moscow, said: 'We are not convinced of the need
(for the bank) to branch into new restructuring operations involving major
policy changes that detract from the bank's main mission. 'The EBRD cannot
cover the entire range of needs; it cannot be all things to all people; it
cannot hope to cover all sectors, both private and public, in all
countries.'
Germany and the former Soviet republic of Georgia set up diplomatic ties
yesterday during a visit by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign
minister, local journalists said, Reuter reports.
The agreement was a diplomatic coup for the new chairman of Georgia's ruling
state council, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister,
who is trying to build diplomatic bridges with foreign states and attract
western business. Germany will be the first western nation to open an
embassy in Georgia and will provide humanitarian aid.
EBRD projects to finance eastern Europe's most promising industries are
becoming entangled in west European anxiety about trade competition, writes
Nicholas Denton. Mr Ronald Freeman, vice-president of the EBRD's merchant
banking arm, yesterday named food, textiles, steel and cars as the areas
with the most immediate potential for restructuring and privatisation. But
the EBRD had to tread warily in precisely these sensitive industrial areas
because they were 'hot buttons in Brussels', he said.
The EBRD's caution comes in the wake of political controversy surrounding
the bank's Ecu61.4m (Pounds 44m) loan to General Motors' new Hungarian car
and engine plant, which Mr Freeman confirmed yesterday. The loan fell
subject to an investigation by the European Community following objections
by France that tax concessions granted to the plant encouraged unfair
competition. EBRD merchant bankers said they were surprised by the
politicisation of the credit decision and that the dispute, although
resolved, served as a warning.
The pressure exercised by western member countries raised doubts about the
independence of the EBRD and its ability to make credit and investment
decisions on primarily commercial criteria which its charter stipulates.
Mr Jacques Attali, the EBRD's president, yesterday launched a broader attack
on EC hypocrisy in protesting about support to eastern Europe and at the
same time blocking imports. He was scathing about the EC's recent
association agreements Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which he said
denied access for nearly half the three countries' products.

<TEXT>
MR Manfred Stolpe, east Germany's most prominent politician, fought to
survive as the Social Democratic (SPD) prime minister of Brandenburg state
in the face of fresh evidence claiming he was a key informer for the former
Stasi state security police.
A 61-page report by the official German commission administering the Stasi
files concluded that Mr Stolpe was for nearly 20 years an important Stasi
informer on the Protestant church, of which he was a senior lay official.
The report was based on accounts by three Stasi officers of conversations Mr
Stolpe allegedly had with them. He was known to the Stasi by the code-name
of 'Secretary'.
The Christian Democratic (CDU) coalition partner of Mr Stolpe called on him
to relinquish office until the 'severe' charges against him were clarified.
The SPD in Bonn said the report contained nothing substantially new, but
Alliance 90, Mr Stolpe's smallest coalition member, said it was a 'strong
case' against him.
Mr Stolpe, however, said he saw no reason to step down. He emphasised that
he was never an informer.
An all-party committee in Potsdam has been examining the media accusations
against Mr Stolpe which surfaced this year and was given the report last
Friday. Mr Stolpe himself volunteered the information about his previous
Stasi contacts several months ago.
As superintendent of the Berlin-Brandenburg church, he helped gain the
release of countless east Germans from prison. He also aided in the
reuniting of thousands of east Germans with their families in the west.

<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, the UK opposition Labour party leader, will today announce
that he will not seek a further term as leader. Mr Roy Hattersley, his
deputy, has also decided not to stand again.
Their decision, in the wake of the party's fourth successive general
election defeat, is expected to pitch Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor
and favourite, against Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, in
a battle for the leadership.
Several other possible contenders are understood to have opted not to run
after it was clear that Mr Smith had already received firm pledges of
support from many leading Labour MPs and trade unions.
A fierce battle may arise for the deputy leadership, which Mr Gould may also
contend alongside Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary to the
Treasury, and possibly Mr John Prescott, the party's leftwing transport
spokesman.
In the aftermath of the election, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has put
government support for British industry at the centre of his strategy with
the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine to head an enlarged Department of
Trade and Industry.
Mr Heseltine's move, part of a weekend cabinet reshuffle which saw Mr Norman
Lamont confirmed as chancellor of the exchequer, was described by Whitehall
officials as an attempt to make Mr Major's administration more
'industry-friendly'.
The reshuffle, the first real opportunity Mr Major has had to stamp his
authority on the cabinet since taking over from Mrs Margaret Thatcher 16
months ago, saw a large-scale redistribution of cabinet responsibilities.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, and Mr Tom King, the former
defence secretary, were among four ministers losing their jobs. Among the
newcomers, Mr Michael Portillo, an unapolgetic Thatcherite on economic
policy, takes charge of public spending as the new chief secretary to the
Treasury.
The new cabinet line-up, with Mr Kenneth Clarke promoted to home secretary
and Mr John Patten to education, signals Mr Major's intention of giving the
government a more responsive image while sticking to the core of its
economic strategy.
The prime minister has balanced promotions for thos on the left and centre
of his party with comparable moves for the most prominent figures on the
right.  Mr Michael Howard, a leading free-marketeer, takes over an expanded
Department of the Environment.
Some ministers had expected the prime minister to move Mr Lamont from the
Treasury, but Mr Major was said to have been impressed by the chancellor's
determination to curb inflation in the approach to the election.
Mr Lamont will also be a key figure in piloting through the House of Commons
legislation to give effect to the treaty on economic and monetary union
agreed at Maastricht.
Mr Major's decision to reward Mr Heseltine for his vigorous role in the
election campaign will give the DTI much greater influence in shaping policy
towards business.  He will take over the Department of Employment's previous
responsibilities for small businesses and the DTI will also take charge of
the oil and coal industries.
Mr Heseltine will have the political weight to pull together the various
Whitehall responsibilities for industrial policy to meet criticism that the
government provides far less support for industry than many of its European
counterparts.

FT  13 APR 92 / A cautious step into the future: The prime minister has
named a consensual, rather than conviction, cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It marks out a new direction. But in the cautious manner of the man who
shaped it, Mr John Major's new cabinet represents a carefully-constructed
bridge to the future rather than a decisive break with the past.
There are plenty of changes around the cabinet table. Fewer than half a
dozen Whitehall departments will wake up this morning to find the same
minister in charge.
There were the predictable departures of some of the old guard, Mr Kenneth
Baker and Mr Tom King among them. Younger ministers kept outside Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's inner circle because they were never 'One of us' have
been given their chance. Mr John Patten's promotion to secretary of state
for education gives a barely reconstructed 'wet' one of the most
high-profile roles in the new government.
With the appointments of Mrs Virginia Bottomley to health and Mrs Gillian
Shephard to employment, Mr Major has lived up to his promise to open to
women the highest ranks of his government.
Two new Whitehall departments have been established - the national heritage
ministry headed by Mr David Mellor and the civil service and Citizen's
Charter department under Mr William Waldegrave. Mr Mellor's responsibility
for broadcasting will give him oversight of the renewal of the BBC's
charter.
Overall, Mr Major's choices reflect the judgment of a politician whose own
journey to Downing Street owed everything to a calculated talent for making
friends rather than enemies right across the ideological divides of his
party.
Mr Douglas Hurd will stay at the Foreign Office. His immediate task is to
steer Britain through its presidency of the European Community in the second
half of this year. More surprisingly, Mr Norman Lamont remains at the
Treasury. Mr Peter Lilley was moved rather than sacked. So was Mr
Waldegrave.
In the background, Mr Richard Ryder retains his formidable influence as
chief whip and Mr John Wakeham's elevation to the House of Lords will give
him a continuing role as government fixer.
If the team can be given a single, if rather outdated, label it is that of
'dry on economic and wet on social policy'.
The prime minister will never again be as powerful as in the immediate
aftermath of his first election triumph. But circumstances as well as his
cautious political instincts dictated that he moved only half way to the
cabinet with which he will fight the next general election.
Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman deprived of his seat in
Bath, will be back. The message from Downing Street is that the prime
minister has assured him that as soon as he returns to the House of Commons
he will be guaranteed to one of the most senior jobs in the government.
The gossip among his colleagues is that two or three years hence, Mr Patten
will be foreign secretary or chancellor. Mr Lamont has not been guaranteed
tenure at No 11 Downing Street for a full parliament. Mr Douglas Hurd
expects to retire from the foreign office before the next election.
Two other casualties of this election - Mr John Maples and Mr Francis Maude
 -had been pencilled in for promotion. They will have strong claims on
cabinet seats if and when by-elections offer a chance to return to
Westminster.
Mr Michael Heseltine's move to trade and industry, a just reward for his
vigorous role in the election campaign, will confirm his powerful influence
in the new Major government.
Anyone who has even glanced at his books and speeches on the subject of
industrial policy will realise that he will not be content with the
minimalist role mapped out for the DTI in recent years by Mr Nicholas Ridley
and Mr Peter Lilley.
There will be a cautious start. Mr Heseltine is shrewd enough not to fall
into the trap of being type-cast as a promoter of 1960s-style corporatism.
But he is said to remain as convinced as ever that many of Britain's
competitors owe their industrial success to active - he would prefer
'enabling' - government.
The transfer to the DTI of policy towards small businesses, a new role in
forging links with the training and enterprise councils and its additional
responsibility for energy, will give him one of the most powerful bases in
Whitehall.
So too will the growing importance of European regional policy implicit in
progress towards economic and monetary union. Mr Heseltine's enthusiasm for
European-wide industrial co-operation has not diminished.
Elsewhere, Mrs Bottomley's appointment, alongside the promotion of Mr John
Patten to education, puts the two most visible departments of the welfare
state in the hands of politicians wedded firmly to One-Nation Conservatism.
They are charged with pressing on with the market-based reforms of health
and education started by Mrs Thatcher. But their left-leaning credentials
will help reassure patients and parents that the final destination is no
longer the dismantling of public-sector provision. It was no coincidence
that Downing Street was at pains this weekend to point out that Mr Patten, a
former grammar school-boy and Oxford don, sends his own young daughter to a
state school.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's move to the Home Office is more complicated. Though one
of the three great departments of state, it is often viewed as a graveyard.
Mr Heseltine turned it down in favour of environment in Mr Major's first
cabinet.
But in Mr Clarke's case, the appointment confirms rather than diminishes his
influence. A liberal on social policy, he will be expected to implement the
recommendations of the royal commission on criminal justice when it reports
later this year.
His other, more Thatcherite, persona as a self-declared enemy of the trades
unions, promises an effort to weaken the power of the prison offices and the
police federation, both largely untouched during the 1980s. Mr Clarke wants
to be chancellor, and success at the Home Office might prove to be his
route.
If there was a surprise appointment it was Mr Malcolm Rifkind's promotion to
defence. Like Mr Clarke, he backed Mr Hurd in the leadership battle which
followed Mrs Thatcher's demise.
For months before the election he was embroiled in a serious dispute with Mr
Major over rail privatisation - the responsibility for which now passes to
Mr John MacGregor.
But Mr Major is said to be impressed by his abilities. If he manages
successfully the cuts in the armed forces outlined in Options for Change,
the 45-year-old Mr Rifkind will confirm his position as a future candidate
for the party leadership.
If it is possible to identify the key figures - with Messrs Hurd, Heseltine,
Clarke and Rifkind most prominent among them - it is harder to draw a single
philosophical thread through the new cabinet.
The ascendancy of the what one right-wing MP yesterday called the 'foppish'
tendency in some of the main spending Whitehall spending departments has
been balanced by the line-up at the Treasury.
Mr Lamont's re-appointment as chancellor is a signal to the right of the
Conservative party that Mr Major means what he says about the defeat of
inflation. It ensures also that a prominent Euro-sceptic remains at the
heart of negotiations with Brussels on progress towards a single European
currency.
The promotion to chief secretary of Mr Michael Portillo, at 38 already
judged the right's most likely candidate for the party leadership in five or
10 years time, provides further re-assurance.
Mr Portillo, charged with holding the Treasury's purse strings, is a
self-confessed tax cutter rather than public spender. Mr Heseltine will not
find it easy to persuade him that the Treasury's money is better spent on
regional policy than on lowering the basic rate of income tax or reducing
the public borrowing requirement.
The same message that the Tory right will remain well represented was sent
by the promotion of Sir Patrick Mayhew to Northern Ireland and of Mr Michael
Howard to environment.
Sir Patrick's appointment is a signal to Dublin that the prime minister's
anxiety for a negotiated settlement in Ulster does not extend to undermining
the Unionist case.
Mr Howard, whose fierce attacks on Labour's links with the trades unions put
him at the heart of the election campaign, can now claim a place in the
ministerial first division.
So it is a cabinet of checks and balances, designed to allow Mr Major to set
his own agenda for the 1990s without compromising unity in his party.

FT  13 APR 92 / International Bonds: Investors become sceptical with primary
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market went through another torrid week, with a only
a handful of new issues launched into the primary market and most failing to
generate sustained buying interest.
The simple explanation is that investors are facing deep uncertainty about
the prospects for bond yields and are unwilling to commit new funds.
However, syndicate officials at leading underwriting firms are concerned
that institutional investors are also losing confidence in the ability of
the primary Eurobond market to deliver paper at fair value.
A striking feature of the primary market over the past two months is the
number of new issues which have traded below issue price. Similarly, the
yield spread of new issues over government bonds - the benchmark measure of
value for non-government paper - has widened in the days after launch.
A rational investor will only buy a new issue if it believes that the
primary market price is solid.
The subject is emotive. Many of the changes in new issue procedure
introduced since the late 1980s were designed to restore the confidence of
investment institutions in the primary Eurobond market.
For example, the practice of offering bonds to investors at a fixed price
during the initial stages of syndication was introduced to prevent
underwriters from 'dumping' bonds at a discount and depressing the price of
new issues.
Some syndicate officials now argue that the fixed price re-offer has been
abused. They argue that too many deals are being re-offered to investors at
a price which is too aggressive and can not be sustained. Firms are bidding
for new issue mandates at impossibly tight yield spreads in order to win
market share and have abandoned the 'discipline' sometimes evident last
year.
But recently even issues which were considered well priced and well handled
by rival firms at the time of launch have had a tough ride.
For example, Norway's Dollars 1bn five-year issue was launched on March 31
at a yield spread of 25 basis points over US Treasury paper - considered
fair by most participants in the deal. By the end of last week the yield
spread had widened to around 29 basis points.
Even borrowers willing to compromise have suffered at the hands of sceptical
investors. On Thursday, Finland launched a cautious Dollars 500m five-year
issue lead managed by Morgan Stanley International. Many syndicate officials
were expecting a Dollars 1bn deal of up to 10-years maturity. The issue was
priced at a yield spread of 45 basis points, rather than 40-43 basis point
spread initially favoured by the borrower.
At the close of trading on Friday, the deal was trading at a yield spread of
around 50 basis points.
Such examples pose the question: is aggressive pricing driving investors
from the primary market, or is the unwillingness of investors to commit
funds making it very difficult to price new issues correctly?
In defence of new issue underwriters, several factors have combined to make
primary market pricing more difficult than usual this year. In particular,
secondary market yields have become a less reliable guide to the level at
which new issues can be sold.
There are several reasons for the dislocation of primary and secondary
market yields. Following the fall in US interest rates and bond yields last
year, many outstanding bond issues are trading well above face value in the
secondary market. Investors are generally unwilling to buy paper trading
above par, knowing that they will take a capital loss when the bonds mature.
These bonds appear to offer a generous return. For example, European
Investment Bank Eurodollar bonds maturing April 1997 are trading below par
on a yield spread of around 13 basis points over Treasuries. Yet EIB bonds
maturing November 1997 trade on a spread of 45 basis points, primarily
because the issue is old and trading at about 108 per cent of face value.
Equally, a number of liquid bond issues launched earlier this year -
potential benchmarks against which other new issues could be measured - were
never fully sold to investors and remain on the books of the lead manager.
Again, this distorts the yield at which the bonds are quoted in the
secondary market.
'It is cheaper for firms to hold unsold inventory rather than mark down
prices to off-load the bonds,' commented one new issue manager. 'Secondary
market spreads are not sustainable at current levels but no-one wants to
admit it.'
In a more liquid market, secondary market yields would adjust to reflect
institutional investors' assessment of fair value rather than levels
dictated by market-makers. However, secondary market trading volumes are
currently very low. There are few buyers, but also very few sellers.
This uncertainty may continue until secondary market yields adjust to match
investors' current perceptions of fair value and intermediaries sell
inventories of unsold bonds. Until then, issues will probably continue to be
mis-priced and levels of inventory held by intermediaries will swell.
'You can't make a science out of pricing a new issue. There are so many
dynamics at work within each deal, secondary market levels are just one
factor,' said Mr Jim Pelgrift, executive director and syndicate manager at
Morgan Stanley.

FT  13 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Technical analysis passes the
bard test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSSIBLY the worst forecast I ever made was that Japanese equities might
fall as much as 60 per cent from their peak. Not so bad, you may think? Only
if you ignore the timing. This was in a speech to the American business
economists in September 1987. How is it possible to get the timing so wrong,
yet the scale so nearly right? Amateur chartism, that's how.
Once the current euphoria is over, the great market debate of 1992 will
resume: is this a stale bull market, or is it just tensing its muscles for a
new rush? This column is about the kind of logic which is appropriate in
forming your own view. Should it be based on the economic future - the
fundamentals  - or simply on a study of market behaviour, like my bad guess
in 1987? And if behaviour is the best guide, should we try to understand
markets, or simply to forecast them?
Technical analysis, to give chartists the term they prefer, is a bit like
medieval science. It describes things in great detail, but does not attempt
to to explain them. Market theoreticians find this impossibly
unsatisfactory, because it gives them no evidence to support their
doctrines. Despite this hostile silence, the practitioners soldier on,
because their methods often work rather well.
Shakespeare knew why. 'There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio,
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' Forecasting can often be done with a
ruler, and it is essential to theorise if we are ever to understand things.
But there are times when the trends, both in the markets and in the real
world, develop a kink.
Bring on the antagonists. In the bear corner, the Norwich Union, which has
become identified with the view that since real interest rates are so high,
current equity yields look unattractive compared with bonds. In the bull
corner Goldman Sachs, which has just published a short paper by Sushil
Wadhwani, a financial economist at the London School of Economics,
rubbishing this view.
The trouble with the Norwich Union analysis is that there is a great hole in
it. It does not suggest why real interest rates are so high and therefore
does say not whether they are likely to stay high, or revert to a long run
norm. The first question is possibly unanswerable - there seems to be no
accepted explanation for the present peak; but the second is absolutely
crucial.
If real rates are being forced up by a shortage of capital, then the return
on capital ought to rise. Further, as Wadhwani points out, if the market
expects equity returns to rise, it will value bonds less highly. Round One
to Goldman. But if real rates simply reflect a sluggish response by the
central banks and the markets to falling inflation, then they will come
down, to the profit of bondholders; and if a world recession is already
brewing, they may have to come down a long way - a muted replay of Tokyo.
Possible KO to East Anglia.
Turn to the Goldman case. It tries to apply to markets the same methods of
statistical fit that produced all the dud economic forecasts last year. This
implies a much bigger black hole than the Norwich analysis, for it leaves
out market cycles. Wadhwani tries to measure the 'revealed preferences' of
investors, without mentioning that these preferences change rather
drastically at times. His methods, which rely on logical stability over
time, rule out the crowd psychology aspect - another thing that Shakespeare
understood.
Norwich is Hamlet without the quotes; but Goldman leaves out the Prince.
Technical KO.

FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Rate cut hopes rest on market reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TREASURY officials are waiting to see the markets' considered reaction to
the election result before deciding whether to cut interest rates.
The pound gained 2 1/2 pfennigs during Friday's trading. But the Treasury
dampened hopes of a rapid rate cut to speed recovery.
'Friday's reaction was not necessarily the last word about whether or not
the election result alters the scope for interest rate cuts,' a Treasury
official said.
City analysts expect the government to resist an early interest rate cut, or
a move to narrow bands within the European exchange rate mechanism until the
recovery is clearly underway.
Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, thinks the
government will wait to see how much pent-up expenditure was delayed by the
election before deciding whether to cut rates.
The government's room for manoeuvre on interest rates may be limited by high
German rates. UK rates are only  3/4 of a percentage point higher than in
Germany and no ERM country has lower rates than in Germany.

<TEXT>
Last Friday, UK equity and bond markets soared as investors scrambled to
take advantage of the Tories' surprise election victory. This morning,
overseas investors in particular will be taking a more considered look at
the attractions of the UK under Mr John Major.
Their conclusions could have profound consequences. International investors
bought well over Pounds 15bn worth of gilts and equities last year, against
Pounds 5bn in 1990. Also, their confidence in sterling will determine the
new government's ability to cut interest rates.
Convincing overseas investors that sterling will not be devalued within the
European exchange rate mechanism is vital if buying is to continue. Losses
from holding equities and bonds denominated in a depreciating currency can
easily wipe out any gains from the investments themselves.
'It's a very good result,' said Mr Rudolf Enz, economist with Union Bank of
Switzerland in Zurich. 'My impression is that interest rates could come down
without endangering the value of the pound. There was a risk premium on UK
rates because of fears a Labour victory would lead to a falling currency.
Now the uncertainty has gone, the risk premium should be reduced.'
Mr Anthony Pearce of Vontobel Asset Management commented there could be
scope for half a percentage point cut in interest rates as early as this
week, with another half a point cut possible if a strengthened currency
permitted Britain to enter the narrow band of the European Monetary System.
But while restoring confidence in sterling is vital to attracting overseas
investment in UK stocks and bonds, international investors remain split
about the wider economic outlook. Many remain sceptical that the new
government can stimulate either the economy or the stock market in the near
term.
'With the Conservatives back in power it is difficult to foresee any major
changes,' said Mr Philippe Ithurbite, a capital markets economist at Societe
Generale in Paris. 'There is still no sign of economic recovery in the UK
and, until this comes, the markets will stay depressed.'
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist of Bayerische Vereinsbank in Frankfurt,
said that it was too early to base investment decisions on the poll result,
despite Friday's rises in the stock and gilts markets and by sterling.
'This is only an advance instalment of confidence. It provides a basis for
Mr Major to work out policies to benefit the economy and develop more
clarity over the party's attitude to Europe,' he said.
Equally, Japanese businessmen recognise that the election alone will not
change the condition of the UK economy. As the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the
business daily, said this weekend, Mr Major has very little room for
manoeuvre in trying to stimulate the economy by managing the country's
monetary and fiscal policies.
But others are less circumspect and are predicting a wider upturn in
economic activity. Mr Harald Schmidlin, European stock market analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said: 'The Conservative victory is like a small
economic package. For me, the recession is over.'
Mr John Hickling, who runs a European fund for Fidelity, the US fund
manager, believes
the London market is still inexpensive by international and historical
standards. The first glimmers of an economic recovery are apparent, and he
thinks UK companies are geared for growth because they have taken the right
action to cut costs and improve balance sheets.
Mr Pelle Danielsen, UK equity analyst at Credit Suisse in Zurich, has been
backing defensive quality stocks with a high American exposure. But he
thinks the time is right to consider cyclical stocks, including capital
goods companies and banks.
Vontobel's Mr Pearce expects the equity market to continue moving up over
the next month or so, but says further impetus will come only from real
signs of economic recovery.
Overseas buying of sterling bonds could be more important to Mr Major's
government than overseas buying of equities.
On Friday alone, the Bank of England showed its eagerness to fund as much as
possible while sentiment is good by selling up to Pounds 4bn bonds.
However, this pace of issuance will not be maintained. One negative factor
is that Japanese investors, some of the biggest buyers of gilts last year,
are now preoccupied with the weakness of domestic markets.
Japanese investors invested Dollars 74bn in foreign securities last year,
with the UK attracting 20 per cent of the total. Much of this cash went into
government bonds, which were seen as attractive because of the high yields
available compared with other leading markets.
But last year's level of Japanese investment in UK securities was
exceptionally high and is unlikely to be maintained.
Mr Haruaki Deguchi, managing director of the London affiliate of Nippon
Life, the life insurer, says: 'The flow of Japanese investments in
securities does not depend on whether Mr Major or Mr Kinnock is in power but
on the state of the Tokyo markets.'
It remains to be seen whether overseas money from elsewhere can plug the
gap. International investors remain nervous about the state of the
government's finances and the amount which needs to be borrowed.

Some familiar themes were developed by last week's new international merger
and acquisition activity, writes Brian Bollen.
Restructuring continues in the European insurance sector where Skandia,
Sweden's leading insurer, strengthened its Scandinavian and international
position by agreeing to take over Hafnia. The deal turns the tables on
Denmark's loss-making number two insurer, which bought heavily into Skandia
late last year, in tandem with Uni Storebrand of Norway. Rubbing salt into
the wound, Uni Storebrand is swapping most of its stake in Skandia for
Skandia's reinsurance operations outside North America.
Willis Corroon, the world's second-largest insurance broker, added to its
European network by taking a 20 per cent stake in C Wuppesahl, a German
insurance broker.
Partnerships continue to develop between international airlines. The Belgian
government finally approved the alliance between Sabena, the loss-making
state-owned airline and French flag carrier Air France. The Government of
Nauru, the guano-rich Pacific island, posted a revised takeover bid for
Compass Airlines, a failed Australian carrier.
The latest western luxury retailing name to be taken over by a Far Eastern
concern is French shoe maker Charles Jourdan, being bought by Dickson
Concepts of Hong Kong.
Cadbury Schweppes is acquiring a foothold in the German confectionery market
by buying 70 per cent of chocolate and sweets maker Piasten
Schokoladenfabrik. Spanish dairy group Industrial Quesera agreed in
principle to merge its interests with Kraft General Foods.

FT  13 APR 92 / Economics Notebook: Pain in Spain falls mainly on the
service sector
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Spain's more enthusiastic newspapers carried the news yesterday that
44 per cent of the population believes the time is ripe for the trade unions
to call a one-day general strike similar to one which stopped the country in
its tracks on December 14, 1988.
The poll, though, will be neither news nor frightening to the government. In
the first place, it sailed through the 1988 strike without trouble and it
was, in fact, the unions which stumbled afterwards.
Second, if there is a general strike it will already have been discounted -
perhaps even deliberately triggered  - by the Machiavellian minds that plot
Spanish economic policy.
Chief plotter is Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister. Readers may remember
him making an elaborate attempt last summer to persuade the unions to sign a
'competitiveness pact' with the government. This involved a long-term wages
agreement and pay rises linked to increases in productivity and there was no
way the unions were ever going to sign it.
Mr Solchaga knew that, just as he knew that his tight budget proposals for
this year would be strongly rejected by the socialist party when they were
presented last autumn. But in Spanish politics deception is everything.
The unions and the left wing of the party were being set up for a terrible
revenge and the minister was carefully preparing for the first few days of
April 1992. This was when he would present his Convergence Plan, a document,
presumably, which would map out how Spain planned to meet the economic
targets set out at Maastricht in December for those EC members wishing to be
among the first to join in economic and monetary union in 1997 or, in the
worst case, 1999.
These were: to have remained in the narrow band of the exchange rate
mechanism for two years without forcing a change in parities, an inflation
rate of not more than 1.5 per cent over the three best performers and, among
other criteria, a public sector deficit of not more than 3 per cent of GDP.
Spaniards got a first taste of it at the end of March when the Prime
Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, made convergence the theme of his annual state
of the nation speech to parliament. It was a foretaste of what was swiftly
to follow. The following Friday, April 3, the finance ministry published the
plan and its most startling section was a note called 'Reinforcing the
job-seeking process'.
This was basically an announcement that Madrid was cutting unemployment
benefits across the board and, even more dramatic, that it was doubling the
time in employment required to qualify for the benefits.
If an unemployed worker refused just one job offer, the benefit would be
withdrawn. In return, the plan mumbled something about creating 60,000 new
college apprenticeships.
The unions quickly labelled this the most severe attack ever by an elected
government on organised labour. That was probably an understatement. Four
days (including a weekend) after showing copies of his plan to the press,
the minister spent six hours defending it in parliament. A day later,
Wednesday, the welfare measures were decreed in the government gazette and
they were law.
Unless Mr Gonzalez loses his nerve and stops his apparently wholehearted
support of the finance minister, there will almost certainly be a general
strike in Spain within the next 12 months. The climate is already sour in
Madrid, where pay strikes have caused serious sanitary problems in the metro
and at the airport, which have not been cleaned for weeks.
Mr Solchaga does make an oblique case for the benefit cuts in his plan. If
Spain is to converge (or lower) its public sector deficits, inflation and
interest rates and grow at the rate the plan predicts (3 per cent this year
to 3.6 per cent in 1995) it has to grow 1 per cent faster than the rest of
the Community. This may be feasible, given that it has five years to put its
macroeconomic house in order, but it assumes that above average growth is
possible because it has been achieved ever since Spain joined the Community
in 1986.
The 1986-1989 boom is, however, long gone. Last year the economy grew just
2.4 per cent. But the plan neatly separates out nominal convergence, which
involves cutting industrial subsidies and budgets to meet Maastricht
targets, and 'real' convergence, which Mr Solchaga has invented with a view
to making Spain the kind of society he wants it to be.
'Real' convergence is where the workers are more mobile, where the doctors,
lawyers, architects and chemists are not protected by Napoleonic rights
giving their clubs or colleges total control over their professions, where
it does not take three trades to fit a gas meter, where the health service
patient is entitled to expect service and expected, in return, to pay for it
and where banks service their customers and not the other way around.
The oblique case for 'real' convergence is that the causes of Spanish
inflation now are mostly to be found in the service sector. As import
barriers have fallen, Spanish industry has been forced to cut prices to
compete. Mr Solchaga wants to remould the service sector. The unemployed are
in that sector, along with the doctors, plumbers and customers.
At the moment Spain's new anti-trust authority is compiling data on the way
the professions protect themselves.
This will be passed on to the minister and the axe will fall. A sweeping,
almost Thatcherite reform of the health service is also certain to happen,
with hospitals managing their own budgets and patients probably paying a
larger portion of their prescriptions.
The political calculation in all of this marks a dramatic change from Mr
Gonzalez' caution of the past decade.
With exactly half the seats in parliament now and an election obligatory by
October next year, he could probably improve his majority by doing nothing.
By deciding to shake up the workers, the health service and the professions,
he risks losing support. Clearly, though, he is convinced that does not
matter.

FT  13 APR 92 / Three-way contest for helicopter deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S General Electric Company is set to confront British Aerospace and
Westland in a Pounds 2bn contest to manage the supply of anti-tank attack
helicopters for the British army.
The three companies are expected to compete for selection as prime
contractor, with each proposing a different foreign helicopter.
GEC is believed to have been negotiating a pact with Bell Helicopter Textron
of the US to put forward the latest version of the US manufacturer's
SuperCobra helicopter as a surprise third British-led entry in the contest.
BAe has already reached a preliminary agreement with the French-German
Eurocopter consortium for the planned Tiger helicopter, with BAe poised to
take the lead role in a UK contract.
Eurocopter is a joint venture between France's state-controlled Aerospatiale
and MBB, part of the Daimler-Benz group.
Favourite for the contract, however, is the US AH-64 Apache, which Westland
proposes to assemble in the UK under an agreement with the helicopter's
manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas. Westland is Britain's only helicopter
maker.
Tenders were due to be formally invited this spring but the Ministry of
Defence has put this off until October.
The Conservative election victory is expected to reinforce the MoD's
determination to hold a competition, in spite of pressure from army
commanders to proceed with an early order for the Apache.
GEC would not comment on the possibility of a joint bid with Bell. But Mr
David Fletcher, managing director of its defence arm GEC-Marconi, has made
no secret of the company's continuing ambitions to secure a foothold in the
helicopter business.
Last year, GEC failed in a joint bid with BAe to take responsibility for a
Pounds 1.5bn contract to supply the EH101 Merlin anti-submarine helicopter
to the Royal Navy. The helicopter is made by Westland in collaboration with
Agusta of Italy, but GEC supplies a number of key systems. That contract was
awarded to IBM, the US computer group, in association with Westland.
Just emerging from an order slump, Westland initially tried to play a double
game in the attack-helicopter contest by reaching collaboration agreements
with both McDonnell Douglas and Eurocopter. But last year it let its option
with the Franco-German group lapse.
The MoD aims to receive bids next spring and place a contract in mid-1994.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Confirmation in Paris last week that the French finance ministry is
preparing legislation to outlaw partial takeovers is a welcome development.
The practice of making bids for only two-thirds of a company's equity has
long antagonised the institutions, besides reinforcing outside suspicions
that the Paris market is tilted against minority shareholders. An important
turning point was this year's partial offer by Pinault for the Parisian
stores group Au Printemps, which infuriated a wide range of market opinion.
Significantly, the Agnellis were quick on a later occasion to convert their
initial two-thirds bid for Exor into a full takeover bid when mutterings of
disapproval turned into a crescendo of discontent.
While bourse reform in the last decade has improved France's international
standing, it would be wrong to think that the country is about to become a
paradise for the likes of Lord Hanson. The concept of concert parties
remains ill-defined and, though the spirit of the new law will be against
them, one wonders just where the line will be drawn. The government will be
reluctant to surrender its power to intervene where defence, banking and
other strategic interests are at stake. A key challenge, though, is to find
a way of conducting takeovers which does not involve excessive use of the
courts. The disagreement between the COB and the CBV - the two Stock
Exchange authorities - is part of the problem. Much as it may stick in local
throats, some body based on the UK's Takeover Panel may ultimately be
required.

FT  13 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One might well ask why Mr Norman Lamont ever worried about balancing the
budget over the cycle. By the time the election result was confirmed last
Friday, the Bank of England had not only officially issued Pounds 1.6bn in
new paper but had also made undisclosed sales of around Pounds 1bn and
announced an auction for the end of the month. And still the long gilt
future closed nearly four points up on the day.
After adding in an estimated Pounds 1.5bn of overfunding for the financial
year just closed as well as around Pounds 800m of calls on existing issues
due during April, the Bank has already covered nearly Pounds 5bn of this
year's requirement. So the alarm that greeted disclosure of the Pounds 28bn
PSBR for 1992-3 looks somewhat overdone. It helps that the election is not
only out of the way but has been won outright by the Tories. That should
make this year's autumn spending round less worrying for the market than it
would have been under a minority Labour chancellor.
This is not to say that funding the PSBR will be plain sailing from now on.
It remains a general worry that Japanese purchases of US government bonds
could dry up, undermining government bond markets everywhere.
Closer to home, the assumption behind Friday's surge was that the UK's
commitment to the ERM was finally established, thus reducing future
inflationary risk and allowing gilt yields to converge towards German levels
as Europe proceeds towards currency union. Convergence is by no means
automatic, however. The UK's obsession with its election may have obscured
doubts elsewhere about the Maastricht Treaty, typified in Denmark's
referendum plan. Such concerns could quickly undermine the convergence
theory and even prompt speculation about a D-Mark revaluation, which would
be a worry for overseas investors in UK gilts.
Although the UK PSBR is still not large in real terms for this stage in the
cycle, the market cannot ignore the fact that it will double this year. Next
year it will rise again, even under the Treasury's optimistic growth
assumptions. It thus becomes clear why the Bank of England was so quick to
avail itself of Friday's opportunity.
Expectations of a base rate cut at some stage in the summer could support
the short end of the market over coming weeks, allowing the Bank to dribble
out some more paper. However, the spread over German bonds has narrowed to
only around 150 basis points from well over 200 ahead of the election. Since
France, with its better inflation record, still maintains a yield gap
against Germany of around 80 points, that seems enough UK outperformance for
the time being. Admittedly, the auction will tap the long end of the market
hitherto neglected by the Bank. But until it fixes the amount involved after
Easter, the possibility of up to Pounds 3bn in extra supply will also
overshadow the market. After Friday's frenzy, it needs a period of calm.

FT  13 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The price of Mr Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the turmoil of last Friday, the most pressing question for the UK
markets this morning is how much foreign money is still heading for London.
From the international investor's viewpoint, a stable right-of-centre
government with a five-year term ahead of it is a scarce and valuable
commodity. If it offers a yield of over 9 per cent on its bonds and nearly 5
per cent on equities, so much the better. The snag is a familiar one:
currency risk.
Despite the markets' preoccupation with Labour as the party of devaluation,
it is worth recalling that all the overt hostility to the ERM in recent
months has come from the Tory camp. Much of it can be ignored as
disaffection among the Thatcherite old guard. But when a centrist Tory
newspaper like The Sunday Times calls, as it did yesterday, for sterling to
be devalued by 10 per cent within the system, the foreign investor is
entitled to ask how much has changed.
One answer is that Mr Major, who was responsible as chancellor for taking
sterling into the ERM at its present rate, can now do just as he likes. If
he did not crack when the Tories were behind in the polls, he is scarcely
likely to do so now. Against that is the fact that discussion of the ERM, as
of all things European, was suppressed in the run-up to the election
precisely because the Tories were internally divided. If UK economic
recovery proves prompt and durable, the issue should die. If not, the
wrangling is all too likely to return to the surface.
That apart, a great deal depends on how much demand for UK financial assets
was suppressed in advance of the election. But it is sobering to compare
Friday's reaction to what happened on ERM entry 16 months ago. Then, the
FT-SE rose 130 points in the first two days. Over the next fortnight, it
lost it all again. The reason, then as now, was that less had changed than
the market first imagined.

FT  13 APR 92 / Russian leaders threaten to quit if powers are curbed
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government is expected to decide today whether to resign after a
weekend vote by parliament threatened to hobble its market reforms and limit
its powers.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, yesterday threatened to
quit with his team of economic reformers unless an 11th hour compromise,
worked out with parliamentary leaders, is adopted by the Congress of
People's Deputies.
The compromise resolution, due to be put to the vote today, frees the
government from having to make specific policy changes which had been
demanded by parliament on Saturday. But it leaves untouched a three-month
deadline parliament gave itself to produce a new law on how the government
is appointed - giving it the right to sack the cabinet. A spokesman for Mr
Gaidar said last night that parliament's long list of policy demands was
unrealistic, contradictory and would cost as much as Rbs1,500bn.
The Congress of People's Deputies' decisions in effect gave the government
three more months in office and demanded changes which Mr Gaidar described
as 'the death of any hopes of serious co-operation with the outside world in
healing our economy'.
'If you try seriously to put into effect what the Congress agreed today . .
. you must understand that this is the road to the collapse of the financial
system,' Mr Gaidar said on Saturday. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a vice-premier,
said a Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.9bn) western aid package for Russia to assist
the switch to a market economy now 'hung by a thread'.
President Boris Yeltsin's supporters said after the vote that the Russian
leader might call a referendum on whether the country wanted presidential
government or a weak parliamentary system. The issue has yet to be decided
because Russia has not adopted a new constitution.
On Friday evening the government was set to celebrate its survival with a
series of successes for Mr Yeltsin earlier in the day.
But after a vote of no confidence in the government was easily defeated on
Saturday morning, Mr Yeltsin's request to retain the premiership and the
right to name the cabinet until the end of the year fell 39 votes short of
the 531 needed.
The former Soviet Union's four nuclear republics have failed to agree on a
joint ratification of the Start treaty, agreed with the US before the Soviet
Union collapsed, to cut long-range nuclear arsenals. The disagreement
centred on Ukraine's refusal at weekend talks in Moscow to recognise Russia
as the Soviet Union's heir with respect to the treaty.

FT  13 APR 92 / German growth estimates halved: Economists urge Bundesbank
to cut rates and help Europe beat recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK should cut interest rates later this year to help pull
western Europe from the grip of recession and stimulate the stagnating
economy at home, according to Germany's leading independent economists.
Halving their estimates for real west German growth this year to only 1 per
cent from their 2 per cent forecast made last autumn, they say that even
this improvement depends mostly on a real freeze in state spending and
moderate pay settlements. Growth last year was 3.1 per cent.
With national debt financing costing an estimated DM100bn (Pounds 35.2bn)
this year, the experts propose fiscal sanctions against Lander (states) and
local authorities which raise spending by more than inflation. In a report
to be presented to the government this morning, the country's five main
economic institutes base their modest hopes on rising consumer spending at
home and increased economic activity in Japan and the US.
However, they add, even though the latest data seem to suggest the German
economy may be stabilising, 'it is not clear if the downturn will continue
or if the turning point has been reached'.
Other western European countries, important export markets, could be
stimulated only by 'a considerable reduction in German interest rates', the
report says.
They expect capital market interest rates to fall in the second half, and
then 'the Bundesbank should not hesitate to reduce its lead interest rates'.
The independent, Frankfurt-based central bank is the dominant force in
European Community monetary policy. Its rigid position on interest rates,
underlined last December when it raised its discount rate to 8 per cent and
the Lombard rate for lending to banks to 9.75 per cent, has been widely
blamed for holding back recovery in Britain, France and other Community
countries.
Although cuts have been generally expected for this autumn, optimism has
wavered recently as fears of inflationary German wage settlements have
increased, growth has slowed and overall economic prospects dimmed.
Today's report seems unlikely to remove all the uncertainties. Its forecasts
are based partly on the assumption that average pay rises will be 6 per cent
this year, compared with 6.7 per cent in 1991.
There is some improvement, however, in forecasts for consumer price
increases. They are now expected to average 3.75 per cent, compared with the
earlier forecast of 4 per cent and last year's rate of 3.6 per cent.
In recent months, the bank has made no secret of its concern about
widespread inflationary pay claims. Last December's rates rise was also
intended to send a clear signal that it would not tolerate inflation at the
then-current levels of about 4 per cent.

question is what is unique about the number 1,729.
Legend - enshrined in no less than the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations  -
has it that the Indian mathematician Ramanujan instantly identified 1,729 as
'the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different
ways' (13 + 123 on the one hand, and 103 + 93 on the other).
In that case, Ramanujan was wrong, says Jonathan Mapley of Royal London
Insurance. The far smaller number 91 can be formed as the sum of two cubes
in two different ways, although in one instance the cube is negative: 33 +
43 = 91, and 63 + - 53 = 91.
Fortunately for poor old 1,729, two other readers who entered the quiz have
come up with something else about it that looks to be truly unique. It is
the biggest number with prime factors (including 1) which each differ from
the next by the lowest positive perfect number, 6 (1 x 7 x 13 x 19).

The phrase 'sinking fund' has acquired a somewhat shameful ring for Britain
with a development in the small Danish town of Ulfborg-Vemb, in west
Jutland.
Its inhabitants still tell of the tragedy that befell the Royal Navy on the
nearby coast at Thorsminde in a fearful storm on Christmas Eve, 1811. In the
raging wind both Nelson's former flagship, the 98-gun St George, and the
74-gun Defence were driven ashore there, and broke up. Some 1,400 souls
perished, only 11 of the two ships' crews surviving, of whom one died within
24 hours of being rescued.
Since divers found the St George's wreck in 1969, marine archaeologists from
Rinmgkjobing Museum have supervised further explorations, recovering pieces
of British naval history by the thousand. To give them a home, Ulfborg-Vemb
has built a special museum.
Of the Pounds 600,000 cost, the township itself has contributed nearly a
third, the European Community has coughed up Pounds 80,000, and sponsors
have provided the rest. And Britain?
Well, the opening ceremony was performed by UK ambassador to Denmark Nigel
Williams, and the Royal Navy was represented at it by Commander Robert
Kirkwood, defence attache in Copenhagen. As for money, however, the Brits
have apparently not even contributed enough for a ha'porth o' tar.

Meanwhile, it's nice to know that at least some of the 300-plus bankers
assembling in Toronto today to hear Olympia &amp; York's debt-restructuring
plans will be making a special contribution towards keeping the
financially-strapped developer on an even keel.
They are the ones who have elected to stay at the Camberley Club, a posh but
little-known hotel in the heart of the city's financial district. The
52-room Camberley occupies the 28th and 29th floors of the 68-storey Scotia
Plaza tower. O&amp;Y owns Scotia Plaza and, not surprisingly, books many of its
out-of-town guests into the Camberley.
The hotel returns the favour. Its usual room rate is CDollars 210 a night.
Corporate clients get a special rate of CDollars 170, but the best deal is
offered to tenants of O&amp;Y buildings, who pay just CDollars 120. Bankers
expecting to return to Toronto in coming months as the debt-restructuring
talks drag on will be pleased to hear that the Camberley is happy to offer
its ultra-low Reichmann rate to them as well.

Every one knows that Olympia &amp; York's Reichmann brothers, Heron's Gerald
Ronson, and Speyhawk's Trevor Osborne are in deep trouble because they
borrowed too much money. They stand to lose a lot, if not their jobs. But
who can remember the name of a single banker, as opposed to a bank, who lent
them so much loot?
Take Barclays Bank, for example. If one adds in its involvement in the
highly leveraged 1989 takeover of Imry Merchant Developers then it appears
to have made a series of ill-judged property investments (sorry, loans).
Over the last five years its UK property lending has risen from Pounds 1.2bn
to Pounds 5.4bn, or two and a half times as fast as its overall balance
sheet. While it is impossible to tell whether heads have rolled inside
Barclays as a result of what looks like over-zealous lending, one fears not.
Indeed, Sir John Quinton, who has headed Barclays during its property binge,
stresses the bank's 'relatively cautious' approach to the property sector.
Were it not for the fact that accident-prone NatWest is once again more
highly rated than Barclays, one would not suspect that the latter had a
problem. Perhaps Sir John will use the occasion of this month's annual
meeting to sound a note of contrition?

FT  13 APR 92 / Letter: Reasons for veto of Irish Republic companies from
FT-SE 100 Index 'unconvincing and discriminatory'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER D SUTHERLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Jones (April 1) seeks to justify the refusal of the FT-SE 100
Steering Committee to consider large Irish companies for inclusion in the
FT-SE 100 Index. As Mr Jones has chosen to go public on the matter, I would
like to explain why I consider the position of the steering committee to be
wholly unconvincing and seriously discriminatory.
The full name of the stock exchange is 'The International Stock Exchange of
the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited'. The Dublin exchange
is currently a constituent part of the stock exchange. Both the Dublin and
London exchanges are likely to maintain the closest operational links within
the EC - such as dual listing and equal access to equity settlement and
market information systems. Including Irish companies in the FT-SE 100 Index
would involve minimal change to its overall balance since at present only
three Irish companies have a sufficiently large market capitalisation. In
this context, for Mr Jones to compare Irish companies quoted in London with
American, Japanese or other non-EC companies is simply disingenuous.
It is suggested that the purpose of the Index is to provide an indicator of
performance of UK companies. Yet, a substantial number of FT-SE 100
companies have a considerable proportion of their assets abroad or generate
most of their turnover or profit outside the UK. Inclusion of the eligible
Irish companies would not alter in any fundamental sense investors' exposure
to companies with a primary listing on the stock exchange. Indeed, not only
would some of the eligible Irish companies provide an exposure to sectors
not currently reflected adequately in the Index, they also interact
substantially with the UK economy and provide significant employment. In
this context, the steering committee's rule requiring a company to be
incorporated and registered for tax in the UK simply does not reflect
economic or industrial reality.
The FT-SE 100 Index is widely perceived to be the premier index,
representative of those blue chip companies which have their primary listing
on the stock exchange. That is the common sense understanding of equity
market observers everywhere and the Index is presented and marketed as such
in the print and TV media throughout the world. The other indices mentioned
by Mr Jones do not have the same economic impact. Are not market
participants entitled to expect that eligible Irish companies will be
included in the premier representative index of the stock exchange?
Mr Jones is trying to defend the indefensible. The current practice of the
steering committee has the effect of limiting the market in shares of Irish
companies, to the prejudice of investors, and of imposing on them dissimilar
conditions to those applied to companies incorporated in the UK.
The steering committee should think again and act quickly to redress this
injustice.

FT  13 APR 92 / Leading Article: From recession to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTORATE has warmed to the Conservative party. The economy is likely
to be less helpful. Increased confidence is wonderful; real interest rates
at 5 per cent or more are not. As in some rather less important areas, here
too Mr Major's government needs to take stock.
It must start with the opportunities and the dangers facing the economy. The
opportunity is to attain price stability at last; the danger is that there
will be no real recovery. The challenge is to exploit the opportunity and
avoid the dangers. Mr Major has the time to do both. But experience during
the last term demonstrates that he does not have limitless time.
Most pundits have been as mistaken in their understanding of UK economic
policy as were their brethren of its politics. Entry into the ERM was not a
repudiation of monetarism; it was its apotheosis: the UK economy is not only
subject to the drag of a nominal exchange rate anchored in the D-Mark, but
is guided by a target for broad money quite as tight as during the early
years of the Thatcher administration. But then it was sterling M3; now it is
D-Mark M3.
Any consistently pursued monetary target will work in the end, however
disconcertingly. Everyone should now act on the assumption that inflation
will fall to levels not seen for a generation. Pay settlements, for example,
must be no more than 2-3 per cent, a level consistent with sustained low
inflation and enhanced competitiveness. But lower inflation is not the end
of the story. The real costs of achieving it in unemployment and reduced
investment are already high and will become higher. Worse, even if finally
achieved, low inflation would still not guarantee recovery.
When overall inflation might fall as low as 2 per cent, when prices of
important assets have been falling and are widely expected to fall further,
when both individuals and companies - especially smaller ones  - are already
highly indebted, and when the world's two largest economies are themselves
suffering in the iron grip of falling asset prices and excessive
indebtedness, renewed voluntary lending and borrowing can hardly be expected
at base rates of interest anywhere near 10.5 per cent. What is more, it
should not be expected, since such borrowing is most unlikely to be sound.
It is on the pace of recovery, therefore, not on prospects for inflation,
that the government is most likely to be disappointed. The Treasury now
forecasts a recovery comparable to that from the recession of a decade ago.
Unfortunately, conditions now are far less favourable.
US comparison
Then the real exchange rate depreciated, real interest rates were lower than
now, a preceding burst of inflation had purged the economy of debt and the
US economy was the locomotive of world recovery. Now, by contrast, the real
exchange rate is stable, real interest rates are tending to rise again and
the economy is drowned in debt. What the latter might mean is revealed by
the comparison with the US, which is making a feeble recovery, despite
official interest rates little more than a third of those in the UK.
Before the government dismisses such fears, it must confront the mistakes of
the Treasury, which failed to forecast the boom of 1987-88, just as it
failed to foresee the slump of 1990-91. These failures were not an accident.
They reflect a misunderstanding of the role of credit and money in a
liberalised economy. Nothing would be more foolish than for the government
to rely on Treasury forecasts. It needs to ask, instead, what could still
block recovery.
The first danger is at home. The real exchange rate may not be grossly
overvalued, but nothing in the performance of industries producing traded
goods and services suggests it is highly competitive. A dynamic export-led
recovery looks highly unlikely. Furthermore, those who borrowed in the hope
of capital appreciation are in deepening trouble, as are the intermediaries
that made the borrowing possible.
The second danger lies in the world economy: Germany has added recession to
the instability already created by economic unification; Japan is suffering
an agonised withdrawal from a monetary overdose; the US is making an uneasy
recovery from its own rush into debt; and the Uruguay round of multilateral
trade negotiations is still not completed.
Trouble lies ahead. Not only might recovery be aborted, but a continuation
of slow growth would further undermine the UK's rapidly deteriorating public
finances. An economy growing at, say, 1-2 per cent a year cannot long afford
growth of public expenditure at 3 per cent a year, at least if the
achievement of lower inflation is not to be called into question. Mr Major's
new team, with hard-liners like Michael Portillo at the Treasury, Peter
Lilley at Social Security and Michael Howard at the Department of the
Environment, will have to put its energies into curbing public spending once
more.
The government does at least have time. It can wait a while, to ensure that
inflation is crushed. But it must start looking for sources of recovery. The
necessary condition will be far lower interest rates than now. Within the
ERM, that can be achieved either by expectation of currency appreciation
against the D-Mark; or by lower D-Mark interest rates. The former is why it
is essential to remain within the ERM's wide bands, at least for the moment.
The second appears, for now, to be a matter of waiting and hoping.
D-Mark expectations
There has been talk of sterling re-alignment. But a re-alignment within the
ERM, though helpful to producers of traded goods, is also likely to lead to
higher interest rates. So long as the D-Mark is expected never to be
re-aligned downwards, German interest rates will normally provide the floor.
The distance from that floor might well be increased by the perception that
one depreciation usually leads to another.
For the present, re-alignment is not a sensible option. But this does not
mean that Mr Major is condemned to inactivity. His main problem is German
interest rates. But it is not his problem alone. He now has the authority to
deliver home truths to Mr Helmut Kohl, preferably in the company of other
European leaders.
Mr Major should tell his friend that being a good European involves more
than rhetoric. Should the Bundesbank still feel unable to deliver a sharp
reduction in interest rates within the next year, then those unneighbourly
German fiscal deficits must be eliminated. Though speaking softly, Mr Major
should also carry a big stick. He should state that it will be unacceptable
for the remaining economies of western Europe to go on importing recession
from Germany, once they have finally attained Germany's erstwhile rate of
inflation.
At the limit monetary co-operation in Europe might collapse. That would
threaten, but need not destroy, the UK's hard-won credibility. Mr Major need
only accept that having chosen one independent central bank in the
Bundesbank, he could also choose another in the Bank of England.
It is time to take stock. It is time for leadership. The UK stands on the
brink of achieving a low inflation economy. But it does not necessarily
stand on the brink of a strong recovery. For the moment, the UK economy must
wait for something to turn up - or, more precisely, for interest rates to
turn down - in Germany. Mr Major can make that point where it matters. He
should do so at once.

FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Billy Budd - Metropolitan, New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Grimes and Billy Budd represent modern opera at the Met . Grimes,
first staged in 1948, was restaged in 1967 in a near-replica of Covent
Garden's 1947 production (producer Guthrie, designer Tanya Moiseiwitsch).
Still in use, it stirs memories for older British visitors. Budd arrived in
1978, in a strong, striking production by John Dexter.
The stage lifts were put to full use; sometimes four or five thronged decks
of the Indomitable were on view. Peter Pears sang Vere, Richard Stilwell was
Billy, and James Morris was Claggart. This Budd has also been revived often-
most recently this month when Thomas Hampson sang his first Billy, Graham
Clark his first Vere, and Charles Mackerras conducted.
While Budd was in gestation, EM Forster wrote to Britten, 'I want grand
opera mounted clearly and grandly.' The Met Grimes and Budd, played to
conservative audiences, are closer to traditional grand opera than what we
see now in Britain. After Tim Albery's sharp-eyed, sharp-edged ENO
productions, they seem curiously old-fashioned, romantic. Period pieces. In
an age when, in various fields, people are trying to recapture performance
styles of the past, this has its interest.
Dexter's Budd was sharp when it was new. It's now a softened house revival
put on after the book - fuzzy at the edges, sloppy in nautical detail that
was originally formalized and precise but now clumsy would- be-realistic.
Morris's Claggart was in keener focus, alert and energetic, particular, 14
years ago; it has become heavier, more portly, less arresting in both
physical and vocal manner.
Hampson is New York's star of the season, appearing everywhere. He opened
the Philharmonic series. He opened a new concert hall in Queens. At the Met
he has been singing Mozart's Count and Rossini's Figaro. His Largo al
factotum - newly fresh,wonderful  - was the highpoint of the city's Rossini
Birthday Gala. His Billy, however, was not altogether convincing. Onstage he
often seems a bit self-conscious, gauche; he is tall (6'5 or so), affects a
Ramey-type mane, tends to hunch his shoulders and throw his arms about. But
he has one of the most beautiful baritones around and - provided one could
accept a simple seaman's scrupulously covered and moulded tones and the
carefully cultivated diction - he was moving. The close of the gun-deck
scene, after Dansker's departure, was especially fine.
Claggart and Vere's three officers were men as or nearly as tall; beside
them Clark seemed a tiny Captain, not reaching their shoulders. His voice
was small and unattractive, but he gave an intelligent, intent, very clear
performance; a great burst of emotion in the epilogue, as he echoed Billy's
paragraph, was something new and stirring. Sir Charles's account of the
score was warmly felt, warmly played, and very sure. The sounds were
beautiful. I have heard performances more nervously exciting'the tone
leaner, the signals more sharply etched'but none more romantic.

FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Chicago Symphony Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This mighty engine is being wheeled around Europe for the ninth time, and
with all its attachments - for its repertoire for the tour demands maximum
forces. Almost anything that Richard Strauss forgot to include in Ein
Heldenleben, which we heard on Friday, was enlisted for John Corigliano's
First Symphony on Saturday. A comparable army was needed for the bleeding
chunks from Gotterdammerung that followed, instead of the popular Ravel
pieces originally advertised; but the prospect of Wagner arrangements after
Corigliano's long, anguished howl was so rebarbative that I fled.
As conducted by Daniel Barenboim, the performance of Ein Heldenleben was
technically remarkable. It is rare for so many details of the score, so many
middle and lower voices, to stand out with such confident clarity, and yet
the orchestral balance was superb. Chicago boasts some of the securest brass
in the world - not, perhaps, the warmest (their horns haven't the depth of
character of the best German and Austrian teams), but unerringly incisive.
The Battle scene was a triumph of organisation.
The engine rolled inexorably forward, but left few interpretative traces
behind. Except for a good, nasty E-flat clarinet, even the woodwind Critics
seemed to be executing a brilliant exercise without much menace.
Contrariwise, the violinist Ruben Gonzalez lavished a uniform warmth and
virtuosity on his role as Strauss's Pauline, without the petulance and
skittishness that the composer mischievously wrote into it. If Barenboim had
had more to say about this score, the orchestra would doubtless have
transmitted it perfectly; but in the event what we heard was special only
for its towering expertise.
Beethoven's 'Leonora no. 3' Overture was done in broad strokes, singularly
lacking in tension or excitement, except for a dazzling burst of
string-scales. About Mozart's G major piano concerto, K. 453, Barenboim as
soloist had almost too much to say: a more self-consciously wrought
performance would be hard to imagine. Many episodes were extremely pretty;
there were also point-making pauses in unwelcome places, and an Andante that
suffered by pretending to be an Adagio, and a Finale so deliberate and
unspontaneous that even a late acceleration failed to supply the missing
fizz.
Corigliano's 'Aids' Symphony (as it will inevitably be known) is a strange
construction. It is laden with manifestly genuine feeling, by turns angry
and desolate, but nearly all the sentiment is 'evoked' by film-music devices
 -notably, and constantly, by setting wisps of wistful music (the Albeniz
Tango, a little Tarantella by Corigliano himself) over softly dissonant
orchestral washes. So far as musical working-out goes, even in the
'twelve-note' Chaconne, there are really no symphonic tensions, just
striking colouristic effects.
Much of it is affecting, in the manner of a poignant orchestral 'opera'.
John Sharp delivered his solo 'cello part with beautiful simplicity; that,
indeed, was the main musical event of the work. A 'symphony", however, it is
not.

FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Civic pride triumphant - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chicago is a great architectural city. It is a proud place with a palpable
sense of built civic pride. It is a wonderful sensation to fly in over the
flat plains and see the pattern of giant fields turn into the grid of the
city. It is a loose grid that gradually gets tighter and tighter until it
reaches the densely interwoven streets of The Loop and then relaxes again as
the city spills quietly along the green shores of Lake Michigan. Buildings
bristle from the grid growing taller and taller until they culminate in the
confident cluster of the Sears Tower - still the tallest building the world.
The city's architecture divides neatly into two schools. First, from the
1880's the early steel frame architecture of firms like William Le baron
Jenney, Burnham and Root and Holabird and Roche dominated the commercial
growth of the city. That great American architect Louis Sullivan also worked
in Chicago with Dankmar Adler at that time, inventing a style that was both
functional and ornamental and that has seldom been improved upon.
The second Chicago school, flowering from the late 1930's, demonstrated that
the cool rationalism of architects like Mies van der Rohe could elevate the
functional glass and steel block into crystalline elegance. In between these
schools lies the distinctive and unique work of Frank Lloyd Wright, who
invented the strongly horizontal 'prairie houses' for the Chicago suburbs.
These are renowned for their casual but organised open plans and a special
sense of the tactile and visual qualities of good, natural materials.
Recently a new major civic building opened in Chicago which could mark the
beginning of a third wave of architectural development. The city decided
that it wanted a great new public library to be named after the city's first
black mayor - The Harold Washington Library Centre. The architectural
competition was won by Thomas Beeby, of the Chicago firm of Hammond, Beeby
and Babka. Their solution was completely unlike any of the other entries
because it is a powerful Beaux Arts-inspired, American classical scheme,
dense in ornament and nourished by all the richness of Chicago's
architectural tradition.
The library occupies an entire city block between State and Congress
streets. Occupies is the right word because the building completely fills
the site in a traditional way - rising from the pavements with no hint of
plaza or forecourt to break up the powerful grid of streets. It is 10
stories high, rising from a granite base with great arched windows beneath a
pediment which is below a curved vaulted roof. The scale is remarkable and
from a distance the soaring arched windows seem to suggest that New York's
Grand Central station has come to Chicago.
No one can doubt the powerful effect of civic grandeur that this new
building conveys. The exterior is temple-like: at the same time as it evokes
classical memories it seems to be reminiscent of so many European nineteenth
century temples of the arts, from the Paris Opera to the Berlin museum. It
is a coherently beautiful building gaining much of its presence from the
fact that it is in the four square Chicago tradition - a great warehouse of
books but one garbed in the civic dress that celebrates the fact that
learning and knowledge are civilised and worthwhile aspirations.
The civic dress is both strong and decorative. The colour of the exterior is
a very pleasing combination of pinkish stone and brick with a green metal
and glass attic and copper roof. It looks particularly rich and natural in a
city that has too many blank towers faced in brown reflective glass.
Additional richness is provided by the iconographic decorative programme
devised by the architect. Cast stone and carved ornament incorporates
symbols of the city's agrarian past, and books and owls to suggest learning.
But the ornamental scheme is more fundamental than just applied decoration.
The whole building is conceived as a giant Greek temple - but the columns
are replaced by vertical pilasters that appear to be suspended from giant
festoons that swing beneath a tough horizontal railing that replaces any
orthodox entablature. At each corner of the library roof there will be giant
acroterion - each one a flowering of leaves above downward glancing owls.
The glazing of the pediment is an almost Schinkel-like line of spears and
shields.
The two artists most concerned with the ornamental programme are Raymond
Kaskey and Kent Bloomer. I suppose that even Chicago is not yet ready for
full scale figurative sculpture that would truly complement the scale of the
architecture. But what we see today is a brilliant start - how many other
buildngs in the world have owls, guilloche, voussoirs, Ceres, corn stalks,
Putto blowing air (for the Windy City),festoons, palmettes, finials and
shields ?
The interior is full of workable and handsome spaces. The furniture is
solid, plain and beautifully made. There is no great interior space until
you reach the rooftop winter garden - reminiscent of Chicago's Rookery
building. This should surely be a great reading room. But I felt that it
needed a more solemn architectural treatment to be one hundred per cent
convincing as a major public space.
Movement through the library is by escalators and although some have
criticised the 'department store' feeling these evoke they seem to me to be
welcoming and efficient. Marble and terrazzo finishes add a sense of style
to the interior. There are many small and intimate places where you feel
that you want to settle down with a good book.
The triumph of the Chicago Public Library built (by the design and build
method with a developer) for a relatively modest US Dollars 195m. inevitably
encourages comparison with the British Library now under construction in
London. The British Library has no apparent civic or urban qualities and
seems destined to be one of the biggest architectural disappointments of the
century. There is a bravery about Chicago's achievement that is not
nostalgic but soundly based on permanent and durable civic and architectural
values. Will it mark the return of a comprehensible public architecture -
and a renaissance of ornament and decoration ?

FT  13 APR 92 / IRA again wrongfoots mainland security forces: How bombers
slip through the net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRA bomb attacks in the heart of the City and on a stretch of road in
north London have again demonstrated the capacity of one of the world's best
disciplined and determined terrorist organisations to wrongfoot the security
forces.
Britain's anti-terrorist squad has been in a state of high alert ever since
the IRA served notice five weeks ago that it would try to disrupt the
general election.
The squad believed there was at least one IRA cell on the mainland and that
the most likely target would be a senior politician. Its efforts appeared to
have been focused on maximising covert protection throughout the campaign.
The fact that the IRA only struck only once during the campaign -
ineffectually, with a small device in Soho - reflected not so much on the
success of the police operation as on the IRA's decision to plan one step
ahead.
Security experts rule out suggestions that Friday's bomb was a kneejerk
reaction to the electoral defeat in West Belfast of Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
The sheer size of the bombs detonated on Friday suggest the action was
planned over weeks and would have involved at least one team of IRA
volunteers on surveillance of the area as well as on the assembly and
transport of the explosive devices.
This team is likely to have been senior to and better organised than the
cell responsible for placing less destructive devices such as the one on a
railway line on Budget day. Friday's bombs are likely to have been kept in a
'safe house' in London for several days before being transported in vans to
their final destinations.
The timing of the City bomb in particular suggests that it was placed to
coincide with a post-election security lull and to maximise the propaganda
effect.
During the campaign, City of London police concentrated on protecting
buildings in their area and the local MP, Mr Peter Brooke, the outgoing
Northern Ireland Secretary.
But by Friday night security arrangements were being wound down and the
London marathon rather than the IRA was drawing on the limited police
resources available at the weekend.
There continued to be speculation yesterday that the IRA had intended to
bomb the Stock Exchange or Lloyd's - and thus halting business there - while
minimising the loss of life. But even given such a miscalculation,
hardliners within the IRA will have judged Friday's bomb a success.
The response of the City was summed up by Sir Brian Jenkins, lord mayor of
London. 'The City of London, confronted with this appalling act, has
responded with the vigour you would expect from a major international
business centre.'
The bomb shook a City that was beginning to celebrate the Conservative
victory as well as the prospects of political stability and economic
recovery. The two blasts reminded Mr Major that, however much Northern
Ireland was ignored as an issue during the election campaign, it will have
to remain high on the security and political agenda as long as the IRA
maintains its military capability.
Some security experts believe the anti-terrorist squad's failure to arrest
any of the significant figures in the current mainland campaign - or to
avert incidents such as Friday's - point to organisational failings.
But, as one senior Special Branch officer admitted during the weekend, there
is a thin divide between stepping up security and undermining the democratic
system which the police are entrusted to protect.
It is such dilemmas which the IRA attempt to exploit.

FT  13 APR 92 / Baltic employee who died worked on dealing floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BALTIC Exchange, which arranges most of the world's freight chartering
and more than half the world's ship sales, had one employee killed and six
injured, one seriously, by the IRA's bomb blast. It will lose its historic
headquarters.
The exchange was preparing yesterday to open for business in temporary
accommodation. However, although it would have been possible to hold a
market from 9am today, the exchange decided, after consultation with the
police and other authorities, to delay starting.
The Baltic has set up temporary headquarters in the Lloyd's of London
building not far from the scene of the blast. Mr Jim Buckley, the Baltic's
deputy chief executive, said: 'We could have had a market. But we will not,
because it would be unwise to bring people into this area, and the police
would prefer us not to.'
The Baltic employee who died was Mr Thomas Casey, a 49-year-old father of
four who was found under rubble after the blast. He was the most senior of
the exchange's 'waiters', the 15 liveried attendants on the trading floor.
He was on security duty on Friday evening.
Mr Buckley described him as 'a splendid man who . . . always carried out his
duties with total commitment.' Another Baltic security man is still in
hospital, but four cleaners hurt in the blast were discharged after
treatment.
Mr Buckley praised the help given by Sir Brian Jenkins, lord mayor of
London, and said offers of accommodation came 'from all round the City' soon
after the extent of the devastation became clear.
Some space was cleared yesterday at Lloyd's, however, and exchange staff
moved some records there.
The exchange's 'floor' is usually a daily meeting place for ship brokers
ready to move world trade 24 hours a day. It handles more than half the
world's bulk cargo movements - ore, coal and grain  - and a Baltic member
has probably had a hand in the majority of cargo deals that happen on a
daily basis anywhere in the world.
It was to the Baltic that the UK and US turned when they needed ships for
the Gulf war, and about 150 vessels were chartered to move tanks, ammunition
and trucks.
The Baltic owns the freehold of its building in St Mary Axe, built between
1900 and 1903, and the frontage and domed trading floor are listed as
historic structures. The building is insured by Royal Insurance and other
companies. Two years ago members shelved a Pounds 100m scheme to rebuild and
decided instead to refurbish the existing building.
Mr Ted Hartill, the City of London surveyor, said last night that the
exchange building had been very badly damaged and would have to be
demolished and rebuilt.
The exchange expects that its usual telephone number in London - 071 623
5501 - will be working today, and in-quiries can also be made on 071 283
9300.

FT  13 APR 92 / Shattered City strives for business as usual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHY MILTON, JIMMY BURNS and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE many City workers affected by Friday's IRA bomb, there was perhaps
no more telling image than the sight of senior managers and employees of
Sanwa Bank, wearing suits and protective hats, carrying black plastic bags
down Cornhill.
The bags contained the remains of the main London offices of one of Japan's
largest banking institutions, which had its windows and furniture wrecked
when the blast shattered the Commercial Union tower it occupies.
Structural engineers who continued to inspect the area yesterday said up to
1m sq ft of office space was damaged by the blast.
The cost of repairs, at an estimated Pounds 150 per sq ft, could total
Pounds 1.5bn.
Official estimates yesterday put the number of affected businesses at 36 in
some 40 buildings.
Although the Baltic Exchange and the neighbouring Chamber of Shipping are
the only buildings that will have to be demolished, several blocks in the
surrounding area remained cordoned off by police yesterday as engineers
continued their inspections.
BT said that up to 12,000 lines served by its exchange in the area had been
disrupted by the blast, which was focused on St Mary Axe, a street linking
Houndsditch and Leadenhall Street.
BT engineers worked throughout the weekend, diverting telephone services for
customers and providing lines and equipment to companies that had been
forced to relocate temporarily.
BT also set up two mobile payphone caravans yesterday at the junctions of
Leadenhall Street and Bishopsgate, and at the junction of Billiter Street
and Fenchurch Street, from which customers will today be able to make
essential calls free of charge.
Damage to the Commercial Union tower, which was opened in 1969, was
concentrated at the north-east corner.
Virtually all the building's glass was knocked out and there was widespread
damage to floors, ceilings and fittings.
However, early indications are that the building's core is intact. Power
lines have not been cut and it is hoped that lifts can be restored.
According Mr Richard Owen, a senior UK director of CU, there is 'no chance
of re-occupancy for some months,' and repair work could take up to a year.
Other insurance companies affected include two Lloyd's agencies, Cassidy
Davies and Roberts &amp; Hiscox. Cassidy Davies manages underwriting syndicates
at Lloyd's specialising in political risk insurance, and has pioneered
insurance against kidnap and ransom. Ms Beryl Hobson, Cassidy's marketing
manager, said yesterday that a small crisis management team had met over the
weekend and had completed plans to move the company's operations to new
premises near Liverpool Street station.
The agency, which employs almost 80 staff, was still assessing the damage,
but Ms Hobson insisted that it will be able to trade today. 'It's business
as usual,' she said. 'We are not going to be deflected by this little lot.'
Law firm Shaw &amp; Croft is moving staff to the Tower Hotel, near Tower Bridge
while Bangkok Bank staff will move to the Lloyd's building. National Bank of
Greece is unlikely to open, but National Westminster Bank will open as
normal. Some staff of James Capel, the stockbrokers, are expected to move
from Bevis Marks near St Mary Axe to Devonshire Square.
It is understood that Midland Bank has told some of its staff to move to
premises in London Wall. Saudi International Bank in Bishopsgate is believed
to be relocating to JP Morgan offices in the City. Royal Bank of Scotland is
understood to be transferring staff from St Mary Axe to its London
headquarters in Lombard Street. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank will operate
normally, in spite of receiving some damage to its Bishopsgate bulding.
Rosehaugh and Stanhope, joint owners of the nearby Broadgate office
development, moved quickly to allow companies affected by the blast to use
office space which had previously been empty.

FT  13 APR 92 / Commercial Union expects to trade normally today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION, the company worst affected by Friday's bomb blast, expects
to be trading normally today after a weekend of concentrated effort by its
executives.
Mr Richard Owen, one of a number of directors involved, said: 'We're aiming
to be back in a trading position as fast as possible.'
CU occupies 10 of the 23 storeys of the Commercial Union tower, its
international headquarters. It is possible that CU, along with other UK
companies, is one of the building's insurers.
CU intends to move its 650 staff who worked in the building to six sites,
four of them in Croydon, south London, and two in the City.
An advertisement in national newspapers this morning tells staff which
office to go to.
Mr Owen, together with other UK directors led by Mr Peter Ward, UK managing
director, met yesterday morning to plan how to cope with the aftermath of
the bomb-ing.
An immediate priority is the restoration of telephone communications.
The CU tower housed the group's central telephone and computer exchange,
linking its branch operations nationwide. By last night, it had been
reconfigured and moved to Whyteleafe, Surrey.
CU was less affected by the blast than it would have been had it occurred 10
or 15 years ago. The group moved many of its back-office claims and
administration functions to Croydon in the early 1980s. The building damaged
by the bomb houses CU's London market insurance operations, the group's main
asset management divisions, the Quilter Goodison stock-broking subsidiary
and central corporate finance and strategic planning units.
CU owns 20 per cent of the building as part of a consortium and holds the
main lease.
Quilter Goodison, the private client and fund management arm of CU, said
yesterday it would relocate about 150 of its 200 staff to the Cranwood
Street, City Road, offices of ACT, the software bureau, and expected to be
operating normally this morning.

FT  13 APR 92 / Thames TV and BBC to launch satellite channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION has linked with BBC Enterprises in a move to launch a
satellite television channel as early as September.
The channel, which will be broadcast by the Astra satellite system, will be
devoted to general entertainment based on thousands of hours of programmes
in the Thames and BBC libraries.
'This could be the first of many investments in other niche channels that
might appear on Astra,' Mr James Arnold-Baker, chief executive of BBC
Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC, said yesterday.
It is the first new project to be announced by Thames since October when it
lost its franchise. The company will cease to be a broadcaster at the end of
this year.
Thames and the BBC will each hold no more than 20 per cent of the new joint
venture, and other minority investors are being sought.
Mr Richard Dunn, Thames chief executive, said yesterday that the new venture
did not preclude a minority investment in a bid for Channel 5, the new
television network which will be able to reach three quarters of homes in
the UK. The decision on Channel 5, which will be taken within the next few
weeks after the Independent Television Commission publishes the terms of the
licence.
The new Thames strategy is to be an independent programme producer and
supplier. BBC involvement in the new channel, which will be available to
more than 3m cable and satellite homes in the UK, is part of the
corporation's strategy to become involved in satellite television while
exploiting 25,000 to 30,000 hours of programmes in its library. The new
channel will need a total investment of Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m.
'We are confident that the time is right for the introduction of this
high-quality, popular programming service for satellite and cable viewers,
and we are delighted to create it in partnership with the BBC,' Mr Dunn said
yesterday.
He believes satellite television will follow the pattern of cable with bands
of different charges.
In addition to the premium fee for such programmes as recent films and
exclusive sports events there will also be a basic tier of channels with a
more modest charge for the entire package.

FT  13 APR 92 / Insurer to sell some of its London property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION, the insurance group which is one of the largest property
investors in the UK, has put nearly a quarter of its Pounds 1.25bn central
London office portfolio up for sale.
Mr Nick Price, chief estates manager, said he was not aware that any of the
property was damaged by Friday's bomb attack in the City.
The attempt to sell results from Norwich Union's desire to reduce its
exposure to UK property and channel more of its funds into bonds and
overseas property.
Norwich Union has an unusually high exposure to UK property, which accounts
for Pounds 3.5bn of its Pounds 12bn with-profits life fund. 'We were very
overweight in property by comparison with our competitors,' said Mr Price.
The group is concerned about the long-term growth prospects of property,
particularly in the City, where the oversupply of offices is expected to
delay the recovery in rental values for several years. Values of City
offices fell 33 per cent last year, according to the Investment Property
Databank, a research group. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a City broker, predicts
further falls of 22 per cent by the end of next year.
News of the proposed sale contributed to the depressed state of property
shares on Friday.
Analysts viewed the decision as further evidence of the pressures facing the
property sector, which is suffering from oversupply, falling rental values
and high borrowings.
Norwich Union is also disposing of shopping centres in Birmingham, and in
Enfield and Barnet in London. The sales, which are on the point of
completion, are expected to raise Pounds 80m.

FT  13 APR 92 / Shell seeks to change decision-making policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL UK is to change its policy on decision-making after finding that
delegating decisions to individuals and small groups led to worsened
communications in the group, according to Personnel Management, the magazine
of the Institute of Personnel Management.
The UK arm of the oil multi-national found that communications suffered as
departments became cut off from each other and the centre of the
organisation, the magazine says.
Shell said it would retain its basic structure, but would seek to improve
communications between departments.
Speaking at a conference, Mr John Wybrew, Shell's public affairs and
planning director, said a conflict had emerged between professionals who
represented the 'Shell way' of doing things, and executives who wanted fast
decision-making.
He warned: 'In adopting fashionable personnel management ideas, for which
there are very good reasons, you have to be careful how you integrate them
into the business.'

FT  13 APR 92 / Japanese working practices on offer to Rover unions:
Decision on deal will be disclosed today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the British Aerospace subsidiary, will learn today whether its 32,000
employees have backed a Japanese-style package which could enable them for
the first time to become significantly more productive than their
counterparts at several other UK car companies.
Unions will announce the results of a ballot on the package - one of the
most comprehensive attempts by a UK car manufacturer to transform working
practices and bargaining procedures.
After nine months of negotiations union leaders have warmly embraced the
package. Seen as Rover's answer to the growing threat from Japanese
manufacturers, it includes plans to remove remaining job demarcations and to
reduce the risk of strikes. It would also cut the number of pay-bargaining
forums from two to one and require 'continuous improvement' from all
workers.
In spite of attractions which include improved job security and common terms
and conditions for all workers, some may vote against the package because of
relatively minor clauses. One fear is over the phasing-out of 'clocking on'
arrangements. Some workers are wary of trusting attendance records to team
leaders.
The main elements of the package would eventually be introduced even if
there was a vote against it. Some changes, including greater team working
and flexibility, are already under way.
A vote against the package would, however, arrest the progress in the
introduction of the cultural change the company is trying to instil in its
workforce to improve competitiveness.
Professor Daniel Jones of Cardiff Business School, who specialises in
motor-industry management, said full implementation would help the
productivity gap between Rover and Nissan. He believes it would enable Rover
to move ahead of the UK operations of Ford and General Motors in terms of
hours per worker in the body and assembly plants.
In the past few years, all UK car manufacturers have adopted changes in
working practices and conditions. Union leaders say the Rover package
embraces more change than other companies have made in one attempt.
The clause which has attracted most attention is one which some observers
have interpreted as offering a Japanese-style 'jobs for life'. The clause
says: 'Employees who want to work for Rover will be able to stay with
Rover.' Under the deal, staff reductions would be achieved through
retraining and voluntary severance.
In spite of the guarantee, union leaders have no illusions that if the car
market dipped markedly, compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out. Mr
David Bower, personnel director, says: 'It is difficult to say there would
never be compulsory redundancies, but that is the intention.'
The agreement does not include a no-strike clause but introduces the
possibility of solving disputes with binding arbitration if both sides
agree. It also includes changes which would make it harder for one union
acting alone to call out its members on strike.
The deal also states that 'employees will be expected to be flexible,
subject their ability to do the job.'

FT  13 APR 92 / Opposition to roles for investors reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY finance directors are opposed to allowing shareholders a greater say in
corporate decision making, according to a survey by 3i, the venture capital
group.
The survey questioned finance directors in about a third of the UK's 750
largest companies. It found that many opposed reforms which would give more
control to shareholders.
Some of the options for reform are expected to be backed by the Cadbury
committee's investigation into the financial aspects of corporate governance
when it publishes its report next month. The committee, chaired by Sir
Adrian Cadbury, is expected to recommend that audit and remuneration
committees be composed solely of non-executive directors who in turn should
have special responsibilities for reporting to shareholders.
Allowing shareholders to be represented on audit and remuneration committees
was opposed by 82 per cent and 78 per cent respectively of those surveyed,
while 78 per cent opposed consultation with institutional shareholders on
new board appointments.
The survey found that 38 per cent of finance directors either favoured a
two-tier corporate board structure or were unsure of its merits. A third
believed that more stakeholders such as employees and local communities
should be represented on boards.
In addition, the survey found that most finance directors believed that the
UK's current system of corporate governance was biased toward short-term
results at the expense of investment and long-term performance.
A total of 45 per cent of those surveyed said that, in spite of their
concerns about short-termism among investors, they had not taken adequate
steps to ensure that their own pension-fund trustees had a sufficiently
long-term outlook.

FT  13 APR 92 / Exporters to demand more government aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTERS are to demand a change in government policy after a meeting during
the general election campaign at which they were assured by Mr John Wakeham
that an incoming Conservative government would address their criticisms.
Mr Wakeham, a former energy secretary who is to be leader of the Lords in
the new government, held a confidential meeting a fortnight ago with
representatives of export organisations including chambers of commerce, the
Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Exports.
'The point was to drive home the way the Treasury strangles support for
exports while our competitors get much more help,' said an export
association official who attended the meeting.
The organisations had asked to meet Mr John Major, the prime minister, after
deciding that repeated meetings with junior trade ministers had failed to
convey their concerns to the highest levels of the government.
Some of the bodies represented at the Wakeham meeting wanted to make their
disenchantment with government policy public. They were persuaded to keep
their concerns private by Mr Wakeham's assurance that their complaints would
be investigated by a new Tory government.
A strengthened and streamlined approach to export promotion is likely to be
one of Mr Michael Heseltine's priorities in his new role as trade and
industry secretary.
An exporter who attended the Wakeham meeting said: 'We pointed out that
Labour had come out with positive proposals to help exporters and the
Liberal Democrats were fairly clear. But we had been through the Tory
manifesto, and other than vague references they had not said what they would
do to help exporters.'
Exporters want a significant reduction in export insurance premiums to match
levels elsewhere in Europe. They also want a consolidated advisory service
to promote exports. The CBI last week focused on export promotion as one of
its main priorities for the incoming government. It proposed concentrating
all export promotion at the Department of Trade and Industry.

HOUSE PRICES should be on a gently rising trend by the end of the year, even
though they are likely to remain weak over the next few months, Halifax
Building Society said yesterday in its monthly housing market figures.
Halifax said house prices were almost static last month, rising only 0.1 per
cent. The slight rise compared with falls of 1.2 per cent in January and 1.1
per cent in February. However, on a seasonally adjusted basis, house prices
were still weak last month, falling 0.8 per cent.
Prices were generally stronger outside southern England, and in Scotland and
Northern Ireland were higher than at the same time last year.
House prices generally fell 5 per cent in the 12 months to March 1992.
Prices in Greater London and the south-east were respectively 8.4 per cent
and 7.7 per cent lower than in March last year.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Safe pair of hands could have a grip - The
odds are favourable for the shadow chancellor in Labour's leadership stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLESS Mr Bryan Gould has a last-minute change of mind, the Labour
leadership contest that begins in earnest today will centre on whether the
shadow environment spokesman can resist the juggernaut now rolling for Mr
John Smith.
The odds are heavily stacked against him. The case for the shadow chancellor
lies heavily with his national popularity, his natural gravitas (a sharp
contrast to Mr Neil Kinnock) and the widely held perception that he is, to
coin a cliche, a 'safe pair of hands'.
Furthermore, as one trade unionist put it: 'John has always been seen as the
obvious successor of proven weight. Why would we risk it all now for some
sort of gamble?'
That view is common in the union movement where Mr Smith has more than
momentum on his side. He already commands the broad support of two of the
three union giants - the GMB and the soon-to-merge engineers and
electricians.
He may not have to wait long to get the final card in this three card trick
 -the mighty TGWU general workers union. All these unions would have to
ballot their members, but there is little likelihood that the rank and file
would disagree with their leaderships.
In consequence, when an electoral college is gathered, many smaller unions
would fall in behind the giants, delivering the bulk of the unions' 40 per
cent share of the college to his campaign.
With Mr Robin Cook and Mr Gordon Brown, respectively the health and the
trade and industry spokesmen, now believed unlikely to run, the Scottish
party - nearly a fifth of Labour's total representation at Westminster -
would also follow en masse. Scots' solidarity is deemed essential. Without
it there are real dangers of schism between those now seeking an alliance
with the Scottish Nationalists and the 'Unionists', opposed to any such
collaboration in spite of the election outcome's dashing of the dream of a
Scottish parliament.
Mr Smith can also expect the support of the great majority of the shadow
cabinet, who know on which side their bread is buttered, and large swathes
of the more traditional Labour activists in the constituency parties.
Popular in the country and in the the Commons - one hard left MP commented
recently: 'John has no real enemies' - Mr Smith's election looks a fait
accompli.
So why is Mr Gould almost certain to stand? The answer lies in the lingering
doubts.
Supporters of the New Zealand-born challenger believe that their man has an
added ingredient that the shadow chancellor's somewhat old-fashioned,
redistributionist style of Labourism lacks.
They argue that even had Mr Smith led this year's electoral assault on the
Tory hegemony, he could not have won. And they add that only Mr Gould has
the broader vision - perhaps, in part, due to his Antipodean roots - that
could further develop the Kinnockite reforms to create a progressive
'crusade' that would generate enthusiasm well beyond Labour's working-class
base.
Try to pin Mr Gould down on the details of this vision and a certain
vagueness descends. In a BBC interview yesterday, the shadow environment
secretary was scrupulous in his praise for Mr Kinnock's campaign.
His critique centred, however, on the party's failure to do much more than
eliminate negative policies and past mistakes and its concentration almost
solely on issues rather than inspiring the voters' imagination.
When it comes to specific policy issues, Mr Gould's differences with Mr
Smith are often a matter of tone.
Unlike his rival - whose views are undeclared  - Mr Gould is a known critic
of proportional representation. Today, he claims he is open to influence by
the findings of Labour's Plant committee into electoral reforms, on which he
sits.
More strongly diverging from Mr Smith, he is a Euro-sceptic and an advocate
of at least a debate on sterling's positioning in the exchange rate
mechanism - a clear signal that he favours devaluing.
All these positions will carry considerable weight with the hard left in the
Campaign group, which will put up a merely symbolic candidate - Mr Ken
Livingstone or Mr Dennis Skinner are being mooted.
But Mr Gould is also something that the old left despises - a bit of a
yuppie. His meteoric rise in the aftermath of the 1983 election debacle was
halted after 1987 by what was widely thought to be a devilish alliance
between Kinnockite insiders, jealous of his growing influence, and the
champions of old-fashioned Clause Four socialism.
A whispering campaign then poured scorn on his argument that Labour should
'leapfrog' Thatcherism with a radical agenda including such ideas as
promoting employee share-ownership schemes as a modern means of enhancing
workers' influence on corporate decision-making. He is keen that Labour's
close links with the unions, not least in their voting strength at
conference, be reduced rapidly.
Other arguments for Mr Gould are negative ones. Mr Smith, say his opponents,
is already a familiar face and could look stale by the time of the next
election. Furthermore, he has had a heart attack - is he up to the strain of
the leadership? Mr Smith's supporters reply with a list of the Scots peaks
he has climbed.
For Mr Gould, his best, perhaps his only, hope of upsetting the Smith
bandwagon is to have time to put his case and to go out and take it to the
party around the country. For that reason, his camp will fight any effort to
bring forward the finale of the contest before the Blackpool conference in
October.
But on this they may already be too late. If Mr Kinnock today argues that
the hand-over should be as soon as possible, Labour's national executive
committee could order the process to be completed by June. 'Bryan's problem
is that he has a very complex message to sell,' said one of his admirers.
'The election is not a left-right battle, it is much more blurred. For that
reason, Smith looks like a shoo-in.'

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Mayhew move gets muted welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew's ap-pointment as Northern Ireland secretary received a
muted welcome in Dublin yesterday - revealing suspicions that he needs to
over come in the Irish Republic if 'round-table' talks on Northern Ireland
are to resume.
Regarded as affable but determined, Sir Patrick had a record as attorney
general that soured relations with Dublin.
He clashed with the Irish judiciary over the extradition of Father Patrick
Ryan, on alleged terrorist offences in 1988, and for not prosecuting members
of the security forces accused of operating a 'shoot-to-kill policy'.
Sir Patrick will meet his Irish counterparts at an Anglo-Irish conference
later this month. In theory that should lead to a suspension of further
conferences, allowing inter-party talks on the political future of Northern
Ireland to restart.
Mr John Major's decision to replace Mr Peter Brooke may not lead to a smooth
transition - not only because of Sir Patrick's past rifts with Dublin.
Mr Brooke earned as a reputation as a skilled conciliator, adept at keeping
Unionist and nationalist politicians at least moving towards the negotiating
table. The welcome Unionist MPs gave his appointment of Sir Patrick will
only exacerbate nationalist suspicions.
Mr Major's decision to replace Mr Brooke probably reflects their differing
personalities and political outlook. Mr Brooke was an old-school Tory,
uneasy with Mr Major's classless Conservatism and new generation of
ministers. Yet Sir Patrick, aged 62, is older than Mr Brooke.
Yesterday the Irish government said that it looked forward to working with
Sir Patrick, but unofficially there was disquiet.
'I would not have been enamoured by some of his decisions as a lawyer,' said
Mr Jim Tunney, the chairman of the ruling Fianna Fail party. 'But law is
different from politics, and I would rather wait and see how he performs as
a politician.'
A spokesman for the opposition Labour party, the sister party of the SDLP in
Northern Ireland, said: 'He would not have been our choice. He has a record
which makes us uneasy, although the person appointed is less important than
a commitment to the talks process.'

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Treasury choice signals spending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Portillo's appointment as chief secretary to the Treasury points
to battles ahead as the government attempts to bring public expenditure
under control.
At this time of year it is commonplace for ministers and Treasury officials
to forecast that the annual public expenditure round will be 'the most
difficult in years'. But the prediction will be truer this year than in
most. The ingredients for tough negotiations between Mr Portillo and his
Treasury officials on the one hand and the spending ministries on the other
are in place:
Mr Portillo is a supporter of low taxation as the way to create a strong
economy.
Provisional spending plans already envisage a pronounced deceleration in the
growth rate of government expenditure to 7.9 per cent in 1993-94 and 5.5 per
cent in 1994-95 compared with 10.7 per cent in the current and 13.7 per cent
in the past financial years.
The Tory manifesto commits the government to reducing the share of income
taken by the public sector. It says public spending is peaking at 43 per
cent of gross domestic product in the recession and that the aim is 'to
reduce this steadily as the recovery gets under way'.
On the other hand the recession has reduced tax revenues and boosted benefit
payments.
The absence of recovery in the first quarter of this year might mean that
the Budget spending projections for 1992-93 are too low and its tax revenue
forecasts too optimistic. Already the Treasury is concerned that higher than
expected spending on single parent and disability benefits is causing social
security outlays to grow faster than anticipated.
Mr Portillo may find he will have to cut public expenditure growth targets
in 1993-94 and subsequent years if the government is to keep to its goal of
balancing the budget over the business cycle and reduce the public sector
borrowing requirement from the Pounds 28bn forecast for 1992-93 and Pounds
32bn for 1993-94 to Pounds 6bn in 1996-97.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lang urged to call a referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party in Scotland yesterday challenged Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, to stage a referendum on the country's constitutional future.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, made the challenge after a
meeting of most of the party's 49 Scottish MPs. He was picking up on a
remark by Mr Lang who on Friday said that a referendum was a 'possibility'
in the continuing question of Scotland's constitutional future.
For Mr Dewar, the referendum challenge is an attempt to seize the initiative
in Scottish politics and to defuse the crisis which his party faces in
Scotland. Once again it finds itself the largest party north of the border
while its hopes of coming to power and implementing its plans for a Scottish
parliament where dashed by the Tory election victory.
The challenge is also a way of trying to head off an incipient revolt by
some Scottish Labour MPs who at the weekend founded Scotland United,
intended to be a grouping of all non-Conservative parties in Scotland, which
between them won almost 75 per cent of the vote last Thursday.
Last night about 3,000 people attended a rally in George Square in Glasgow
organised by Scotland United. They were addressed by Mr George Galloway, the
leftwing Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead who is on the wing of the party that
is sympathetic to Scotland's eventual independence.
Scotland United's stated aim is to campaign for a multi-option referendum,
although Mr Galloway has also spoken of the possibility of civil
disobedience and has echoed the Scottish National party argument that the
Conservatives do not have a mandate to govern Scotland.
Mr Dewar said the referendum would have to cover the constitutional status
quo, the scheme for a devolved Scottish parliament devised by the Scottish
Constitutional Convention, and independence. Mr Lang would have to abide be
the result, Mr Dewar added.
'The Tories have always claimed that faced with the choice Scotland would
vote for the status quo,' said Mr Dewar. 'They should have the courage to
put the matter to the test.'
If Mr Lang did not deliver, 'bitterness and instability will be the mark of
his government.'
The Conservative party is anyway considering what response to give to the
demand for constitutional change following its election victory. But on
Friday Mr Lang heavily qualified his remark about the possibility of a
referendum by saying it would have to be based on a specific proposition,
preferably one enshrined in law, as was the case with the 1979 referendum on
devolution for Scotland.
The SNP has not joined Scotland United although some prominent individual
supporters such as Mr Pat Kane, a rock singer with the Scottish group Hue
and Cry, were at last night's rally.
The SNP is concentrating its efforts on achieving victory in the district
council elections of May 7. It will fight on a platform promising to use
district councils in which it wins control to organise a multi-option
referendum.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Subtle race to be Speaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the election over, the far subtler race to become Speaker of the House
of Commons began yesterday.
The dropping of Mr Peter Brooke as Northern Ireland secretary clears the way
for him to succeed Mr Bernard Weatherill who retired before the election.
But Mr Brooke faces a strong challenge from Mr Terence Higgins, former Tory
chairman of the Commons' Treasury committee.
Other challengers are expected to include Sir Giles Shaw, the Tory MP for
Pudsey and a former industry minister. If MPs defied expectations and picked
a Labour alternative, the front-runner would be Mrs Betty Boothroyd,
currently one of the deputy speakers.
Mr Brooke's strengths are the respect in which he is held by many Labour
MPs, his sense of history and his regard for procedural proprieties.
He is regarded affectionately among Tory backbenchers for his old-fashioned
courtesy - but he may not necessarily be appreciated by fiery Labour
critics.
He may also lack an ability to control the Commons at its most tense
moments. He is not authoritative by nature. He succeeded in bringing Ulster
politicians to negotiations via patient progress rather than the well-chosen
directive.
Mr Higgins is similarly gentlemanly, but has spent longer earning the
respect of backbenchers and is believed to be building cross-party support.
He has not been a minister since the 1970s.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Baker delays return for Patten
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH BAKER has made it clear that he does not intend to give up his
safe parliamentary seat - thus ruling out speculation that he might make way
for a by-election which could return Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman who
lost his seat in Bath. Mr Baker made his wish to keep his seat apparent in
his letter of resignation as home secretary.
At the election, Mr Baker, who is 57, won a majority of nearly 16,000 in his
constituency of Mole Valley, Surrey. He wrote to the prime minister: 'I
intend to continue to serve my constituents . . . as I consider it a great
honour to represent this seat.' Mr Baker declined the offer of demotion to
Welsh secretary.
Mr Tom King, the former defence secretary, said in his resignation letter
that he had told Mr John Major before the general election that he would
soon like to take a break from his cabinet responsibilities.
Mr King wrote: 'Now that you have led us to this tremendous victory, with
the clear prospect of a full five-year parliament, 'I fully understand that
you would prefer to make the change now and establish a new team in cabinet
for the longer term.'
Mr Major wrote to Mr Peter Brooke, who he sacked as Northern Ireland
secretary: 'Thank you for agreeing to put your portfolio at my disposal so
that I can bring some new faces into the cabinet.' Mr Brooke, in his brief
one-paragraph reply, wrote: 'You have the warmest possible support from the
whole party for the magnificent way you led us to our historic victory.'
Although the letter ended: 'Yours ever,' in the copy that was released by
Downing Street it was unsigned.
In his letter to Lord Waddington, who resigned his post as leader of the
House of Lords, Mr Major also referred to his desire to bring younger people
into the cabinet. In his reply Lord Waddington replied said that he
recognised that 'at the age of 62 it is time for me to go.'

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Four of the new faces around Major's cabinet
table - Gillian Shephard: Employment secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A former Treasury minister, Mrs Gillian Shephard will be on familiar
ground this week as she attempts to come to terms with a set of grim
economic indicators. One of her first duties as employment secretary will be
to preside over the publication of the latest unemployment figures.
Unemployment has risen for the past 22 consecutive months, reaching a
seasonally adjusted figure in February of more than 2.6m. Last month's total
will continue the trend.
Even with her Treasury contacts, there are no indications that Mrs Shephard
will be able suddenly to reverse the decline of government expenditure on
measures to tackle unemployment. Since 1986-87 these programmes have
experienced cuts totalling a fifth in real terms.
Instead, Mrs Shephard will be relying on the assistance of another new
appointee, Mr Michael Heseltine, at the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr
Heseltine, will have his department strengthened as he takes on the
employment department's old responsibilities for small businesses.
Mrs Shephard will retain the primary responsibility for the employer-led
Training and Enterprise Councils. While Mr Heseltine will also be charged
with forging links with the Tecs, Mrs Shephard will find herself the primary
focus of Tec lobbying over budgets and what is seen as a lack of flexibility
in government contracts.
Expectations may be raised that she will bring in measures to promote the
position of women in the workforce, particularly since responsibility for
the Equal Opportunities Commission will move to her department from the Home
Office.
Here, again, her room for manoeuvre will be strictly limited by restraints
on expenditure - and exhortations to industry on equal opportunities may
remain the only form of action.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Four of the new faces around Major's cabinet
table - Virginia Bottomley: Health secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG Mrs Virginia Bottomley's hopes as she enters John Major's cabinet is
that her health department will be blessed with a relatively quiet life.
As incoming health secretary, one of her chief aims will be 'to try to
remove politics from the health service'. What the NHS needs, she says, is a
'spell of stability' in which to beaver away at the government's reforms.
In the wake of the bitter War of Jennifer's Ear - during which health was
turned into the most abused of political footballs - this might seem a
forlorn aspiration but Mrs Bottomley may see it partly fulfilled for three
reasons.
First, as she argues with some justification, the election result has to
some extent 'nailed' Labour's aggressive claims regarding NHS
'privatisation'. At the least, both leading opposition parties now face a
period of introspection and possible policy changes.
Second, the government's framework of reform is now mainly in place, with
the focus switching to implementation as more GPs gear up to become
fundholders and more hospitals prepare for trust status.
Mrs Bottomley gave an early signal that she will not be doctrinaire over the
pace at which the new structures are introduced. 'It is not a kind of
rigorous ideological commitment that every unit shall become an NHS trust,'
she said on TV-am's Frost on Sunday programme.
Third, the formidable Mr Robin Cook will probably not be Labour health
spokesman beyond the autumn. Mr Cook's mastery of his portfolio has taxed
even such accomplished debaters as Mr Kenneth Clarke.
Mrs Bottomley's capacity to perform capably under pressure is not in doubt
but although meticulous in mastering briefs she has yet to demonstrate the
ability to ad-lib convincingly. There is also a question mark over her
ability to stamp her authority on an entire government department.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Council tax hurdle ahead for Howard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST immediate chal-lenge facing Mr Michael Howard, the new environment
secretary, will be to achieve a smooth lift-off for the council tax, which
is due to replace the poll tax in April next year.
The irony of this will not be lost on Mr Howard, for it was he who
supervised the passage of the poll tax through parliament during his stint
as housing and local government minister. He now has less than a year to
ensure that the council tax does not become a political millstone around Mr
Major's neck, as the poll tax became for Mrs Thatcher.
His past record is unlikely to endear him to the local government leaders
whose co-operation is essential to making a success of the council tax.
However, one influential Labour council leader said last night that he hoped
Mr Howard would be prepared to work for an improvement in relations between
central and local government.
Mr Howard will himself become a sort of unelected mayor for London through
his chairmanship of the government's new cabinet sub-committee which is to
co-ordinate planning and policy for the capital. He will also convene a new
private-sector forum to promote London as a business, tourist and cultural
centre.
An early decision will have to be made on whether to cap poll-tax levels for
15 to 20 councils which have exceeded government guidelines on local
spending. In the longer term Mr Howard will be responsible for seeing
through the work of the Local Government Commission which will eliminate a
tier of local government in England and Wales and redraw local-authority
boundaries.
The environment secretary's role in regenerating inner cities is to be
enhanced, with additional responsibilities transferred from the Department
of Trade and Industry.
The Conservative manifesto pledged an extension of the City Challenge
approach which distributes resources by competitive bidding between
councils. With a second round of bidding closing this month, Mr Howard will
have the opportunity to set his own priorities in selecting the 20 winners.
Mr Howard can expect a surge in transfers of local authority housing to
housing associations and housing action trusts. With the election of a
fourth Tory government, many Labour councils will set aside ideological
scruples and seek such transfers, which will be the only way of bringing
significant new investment into run-down council estates.
On environmental issues, the government is committed to establishing a new
agency to bring together existing bodies such as the National Rivers
Authority and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.

table - John Patten: Education secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Patten's promotion marks the end of a time when he seemed doomed to
be the minister most frequently and wrongly tipped for the cabinet.
Since 1989, Mr Patten, 46, has been listed among the 'ministers most likely
to' at every reshuffle. But while contemporaries such as Mr William
Waldegrave and Mr Michael Howard got seats at the top table, he was left to
soldier on through criminal justice bills at the Home Office.
His qualifications for his appointment are so fitting that it is a fair bet
that Mrs Margaret Thatcher would never have trusted him with it. Not only
does his seat - Oxford West and Abingdon  - contain Oxford University, but
he was a university lecturer from 1969 and a fellow of Hertford College
until 1983.
His ministerial apprenticeship has been long. In his five years at the Home
Office he learnt the need to work with dissatisfied departmental client
groups. It should serve him in good stead in his dealings with the teachers
and educational establishment, who are desperate for stability after the
upheavals of the education reforms.
Among his recurring themes, and one he is likely to elaborate in his new
post, is that of parental responsibility.
At Westminster, he is an effective dispatch box performer. He has a gift for
the popular phrase, being credited with giving the nation 'lager louts'.
Whatever his rhetoric, his years at the Home Office have not entirely
blunted his liberal edge: he has consistently voted against the restoration
of capital punishment.
His officials talk of his relentless drive for self-publicity, although this
also enables him to attract attention to fresh or even not-so-fresh
departmental actions.
Apparently undaunted by the crime figures rising to record levels, he has
insisted on the preventability of much minor property crime and launched
initiatives to try to reduce it.

table - Michael Portillo: Chief secretary to the Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR John Major's intention was to signal the Tories' determination to
balance the budget over the economic cycle, he has done so with his
appointment of Mr Michael Portillo as chief secretary to the Treasury.
An unashamed member of the rightwing No Turning Back group of MPs, who
welcomed Mrs Margaret Thatcher as the guest of honour at his annual
constituency dinner this year, Mr Portillo is under no illusions that
control of public spending can be relaxed as the economy comes out of
recession.
Colleagues lining up for the annual tussle of the public expenditure round
will find him a formidable opponent.
He can master vast amounts of detail, can argue his case cogently and has a
strong streak of stubbornness or determination. All three qualities were in
evidence as he pushed through both the council tax bill and the local
government bill before parliament was dissolved last month.
He is also committed to low taxation which, even before the election
campaign, he was highlighting as one of the critical differences between the
two main parties.
Aged 38, he is the youngest member of the cabinet, and is already used to
being tipped a future leader of the party.
He became MP for the safe seat of Enfield Southgate at a by-election in
November 1984, having worked as special adviser to Mr Nigel Lawson, the then
chancellor, immediately beforehand.
In 1990 he was given the high-profile job of local government minister. It
made him practically the last public friend of the poll tax before he became
its executioner.
Like Mr Major's, his abilities are praised on all sides of the party. Only
the faintest of unease is occasionally expressed about his ambition. 'I wish
he still invited me to his parties,' was the slightly wistful comment of one
senior Conservative who had known him well when he first worked for the Tory
party.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine ready to meet challenge of
consolation prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Michael Heseltine must finally abandon any ambition to lead his party,
the chance to put a powerful Department of Trade and Industry back at the
centre of government offers him an exciting consolation prize.
Mr Heseltine has long had his eye on the top job at the DTI, where 20 years
ago he served briefly as minister for aerospace. Although he has kept his
own counsel since returning to the cabinet, he holds clear, controversial
views on the proper role for his new department.
During his period in ministerial exile, as the DTI was increasingly
emasculated, Mr Heseltine produced reams of ideas for empowering a beefed-up
industry department.
At times, he sounded more in line with Labour thinking on the need for an
industrial strategy than with his own party.
Some of his ambitions for the DTI run the risk of conflict with other
departments, not least the Treasury - which he believes has too great an
influence on industrial policy - and the Foreign Office, which he thinks
should play a much greater role in promoting British industry.
Mr Heseltine may also have some home truths for the business community's
representative bodies, such as the Confederation of British Industry and the
chambers of commerce, which he believes could be organised more effectively.
He may wish to stir a debate on the need for institutions to take a
longer-term view towards investment in industry. He could also want to take
a look at the narrow parameters which dictate the policy on takeovers, an
area of activity not always perceived to be in the best interests of British
industry.
Another item on his checklist for action could be trying to devise a more
effective role for the National Economic Development Office, which was
effectively ignored under Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mr Heseltine will, in any case, begin with far broader responsibilities than
Mr Peter Lilley, his predecessor.
He will take charge of energy policy in a government committed to
privatising the coal industry, to reducing the retail monopoly of British
Gas and to reviewing the future of the nuclear industry.
The DTI will also take over the Department of Employment's responsibility
for small businesses, an area which is has been of particular interest to Mr
Heseltine.
Mr Heseltine's stewardship of the DTI will be in marked contrast to that of
Mr Lilley, who promoted a comparatively narrow role for his department. This
was focused on limiting the burden of bureaucracy on business and on
creating a political environment which, Mr Lilley said, left companies 'free
to get on with doing what they do best - encouraged and unimpeded'.
Mr Lilley, above all, was accused of presiding over a department which had
no real clout in government and which placed too much reliance on the
mechanisms of the market place.
The new incumbent sees things very differently - Mr Heseltine has described
as short-sighted the 'averted gaze' of government in respect to industry.
Some changes at the DTI may amount to little more than a different tone; Mr
Heseltine may appear more understanding and concerned, although he will be
as hard-pressed as his predecessors to win more cash.
He inherits a Pounds 1bn departmental budget, primarily aimed at stimulating
the process of longer-term wealth creation through innovation and research
and development - areas which he will be keen to expand further.
Mr Heseltine will also place renewed emphasis on the need to stimulate
industrial development within the regions.
Although he is not an interventionist in the sense that he has any time for
central planning, his two spells as environment secretary demonstrated an
enthusiastic advocacy of 'active government'.
He believes passionately in the need for government to have 'a view from the
centre' about how British industry should develop and prosper. He wrote
recently: 'All the trappings of a continuous relationship between government
and industry are there. What is missing is the conviction, the consistency
and the machinery to work together with a coherent industrial strategy.'
Mr Heseltine wants the DTI to have greater cabinet seniority than in the
past, something which his own appointment will help bring about. But he also
wants to see the DTI given overall responsibility for government relations
with industry.
During the 1980s, he viewed with dismay the endless changes at the top of
the DTI, which enabled critics to claim that the government gave low
priority to the problems and demands of British industry.
As he put it five years ago: 'The views of the City are in the mainstream of
policy; those of industry are frequently dismissed as little more than
special pleading.' It is that culture which he now sets out to change.
Mr Heseltine becomes the eighth trade and industry secretary in nine years
and shows every sign of relishing the challenge. He will find it hard to
complain, however, if he has to spend most of the next five years at the
DTI.

FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Relief at BBC over Mellor post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH INTERESTS ranging from the composer Glazunov to Chelsea Football Club,
Mr David Mellor is equipped to head the new national heritage ministry
responsible for the arts, the media, heritage and sport.
There will be relief at the BBC that its future is in the hands of Mr
Mellor, who understands the complex policy arguments in broadcasting. This
is particularly important since some Tories have muttered about taking
revenge for alleged anti-Conservative bias by the BBC during the election
campaign.
A green paper on the BBC is expected later this year. Its charter expires at
the end of 1996 and must be renegotiated. While Mr Mellor is likely to give
short shrift to any arguments from the BBC that smack of vested interests,
he will not be inherently hostile to the notion that there should be a body
like the BBC funded by a licence fee and committed to quality programmes.
Mr Mellor, who combines previous ministerial experience for broadcasting and
the arts with a feeling for handling large budgets from his most recent post
as chief Treasury secretary, will know that the superficially attractive
idea of putting advertisements on BBC television could destroy the finances
of ITV. It was principally Mr Mellor who turned the 1990 Broadcasting Bill
from being a potential disaster for ITV into an Act that may turn out to be
workable, in spite of its imperfections.
With a mixture of responsibilities from no fewer than six departments being
assembled under his bailiwick, Mr Mellor will be anxious to keep
bureaucratic teething problems to a minimum. He will preside eventually over
a 350-strong staff in a yet-to-be-determined location.
The creation of this ministry is one of the clearest signs that Mr John
Major is attempting to put a distinctive stamp on his premiership. Mr Mellor
will bear a heavy responsibility in making a success of it, and will need
his robust debating and bargaining skills.
He spoke yesterday of seeing a role for government in assisting 'the
accessibility of the arts.' There was 'a clear feeling' that the arts were
'a lasting and enduring part of society' and hence needed cabinet-level
representation, he said. His will be the final word on whether works of art
may be exported.
Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, welcomed Mr Mellor's
appointment, saying he would give the arts 'leadership, direction and a
vision for the future'.

FT  13 APR 92 / Pentagon draws on Gulf war lessons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN the midst of a ferocious political debate over how to structure US
defences after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US Defence Department
has set out to build its answers on the lessons of the Gulf war.
In a three-volume report to Congress totalling more than 1,300 pages, the
Pentagon has analysed every aspect of the conduct of the war - from the
performance of weapons systems to the treatment of prisoners of war, from
political leadership in the inter-national arena to coalition command
structures in the field.
The 'Conduct of the Gulf War' report concludes that the decisive victory of
the coalition forces over the Iraqi army is attributable in large measure to
the extraordinary effectiveness of the air power deployed.
It warns, however, that in future wars air power may not be so successful
nor sustain such low casualties. It also argues that the ground offensive of
Operation Desert Storm was essential in enabling the coalition to seize the
initiative.
The report also notes shortages of specific types of transport equipment and
shortcomings in intelligence and reconnaissance, in targeting mobile missile
launchers and in preparations for defence against biological warfare.
Mr Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, has used the report to bolster some
of the themes he has repeatedly laid out in his efforts to prevent an
over-hasty draw-down of the US military establishment now that the Cold War
is over.
'The Persian Gulf war reminds us that we cannot be sure when or where the
next conflict will arise,' he writes in an introduction to the report.
'Our ability to predict events five, 10 or 15 years in the future is quite
limited. But whatever occurs, we will need high-quality forces to deter
aggression or, if necessary, to defend our interests.'
Mr Cheney underlines his argument that it takes years to develop both the
personnel and the military technology that contributed to the coalition
victory. But he faces a hard task convincing Congress that his defence
budget cannot be cut more quickly, while at the same time many congressmen
will battle to preserve their local army and air force bases, national guard
units and defence manufacturing programmes.

FT  13 APR 92 / Winnie Mandela in fresh row over beating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CO-DEFENDANT in last year's kidnap and assault trial of Mrs Winnie
Mandela, wife of the African National Congress leader, Mr Nelson Mandela,
has told a Johannesburg newspaper that he was present when Mrs Mandela beat
four young men in her Soweto home, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
The claims, published in the Johannesburg Sunday Times, will heighten
controversy surrounding the role of Mrs Mandela in the 1988 beatings. They
follow allegations made a fortnight ago that Mrs Mandela ordered the murder
of a prominent doctor who would have been a key figure in the case. In light
of those claims, police are re-examining the doctor's death, which had been
treated as a robbery-related murder.
The charges are an embarrassment to the ANC, in which Mrs Mandela holds
senior positions. However, her influence in the organisation has declined
sharply since the trial and she is seldom seen in public with her husband,
leading to speculation that they will soon become legally separated.
Mr John Morgan, Mrs Mandela's former driver, told the Sunday Times that he
lied in court to protect her during last year's trial. Mrs Mandela was
convicted as an accessory after the fact to assault and given a one-year
prison sentence, as well as a five-year sentence for planning the kidnapping
of the boys. The case is subject to appeal.
The judge failed to find Mrs Mandela guilty of assault because he accepted
her alibi that she was not present when the boys were beaten - which Mr
Morgan now disputes.
One of the four victims of the beatings later died, and Mr Morgan told the
newspaper that Mrs Mandela ordered him to remove the corpse from the house.
'I was told by Winnie to pick up the dog and dump him,' it quoted Mr Morgan
as saying.
Mr Morgan received a one-year suspended sentence during the trial.

<TEXT>
LIBYA has offered to hand over to Tunisia, or some other neutral country,
two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner, but the
proposal is unlikely to stave off UN sanctions due to come into effect on
Wednesday, writes Tony Walker in Cairo.
It was also reported last night that Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi told
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak he agreed in principle to abide by UN
resolution 731 urging Libya to hand over the two men, accused of bombing a
Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, an Egyptian official said.
Scheduled flights from Tripoli are reported to be heavily booked over the
next few days before the deadline expires for the imposition of UN sanctions
resolution 748, which includes an arms and air embargo.
Libya said it would sever all contact with the outside world for the 24
hours before the sanctions begin.
Arab foreign ministers, members of a special seven-member Arab League
committee, were meeting in Rabat today in an effort to fashion a last-minute
compromise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA is borrowing SR10bn (Pounds 1.53bn) from domestic banks to help
pay for its al-Yamamah defence deal with Britain, Reuter reports from
Bahrain. Economists in Riyadh said the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (Sama)
told five domestic banks to participate in the 13-month loan, the kingdom's
third sovereign credit during the past year.
The money - due to be drawn in four tranches at fortnightly intervals
beginning today - was for the Finance Ministry and would cover the kingdom's
last Pounds 1.5bn payment for al-Yamamah.
Sama officials were not available for comment.
Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, said last week King Fahd had
confirmed the payment for phase two of the deal, which could involve the
supply of British Aerospace aircraft, minesweepers, technical advice and
construction of a large military airbase on the edge of the southern Empty
Quarter desert.
Bankers in the kingdom said the loan was priced at 25 basis points over the
Saudi interbank offered rate (Sibor).

FT  13 APR 92 / Unions face Bush offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush is to embark on a new policy which is expected to
weaken further the ailing US trade union movement. He plans to announce
today measures to implement a 1988 Supreme Court decision inhibiting trade
unions from using membership fees for political purposes.
The measures echo similar efforts undertaken by the UK's Conservative
government in the 1980s to curb British unions' use of political funds. This
could, in time, diminish a significant source of support for Mr Bush's
Democratic rivals, who are the overwhelming beneficiaries of organised
labour's backing.
The scope of the 1988 Supreme Court ruling on the case of Communications
Workers of America v Beck is limited, covering only workers who do not
belong to a union but who are required - as they may be in many states - to
pay dues because they receive union representation and are covered by a
union contract.
All the same, officials estimate that full implementation of the decision to
permit such workers to refuse to pay dues for political purposes could
reduce trade union funds by more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) a year.
Mr Bush's decision to act on the Beck ruling, four years after it was
delivered by the Supreme Court, demonstrates how the impending presidential
election has sharpened his administration's focus on policy issues.
Right-wing Republicans have urged the administration for some time to act on
the Beck ruling to curb unions' political muscle.

FT  13 APR 92 / EC protectionism threatens east European growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL rhetoric peddled by the European Community is regularly at
odds with the reality of its activities. Nowhere is this better illustrated
than in the contradiction between its free trade propaganda and the
protectionist bias of its trade policies. For eastern Europe, the EC's
half-hearted response to their need for market access provides a
disillusioning introduction to the practice of west European capitalism.
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the distorted pattern of trade within
eastern Europe makes the EC a vital source of new markets and foreign direct
investment for eastern Europe. One-third of all east European exports were
sold in EC markets in 1990. The extensive trade liberalisation undertaken by
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia suggests they have swallowed the free
trade message.
The response of the EC, while sluggish, is at first sight encouraging. Last
December, the EC countries signed Association agreements with Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia which appear to be the first step towards a
European 'free trade area.' The agreements, which came into effect last
month, have abolished most quotas and will remove many tariffs over the next
2-5 years. They are intended to create a free flow of industrial goods
between the EC and these three east European countries within the next 10
years.
There is much protectionism to dismantle. Energy, agriculture, textiles and
apparel, iron and steel and chemicals together account for between a third
and a half of these countries' exports. All have traditionally faced high
levels of EC protection. The eastern European countries have been
particularly hurt by the high level of EC agricultural protection. The
Common Agricultural Policy has doubled the price of their agricultural
exports, as the left-hand chart shows. Moreover, there has been a
substantial increase in EC agricultural protection since 1985, compared with
the US or Japan.
Textiles, apparel and iron and steel exports have faced only modest tariffs;
protection has been applied through non-tariff barriers instead. Half of all
Polish, Czech and Hungarian exports to the EC have faced restrictions under
the Multi-fibre Agreement. Barriers to iron and steel exports to the EC
consist of quotas on the majority of east European exports.
Much of this EC protection will survive the Association agreements. At a
recent conference at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
Mr Patrick Messerlin argued that substantial trade barriers will remain
against eastern Europe's main industrial exports for at least the next five
years. The agreed trade liberalisation will occur on a slower timetable for
certain 'import-sensitive' sectors - textiles and apparel, and iron and
steel - and not at all for agricultural exports. Member countries required
these exceptions, despite the small scale of east European trade. Completely
free trade with eastern Europe would be expected to reduce the EC output of
these industries by a mere 2-4 per cent.
Moreover the agreements are loaded with provisions - covering rules of
origin, safeguards and standards - which may seriously undermine the
announced trade liberalisation. Eastern European goods will have to
demonstrate at least 60 per cent local content to qualify for duty-free
entry into the EC; while Article 30 allows the trade barriers to be
re-erected in order to safeguard a threatened domestic industry and prevent
'serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which
could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a
region.'
This safeguard clause could be used to reverse all of the other trade
liberalisation clauses in the agreements. Whether this will occur depends on
the attitude of the EC. Its willingness to bow to the special pleading of
certain 'import-sensitive' industries does not bode well for eastern
Europe's future.

All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and
the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on
the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which
use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges).
German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the
former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period
averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by
Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.
