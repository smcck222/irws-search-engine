FT  11 APR 92 / High-tech fibres mimic silk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FASHION DESIGNERS of the 1990s are returning to nylon and polyester
after decades of consumer resistance. Unlike in the 1960s, though, their use
is not just a whim of fashion, according a report from the Economist
Intelligence Unit.
High-technology materials once intended for sports and outdoor wear have
generated new fashions that are being sold from the catwalk to the high
street.
The technology behind the materials is microfibres - polyester or nylon
filaments finer than silk. That fineness imparts a luxurious 'handle and
drape' to machine-washable clothes. Different weaves create a silk or suede
touch and fabrics can be made to feel like peach skin or be given a powdery
surface.
Mr Paul Smith, a London fashion designer, said yesterday: 'The peach-finish
microfibre was the real breakthrough. Man-made fibres have always had a
man-made nastiness about them, but microfibres have a fluid touch. They can
feel like silk or suede.'
The biggest demand for microfibres is in 'fashion plus function', where
looks are as important as technical performance, according to the report.
Microfibre weaves can be made so fine they do not need further treatment to
be rainproof and at the same time allow the wearer to sweat. Mircrofibres
were developed in the 1970s by Japanese chemists seeking a more realistic
artificial silk. Japan still leads the field, but new competitors include
ICI in the UK and Hoechst in Germany.
'Microfibres are overpriced,' Ms Katharine Hamnett, the London fashion
designer conceded. 'But they feel absolutely wonderful.'
Prices may fall as sales grow. But consumers beware: 'microfibre' labels are
being sewn on to more ordinary high street clothes and, the unit warns,
quality is already a casualty in the race to cash in.

FT  11 APR 92 / US news service expands in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE NEWS Network International, the 24-hour US television news service,
yesterday expanded its service in the UK and the rest of Europe when it
began broadcasting on the Astra satellite system.
Until now the service, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has been available only to
owners of large satellite dishes and subscribers to cable television
networks.
The decision to broadcast from Astra, as well as an Intelsat satellite,
means that the international news service will be available to an additional
8m homes in Europe equipped with 60cm dishes. That includes more than 2.7m
homes in the UK.
The extension of its broadcasting is the latest move by CNNI in its strategy
to make its service more international. This week the station began
co-presenting its live programme, The International Hour, from London.
Spanish-language translations of a number of programme segments will be
introduced from September.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Regional breakdown shows swing failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN NO REGION of the country did Labour achieve the level of swing required
to become the largest party. Only in the east Midlands did the party make
the kind of improvement which could have removed Mr John Major's overall
majority.
A swing to Labour in London of 3.3 per cent was enough to win 12 seats, 10
from the Conservatives and the two remaining outposts of Dr David Owen's
SDP. But the Conservatives held nine of the 21 seats in the capital which Mr
Neil Kinnock needed for an overall majority. As suggested by the opinion
polls, Tory support held up well in the north-west.
Scotland swung by more than 2 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, and
the band of Tory MPs swelled from nine to 11.
The Liberal Democrats were down from 1987 in every region, most markedly in
Scotland and London where their vote was squeezed in the Conservative/Labour
battle, and in East Anglia where their vote plummeted in Cambridge and
Cambridgeshire North-East.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Finance bill set to head agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLINES of the new finance bill, which could be introduced early next
month, within a few days of the state opening of parliament, are clearer
than the names of the ministers who will take it through parliament.
No decisions will yet have been taken, but the bill might include one of the
first manifesto pledges to be implemented. The Tory manifesto specifically
says that 'as early as possible in the new parliament' the party would
introduce a 'rent-a-room' scheme enabling home-owners to get tax relief on
rooms they let to lodgers.
Fresh Budget resolutions could be brought forward for debate immediately
after the Queen's Speech debate, which lasts a week and begins on May 6.
The second reading debate on the finance bill could then take place in late
May, with it receiving detailed consideration through June and into July on
a timetable not very different from usual.
The bill is expected to be substantial, though not necessarily particularly
controversial, comprising perhaps 70 clauses and several schedules.
Many of these would be fairly technical measures on the European single
market which have been discussed by the Customs and Excise department with
interested groups, but some important aspects of the Budget have still not
been introduced.
The most notable of these are the changes on inheritance tax, to raise the
general threshold to Pounds 150,000 and to exempt most family businesses.
The further alleviation of inheritance tax is thought in Whitehall to be for
future years rather than in changes to the existing Budget proposals.
Other Budget plans which will feature in the bill include the additional
help for the film industry, the extension of Gift Aid, and the abolition of
the Business Expansion Scheme.
Also on the stocks is a short, perhaps 10- or 12-clause bill, to bring about
the promised relief for businesses hit by the transitional arrangements for
the uniform business rates.
Changes in personal equity plans allowing Pounds 6,000 to be invested in
unit and investment trusts over a tax year, have already been made, though
not by a bill but by alterations in the PEP rules.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Trend is reversed in sharp share surge - FT
Election Share Index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE politically sensitive shares in the FT Election Share index reversed the
trend of the campaign yesterday. Shares that might benefit from the
Conservative victory leapt by more than 10 points, three times as far as
those which might have benefited had Labour won.
'Conservative gainers' rose twice as fast as the FT-SE index, to finish 1
point higher than the level at which they closed on the day the election was
called, March 11.
'Labour gainers', which had outperformed their Conservative rivals
throughout most of the campaign, finished a hair's-breadth behind.
Among the Conservative portion of the index, Thames Water (up 21 per cent),
Forte (up 14 per cent) and SG Warburg (up 13 1/2 per cent) did best
yesterday. All three might have suffered from policies in Labour's
manifesto. On a day when almost the whole market rose, the only member of
the election index to lose ground was Zetters, the pools company, which
dropped by just under 1 per cent.
The Conservative manifesto promises a national lottery, which might harm the
pools promoter.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Continental investors see little change as
euphoria fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE general election result clearly struck an ideological chord with
institutional investors across Europe yesterday, with Continental
shareholders expressing shock - and pleasure  - that professional pollsters
should have got it so wrong.
But as the euphoria faded, investors conceded that very little had changed
and the UK equities markets were little better a bet than than they were
before the election was called.
Still, the upset seemed to provide more encouragement to those who watched
the election from across the English Channel. 'We were shocked to see such a
divergence between the polls and the results,' said Mr Claude Guillaume of
Paribas Asset Management in Paris.
But in the long run, Mr Guillaume and his counterparts across Europe are
prepared only for a modest increase in their exposure to the UK equities
markets. 'We think there will be a recovery, but a very modest one,' Mr
Guillaume said.
The clear Tory majority rules out the increase in interest rates Labour
might have had to accept to defend the pound. But beyond that, the picture
has changed little. 'There can be no real recovery until German interest
rates come down,' he said, echoing investors across Europe.
Several Continental investors said expectations of a Labour win - or at
least, a hung parliament - had convinced them to underweigh UK equities in
their portfolios before the elections. The main international equity indices
are suggesting 38 to 40 per cent UK weightings, but Continental accounts had
been a few percentage points below that.
Ms Edith Thioun, fund manager at Banque Julius Baer in Zurich, said she was
now likely to increase slightly her weighting in UK equities above the 40
per cent they now represent in her portfolio.
In addition to removing the fear of a rise in interest rates, Ms Thioun said
she expected the Tories' return to stimulate confidence up to the point that
spending would be likely to pick up again.
Closer to home, however, the Tory win has brought no new surge of enthusiasm
for UK equities. 'We have felt that the economy would pick up in the next 12
months regardless of how the elections went,' said Mr Dick Barfield, chief
investment officer at Standard Life. He said his pension funds carried an
above-average 64 per cent weighting in UK equities before the election and
he had no plans to adjust that.
That view was echoed by Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief investment officer at
Prudential Asset Management, the UK's largest life insurance company.
'Our immediate view was that whomever won would be restrained by the ERM,'
he said, explaining that until German interest rates are cut, British and
other Continental rates will remain high and restrict growth.

FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: City poised for more bids and deals activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REMOVAL of political uncertainty for the next few years gave many
companies yesterday cause for relief and the opportunity to say that
corporate planning would be that much easier.
However, this is not to say that corporate financiers expect a sudden
opening of the bids and deals floodgates, as one explained, partly because
'no one expected the Tories to win'. But they do believe that political
certainty will make their clients more willing to contemplate making
acquisitions.
Among potential predators, there is some relief that the threat of
Labour-imposed takeover restrictions has been lifted. Mr Ian Duncan, finance
director of Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate, said the group had been
looking to make a UK acquisition for some time, but it had become 'a bit
passive' prior to the election. Had Labour won, it might have seen better
prospects for growth overseas.
Both Tomkins and Williams Holdings, another conglomerate with the financial
strength to acquire, have complained about the difficulty of finding
'sensibly priced' targets in the UK. Ironically, a Labour victory or a hung
parliament might have helped on that issue by cutting share prices.
But the main response is expected to be towards more action. Mr Gavin
Simmonds, a corporate finance director at Kleinwort Benson, the merchant
bank, said the election result, 'will have a profound effect on the mergers
and acquisitions market', bringing a return of the longer-term players.
Whatever happens to the price of potential targets, a rising stock market
would give acquisitive companies more firepower to make bids with their own
shares.
Similarly, if the market remains strong it could trigger rights issues.
Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive of Williams, commented: 'Companies will
see the opportunities to repair balance sheets and raise money for other
activities.'
Other companies pointed out that some negative factors remain. Mr Roger
Wood, finance director at Wimpey, the housebuilder, said: 'There is still
the uncertainty of unemployment and of housing affordability, which both
hold down house prices.' He did, however, believe that the result would
bring forward a recovery in house prices.
At English China Clays, Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said the sale of
the group's housing landbank would be facilitated by the result.
Companies rather more dependent on the UK economy, for instance in the
construction industry, may not find the market immediately receptive to
rights issues, even after the election-inspired gains. Mr Wood, while
stressing that Wimpey had no plans for a cash call, said: 'Once the initial
euphoria dies away, too little will remain for construction companies to
raise large amounts of cash. We need some demonstrable signs that we are
coming out of recession.'
A revival of the new-issue market, later in the year, is forecast by another
banker. He suggests that management buy-outs completed before the recession
could now be looking to float. MFI, the kitchen and bedroom retailer, is one
likely candidate.

JAPANESE stocks rebounded yesterday as investors sought bargains following
the market's recent sharp fall.
The Nikkei index of leading shares rose 1,252.51 points to 17,850.66, its
fifth-largest single-day jump. Prices were buoyed by the easing of US
interest rates, strong rises in American stocks and bonds and, above all, by
a sense that the recent sell-off had gone too far.
Shares opened at their low and rose continuously through the day to close at
their high. Yet, stockbrokers said many investors remained nervous and
uncertain about how long the rally would last.
Mr Shigeru Akiba, of UBS Phillips and Drew, the Swiss-owned broker, said:
'Of course investors can take some comfort from the size of the rebound, but
this sort of volatility is not the sign of a healthy market.'
The authorities welcomed yesterday's rebound: Mr Hiroshi Yasuda, the
vice-minister at the finance minister, said stocks were now at a reasonable
level for buying.
A sharp reminder of the continuing problems in the financial community came
with news of the Hachidai Corporation, a property developer, being declared
insolvent with debts of Y114bn (Pounds 490m).
A central reason for the market's recent gloom has been concern about the
burden of bad debts on banks from speculative investments in stocks and
property.
Yesterday bank shares, which had fallen by over 30 per cent since the
beginning of the month, recovered sharply with some stocks rising by the
maximum permitted daily limit.
Securities industry executives have repeatedly urged the government to
support the market by measures to encourage securities buying and by steps
to boost the economy.
Last week's cut in the Official Discount Rate, the Bank of Japan's key
lending rate, and plans to bring forward public works spending proved
insufficient to restore investors' confidence.
Yesterday, sentiment was buoyed by reports that leaders of the Liberal
Democratic Party were considering proposals to cut taxes and boost public
spending in the financial year which started this month by means of a
supplementary budget.
Discussions on a possible supplementary budget will now begin in earnest
following the passage of the basic budget bill through the Diet on Thursday.
Politicians are also examining plans to allow public sector pension funds to
invest a bigger proportion of their money in securities. However, officials
of the ministry of finance have so far opposed moves which might appear like
artificial efforts to prop up shares.

FT  11 APR 92 / Quiet bewilderment as Iranians cast their votes

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to spot an election poster in Tehran this year. On previous
polling days they covered this vast city, every wall sprouting slogans and
portraits of the ruling clergy.
Instead there was an air of tranquillity yesterday as Iranians voted in
parliamentary elections which are expected to strengthen the hand of
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his supporters who want to improve
relations with the west. Opposing the president is another Islamic faction,
fighting a rearguard action in the 270-seat parliament to assert a more
radical role.
Election days in Iran have not been noted for their tranquillity. Debates in
parliament can be fierce and chanting demonstrators fill the streets. In
1988, Islamic radicals hijacked an airliner shortly before the poll. Bombs
are not unknown, usually planted by the banned Islamic Marxist opposition.
By contrast, the voting yesterday for the Fourth Majlis (parliament) was a
muted affair. Polling stations were quiet. 'I'm sure they will come,' said
an election official peering anxiously at the empty streets.
The day slid by, much like any other weekend. Friday prayers started with
the usual chorus of 'Death to America'. Friends strolled around Mellat park.
Only a few soldiers stood on street corners in case of trouble.
In part, it was the mayor's responsibility. He had declared war on political
posters and sent city workers into the streets in hot pursuit of party
volunteers. Even before the glue had dried, most of the posters were removed
and dumped.
Throughout the past week campaign meetings have been low-key. Like most
other candidates, Mr Rajaie Khorassani, former Iranian ambassador to the UN,
held his in a mosque. The audience, stragglers from evening prayers, chatted
quietly through his speech.
So subdued was the campaign that voters often had little idea of who was who
among the bewildering array of candidates. Mr Ali Mohammad Arab, a
19-year-old conscript from Teheran, proclaimed himself a supporter of
President Rafsanjani; in fact, he had voted for a random selection from both
sides.
With 30 votes to cast and over 2,000 candidates to choose from, voters had
to rely on short lists published in daily newspapers.
If voter-turnout appeared to be low, there was good reason. People are angry
at the state of the economy. With prices soaring on the black market and
rents nudging European levels, they have a point.
'We are earning in rials and paying in dollars,' proclaimed a middle-class
Tehrani woman.
Many of the middle classes see little point in voting. The only alternative
to the government is the Society of Combatant Clergy, militant mullahs in
the image of the late Ayatollah Khomeini.
Certainly no one seemed in much doubt that President Rafsanjani will
consolidate his support. 'We already know who is going to win,' said an
official from the Ministry of Islamic Guidance.

FT  11 APR 92 / Bonds jolted by jump in US inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US bond market was jolted yesterday by news of an unexpected 0.5 per
cent jump in consumer prices last month.
The spurt in inflation came only a day after the Federal Reserve, the US
central bank, cut interest rates by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent in an
attempt to accelerate a weak economic recovery.
The rise in prices, the largest for 17 months, took the annual rate of
inflation to 3.2 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent in February.
The benchmark 30-year long bond initially fell more than half a point, but
regained some ground by midday as analysts pointed to the dangers of taking
one month's figures too seriously.
The increase in prices was broadly based, with food, energy, clothing and
transportation prices all registering big gains. The 'core' consumer price
index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.5 per cent last month, nearly
twice the increase analysts had expected. On an annual basis, core inflation
rose to 3.9 per cent last month, against 3.7 per cent in February.
The jump in inflation was a minor embarrassment for the Fed which nudged
interest rates lower partly on the basis of encouraging figures for
wholesale price inflation. Producer prices, reported on Thursday, rose only
0.2 per cent last month and by 0.9 per cent in the year to March.
The poor consumer price figures may raise fears that inflation will
accelerate again if the economy recovers from three years of abnormally
sluggish growth. Most analysts, however, were inclined to treat the March
figures as an aberration. The economy is widely seen as too weak to sustain
price increases of this magnitude.
'I expect the underlying rate of inflation to continue to drift down, but
slowly,' said Mr Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corporation, a
New York financial services company.
Some analysts, however, said the unexpected jump in prices would make the
Fed reluctant to sanction any further cuts in interest rates.

FT  11 APR 92 / Democrats losing defence budget battle
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC leaders in Congress appear to be losing the battle to cut defence
spending in order to release more money for domestic programmes.
Republican congressmen backing the Dollars 281bn (Pounds 163.30bn) defence
budget proposed by President George Bush for 1993 have won support from some
Democratic members, many of them driven by fear that military spending cuts
could affect defence industries or army bases in their home states.
Although President Bush's defence proposal already represents a cut of
around 1 per cent in real terms from this year's budget authorisation, the
Democratic leadership has argued for deeper cuts, particularly in major
equipment programmes.
But a proposal from Senator James Exon of Nebraska to cut a further Dollars
4bn from the defence budget failed in the Senate this week. Mr Exon
complained that the administration and the defence industry had dishonestly
exaggerated the job losses that deeper defence cuts would cause.
'The military-industrial complex is alive and well,' Mr Exon grumbled.
The House of Representatives had earlier approved a budget resolution that
would inflict more severe spending discipline on the Pentagon, but
congressmen are finding it difficult to enact the individual cuts that would
make up this overall reduction.
Indeed, a House appropriations committee is ready to reverse one of the cuts
President Bush has proposed, by authorising a second Seawolf submarine.
At Dollars 2bn each, the Seawolf is one of the most costly pieces of
military equipment in the US budget.
It was also the only defence programme that the Pentagon described as
specifically designed to counter the Soviet Union, and it has been hard to
argue - as supporters of the B2 stealth bomber attempted to do - that it
would be equally useful for the smaller regional wars which now loom largest
in the US's military planning.
Democratic opposition in the Senate to deeper defence cuts is led by the two
senators from Connecticut, who have been desperate to preserve their
constituents' jobs at the Groton yard which is building the Seawolf.
The political difficulty of cutting defence programmes may increase pressure
to cut the Star Wars budget.

FT  11 APR 92 / Asia's fast-growing economies defy the world recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth in Asia is expected to accelerate this year and next,
despite sluggish economies in the western world and Japan, the Asian
Development Bank forecast yesterday.
The annual economic outlook published by the Manila-based institution
predicted growth for the region's developing economies of 6.5 per cent in
1992 and 6.7 per cent in 1993, faster than 1991's 5.8 per cent rise in real
gross domestic product.
Increased intra-regional trade and investment were helping to maintain rapid
development in Asia, despite the weak performance of big industrial
economies, especially the US, which is the region's biggest export market.
Malaysia is expected to achieve the fastest growth in the area, followed by
Thailand, China and Taiwan. Economic reforms are expected to boost recovery
in South Asia.
The ADB warned that environmental degradation, infrastructure bottlenecks
and rapid population growth could reduce growth in some Asian countries, and
that the slowdown in Japan would affect the region.
It urged governments to spend more to protect the environment and control
pollution. 'The rapid deforestation of south-east and south Asia under the
onslaught of population pressures and indiscriminate logging and farming
have increased the incidence of floods and droughts, and created havoc in
local economies.'
The ADB forecast an Aids epidemic in the region. Of 40m people expected to
be infected worldwide by 2000, most would be in Asia. 'Preventive measures
have to be given top priority by governments sooner rather than later,' it
said.
In its economic forecasts, the bank said labour shortages, particularly in
Hong Kong and Taiwan, could push up wages and increase pressure to import
more manpower. It recommended a shift away from labour-intensive industries.
Rapid economic growth in China, forecast at 7.8 per cent for 1992, will not
be sufficient to halt a rise in unemployment, which will intensify because
of rises in the workforce and structural changes in the economy. China's
imports are expected to grow faster than exports, and control of inflation
will be essential, the ADB said.
South Korea was confronted with 'a large and growing trade deficit, a
relatively high rate of increase in wages and prices and infrastructure
shortages that are beginning to undermine international competitiveness'. It
said the Seoul government was faced with tough choices in an election year
when fiscal restraint may be more difficult.

WESTERN Paris will be packed with traffic tonight as hundreds of
politicians, journalists, stars, and anyone else who has laid hands on an
invitation arrive at Marne La Vallee for Euro Disneyland's eve-of-opening
gala.
Euro Disneyland, the biggest and most expensive theme park in Europe,
officially opens tomorrow. But the celebrations start this evening when
guests, clad in the Mickey Mouse sweatshirts which are obligatory garb for
the night, are let loose on the attractions. A string of stars - from Tina
Turner to Jose Carreras - will croon for a 'musical spectacular' to be
broadcast on French television.
Anyone who has glanced at a French newspaper or magazine recently could be
forgiven for thinking Euro Disneyland had already opened. The French press,
which followed every hitch and suspected hitch in the park's construction
with avid attention, has flung itself into a furore over the pros and cons
of Paris's latest tourist attraction.
So far the French public has heard more about the cons. Le Nouvel
Observateur, the leftish weekly, has devoted four pages to whether the park
was a 'cultural Chernobyl'.
A group of intellectuals polled by Figaro, the right-wing daily, voted
solidly against Euro Disneyland. One dismissed it as 'a construction of
hardened chewing gum and idiotic folklore taken straight out of comic books
written for obese Americans'. Another hoped 'with all my heart' that it
would be 'burnt down'.
Euro Disneyland does have some supporters. Mr Andre Glucksmann, the pop
philosopher, leapt to its defence in the International Herald Tribune. 'This
may come as a surprise but I don't feel attacked either by an outside enemy
or a hostile foreigner,' he said.
One bastion of the French media has remained loftily aloof from the debate.
The venerable Michelin has devoted its latest guide to what to do in and
around Euro Disneyland. The 'white knuckle' attractions - the Phantom Manor
haunted house with its 999 ghosts and the runaway minetrain - come out tops
with the ultimate accolade of three stars.
But only one of the park's cafes and restaurants, the Lucky Nugget Saloon,
was deemed worthy of a star - and that was for 'interest', not food.

FT  11 APR 92 / Australians in gold-mine deal with Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Russian government yesterday approved a ground-breaking deal letting
foreigners into the country's jealously-guarded gold mining industry.
Strengthened by his survival of the Russian congress's attempts to sack him,
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, finally signed a
resolution allowing Lenzoloto, a state-owned Siberian gold producer, to team
up with an Australian consortium, Star Technology Systems.
The deal is the first to involve a foreign company directly in the flagging
Russian gold industry since Stalin brought in western know-how for a brief
period starting in 1927. The now-independent republics of Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan are also entering partnerships with foreign gold mining
companies.
Under the long-debated deal, Star will obtain a 31 per cent stake in
Lenzoloto in return for an injection of cash and technology to develop its
prime Sukhoi Log mine and reduce waste in existing alluvial, open pit and
underground operations.
The Russian government and the local authorities of the Irkutsk region will
also hold minority stakes, with Lenzoloto's management retaining control of
operations spreading over a territory of 105,000 sq km, along the Lena
River.
Star, which includes two listed Australian mining companies and unnamed
private investors, has been working on the deal for more than two years. The
final agreement appears however to have been well worth the effort.
Star will be entitled to a third of the profits from sales of the gold,
which will go exclusively to the state at a price to be determined by the
government.
Although figures for the size of Lenzoloto's reserves were not immediately
available, one foreign executive described them as being 'elephant-sized'.
The deal has run into strong opposition from Mr Valery Rudakov, the powerful
head of Rossalmazzoloto, the central gold-producing authority, who believes
Sukhoi Log should be put out tender 'if it has to be given to foreigners in
the first place'.
Russia is believed to have produced around 240 tons of gold last year - the
world's third largest producer after South Africa and the US. The
neighbouring Irkutsk and Yakutia gold mining regions together account for
more than a fifth of Russian gold output.

FT  11 APR 92 / Fleet sails uncharted waters: Life under two flags on the
Black Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOORED in Sevastopol's historic harbour, the anti-submarine ship Skoryi
('Quick') flies the red, white and blue Soviet naval flag, whose hammer and
sickle represents a country which no longer exists.
The flag is an oddly appropriate symbol for the Black Sea fleet, which has
been consigned to limbo by the unstable compromise Ukraine and Russia have
achieved after a five-day struggle for control of the fleet.
The conflict over the former Soviet Union's most powerful warm-water naval
force, which includes 350 ships, 150 aircraft and 28 submarines with nuclear
capacity, marked a low point in Ukrainian-Russian relations.
Unable to enforce their rival claims to the fleet or to hoist their national
flag on its ships, Ukraine and Russia have suspended their decrees. The
fleet has reverted to the shaky status quo ante - the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
That is fine with the Skoryi's 34-year-old captain, Andrei Reshetov.
'If we are forced to divide the fleet there will be chaos. No-one will
benefit,' he says. 'It would be better not to have to divide anything.'
Captain Reshetov's ship is the ninth to bear the name Skoryi; he says the
original was built by Russia's first naval enthusiast, Peter the Great.
But Captain Reshetov holds with a different tradition. He emphasises that
the Black Sea fleet was 'Soviet, not Russian', and portraits of Lenin are
ubiquitous aboard his ship.
Bristling with missiles, the 20-year-old Skoryi is half-way in size between
a corvette and a destroyer. It is designed primarily to fulfil strategic
tasks in the Mediterranean, hunting submarines and attacking aircraft.
Over lunch in the wood-panelled officers' mess hall, where the same
congealed noodles are on offer as are served to the enlisted men, it is
evident that Captain Reshetov and his officers are primarily concerned about
preserving the strategic functions of their ship.
A Ukrainian takeover poses a certain threat, given Ukraine's vow to become
non-nuclear and restrict its fleet to the Black Sea. Nonetheless, most
officers say they will serve whichever republic acquires political control
over the fleet, although on the Skoryi they expressed a preference for
Russia.
Below decks, where bunks are stacked in threes, sympathies swing the other
way. Most recruits have been drafted from Ukraine and even the ethnic
Russians among them say they hope the fleet will become Ukraine's.
Deputy captain Igor Prutskov sums up his ship's predicament: 'What are we to
do - raise the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag at the stern and the Russian
tricolor at the bow?'

FT  11 APR 92 / Yeltsin defeats challenge to his economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday appeared to beat off the Russian
parliament's challenge to his economic reforms after deputies dropped
demands that he redraft a plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund,
Leyla Boulton writes.
He also won overwhelming backing for a new federation treaty binding
together Russia's ethnic regions.
Mr Yeltsin now has one final hurdle to overcome when deputies vote this
weekend on whether to press demands that he give up the premiership and cut
back his government of young economic reformers.
In a veiled threat to go to the country with a referendum on his right to
rule with strong powers, the Russian leader warned the restive Congress of
People's Deputies 'not to put pressure on me'.
He asked the congress to delay until September a proposed deadline at the
end of May for him to introduce a new law which would deprive him of the
right to nominate and head the cabinet.

FT  11 APR 92 / Peruvian jail massacre feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERUVIAN human rights groups said yesterday they feared an imminent massacre
inside a high security prison for Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)
guerrillas, after troops and armoured vehicles were seen entering the
precinct.
One of President Alberto Fujimori's first decrees after overthrowing
democracy in a palace coup last Sunday was to put the army and police in
charge of Peru's prisons. The wardens were perceived to have lost control
inside jails such as the Miguel Castro Castro, which the Shining Path has
turned into a no man's land.
A heavy crackdown inside Castro Castro would allow Mr Fujimori to claim an
early success for his military-backed 'emergency government'. It would boost
army morale and raise the president-turned-strongman's already high rating
in public opinion polls.
In a further indication of a crackdown, the army has requisitioned a large
hospital in Lima in apparent anticipation of heavy casualties.
The tension surrounding the army's next move has added to the state of limbo
that has engulfed the capital following Mr Fujimori's coup.
On the surface, little has changed in Lima. The tanks and troops that guard
the empty congress and supreme court - which Mr Fujimori has closed - are
not unusual in a country accustomed to living under a state of siege. The
soldiers look bored. Pedestrians hardly notice them. Lima's chaotic traffic
roars by.
It is hard to find anyone in the street who mourns the demise of congress.
Their reasons are variations on a theme: politicians and judges are corrupt,
self-serving parasites in a poor country that could not afford them. They
echo Mr Fujimori's relentless attacks against parliament and the judiciary
since his election 22 months ago.
Snap opinion polls this week gave Mr Fujimori over 70 per cent support for
knocking out the two other powers of the state.
The president is using his standing in opinion polls to legitimise his
actions. 'Congress was not a temple of a democracy, it was a market for
bartering laws,' he told a gathering of exporters, promising to excise
corruption from all walks of public life.
His speech, broadcast live to the nation, was strong on rhetoric and short
on concrete plans for government. As he claimed that supreme court judges
could be bribed for a mere Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 11,600), several of the
sober-suited gentlemen in the audience looked embarrassed.
Mr Fujimori on Thursday sacked 13 judges who had been appointed by his
predecessor and arch enemy, Mr Alan Garcia. Mr Garcia is in hiding, along
with another dozen leading figures of his party, the American Popular
Revolutionary Alliance.
Several other politicians have been placed under house arrest or detained.
The repression has been selective but it has thrown political parties into
disarray. Press censorship has been lifted, and one can talk to detained
congressmen on the telephone, even as their houses are surrounded by tanks
and army units.
A large number of the now redundant congressmen met in secret on Thursday
night to impeach President Fujimori and nominate a successor, Mr Carlos
Garcia Garcia. It was a symbolic action, almost devoid of meaning in the
face of so much public indifference.

   MALI ZVORNIK, SERBIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOSLEM and Serb refugees streamed across the River Drina into Serbia
yesterday from the embattled frontier town of Zvornik in northeast Bosnia,
as it again came under Serb mortar and artillery fire.
Serb irregular forces moved to wipe out pockets of Moslem resistance in the
town, after earlier Serbian reports that Zvornik had been 'liberated'.
Fighting continued across Bosnia despite a warning by the Yugoslav armed
forces that they would intervene unless peace was restored.
The republic has been engulfed by violence since its independence was
recognised by the European Community and the US this week. Serbs, who make
up 33 per cent of the 4.4m population, vehemently oppose independence, while
Moslems and Croats support it.
Witnesses in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, said Serbs hit a police station
with artillery and mortars, but Belgrade radio said the building was
attacked by Moslems. Clashes between Serbs and Moslems were also reported in
Visegrad and Foca, eastern Bosnia.
Among the refugees hurrying from Zvornik across the bridge into the Serbian
town of Mali Zvornik, was Amela, a Moslem with two children in tow, who
clutched the few possessions she could carry. 'Serb fighters took our car,'
she said. 'My uncle was killed while peering out the window. If we can ever
return, who knows what will be left after the looting and destruction.'
There were reports in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, of people
being called up for military service, signalling that the army might
intervene. It warned on Thursday night that it would take action. General
Bozidar Stevanovic, federal air force chief, told Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
Moslem president of Bosnia: 'We will take full combat measures against
objects and formations. . . if stolen military equipment is not returned and
armed attacks on units and facilities do not cease.'

Mexico's consumer price index was up 1 per cent in March, against 1.2 per
cent a month earlier, Jeanne Grant reports from Mexico City. Although
inflation continues to fall this year, the cumulative increase for the first
three months of 1992 now stands at 4.1 per cent. Single-digit inflation, the
government's goal for the year, seems unlikely to be achieved. Most analysts
predict a figure of between 12 and 14 per cent.

FT  11 APR 92 / Rolls-Royce wins Tupolev engine deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE will provide engines for a new Russian passenger aircraft under
an ambitious manufacturing deal concluded yesterday which could bring the UK
aero-engine manufacturer about Pounds 490m worth of business over the next
decade.
The agreement, signed in Moscow by Robert Fleming, the UK investment
management company, with Russia's Tupolev design bureau and Aviastar, the
country's biggest aircraft plant, creates a joint stock company to produce
and market a 200-seat twin engine passenger aircraft.
The aircraft, known as the TU-204 in its existing Russian-only form, will be
fitted with Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines and western avionics. The avionics
supplier has yet to be determined.
The pioneering deal not only gives a foreign company a direct stake in the
Russian aviation industry but represents a badly-needed victory for the
Russian government's campaign to attract foreign capital despite the
obstacles facing potential investors.
The British-Russian Aviation Corporation (Bravia) will be 50 per cent owned
by a subsidiary of Fleming's Russian investment fund, with Tupolev and
Aviastar holding 25 per cent each.
The deal seeks to marry Russia's manufacturing capacity and cheap labour
force with western know-how to produce a low-cost aircraft which can compete
with western counterparts.
Its nearest western equivalent is the US Boeing-757, which is powered by the
same engine.
The engines are to be paid for with foreign exchange earnings from the sale
of the aircraft either outside Russia or to airlines inside the country once
they have access to hard currency.
The first two engines, for a test aircraft, are due to be delivered to
Russia in May.
Although Rolls-Royce will not hold a stake in the company, it will have a
seat on the board of directors.

<TEXT>
CHAMPAGNE flowed in the City of London yesterday to celebrate the election
result. Many employees were given extended lunch hours, and one wine bar ran
out of champagne. Mr Gilbert McClung, a City lawyer, had begun to celebrate
as soon as the Tories looked set for victory. 'A Conservative government has
given me Pounds 5,000 to spend and I am starting to spend it now.'
The crowds in Oxford Street remained cautious, however, mainly confining
themselves to window-shopping because of high interest rates and the
possibility of losing their jobs.
Mrs Helen Walker, whose husband is unemployed, said: 'We come here every
week and we've never seen the shops so empty. It's still getting worse, and
I can't see it improving very quickly.'
Mr Pete Lucas, a jazz musician, was also cautious. 'People aren't going to
start spending more money yet because they haven't got it to spend. I'm
finding it very difficult to get any work and where I live there are shops
closing every week.'
Mr James Carpenter, a university student, was more optimistic, perhaps
because he had just been offered a job as a financial consultant.

FT  10 APR 92 / French court issues warrant for Medecin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRENCH court yesterday issued an international arrest warrant for Mr
Jacques Medecin, the former mayor of the Riviera resort of Nice, who fled to
Uruguay 18 months ago to escape prosecution for fraud.
The warrant, over alleged embezzlement of city funds, comes two months after
Mr Medecin was sentenced in his absence to a year's imprisonment and a
FFr2.5m (Dollars 453,000) fine for misusing public money. He still faces
charges over four other fraud and financial corruption allegations.
Formerly one of southern France's most influential local politicians, the
right-wing Mr Medecin now sells T-shirts in Punta del Este and has had his
luxury villa near Nice confiscated to pay back-taxes.
Yesterday's move also increases the pace in a general crackdown on financial
corruption in politics, enthusiastically taken up by Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
the new prime minister. He made a stir on Wednesday during his maiden prime
ministerial address, by brandishing in parliament a list of alleged
offenders.
Several MPs, outraged at the apparent threat, left the chamber, though Mr
Beregovoy later said no MPs were on the list.
At the same time, a number of legal actions against party financial
corruption are coming to a head. In the past month, charges have been laid
against Mr Geard Monate and Mr Michel Reyt, the heads of two consultancies
accused of having used illicit methods to raise funds for the ruling
Socialist party.
Opposition parties are also implicated in other investigations stretching
back several years.
Yesterday's warrant, issued by the Grenoble prosecutor's chamber, concerns
FFr2.2m found missing from a city-funded group established to promote Nice
opera house. As a next step, the French authorities are expected to ask
Uruguay to extradite Mr Medecin. Technically, Uruguay can refuse because it
has no extradition accord with France, so the outcome hangs on diplomatic
contacts.
Despite his exile, Mr Medecin still exerts strong indirect influence on
politics in the region of Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur. He has lent his
support to the extreme-right-wing National Front (FN), which emerged as the
second most powerful party there in last month's regional election. Mr
Medecin's eldest daughter joined the FN's list in the election, but failed
to win a seat.

FT  10 APR 92 / Payroll group sold after tax payments go astray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks, already reeling as the Japanese economy falters, are among
500 companies in the UK facing a total loss of up to Pounds 20m following
the discovery that PAYE and national insurance payments have gone astray on
the way to the Inland Revenue.
The financial institutions, including Fuji International and Yamaichi
International, were all clients of Payroll Services, a private company that
handled about Pounds 30m a month in payroll, PAYE and NI payments.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has been appointed to act as provisional
liquidator at Payroll Services, and its parent, Wren Group, after the Inland
Revenue discovered one of the institutions was behind on its tax payments.
The UK's largest banks, which have their own payroll departments, are not
believed to be involved. But Payroll Services' client list reads like a
Who's Who of international banking. Payroll Services also paid the salaries
of the London-based crews of Japan Air Lines, which estimates it will have
to pay Pounds 250,000 again to the Inland Revenue to cover missing PAYE and
NI contributions.
This amount was described by one client, who wished to remain anonymous, as
'small fry' compared with the losses facing other companies.
Industrial Bank of Japan said last night it had not suffered any financial
damage, having stopped using Payroll Services for making payments last
November. Visa International, one of Payroll Services' biggest clients, and
Nippon Credit International, said they had stopped using Payroll Services
last year. Another large Japanese bank had made credit checks on Payroll
Services and was about to segregate its payments. However, Payroll Services
failed before a trustee account could be set up.
The Inland Revenue has agreed to give Payroll Services' clients a moratorium
of a few weeks on paying the missing taxes while Touche Ross establishes how
much is missing. The Inland Revenue has made clear, however, that in such
cases it still looks to the banks and companies for payment of the taxes.
The Pounds 20m believed to be missing is an initial estimate and sources
close to the company believe it could be much higher.
Touche Ross is investigating all the circumstances surrounding its
appointment and has reached no conclusions on why the money has gone
missing.
Touche Ross said all the directors of Wren Group and Payroll Services had
left the company. Mr Terence Wright, who holds all but one of Payroll
Services' 5,000 shares, could not be contacted.
Yesterday, Touche Ross said a consortium of Payroll Services' clients had
bought its goodwill and equipment for a sum understood to be about Pounds
1m.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sense of reprieve sweeps the Conservatives'
HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT SMITH Square, where the evening had begun with an air of suppressed
relief as exit polls indicated the result was too close to call, Mr Shaun
Woodward, communications director, was holding the fort.
The energetic young official, resplendent in blue pinstripe wore the look of
a man just reprieved from Death Row, resplendent in blue pinstripe. He was
already confident enough simply to smile when it was suggested the early
signs were he would not be clearing out his desk. As he did so, he crowded
closer to the television to catch comments made by Mr Chris Patten, the
drained-looking party chairman.
While the defeated Mr Patten spoke, an attentive minion distributed
cassettes of the Conservatives' campaign theme tune. Other Central Office
superintendents - some wearing bages designating them as 'gofers' - began to
perk up. 'I'd rather be watching Duck Soup,' said a doorman.
At around 10.20pm, Mr Woodward, who had 'enjoyed every minute of the
campaign' was successfully fighting the urge not to pronounce on these early
indicators. But he was happy to offer his view of how the campaign had gone,
together with the prediction: 'I think it is going right down to the wire.'
According to Mr Woodward, the Tories had stuck to their guns after they had
got off to a predictably slow start due to unhelpful economic statistics.
'We broke their (Labour's) momentum a week ago,' he said, expressing
satisfaction that pressure to change tack in the final days had been
resisted.
'We were running fastest to the tape,' he added. 'We believed this morning
we would be the largest party. The other thing coming through was a very
strong sense of John Major.'
There was certainly a strong sense of John Major in the journalists' bunker,
thanks to the upbeat posters of the prime minister surrounded by smiling
schoolchildren and the slogan proclaiming him 'The Best Future For Britain'.
At 12.45am, with Basildon and Putney held, Southport won and Cheltenham
lost, Mr Woodward made another sortie. 'At the moment, it looks like Labour
are falling way behind their expectations,' he said. still cautioning that
it would be a long night full of surprises.

FT  10 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie posts biggest gain of the
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market, shrugging off the debilitating effects of the recent
slides by Wall Street and Tokyo, was gripped by election fever as the market
spiralled upwards towards the close amid frantic trading and a growing
feeling that the Tories might have staged a last gasp advance to pip Labour
at the post.
The FT-SE 100-share Index went into overdrive, gathering momentum as the day
wore on to close 43.2 higher at 2,436.4, its biggest single-session rise
this year.
Adding to the market's general mood of enthusiasm was another bout of
strength in the currency and money markets. Sterling continued to rise
against the dollar and the D-Mark, especially the latter, while the
three-month interbank rate indicated that the market sees no short term
increase in bank base rates.
Gilt-edged stocks mirrored the general mood, posting gains of around half a
point.
Dealers pushed equity prices ahead as soon as the market opened after
confirmation in the most recent opinion polls that the Conservative party
had begun to peg back the long-held Labour lead.
They were also reassured by a late rally on Wall Street on Wednesday
evening. Another bad showing by the Tokyo market, down to its lowest level
for 5 1/2 years, had been expected, dealers said, but remained a worrying
factor.
What took the market by surprise was the weight and volume of demand for UK
equities at the eleventh hour of the election campaign. The Footsie future
galloped ahead, triggering short-covering around the derivatives market and
causing a flurry of buying of the underlying Footsie stocks.
There was strong evidence that overseas funds had moved back into the London
market, with Glaxo, ICI, BAT Industries and all the recently troubled
utilities attracting exceptionally heavy support from the Continent, the US
and domestic institutions.
'We have had our busiest day for a week or so,' said a trader at one of the
leading US investment banks, although he professed scepticism over the
market's expectations of an overall Tory majority in the next parliament.
Another trader said the market had definitely responded to a late swing of
support for the ruling party, and marketmakers, alarmed at the prospect of
waking up with short trading positions in the face of a Tory victory, had
rushed in to cover all their short positions. 'There is no doubt the City
expects a much better showing by the Conservatives, and there has definitely
been keen support for the leaders since the encouraging economic data
earlier this week,' he added.
Seaq turnover in equities was well above expectations at 506.2m shares.
Strategists are forecasting a tumultuous trading session this morning, when
it is expected that the biggest single-session volume so far this year, just
over 700m shares, will be left far behind.
Water, electricity and power generation stocks, all of which have been
roughly treated in the run-up to the general election, were strongly
supported, as was BT, in both fully-paid and partly-paid form. Reuters was
hit by another burst of selling pressure.

<TEXT>
REPORTS OF a late surge in support for the Conservative party in yesterday's
general election triggered a strong advance in stock index futures in a
volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the June contract on the FT-SE opened firmly and it rose 5 to
2,444 within minutes. But June soon went into retreat after a leading
institution began executing a sizeable order, sending the contract falling
to 2,438.
Further selling, in spite of sporadic buying from independent traders, saw
June move lower in the morning. But buying interest returned in the
afternoon as talk of a Conservative party lead increased.
A firm Wall Street and a late burst of panic buying as independent traders
filled short positions saw June recover ground lost earlier.
June closed at 2,476, up 38 from the previous session and around 19 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22.
Turnover reached 7,391. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was particularly active in the
session.
The traded options market also witnessed a busy day. Turnover rose to a
healthy 41,847 lots. Hedging in the FT-SE options was the main feature, with
22,334 contracts dealt by the close.

FT  10 APR 92 / Hopes of disposal boost ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK that ICI might be about to sell off one of its divisions was behind a
good performance for the shares, which advanced 14 to 1273p. Analysts said
the market believed that the chemicals company would soon announce the
disposal of its fibres subsidiary, following a report in a leading US trade
magazine.
There is a feeling that US chemicals group Du Pont wants to buy the division
to get a foothold in Europe and observers estimate that it could be worth
around Pounds 350m to ICI. The latter said it never comments on market
rumour.
Mr Charles Lambert of securities house Smith New Court said the sale would
be good for sentiment and could be worth some 30p on ICI's share price, but
would not impinge heavily on the company's balance sheet. ICI said yesterday
it had completed the sale of its rock salt and white salt businesses to a
US-based investor group in a deal valued at about Pounds 40m.
Forte pressured
Hotel group Forte came under pressure on consideration of Queens Moat
Houses' results, released on Wednesday, which pointed to continued poor
hotel occupancy rates in the UK.
Queens Moat, which derives around 40 per cent of its profits from
continental Europe, reported UK occupancy rates for the first two months of
the year below the level a year ago - a period when the hotel trade was hit
badly by the Gulf war.
Hoare Govett yesterday sounded a cautious note on Forte, pointing out that
the group is heavily exposed to the UK market. The shares slipped a penny to
214p in busy trading of 1.3m. Queens Moat rose 2 to 73p, helped by a strong
buy note from Paribas.
Reuters slides
Information group Reuters shed 20 to 1085p on turnover of 1.8m shares, heavy
for the stock, as a result of what one analyst called 'Wall Street
paranoia'. More than a third of Reuters shares are held by US investors and
Wall Street has fallen sharply in recent days. Also, a couple of UK
securities houses have turned cautious this week.
However, Henderson Crosthwaite was a strong buyer yesterday and Mr Brian
Newman, the firm's Reuters analyst, said: 'We think the stock is oversold
and I believe that the launch date for its automated foreign exchange system
Dealing 2000-2 is imminent.'
Building group Amec saw its shares rise in spite of a loss of Pounds 9.9m
against profits of Pounds 42.2m last year, with property write-downs the
culprit. However, Amec's other markets appear generally solid, and the group
is holding on to cash of Pounds 76m.
One building analyst argued that given the fact that Amec's dividend is
covered this year, and taking account of the company's strong cash position,
a yield of 9.2 per cent - similar to Wimpey and Costain - is too high. He
added that the shares should move to a lower yield of say 8 per cent,
implying a price of around 170p. Yesterday the shares moved forward 11 to
149p.
A buy note from Nomura helped Cable and Wireless rise 10 to 538p. The house
liked the telecoms group's refocusing of strategy, although as in the case
of others it is cautious over restructuring costs.
Rumours of a late surge in support for the Conservatives made BT partly-paid
the most heavily traded stock of the day with over 10m shares recorded. The
partly-paid finished 6 3/4 ahead at 100 1/2 p. The ordinary shares gained 7
to 314p.
Euro Disney remained friendless as the fall-out from this week's analysts'
visit to the Paris site continued to pull the stock down. Further trouble
for the theme park, which opens its doors to the public this weekend, can be
expected next week when a number of analysts are likely to produce negative
reports. The shares retreated 22 to 1433p.
Rank Organisation, seen as a safe political hedge, continued its strong
surge, ending 19 higher at 688p.
BP recovered some of its recent fall as the effect of a buy recommendation
from securities house Hoare Govett made itself felt. Hoare has changed its
stance from a hold and argues that the bad news surrounding the company is
already discounted. The shares gained 2 1/2 to 248p.
If any sector was guaranteed to benefit from rumours about a late increase
in support for the Conservatives it was the politically sensitive utilities.
Hopes that the party responsible for privatisation of the electricity and
water industries would hang on to power resulted in sharp gains by shares in
both sectors.
The Electricity Package rose Pounds 93 to Pounds 2453, after rallying Pounds
92 on Wednesday.
Scottish power companies continued to recover some of their losses. Scottish
Hydro improved 6 to 85p and Scottish Power 7 to 83p.
Among water companies, Anglian gained 14 to 331p, Thames 15 to 344p and
Welsh Water 16 to 356p.
Politics were the main factor boosting stores, and not just speculation
about a late swing to the Tories. County NatWest issued a note saying that a
Labour government would not be as bad for the sector as sentiment suggested.
Analyst Ms Kimlan Cook at County said that if the Conservatives managed to
achieve an overall majority shares would surge anyway, but if Labour formed
the next government prices would come off, representing good buying
opportunities for the quality stocks.
Dixons, up 12 at 210p, was identified by County as a particular buying
target, partly because it is not as politically vulnerable as feared, and
among other reasons the company's US operation is no longer a negative
factor.
Other selective buy recommendations from NatWest's investment arm were
Argos, which appreciated 14 to 247p, Boots, ahead 12 at 419p, Marks and
Spencer, up 10 at 301p, and WH Smith, 22 stronger at 415p.
Traders marked up the price of Wellcome on news that former tennis star Mr
Arthur Ashe is using its Retrovir drug to treat Aids. The shares closed 24
ahead at 1086p after unimpressive turnover.
Speculation that new contracts would be announced with next week's interim
figures helped Smiths Industries jump 14 to 276p.
Construction equipment distributor and maker BM Group closed 12 down at
294p. A number of large holders of the stock are known to have sold out over
the last few weeks as worries surfaced over the integration of Thomas
Robinson, which it acquired in January. There is also concern about the
company's exposure to the troubled building and construction sector.
Worries about the financial health of Eurotunnel left the shares 10 weaker
at 403p, making it one of the handful of FT-SE stocks to buck the market
trend.

FT  10 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow boosted as Fed eases
monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets rebounded from two days of heavy losses, aided by good news
on inflation and an easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 43.61 up at 3,224.96, although off
its high for the day when the index had been ahead more than 50 points. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 forged ahead 6.14 to 400.64, while the Nasdaq
composite index of over-the-counter stocks soared 13.07 to 586.75. Turnover
on the New York SE was again heavy at 231m shares and rises outpaced falls
by 1,271 to 494.
Share prices opened firmer, but did not take off until 11.30am, when the Fed
eased, by signalling to the credit markets that it wanted the Fed Funds rate
brought down from 4 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent. The Fed's action was
interpreted primarily as an attempt to boost the economy.
Room was made for a monetary easing by the morning's inflation figures,
which showed that producer prices rose just 0.2 per cent in March,
indicating that inflationary pressures remained dormant.
There were some big gains among leading stocks which bore the brunt of
Tuesday and Wednesday's selling. Merck gained Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 150
1/8 , General Electric rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 74 3/4 , Philip Morris
firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 75 7/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble advanced Dollars
2 1/4 to Dollars 98 3/4 .
Banking issues, which have suffered from concern about a Japanese financial
crisis, recovered strongly. JP Morgan rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 55 7/8 ,
aided by an upgrade from a 'hold' to a 'buy' recommendation from Brown
Brothers Harriman. Bankers Trust firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 1/8 ,
Citicorp gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 1/8 and Chemical put on Dollars 1
to Dollars 30 1/2 .
One of the rare losers was Digital Equipment, which dropped Dollars 5 1/4 to
Dollars 48 1/4 after reporting a fiscal third-quarter loss of Dollars 294m,
compared with a profit at the same stage last year of Dollars 117m. News of
higher March sales lifted retailers JC Penney Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 65,
Sears Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 , Dayton Hudson Dollars 2 5/8 to
Dollars 62 5/8 and K Mart Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 52.
Fannie Mae moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 65 1/8 on news of a 13 per
cent rise in first-quarter profits to a record Dollars 381.6m.
Canada
TORONTO stocks quickly picked up from a flat opening after the US Federal
Reserve cut its funds rate target, sending the market sharply higher. The
upturn reversed two straight days of losses in the market totalling 68
points on the 300-share composite index.
The index closed 30.9 up at 3,349.0, while advances led declines by 310 to
237 after volume of 27.7m shares.
Canadian banks quickly followed the US Fed's move with cuts to their prime
rates to 8 per cent from 8.25.

FT  10 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling stages late rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUOYANT start to the dollar in London was reversed when the Federal
Reserve unexpectedly added funds to the money market in the US.
Earlier reports that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, was to face a
vote of no confidence pushed the dollar up, but the US currency slid sharply
after the Fed's actions, which signalled a cut in its target funds rate to
3- 3/4 per cent from a previous 4 per cent.
The dollar fell from a level of DM1.6230/40 ruling before the Fed's
operation to close in London at DM1.6180. Later in New York it finished at
DM1.6164/70 and Y132.02/12.
The US unit remained easier against the yen but by no more than before the
Fed added funds to the money market. Traders said there was still little
interest rate differential between the dollar and yen and the market was
more inclined to forgive a rate cut if it helped bolster the US recovery.
Fears of repatriation of funds by Japanese investors continued to dominate
yen trading. Further sharp declines in Tokyo stocks today could well see the
dollar test Y132 and lower, traders said.
In late Asian trading the dollar slipped against the yen but remained firm
against the D-Mark, with sales of D-Marks for yen dominating. The dollar
closed in Tokyo at Y132.70 and DM1.6360.
Later in European trading the D-Mark was also hurt by investors switching
into yen. The German unit ended at Pta63.38/41, down from Pta63.53/56 on
Wednesday, but was fairly steady against the French franc at FFr3.3876/79,
after FFr3.3872/74 the night before.
Many of London's trading rooms packed up early to leave traders fresh for
late night and early morning business. 'We have got it all mapped out,' said
one trader. 'It will be a couple of pints and a curry first, then at the
desk for the exit polls and all eyes on the marginals. It is going to be
seat of the pants, minute by minute trading.'
During the day the pound staged a rally. News that the Conservative party
had made ground against Labour in Wednesday night's opinion polls encouraged
speculation of a Tory win.
Sterling rose against the D-Mark by about a pfennig to stand above DM2.85
throughout the day after opening at DM2.8419. It closed at DM2.8575. The UK
currency picked up to Pta180.92 from its EMS floor of Pta180.59, where it
has been in recent days.
A full set of parities for the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System after the admission of the Portuguese escudo is published in
today's FT. The table includes the rates at which central banks are
committed to buy and sell every other currency in the system, together with
the bilateral central rates.

FT  10 APR 92 / Money Markets: Short sterling rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A smattering of optimism on a sunny election day helped push rates down in
generally thin trading.
Interbank rates eased over the day on a stronger pound and the belief among
some traders that a late gain for the Conservative party in the opinion
polls on Wednesday night had improved their chances for snatching victory.
However, Mr Nick Parsons, head of the treasury advisory group at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce said the movement was driven by people who had
left themselves short on sterling as much as by sentiment or rumour.
Mr Parsons feared sterling had crept too high. 'The great danger is that it
has now gone too far. I see very little upside for sterling on the return of
a Conservative majority, but at least 3 to 4 pfennigs on the downside on
Labour or a hung parliament,' he said.
The key three-month interbank rate remained down on last week's high of 11.5
per cent at 10 7/8 - 3/4 .
The June sterling contract opened seven basis points higher after
yesterday's gains, at 89.21 before pushing ahead in early trade to reach a
high of 89.30. Volumes dwindled over the day and the contract closed at
89.24
The general sentiment in the markets appears to be that a unilateral
devaluation of sterling has been ruled out regardless of the outcome of the
election. But the interest rate risk has not necessarily diminished, many
dealers declared, in spite of the backtracking from last week's levels.
The Bank of England continued to foster inexpensive funding. Its forecast
shortage in the morning was Pounds 100m. The overnight rate notched up to 8
1/2 - 1/4 per cent when the Bank did not operate at midday. In the early
afternoon the Bank took out the shortage by purchasing Pounds 100m of band-1
bank bills at the established intervention rate of 10 3/8 per cent. The
overnight rate closed at 10 3/8 - 1/8 per cent.
The Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the banking system through
overnight system repurchase agreements, signalling an ease in credit policy,
economists said.
Funds traded at 3- 7/8 per cent at the time of the Fed's operation. The
Fed's presumed federal funds rate target had been 4 per cent and economists
said the reserve addition probably pointed to a new target of 3- 3/4 per
cent.

US Treasury prices rose sharply across the board yesterday after the Federal
Reserve, responding to concern about the sluggishness of the domestic
economy, and with one eye on a possible financial crisis in Japan, eased
monetary policy.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was up  19/32 at 101 19/32 ,
yielding 7.854 per cent. The two-year note was even firmer, up  13/32 at 101
1/4 , yielding 5.058 per cent.
Prices had been firmer in early trading following a positive inflation
report, which showed producer prices rose just 0.2 per cent during March.
The indication that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted may
have been the trigger for the Fed's easing move, which involved intervention
in the credit markets.
The Fed's actions, a series of overnight system repurchase agreements while
the Fed funds rate was trading at 3 7/8 per cent (below its target of 4 per
cent), surprised the market, which had been expecting no intervention. The
move was immediately interpreted as an easing of policy, although analysts
were unsure whether the new target rate was 3 3/4 per cent or 3 1/2 per
cent. In late trading Fed funds were holding steady at 3 3/4 per cent.
Recent messages emanating from the Fed have suggested the authorities remain
concerned about the sluggish nature of the economic recovery, and in
particular about the weakness in money supply growth. Yesterday's signal
that the Fed wants to see lower interest rates was interpreted as an attempt
to address those problems.
The sharp declines in Tokyo stock markets over the past week, and growing
concern that an economic slump in Japan could stifle world - and therefore
US - economic recovery, may also have helped persuade the Fed the time was
right for a further easing.
DURING normal trading hours yesterday, UK government bonds continued their
last-ditch pre-election advance with further gains of more than half a
point. The market's apparent belief: that the ruling Conservative party
could yet find itself still in office when the votes have been counted.
'It could be the triumph of hope over reason,' one analyst said, adding that
some speculative money had come into the gilts market during the day.
Yesterday's gains come on top of a strong performance already recorded this
week. The market has now climbed firmly away from its low point of a week
ago, when yields touched their high point for the year so far. The benchmark
9 per cent bonds maturing in 2011 had recovered from 93 27/32 to 94 3/4 by
the opening of business yesterday, and during the day moved ahead further to
95 3/8 .
In a moderately busy day on the futures market, the long gilts future, which
opened at 94 17/32 , rose to a high of 95 on news of an easing of US rates,
before easing slightly.
Yesterday's gains reflected both a more positive showing for the
Conservatives in late opinion polls before voting began, and further moves
by traders to cover short positions.
SHORTER-dated bonds in Germany moved ahead yesterday while long dated paper
remained steady, bringing about a further flattening of the German yield
curve.
Two things prompted the greater confidence in shorter-dated paper. One was a
comment by Mr Norbert Kloten, president of Baden-Wurttenberg central bank,
that interest rates should fall in the second half of the year. The second
was the recommendation of an arbitration committee that public sector
workers should receive a pay rise of 5.4 per cent - lower even than the
level the market had been hoping for.
'The market has clearly taken a different view on monetary policy,' said Mr
Klaus Baader, an economist with UBS Securities in London. A week ago,
10-year bonds were yielding 47 basis points more than five-year paper:
yesterday, that differential had fallen to 36 basis points.
JAPANESE government bonds eased yesterday, as investors continued to watch
with horror the havoc being wreaked on the financial sector by the plunge in
share prices.
With the confirmation of the Japanese budget (with its projected borrowing
of Y7,300bn) yesterday acting as a reminder of the extensive supply of bonds
to come in the year ahead, there was little cheer during the day.
The yield on the benchmark bond no. 129 rose during the day from 5.555 per
cent to 5.585 per cent.

the December quarter of this year, writes Bruce Jacques.
Mr Bailey's successor will be announced in a few months.
The bank's chairman, Mr Milton Bridgland, will also retire, to be replaced
by ANZ director Mr John Gough.
The changes end an era of growth at ANZ since Mr Bailey became chief
executive in 1984. This included integration of the UK-based Grindlays

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: German regional bourses unveil
central SE deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S regional stock exchanges yesterday agreed to join the Frankfurt
bourse to create a central stock exchange holding company.
The seven exchanges, led by Dusseldorf, will set up their own company to
take the 10 per cent stake offered to them by the Frankfurt exchange in
Deutsche Borse AG, which will be set up to run Germany's stock markets on a
centralised basis.
Mr Rudiger von Rosen, managing director of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
welcomed the move saying it would strengthen the will to unite the resources
of the eight bourses as part of the drive to become more competitive in
Europe.
The regional exchanges - the others are Munich, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Berlin,
Bremen and Hanover - said they intended to share with Frankfurt, the
country's dominant bourse, the responsibility for creating a modern German
stock exchange system which met international demands.
They have set up a company called Deutsche Borsenbeteiligungs to acquire the
stake in the new stock exchange holding. Dusseldorf will own 44 per cent of
this company, Munich 18 per cent, Hamburg 13 per cent, Stuttgart 13 per
cent, Berlin 6 per cent and Bremen and Hanover 3 per cent each. Banks and
brokers in Frankfurt and other German trading centres will also participate
in Deutsche Borse.
The Bonn government has already said it favours setting up Deutsche Borse,
calling it a 'decisive breakthrough' which combines the advantages of
increased centralisation of stock exchange services with the opportunities
provided by regional trading. This was one of the measures included in the
finance ministry's paper produced in January aimed at helping increase
Frankfurt's strength as a world financial centre to rival London, New York
and Tokyo.
The other measures were the outlawing of insider trading and fairer
treatment for investors, in line with international rules of conduct.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Injunction granted against
Blockbuster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DALLAS court has granted a temporary injunction against Blockbuster, the
US video rental chain which owns the Cityvision group in the UK, restricting
its activities in certain US east coast areas.
The order follows the filing of a lawsuit against Blockbuster by Capitol
Entertainment, a Blockbuster franchisee and largely owned by the Zale
jewellery store family.
The dispute results from Blockbuster's purchase of the sizeable Erol's Video
Store chain in the US last year. Capitol, whose franchise area encompasses
some of the Erol area, has alleged that Blockbuster promised not to acquire
Erol until it had a deal to sell Capitol the Erol stores in Capitol's
territories; that it went ahead regardless and then offered the stores on
'the most onerous terms'.
A trial date has now been set for January 11, 1993.
However, in the meantime the court found that Blockbuster had 'competed
unfairly' with the plaintiffs, and that there were grounds for restraining
the group's activities in the area.
Blockbuster claimed that 'the court had found no evidence to support Capitol
Entertainment's contention that it had an agreement with the company to
purchase certain Erol's video stores at an agreed-upon price', and heralded
this as 'a major victory'.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae sets another
quarterly earnings record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) reported its fifth
consecutive quarter of record earnings yesterday.
The largest residential mortgage provider in the US made a profit of Dollars
381.6m in the first three months of the year, compared with the Dollars 320m
it earned at the same stage a year ago.
The first quarter was the busiest in the association's history in terms of
the number of loans Fannie Mae bought from mortgage originators and the
amount of mortgage-backed securities it subsequently sold to investors, the
combined volume of which totalled Dollars 55.6bn.
Previous record business volume was Dollars 41.7bn, recorded in the fourth
quarter of last year.
Three factors in particular had contributed to the increase in earnings
during the opening quarter, said Fannie Mae. The average net mortgage
balance rose Dollars 5.8bn, in spite of a near-record level of mortgage
portfolio liquidations, as homeowners took advantage of low interest rates
to refinance.
A rise of 3 basis points in Fannie Mae's net interest margin to 145 basis
points also boosted earnings. Thirdly, guaranty fee income from
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rose Dollars 10.9m to Dollars 193.6m. The
increase reflected a record amount of total MBS issues (Dollars 41.2bn) and
a jump in total MBS outstandings to Dollars 389.9bn.
The company's acquisition of foreclosed properties rose 17 per cent to
2,238, primarily because of difficulties in the north-eastern states, where
the US economic slump has hit hardest.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: American Airlines overhauls
domestic fare structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines, one of the three largest US airlines, yesterday unveiled
details of a radical and much-rumoured overhaul in its domestic fare
structure, writes Nikki Tait.
American said that, for domestic travel starting on April 13, it planned to
operate four principal fare classes, with fares generally lower than full
fares for comparable existing classes. First-class fares, for example, would
be 20 to 50 per cent lower than existing full fares for first-class.
On the minus side, the company will discontinue corporate discounts, and
charge a Dollars 25 fee for rescheduling or refunding tickets. The overhaul
will reduce the number of different fares offered from 500,000 to around
70,000.
Some analysts, however, saw move as an implicit attempt to push up fares.
Few travellers pay full coach fares at present, and businesses often find
discount alternatives.
Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman, stressed that this was not a 'one-off'
promotional scheme, but a fundamental overhaul of pricing policy.
He denied that American was responding to aggressive pricing tactics by
either Southwest Airlines, the smaller carrier also based in Dallas, or
Trans World Airlines, which is in bankruptcy and has been slashing fares to
attract business customers.
Both Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, American's biggest rivals, said
that simplified fares made sense, and pledged to remain competitive.
Northwest Airlines, Continental and America West, a smaller bankrupt
carrier, also said they would adjust fares.
Mr Crandall admitted that American could lose some revenue in the short-term
 -he put the second-quarter figure at around Dollars 100m - but estimated
the long-term annual benefit at Dollars 300m to Dollars 350m.
The simpler structure, he added, could lead to annual cost savings of around
Dollars 25m.
PWA, the parent of Canadian Airlines International, is seeking CDollars 200m
(USDollars 169.5m) cash in return for selling 25 per cent of the airline to
American Airlines.
Analysts had estimated Mr Eyton would seek about CDollars 100m in new equity
for Canadian.
The two companies are now in negotiations.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: US retail chains show slower
rate of growth
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the largest US retail chains yesterday reported same-store sales
increases in the low single digits for the month of March - a slowdown from
the rates of improvement seen in January and February.
However, the comparisons are influenced by the timing of Easter, which fell
on March 31 in 1991, causing the pre-Easter spending period to fall in
March. In the current year, Easter is on April 19.
Sales gains in the first two months also reflect the very slow period in
early 1991, when the Gulf war held consumers' attention. In some cases,
February 1992 comparisons were also distorted by the extra leap year day.
Shares of many retail groups moved higher on the figures. Sears, Roebuck,
for example, gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 45 1/2 ; Woolworth was down
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28 5/8 ; Wal-Mart advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
52 7/8 ; JC Penney gained Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 65; Dayton Hudson was up
Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 .
The two notable exceptions were The Gap and The Limited, both specialty
fashion retailers which have been much admired for their resilience to
recession and for their retailing techniques.
The Gap saw a 3 per cent decrease in same-store sales in March, compared
with a 15 per cent increase a year ago, although total sales were up by 12
per cent. The Limited reported an 8 per cent fall in same-store sales.
Shares in these two companies fell by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 40 3/8 , and
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 , respectively.
Among the discount chains, Wal-Mart Stores saw a 6 per cent increase for
March on a same-store basis, with the overall sales figure rising by 18 per
cent to Dollars 3.93bn. K mart, however, saw a 0.7 per cent fall on a
same-store basis, with gains from its specialty chains offset by declines on
the general merchandise side.
In the department store sector, Sears, Roebuck showed a 3.6 per cent
increase in domestic same-store sales, while Dallas-based JC Penney managed
9.5 per cent. Dayton Hudson reported a 1.9 per cent improvement, but
Woolworth registered a 9.9 per cent decline for comparable stores.
At May Department Stores, there was a 4.7 per cent decline overall, but this
masked a 2.3 per cent decline in the department stores themselves and a 15.2
per cent fall in the Payless shoe stores.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Digital shares tumble 10% on
Dollars 294m net loss

<TEXT>
SHARES in Digital Equipment, the second largest US computer manufacturer,
plunged by nearly 10 per cent yesterday as it reported worse third-quarter
figures than Wall Street was expecting and said it might need to make a
further restructuring charge at the year-end.
The Massachusetts-based company, which has been cutting costs and laying off
staff in the face of a weakening world economy, said it would reinstate its
programme of lay-offs in May. In the past, executives forecast that some
10,000 staff could leave the company during the fiscal year to June, but
yesterday they appeared to hint the cuts might be deeper.
Digital reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 294m, or Dollars 2.36
a share, compared with net income of Dollars 116.5m, or 94 cents, in the
same period last year. Operating revenues totalled Dollars 3.25bn, down 8
per cent from the Dollars 3.52bn of a year ago. For the nine months it
reported a net loss of Dollars 403.86m, or Dollars 3.24 a share, compared
with net income of Dollars 253.89m, or Dollars 2.06 a share.
The company blamed the drop in revenues in part on the economic slowdown,
particularly in Europe and Japan, on unfavourable currency movements, which
cut foreign revenues by Dollars 150m to Dollars 200m and on pricing
pressures.
Product margins had declined mainly because of lower than expected volumes.
Additionally, the company's recent push into directly selling personal
computers to end users, and its new, low-cost workstations, had meant a
continued shift in its mix to lower margin products.
Mr John Smith, senior vice-president for operations, said that while the
company was very disappointed with the results it was confident in its
strategy and new products.
But he added it remained cautious about revenues and profits for the
remainder of the fiscal year and the first half of next.
He disclosed that third-quarter revenues fell about 17 per cent in Europe
and about 10 per cent in the US. On the New York Stock Exchange, Digital
shares closed at Dollars 48 1/4 , down Dollars 5 1/4 in a generally rising
market.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Intel blames AMD feud for fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported a drop
of nearly 7 per cent in first-quarter net income. It blamed the fall on
special factors, including an arbitration judgment against the company in
its long-running feud with Silicon Valley rival Advanced Micro Devices.
Net income totalled Dollars 184m, or 86 cents a share, down from Dollars
197m, or 95 cents, in the first quarter of 1991. Revenues were Dollars
1.24bn, up from Dollars 1.13bn a year ago.
The figures included a Dollars 35m reserve to cover payments to Hughes
Aircraft as part of a patent infringement settlement, and a Dollars 15m
reserve for a possible payment to AMD. In February, an arbitrator gave AMD
the right to all technologies embodied in its clone of Intel's popular 386
microprocessor. It awarded the company Dollars 15.3m in damages.
Intel said these special charges were partly offset by recognition of
Dollars 23m in deferred royalty payments previously received from AMD.
Excluding these special events, first-quarter income would have been Dollars
18m, or 8 cents a share, higher.
The company said North America was its strongest area for new orders. Europe
and Asia-Pacific improved from the fourth quarter, but Japan remained soft.

THE official bondholders' committee at Circle K, the bankrupt US convenience
store chain, yesterday filed papers in the Arizona courts opposing aspects
of the proposed sale of the business to a group of investors, writes Nikki
Tait.
The Dollars 425m deal was announced last month. The international group of
investors is led by Investcorp, the Arab finance organisation which already
owns Saks Fifth Avenue.
The bondholders committee alleges that there was lack of informed
decision-making by the board, and claims that the entire board never
received a written valuation of Circle K's worth. As a result, it suggests,
the board could not make an informed decision on the offer and breached its
fiduciary duty.

fall

<TEXT>
YVES Saint Laurent, one of the most famous French fashion houses, recovered
from its first-half profits fall to produce virtually static 1991 full-year
net profits of FFr233m (Dollars 41.60m).
YSL suffered with the rest of the global luxury goods industry during the
Gulf war, in early 1991, because of its affect on the important duty free
market. It subsequently sustained a sharp fall, of 42 per cent, in profits
during the first half of the year.
However, the group, which recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of its
haute couture house, recovered in the second half, despite the impact of
economic slowdown in the US and Japan on consumer demand for luxury goods.
It reported a marginal increase in sales, from FFr3bn in 1990 to FFr3.06bn
in 1991; net profits were down from FFr252m to FFr233m.
The couture division, which includes pret a porter, as well as the exclusive
haute couture collection, increased operating profits, from FFr123m to
FFr132m, on sales down from FFr521m to FFr512m.
Perfumes and cosmetics, the biggest part of the business, saw profits fall
from FFr392m to FFr377m, on sales which rose from FFr2.43bn to FFr2.5bn.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais doubles client
risk provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, one of the largest French banks, yesterday reported a fall
in annual net profits, from FFr3.71bn (Dollars 660m) in 1990 to FFr3.16bn,
after doubling the client risk provisions to FFr9.5bn because of loan
losses.
The fall was disclosed on the same day that the the upper house in the
French parliament ordered an inquiry into the bank.
The inquiry follows a lobby last year by opposition politicians demanding a
formal investigation into Credit Lyonnais' involvement with the ill-fated
takeover of MGM-Pathe, the Hollywood movie studio, by Mr Giancarlo Parretti,
the Italian businessman whom Credit Lyonnais later ousted from MGM.
Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman, said it was too early to comment on the
inquiry. Mr Haberer led Credit Lyonnais' aggressive expansion into new areas
of banking and different countries in the late 1980s.
The findings of the senate inquiries are influential within French political
and industrial circles, but do not have immediate legislative implications.
Credit Lyonnais, which may have to make bigger provisions in 1992 because of
its exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property group, raised
its total provisions from FFr6.5bn to FFr9.6bn last year.
Its client risk provisions - thought to include write-offs on loans to VEV,
the troubled French textile group, and Hachette, the struggling publishing
company, as well as on MGM and the companies headed by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell, the UK publisher - rose from FFr4.2bn to FFr9.5bn.
The increase in provisions, to the upper end of analysts' estimates, meant
that net profits fell despite a healthy 13.5 per cent increase in net
banking income, from FFr40.83bn to FFr46.33bn. Mr Haberer said the increase
reflected the strong performance of Credit Lyonnais' retail banking networks
in Europe, and its investment banking interests in the US.
The fall in net profits meant earnings per share slipped from FFr110.6 to
FFr90. However, the board proposed holding the dividend - for the third year
in succession - at FFr34.5 a share.
Mr Haberer said that, despite the increase in provisions and the general
problems posed by the worldwide economic slowdown, he was encouraged by the
progress of Credit Lyonnais' retail networks and by the increased
contribution from its industrial investments.
He said the group was determined to continue its policy of expanding its
European network, and confirmed it was still in discussions over an
investment in Germany's BfG, the troubled union bank belonging to the AMB
insurance company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, Sweden's leading insurance group, strengthened its position in the
Nordic area yesterday when it agreed to take over Hafnia, Denmark's second
largest insurer.
The deal will create a group with premium income of SKr22bn (Dollars 3.7bn)
and assets of SKr176bn.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, said it represented 'a
significant step in Skandia's strategy of establishing a strong position in
the Nordic market and in Skandia's international operations, where the focus
will shift to direct insurance'.
A 'critical mass' would be achieved in the UK where Prolific, Hafnia's life
business, and Economic, the general insurance company, would be merged with
Skandia's NIG Skandia, said Mr Wolrath,
The acquisition will take place through a share exchange in the ratio of
nine Skandia shares for four Hafnia Holding A shares and five B shares.
The agreement was a humiliation for Hafnia. Last December, Hafnia and
Norway's Uni Storebrand bought heavily into Skandia with the intention of
establishing a Nordic alliance.
Hafnia's position was weakened by a DKr1.22bn (Dollars 194m) loss in 1991,
announced yesterday. Mr Per Villum Hansen, Hafnia's chief executive and
Henrik Klaebel, director, have stood down.
Mr Ebbe Christensen, chairman, said Hafnia's holding company had borrowed
about DKr500m from its subsidiary Hafnia Insurance. He believed that at
least some of it was used to buy shares in Skandia. He admitted that a loan
of this kind from a subsidiary to a parent company was illegal.
Uni Storebrand will take over Skandia International, Skandia's reassurance
business (with the exception of its North American reassurance operations)
to become one of the 15 largest reassurance writers in the world with
premium income of about Dollars 1bn. The new reassurance group will take the
name Christiania International Insurance.
The Norwegian company's deal with Skandia was on the basis of a share swap
although the terms were not announced. Uni Storebrand holds 28 per cent of
the stock in Skandia, which will be reduced to 4 per cent when the
agreements are completed.
Mr Jan-Erik Langangen, chief executive of Uni Storebrand, admitted that the
company had failed in its intention of establishing a stronger Nordic base,
but he was satisfied that it had achieved the secondary objective of
strengthening the group's international business.
Hafnia's 1991 loss included an unrealised loss of DKr876m on shareholdings
in Skandia and Baltica, Hafnia's domestic rival. Losses of DKr1.09bn arose
from Danish credit guarantee business, mortgage indemnity losses in the UK,
and the financial costs of the investments in Skandia and Baltica.
Group equity capital was reduced from DKr5.34bn to DKr3.88bn over the year.
Hafnia holds 33.5 per cent of the shares in Baltica. Mr Wolrath said
yesterday that it was Skandia's intention to sell these.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: The rising workload of insolvency
practitioners - The secrets behind the way banks allocate their appointments
of receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF INSOLVENCY specialists get much of their business by scratching
influential backs in the City, London may have developed some very red backs
indeed over the past year.
While a handful of high profile insolvencies such as Polly Peck and BCCI
have drawn public criticism for the high level of fees charged, less
attention has been given to how business is allocated between the
practitioners.
As an analysis conducted by the Financial Times shows, while the pattern is
far from clear-cut, there are signs that particular banks favour certain
receivers.
Cork Gully, the largest firm and the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, reported Pounds 64m in fee income in April last year. KPMG Peat
Marwick, its largest competitor, showed insolvency fees of Pounds 44.5m at
its year end on September 30 1991, compared with Pounds 26.4m the previous
year.
Insolvency income is likely to rise significantly in absolute terms as the
firms report later this year. Given the decline in other activities, it is
also likely to make up a larger proportion of total fee income from all
accountancy services.
Practitioners point out that not only will appointments continue to rise
with the effects of the recession, but even after the economy has begun to
pick up, there is a substantial lag during which expanding businesses will
not be matched by enthusiastic banks and further insolvencies will occur.
The FT analysis uses the announcements of 5,513 receiverships made in the
official London and Edinburgh Gazettes, for the 12 months to the end of
March.
These name both the bank and the receiver which it calls in to sell the
business or its assets.
Receivership - as distinct from administration and other insolvency
procedures - is driven by banks, which hold security over assets held by the
company to which they have loaned money.
The nine banks illustrated account for 79 per cent of all receiverships
during the period, easily led by National Westminster. The top ten
insolvency and accountancy firms shown make up 76 per cent of all
receivership appointments.
Eight of the ten firms are names familiar as among the top ten accountancy
firms by fee income. The exceptions are Leonard Curtis, which specialises
purely in insolvency work, and Levy Gee, the 25th largest firm by overall
fee income, which has boosted its receivership work substantially over the
past two years.
The proportion of receiverships given by the banks to each firm varies
widely. Some banks appear to distribute their work relatively evenly, but
others clearly favour particular firms.
Cork Gully dominates the appointments overall. In all but two cases it has a
higher proportion of appointments than any other firm. The exceptions are
Hill Samuel and Yorkshire Bank.
Hill Samuel gave 23 per cent of its appointments to Levy Gee. Yorkshire Bank
gave 20 per cent to Grant Thornton and 8 per cent to Stoy Hayward. Another
unusually high figure comes from 3i, which gave 16 per cent of its
appointments to Stoy Hayward.
Partly the pattern is explained by the strong regional office structure of
firms like Grant Thornton, which offer a local presence around the country.
Some banks, such as 3i, also have a strong devolved management structure
with appointments made locally.
Most importantly, banks and receivers alike point out that receiverships are
allocated under the Insolvency Act to named qualified practitioners, not
simply to insolvency firms. That is not simply a pedantic point.
'Receivership is a very personal type of work,' says Mr Maurice Moses from
Levy Gee. 'The banks are trusting you with their money so they are not just
going to pick up the phone and ask anyone. It really boils down to
relationships and trust. It is the individual not the firm who is
appointed.'
He says four of the nine partners in the firm have close links with Hill
Samuel and says they do make efforts to cultivate individuals within the
bank. 'But the best cultivation is doing a good job,' he stresses.
In the past, some appointments by banks may have gone to the practitioners
which banked with or were audited by them. But the banks deny any
accusations of favouritism, and stress that they distribute work based on
their assessment of the expertise of individual practitioners, how well they
have performed with previous assignments, and their understanding of the
workload facing a particular firm at any one time.
One senior banker says: 'Obviously we meet the receivers socially. It is
important to know the sort of people they are. But the wining and dining
counts for nothing when it comes to appointments. Like pop stars, they are
as good as their last appointment.'
The data in the analysis needs to be treated with some caution. They only
show the number of appointments made, and give no idea of the value of each
appointment - a figure often not likely to be revealed for a year or more
after the insolvency practitioner moves in if ever.
They do, however, treat receiverships from a connected group of companies as
a single appointment, which prevents the statistics from being inflated by
dormant or related companies.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: ADT plans ambitious warrant offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, set itself an
ambitious target of a 1-for-6 warrant offering at Dollars 10 a share to
existing shareholders in its annual report circulated yesterday.
The report reflects the new standards of corporate governance introduced
after pressure exerted last year by Laidlaw, the Canadian waste services and
school bus operator which holds the majority stake in ADT.
It includes far greater details in the accounts - for the year to December
31 1991 - and a commitment to issue quarterly reports from March 31 1992.
Notes to the accounts reveal that litigation with Laidlaw cost ADT Dollars
11.5m, which Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, referred to in his letter to
shareholders as a 'short but distracting legal dispute'.
Goodwill write-offs included Dollars 278m against the acquisition of
Britannia Security Group in 1990 after an extensive review suggesting assets
had been materially overvalued. 'The company is discussing with its advisers
the various courses of action which may be available,' it said.
There are also write-offs of Dollars 146m against Christies International,
Dollars 101m against Lep and Dollars 21m of security services.
Mr Ashcroft said that in spite of attention given to the company's debt
maturities, principal banking facilities do not mature until 1994. He said
ADT continued to be in compliance with its covenants made to bankers and 'it
is not expected that any such covenants will be breached.'
Net cash provided by operating activities has risen to Dollars 218m (Dollars
140m), while net cash outflows from investing have slumped to Dollars 16m
(Dollars 539m).
Aggregate directors' remuneration fell to Dollars 4.9m (Dollars 5.6m), but
included a substantial rise in directors' shareholdings, including 1.75m
beneficial and 908,000 options held by Mr Ashcroft.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Recession and Gulf war behind Pounds 8.4m
Wembley loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEMBLEY, the international leisure group which owns the national stadium,
yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.37m for 1991 - broadly in line
with its forecast at the time of January's debt-reducing rights issue.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said recession and the Gulf war had made 1991 a
dreadful year but that the perception of debt-financed growth had also
changed.
Gearing had been reduced to 65 per cent by the rights issue and would fall
to about 50 per cent by the current year-end.
'We spent Pounds 250m over six years creating businesses with Pounds 175m of
debt,' Sir Brian said. 'The market said this was the wrong level of equity
and debt.'
Included in the pre-tax loss, a reversal from profits last year of Pounds
13.2m, was a Pounds 7.47m exceptional item. Almost half related to the
restructuring of Pacer CATS, the ticketing machine business in the US, and a
similar amount related to the write-down of the group's residual interest in
its Juliana's night club business.
Losses per share emerged at 8.5p (earnings 13.3p). A proposed final dividend
of 0.9p makes a 1.8p (2.4p) total.
While the company would have been able to maintain its dividend, a reduced
level was considered less of a burden and would allow dividend growth in
line with expected profits growth.
Sir Brian said that even with no improvement in UK economic activity, a
number of income sources were on stream this year.
Tickets will be on sale for 12 concerts whereas in 1991 the reluctance by
performers to travel after the Gulf war cut this to three.
Furthermore, legislation has been introduced to allow more live greyhound
racing days in the US and the UK and the new Club Royale bingo club is
currently showing record attendances.
COMMENT
Few can blame Wembley for the fact that Whitney Houston, and other stars,
decided on State Department advice that flying during the Gulf war was a
security risk and postponed her European tour; nine fewer concerts than
expected made a nasty dent in the bottom line. But Wembley's investments in
exhibition halls and ticketing operations are reducing this historical
dependence on filling the stadium. Coupled with the Pounds 6m lower interest
charge after January's Pounds 37m debt-reducing rights issue, Wembley should
substantially recover after what was a ghastly year. Brokers forecasting
pre-tax profits at Pounds 11.9m, give 2.9p of earnings, and a prospective
multiple of 12. But there is a need for caution: this time last year Wembley
was hugely optimistic and the ground fell from under shareholders' feet. For
all Sir Brian's optimism, the group's fortunes are still heavily tied to
consumer spending.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Goldman cleared in share probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank, was yesterday cleared by the Stock
Exchange on one aspect of its relationship with the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The exchange's investigation covered only a narrow part of the bank's
dealings with Maxwell. It plans no further investigations.
Wider aspects of Goldman's relationship with Mr Maxwell are still under
scrutiny by other authorities such as the Serious Fraud Office and the
Department of Trade and Industry.
They are studying, for example, the purchase late in 1991 of shares in
Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of Mr Maxwell's two listed companies,
by Maxwell vehicles as part of an alleged share support scheme. The
purchases were made through Goldman. The US bank has denied knowing at the
time that the purchases were linked to Mr Maxwell.
The exchange set up a working party in January to report on whether Goldman
had acted within the exchange's rules when dealing in MCC shares.
The party was told to look only at one aspect of Goldman's dealings: whether
it had been covered by the Companies Act exemption which allows
market-makers not to disclose stakes in listed companies which would
normally have to be revealed to the stock market.
The investigation focused on Goldman's dealings between August 1990 and
February 1991 - after it had bought a large put option from Robert Maxwell,
giving it the ability to place shares with Mr Maxwell at a predetermined
price.
The exchange is believed to have been concerned that any shares bought by
Goldman after that time might not count technically as market-making
positions, but rather should be treated as holdings built up through
own-account trading.
Whereas market-makers take stock on to their books through the normal course
of quoting buy and sell prices to support the market, own-account traders
buy shares with a view to taking a position and making a profit. The
existence of the put option raised a question over whether Goldman had been
acting purely as a market-maker.
The exchange said: 'The working party found no evidence to support
speculation that there had been a breach of Stock Exchange rules, or that
there had been some form of illegal share support operation by Goldman
Sachs.'

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Broking new ground across Europe - The
rapid expansion of Willis Corroon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIS CORROON, the world's second biggest insurance broker, is close to
completing a network of European subsidiaries and associates - following the
acquisition this week of a 20 per cent stake in a medium-sized German
insurance broker, C Wuppesahl &amp; Co Assekuranzmakler.
The deal is the latest in a series effected by Willis since the October 1990
merger between Willis Faber of the UK and Corroon &amp; Black of the US.
Over the past 18 months, at a total cost of some Pounds 25m, Willis has
bought 50 per cent stakes in operations in Italy and the Netherlands and a
40 per cent stake of an operation in Spain.
New ventures have been begun in France, Sweden, Hungary, Russia, Denmark and
Czechoslovakia. Wuppesahl, which handled premiums of more than DM300m in
1990, earning brokerage revenue of DM30m, has offices in seven German
cities, and also brings Zurich representation in Switzerland and Austria.
Negotiations are afoot with a Belgian partner. A deal here would complete
the network.
The speed with which Willis has assembled its network is symptomatic of the
interest in the rapidly-growing European market of the world's biggest
insurance brokers, which provide insurance and risk management services for
the world's largest companies.
Increasingly brokers are also interested in the business of medium-sized
companies which, following the approval of key planks of the European
Commission's liberalisation programme, are now more likely to buy their
insurance from companies located outside their home territories.
Brokers, which in many European countries have handled only a small
percentage of commercial insurance business - as little as 15 per cent in
Germany and Italy for example - see rising demand here as another source of
growth.
Keen to take advantage of this opportunity, many brokers have begun building
European operations. Recent developments include:
In February Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest broker, spent Dollars 105m
acquiring control of Faugere et Jutheau, the French family-owned broker.
Europe has generated faster growth for Marsh than any other territory. The
completion of a continent-wide network has been a priority.
The Marsh network in Europe - which covers 16 countries - also includes the
Lloyd's broker, CT Bowring, in London and Germany's largest broker, Gradmann
Holler, which was acquired in 1989.
In August last year Rollins Burdick Hunter, the US broker which is part of
Aon Corporation, paid more than Dollars 200m to acquire Holland's leading
broker, Hudig-Langeveldt.
In the past five years both Sedgwick - which links London's Sedgwick with
Fred S James - and Alexander &amp; Alexander - formed when A&amp;A took over
Alexander Howden of London in 1982 - have strengthened their European
networks.
A&amp;A was represented in 60 European cities as early as 1989. But Willis's
recent drive has been particularly urgent because of the way the October
1990 merger affected its European links.
The link-up with Corroon &amp; Black ended a century-old relationship with the
US broker, Johnson and Higgins, and a loose alliance of international
brokerage connections, which included Mees Zoonen of Holland, Gras Savoye of
France and Gil &amp; Carvajal of Spain.
Without the funds for big acquisitions, Willis has opted to link with small
and medium-sized brokers or back existing teams of brokers in new ventures.
Willis's strategy means it lacks the weight in some European markets enjoyed
by some of its rivals - especially after the recent acquisitions. Critics
also suggest that its control may be limited in some cases.
Nevertheless there are also advantages. In particular by leaving local
owners and managers with substantial stakes of each subsidiary, Willis feels
it is likely to encourage a more dynamic development.
'By leaving substantial shareholdings with local managers and owners we have
created incentives for people to develop the business nationally,' says Mr
Adrian Gregory, the group director responsible for Europe.
Mr Gregory says the main emphasis has been in building links with brokers
who can help service the group's multinational business.
Willis's lower profile approach will also allow it to develop its existing
relationships with the continent's large reinsurers more sensitively. 'The
network doesn't disturb our existing business connections in reinsurance,'
adds Mr Gregory.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, one of the two big advertising agencies owned by
Britain's ailing WPP Group, yesterday announced that Charlotte Beers had
been appointed chairman and chief executive.
Ms Beers replaces Mr Graham Philips, who is rumoured to have clashed with Mr
Martin Sorrell, WPP's chairman.
Ogilvy said yesterday that Mr Philips, who is 53 years old, asked to step
down as chief executive last December.
The agency added that it was agreed then that no announcement would be made
until a successor had been found. It also said that Mr Philips would stay on
as a vice-chairman 'with continuing responsiblity for certain key client
relationships'. This arrangement, it said, was at Ms Beers' request.
Ogilvy, founded by the legendary adman, David Ogilvy, was acquired by WPP in
1989 in a leveraged deal. This was its second big US acquisition, the first
being the JWT Group.

FT  10 APR 92 / China questions Midland Bank deal: Financial soundness of
Hongkong takeover in spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday questioned the financial soundness of Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank's proposed takeover of Midland Bank and reminded the bank of its
responsibilities to Hong Kong.
The New China News Agency (NCNA) quoted an unnamed official of the Bank of
China who said Midland was the worst performing of Britain's four clearing
banks, with huge bad debts and losses.
'(Hongkong Bank) is the biggest bank in Hong Kong, a major note-issuing
bank, the clearing bank and the government's main banker. Its executives sit
on many top advisory bodies. It is just natural that every move of (the
bank) arouses concerns among local and overseas investors,' the NCNA quoted
the Bank of China official as saying.
Hongkong Bank has always said it hoped the Chinese authorities would approve
of the deal. Hongkong Bank's fortunes in the coming decade will depend to a
great extent on Chinese attitudes, as Hong Kong will revert to Chinese
control in 1997.
China has to date adopted a low profile on Hongkong Bank's bid for Midland.
It has said the deal represented a sound commercial strategy for the bank's
long-term development, although it was a means of switching assets out of
Hong Kong.
Hongkong Bank has taken pains to keep China informed of its plans. Before
its March 17 announcement of the bid for Midland, the bank told Beijing's
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of its intentions, a strategy it has
adhered to since it acquired a 14.9 per cent interest in Midland in December
1987.
It was not immediately clear if the comments of the BOC's spokesman
represented a change in Beijing's policy towards the bank's takeover. But if
it did, it was unlikely to dissuade Hongkong Bank from the takeover.
The Hongkong Bank would not officially comment on yesterday's reports.
However, one bank official noted that it was well aware of its
responsibilities to Hong Kong which it took seriously.
Mr Gordon Wu, managing director of Hopewell Holdings, the big Hong Kong
construction company, yesterday said it was 'stupid' to claim the bank was
deserting Hong Kong.
'They, more than any other bank, have been the biggest supporter of Hong
Kong business in southern China,' he said.

FT  10 APR 92 / Amec hit by Pounds 60m property charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC yesterday became the second UK construction and engineering group in
two days to announce pre-tax losses caused by the slump in housing land and
property values.
Its Pounds 9.9m pre-tax loss, after Pounds 60m of write-downs, followed
Costain Group's Pounds 69.2m loss, mostly caused by housing and commercial
property. Last year's deficit compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds
63.4m.
Two thirds of Amec's Pounds 60m exceptional costs came as a response to
falling house prices. Last year the Fairclough Homes subsidiary sold 1,300
houses at an average price of Pounds 90,000, down from more than Pounds
100,000.
Mr John Early, finance director, said the new land value calculation started
from a selling price of Pounds 85,000 per house, of which just over 20 per
cent was allowed for the land. This had led to the 'swingeing' write-down,
compared with about Pounds 20m over the previous two years.
The 1991 Pounds 20m exceptional charge for commercial property had been done
on a site-by-site basis. Mr Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said the aim was to
reduce the capital in housing and property.
Some money would be diverted into the building and civil engineering and the
mechanical and electrical divisions, which made profits of Pounds 57.8m,
down from Pounds 68.9m.
Amec maintained its final dividend at 6.25p to give a total of 10.25p, up
slightly from 10.125p last year. The diluted loss per share was 3.2p
compared with 1990 earnings of 17.5p.
Mr Early said: 'The dividend is uncovered but backed by cash and we are
confident we can cover it in future.'
After a Pounds 110.6m rights issue last March, at 200p a share, Pounds 76.7m
net cash remained at the end of the year. Mr Early said about Pounds 30m had
been spent on acquisitions.
While there had been no cash outflow in 1991, he said 'pressure on cash will
intensify across the industry this year and we will have a trading outflow'.
Last year turnover inched ahead to Pounds 2.34bn from Pounds 2.22bn, while
operating profit fell to Pounds 47m, from Pounds 71m, after Pounds 7m of
rationalisation costs and a Pounds 4m provision for bad debts. There was
Pounds 3.6m interest, compared with a Pounds 4.8m payment last year.

FT  10 APR 92 / Fed cuts rates to aid recovery: US takes steps to settle
markets after plunge in Japanese share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and STEFAN WAGSTYL

   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday in an attempt to sustain
the momentum of a weak economic recovery and prevent sharp falls in share
prices in Japan from undermining confidence in US financial markets.
The US central bank signalled a quarter-point cut to 3.75 per cent in the
Federal funds rate - the rate at which banks borrow from each other. It was
the first move since late December when the Fed cut the discount rate by a
full point to 3.5 per cent.
The move took Wall Street by surprise and prompted immediate gains in share
and bond prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 43.61 at
3,224.96, partially reversing sharp falls earlier this week. The benchmark
30-year long bond also rose sharply, pushing the yield down to below 7.85
per cent.
Earlier yesterday, the Japanese stock market fell for the fourth successive
day, taking the Nikkei average below the 17,000 level and raising renewed
fears about the soundness of Japanese financial companies. The Nikkei fell
577.38 to 16,598.15, the lowest level since late 1986.
Mr Tsutomo Hata, Japan's finance minister, said there was no need for
concern about the financial health of Japanese banks, adding that there were
signs 'that lost confidence in the stock market will be regained'.
Wednesday's nerves on European stock markets steadied yesterday ahead of the
news from Washington. While London was preoccupied with the general
election, some continental bourses managed to regain lost ground.
The quarter-point cut in Fed funds was not seen as big enough to prompt
significant reductions in the cost of borrowing for US consumers and
businesses. It may therefore spur speculation that the Fed will cut the
discount rate again if the economy does not show greater vitality in the
near future.
The move followed further evidence yesterday that inflation was well under
control. The producer price index rose 0.2 per cent last month and by only
0.9 per cent in the year to March.
The easing of policy reflects growing apprehension about the momentum of the
US economy. Employment figures for March released last week showed a gain of
only 19,000, raising doubts about the sustainability of a recent rise in
retail spending.
The Fed has also been embarrassed by a sharp slowdown of monetary growth in
recent weeks. M2, the main targeted measure of money, is just above the
lower limit of its 2.5 to 6.5 per cent target range.
In Tokyo, shares had held their ground for most of the day, prompting hopes
that the latest plunge in prices was over. But in the last hour the market
was hit with sell orders related to computer-driven, futures-linked trading.
Turnover totalled was a moderate 350m shares. The heavy selling of bank
shares, which have fallen by more than 30 per cent since the start of the
new financial year this month, abated. Shares of Industrial Bank of Japan,
the country's premier bank, rose modestly.
Investors remain very gloomy. Mr Yukio Takayama, senior managing director of
the Sakura Research Institute, an affiliate of Sakura Bank, said the Nikkei
might drop to 15,000 or even lower. He was concerned that foreign investors
might abandon the Japanese market.
For their part, foreign fund managers in Tokyo looked forward to
bargain-hunting, saying that blue-chip industrial stocks were now good
value.
Nevertheless investors, foreign and Japanese, are disappointed with the the
modest level of the authorities' actions last week when the Bank of Japan
cut the Official Discount Rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.75 per cent
and the finance ministry announced plans to accelerate public works spending
plans.
The budget for 1992-93, which includes those public works, was passed by the
Diet (parliament) last night. The decision clears the way for discussions on
plans for a supplementary budget, which, if enacted, could boost the economy
further. Options favoured by politicians include tax cuts and public works
increases.

FT  10 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to blame the 4 per cent fall in the Hang Seng index in the
first four days of this week on British politics. Hong Kong investors could
not easily ignore the possible impact of the election on UK relations with
China, not to mention the choice of a new governor. That may be one excuse
for nervousness. But, as with the Hongkong Bank's bid for Midland, it is a
minor one. The more immediate impulse has been weakness in Tokyo and, until
yesterday, Wall Street.
Fears of distress selling by Japanese investors are overdone, but Hong
Kong's trade-orientated economy would certainly suffer from a Japanese
slowdown. Similarly, US reservations about recovery are scarcely
encouraging. The question is how far these factors justify re-rating the
Hong Kong market, especially after yesterday's easing by the Federal
Reserve.
It is too early to conclude definitely that the problems facing Japanese
banks make a deep recession inevitable. A weak US recovery is a two-edged
sword for Hong Kong. Exports will be weaker, but, since the territory's
currency peg forces it to track US interest rates, local borrowing costs
will be held down. An expected rise of more than 20 per cent in corporate
earnings this year puts the market on an undemanding multiple of about 12.
There should be scope for the Hang Seng to resume its upward course, but
events in Japan suggest greater caution than before.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unhappy Hafnia, the Danish insurer which tried to force its plans for a
Scandinavian alliance on an unreceptive Skandia, got its come-uppance
yesterday. The company's senior executives fell on their swords after
disclosing huge capital losses for 1991, while shareholders found themselves
with little choice but to accept a rescue takeover bid from none other than
their original Swedish prey.
In turning the tables, Skandia appears to have landed itself an attractive
deal. The all-paper offer values Hafnia at DKr2.6bn, or a net DKr1bn if you
knock off the value of Hafnia's 15 per cent Skandia stake. The Danish
group's net assets, meanwhile, including the embedded value of its life
fund, should work out at around DKr2bn even after last year's write-downs.
In the process, Skandia has become the largest Danish insurer and has headed
off the threat from its other would-be predator Uni Storebrand by persuading
the Norwegian group to give up most of its 28 per cent stake. Uni's
acquisition of Skandia's international reinsurance operations is very much a
consolation prize. All in all, the shape of the Nordic challenge in a single
European insurance market is becoming clear.

The quarter-point cut in the Federal Reserve's target rate for overnight
money seems the more dramatic because it took the market by surprise. In
fact, it is a measured response to mounting evidence that the US recovery is
not as robust as at first seemed. It is also a reminder, pointed without
betraying a sense of alarm, that the US authorities will step in to limit
the secondary impact of Japanese financial market turmoil. If only one could
believe the Bundesbank had a similar social conscience.

FT  10 APR 92 / The Lex Column: ADT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In one sense, ADT's 1991 annual report and accounts represent a welcome
break with the group's mysterious history. Not only is there information in
abundance, but it is of much better quality. The obvious inference is that
Laidlaw, ADT's main and disgruntled shareholder, insisted on improved
disclosure along with four non-executive directors as the price for settling
their long-running dispute.
In broad terms, ADT's main businesses look healthy enough, so investors may
not be too shocked to learn that in a year when pre-tax profits fell by 44
per cent, the five executive directors took a 12.5 per cent pay cut and
still earned nearly Dollars 1m on average.
Rather less gratifying, however, is the fresh light shed on ADT's past
profligacy. Its expensive stakes in Christies and Lep aside, easily the
nastiest example is the group's acquisition two years ago of Britannia
Security which, it appears, was based on thoroughly misleading asset
valuations. For a paper deal worth a mere Pounds 105m, ADT now claims to
have written off as goodwill the sum of Dollars 278m. This is the kind of
mind-boggling accounting which suggests Laidlaw still has work to do.

FT  10 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Looking for opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This column being written ahead of the UK election result, there is no point
in predicting how the UK markets will react. There is a good deal of point,
however, in asking what reaction would be logical. On the crucial assumption
that sterling will not move much whatever the outcome - for reasons
discussed yesterday - it is not clear that the equity market ought to move
much either. In fact, it will doubtless shoot all over the place, but that
is an opportunity.
Large chunks of the equity market, such as oils and overseas earners, are by
common consent fairly insensitive to the outcome. The market believes the
utilities are highly sensitive, but it could be wrong. There are votes in
being nasty to British Gas or BT whoever is in power. It matters slightly to
consumer stocks whether Labour raises a net Pounds 3bn extra taxes and
redistributes consumers' income, just as it matters slightly to the capital
goods and construction industries whether there are mild fiscal incentives
to investment. But in the context of an economy dominated by the ERM, that
is tinkering at the edges.
It is reasonable to suppose that yesterday's close of 2,436.4 on the FT-SE
represents a point of equilibrium, if only because the final opinion polls
were roughly equal and the big bookmakers were offering the same odds for
both contenders. Once the election excitement has died down, the market may
have to reconsider that position. Much has been happening in the real world
during the election run-up: the further slide in UK property, the collapse
of the Tokyo market and the most convincing evidence yet of modest recovery
in the UK economy. But in the meantime, the short-term logic is appealing;
sell into strength if the Tories win, buy into weakness if Labour does.

FT  10 APR 92 / Banks to shed over 4,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO largest high street banks, Barclays and National Westminster,
yesterday an-nounced large job losses but denied they had selected election
day to make the news public to keep exposure to a minimum.
National Westminster, the second-largest UK bank with 102,000 employees, is
to shed 4,000 jobs this year, including 1,900 in its UK branch staff.
All staff received letters telling them of the cuts. However, the bank has
not yet decided who will lose their jobs.
NatWest said actual redundancies might be well below the number of job
losses. 'We shall be using natural wastage through resignations and
retirements to keep the numbers down as far as possible,' the bank said.
In a separate move Barclays, the largest UK bank, is to cut 450 jobs over
the next two years because of the installation of new technology at Barclays
Bank Trust, its subsidiary which handles taxation and investment advice, and
executor and trustee work.
Bifu, the bank employees' union, said the banks timed the announcement to
coincide with election day, but both last night strongly denied the claim,
saying the timing was purely coincidental.
NatWest, which shed 6,400 jobs last year, said it had not planned to make
the announcement public yesterday. 'We wrote a private letter to our staff
telling them of job cuts in their region, following our original
announcement at our annual results on February 25 that more job losses were
on the way,' NatWest said.
'We chose April 9 a long time before John Major did,' said Barclays. 'We
wanted our staff to have the chance of a full two years to cope with the
reorganisation.'

FT  10 APR 92 / Leading Article: A deepening German crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TEST of an economic or political system is whether it can respond
quickly and effectively to rapidly changing circumstances; it is a test that
Germany is currently failing. For Germany's neighbours, the consequences of
this failure are economically trying; for the EC they may prove increasingly
disruptive. But it is the social cohesion of the new Germany that will
suffer the most.
Germany's politicians, employers and trade unions have so far proved unable
to meet the challenges thrown up by the unification of west and east Germany
in 1990. It would be premature to write the obituary of the German social
market economy. But the economic disaster in the eastern Lander, the growing
threat of a recession in the west and the rise of the German right in the
recent regional elections are all testament to the great economic and
political strains that have been caused by this failure.
The economic collapse that has occurred in east Germany since monetary
unification in July 1990 lies at the heart of Germany's current problems.
The disintegration of east European trade is partly to blame. But the
underlying cause was the imposition by the west German establishment of the
regulations, non-wage costs and wages of one of the most productive
economies in the world upon east Germany's backward one.
Wage levels
Few companies would agree to move to east Germany and pay unit labour costs
comparable to those in west Germany, and higher than in Portugal or Spain.
But that has been the effect of union efforts to push east German wages
towards west German levels, with the blessing of western employers and
politicians. In the absence of new investment and indigenous production, the
east German economy will continue to be propped up by large transfers from
west Germany.
As important a cause of Germany's current predicament has been the
politicians' unwillingness to persuade the west German electorate that they
would have to pay for unification: through higher taxes and lower real
wages. Instead, the general government deficit has been allowed to rise to
DM180bn this year, 6 1/2 per cent of gross national product and twice as
high as the deficit ceiling that Germany insisted be included in the
Maastricht treaty; while west German unions have been demanding real wage
rises to recover the loss in incomes caused by temporary tax increases.
Slow growth
The longer the government prevaricates, the more difficult it then becomes
for it to act. Persistently high borrowing, rapid monetary growth and the
threat of a public sector strike are likely to persuade the Bundesbank to
keep interest rates high throughout 1992. But slow growth or even a
recession this year is precisely what is not required to bring public
borrowing under control. Nor does it make sense, politically or
economically, to raise taxes now the economy is slowing. Mr Kohl has already
gone back on one misconceived no-tax pledge.
There is still time. The government needs a fiscal plan, consisting of tax
increases and spending cuts, that will bring the budget back towards balance
over the next five years; the public sector unions should drop their strike
threat; and wage convergence must be halted, preferably by a temporary wage
subsidy.
Yet none of this seems likely to emerge from Germany's paralysed political
system. West German real wages will fall: but only after an all-German
recession has pushed west German unemployment towards 10 per cent and east
German non-employment nearer 50 per cent. Wage convergence will slow: but
only after more businesses have collapsed and many more east Germans have
moved west. Meanwhile the fiscal deficit will grow larger.
For the European economy this second scenario may be good for growth. The
negative effect of high German interest rates has outweighed the stimulative
effects of German expansion over the past two years. Lower interest rates,
following a German recession, might fuel European growth. But slow growth,
rising unemployment and further mass migration would sorely test the unity
of the new Germany. Last week's election may prove a foretaste of things to
come.

FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: John Surman's Brass Project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10-piece Brass Project - trumpets, trombones and rhythm section - is a
luxurious vehicle for John Surman's baritone saxophone to ride solo with. As
is the case for any of Surman's many means of musical conveyance, it is
distinctly European in design, veers to the left field, and is physically
demanding of the man himself.
The Brass Project has been around since 1984, when Surman first collaborated
with his 'musical director' and co-writer John Warren. It stands alongside
his work with Synths (for the German ECM label), or accompanying the icy
vocals of Karin Krog, as a favourite way to play.
Musically, the present show at Ronnie Scott's Club (until tomorrow night) is
a long way from his first date in the club with the house band, under
saxophonist Scott's leadership, 24 years ago. 'I wasn't paid much in those
days,' he teased the proprietor. 'We're not paying you much today,' came the
tart reply from the wings.
Mixing originals (like Warren's rolling 'New one two') and standards (a
soulful 'The thrill has gone') Surman is both waywardly mobile and
mischievous with both baritone and soprano saxophone.
Four trombones (three of them bass instruments) provided rumbling ostinato
passages over which Surman edgily flurried baritone notes. Alternatively,
searing harmonies from three trumpets laid the ground for jaunty soprano and
occasional piano accompaniment.
Alone with a straight blues walking bass and drum, Surman, who is
classically trained, maintained a peculiarly un-American attitude in his
playing - even with that genre. Bumping and squealing against a heavily
laden brass section, his arrangements remain strangely European in accent
and eccentricity. For sophisticated technique and emotional commitment, the
leader himself is still hard to beat.
If American Gerry Mulligan is the name immediately associated with this
friendly but cumbersome instrument, Devonian John Surman has surely done
more to test its possibilities - and it's upper registers - in a variety of
settings. And for a daring improvisor with a disarmingly unpretentious
rapport with his audience, a club setting suits him fine.

This is a South African show, the successor to Ipi Tombi (music and
direction again by Bertha Egnos), and it is unabashed showbiz.
Everybody in it is very fit. They all sing and/or dance almost continuously
and with limitless enthusiasm - or at least dance: the entire show is piped
at full steam through loudspeakers, with added orchestral backing, and from
time to time there is a suspicion that the well-honed chorus, never out of
breath, may be pre-recorded too.
There is the merest thread of a story. Ubhejane, a devoted son, departs from
his native village in search of his father; he meets urban alienation in
Johannesburg and Soweto, finds his father in a remote prison, and goes home.
Spoken dialogue is minimal, although the flash taxi-man Dube Dube (played by
Rosen Songelwa, with portable telephone) does some earnest narration of
recent, painful history.
Nothing else is allowed to disturb the athletic cheerfulness, except a
soulful reunion-duet for father and son - a frank Western pop-ballad,
affecting or excruciating according to taste - and a sullen sextet of Rebels
who sing, implausibly, 'So naive, old and trusting / Like the shelves your
mind needs dusting.'
Music and dance alike run the gamut from 'traditional' native stuff to basic
South African pop and lusty Broadway-style numbers, all of it rendered
hyper-energetic and aimed straight at the audience. There is no pretence
that we're eavesdropping on anything private; even the tribal battle-dances
at the end are show numbers.
The stage-Soweto is clean and bright, and nothing rougher happens than a
failed handbag-snatch. The colourful costumes are uniform for each group,
like elves or Cossacks or cygnets in a ballet, or an old-fashioned musical,
and the simple sets and slick lighting are in nightclub-vein.
The performers come from several tribes: Tswana, Sotho, Shangaan, Xhosa
(which means that we get a women's trio in click-talk), Zulu and more. There
is a manic miners' dance for men in gumboots at the disco-wedding which
occupies a large part of the second act, dramatically quite irrelevant but
fun.
Some ethnic instruments are visible from time to time - including four large
drums, furiously played and fiercely amplified - but the backing-track laces
much of the music with pop Western brass and strings. This is not a
compromise, for the whole pageant is uncompromisingly commercial.
Good-hearted too, though; and often reasonably infectious, and sometimes
exhilarating.
As Ubhejane, Joe Motsamai looms with grave dignity and wields a fine,
resonant bass, and Andy Chabeli sings not only his plaintive father but two
other roles.
The exuberant choreography is by Lynton Burns, wherever the dancers
themselves have not supplied the steps from folk-memory. Nothing very
political raises its head: the sole agent of repressive authority is an
illiterate black prison guard, and in general the tone is not militant, but
forgive-and-forget - and keep on dancing.

FT  10 APR 92 / The Property Market: Surveyors map out the road to reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great and the good of the UK's chartered surveying world yesterday took
a break from considering the future of the country, and instead considered
the future of their profession, writes Vanessa Houlder.
After hours of debate, the General Council of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors (RICS) voted for a package of reforms which heralds the
most thorough overhaul of the institution since it was granted its royal
charter in 1881.
The case for reform of this inward-looking and bureaucratic organisation was
a strong one. 'Today's market, not yesterday's traditions, must dictate the
institution's decision making,' said Mr Christopher Jonas, RICS' senior
vice-president, proposing the reforms.
The main thrust of the reforms is to heighten the awareness of the needs of
the surveyors' customers. Half a dozen 'market panels', composed of small
groups of experts (rather than committee time-servers) will mull over the
needs of different parts of the market.
If RICS is to avoid merely adding extra layers of bureaucracy it will have
to reduce its swathes of committees and divisional councils. As well as
cutting down the bureaucracy, such a measure will save money that can be
channelled into the new panels and into a more effective promotion of the
profession. The future of the very title 'chartered surveyor' has also been
under discussion. Although a cherished and distinctive soubriquet, it means
little outside Britain or to the general public. RICS will add the phrase
'the property profession' alongside the title, in place of the existing
overlong strapline, 'making land, property and construction work better for
people'.
However, this may not be welcomed by surveyors working in areas outside the
property market, such as minerals.
RICS will also start a debate on constitutional reform of the institution.
This is a thorny matter: existing divisions are unlikely to want to reduce
their power, while RICS' critics are unlikely to feel that the proposals go
far enough.
Although the institution's leadership has run into opposition on some
points, it thinks it has struck a good compromise. 'This is not the counsel
of perfection but radical steps in the right direction,' said Mr Jonas
The endorsement of the proposed reforms, which could not be taken for
granted before yesterday's meeting, was greeted with alacrity by RICS
leadership. 'It is a very substantial shift,' according to Mr Michael
Pattison, the institution's secretary-general. 'It is a signal that the
council is prepared to face up to the changes it has to make.'

THEY'VE wined and dined senior politicians, listened to newspaper editors,
eavesdropped on the constituencies and compared notes among themselves, but
in the final run-up to polling day, foreign diplomats in London found it as
hard as anybody else to make a firm prediction.
'Everyone is very confused. If you ask me who is going to win. We don't
know,' said one Spanish diplomat, barely hiding his frustration at failing
to make a firm prediction in his latest report to Madrid.
All the foreign embassies in London have kept a watching brief on the
election campaign, but a small group of countries, including Spain, have
devoted particular resources to the event.
It is not so much Gibraltar as the wider context of Europe that has drawn
Spanish interest: 'After the recent electoral reversals of the socialists in
France, we thought it was very important to see what happens here', said one
Spaniard.
Territorial issues seem to be of more exclusive concern to the Argentine
embassy, where diplomats have been experiencing frustration of a different
kind.
They have witnessed the apparent reluctance of the Labour party to reaffirm
its 1990 policy review document statement that it would adopt a more
conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty over
the Falklands Islands.
For the US embassy, which has had to be less on its guard on issues such as
defence policy than during the last British election campaign, some
half-a-dozen diplomats have been following the hustings and feeding back
information on grass-roots opinion.
The embassy believes its feel for the political pulse has been enhanced by
the longstanding links of Mr Raymond Seitz, the current US ambassador, who
is on his third diplomatic posting to London. Yet one senior US diplomat
said he was only prepared to telegram a guess about the outcome of the
general election the night before the poll.
'We're scratching our heads like everybody else,' one US diplomat confided a
few days ago. His final report has remained a closely guarded diplomatic
secret.
Two weeks ago, the German embassy commented, in response to a journalist's
question, that the German way of measuring inflation rates was not
comparable to the British. The statement was jumped on by the Labour party
as evidence that Mr Lamont had misused his comparisons.
It was the closest any embassy so far has come to getting embroiled -
seemingly unwittingly - in a campaign controversy. And it probably explains
why the Germans have in recent days steered clear of any comment whatsoever.
As one German diplomat put it: 'To ask any diplomat what he thinks about the
British election is a very sensitive question.'

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Whitehall prepared for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN's civil servants are ready today to welcome a new government and
ensure a seamless transition between administrations.
Their preparations have been more complex this year, with the serious
prospect of a change of government for the first time since 1979. As the
likelihood of a hung parliament grew in the run-up to the election, the
Civil Service also drafted guidelines on its role if there were no outright
winner.
For one party with an overall majority, the aim is to help the new
government hit the ground running, with the main cabinet appointments able
to be announced by the end of today.
A hung parliament, could make progress much slower. It could be days or even
weeks before an administration is formed which can win a parliamentary vote
on its Queen's Speech. Throughout the negotiations, civil servants will be
on hand to assist.
Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, will be expected to act as an
intermediary between the parties. He will keep the information channels open
between the party leaders and Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen's private
secretary who will advise the monarch.
Civil servants will be available to draft documents required for discussions
between the parties. But while they can help in turning an indecisive result
into a government, civil servants cannot become involved in politicians'
negotiations.
Throughout the election campaign, each government department has been
working on briefs for the incoming government. At least two sets will have
been prepared: a red one to brief an incoming Labour government, a blue one
for a re-elected Conservative administration. The most prescient will have
prepared a third set for the Liberal Democrats - not because they are
expected to form the government, but to prepare for a government in which
they play a role.
These briefs will be in two sections. The first will offer incoming
ministers background information on the state of their policy area: 'opening
up the books', as one senior mandarin describes it. Decisions which need to
be taken quickly will be listed, ranging from government appointments to
main policy decisions - such as whether to send British troops to join the
UN peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia.
The second section will help the new minister plan the implementation of the
party manifesto. The brightest and best in the department will have spent
the election campaign combing the party manifestos and policy statements and
monitoring announcements by spokesmen.
The briefs will list the party's promises and offer advice on how they can
be implemented - inviting the minister to indicate priorities and
preferences. With less than a month to the Queen's Speech on May 6, civil
servants have already produced drafts for ministers to consider at an early
meeting of the cabinet sub-committee which will supervise the speech.
For the first time since 1979, civil servants have had the opportunity to
discuss the opposition's plans with members of the shadow cabinet. Under
rules drawn up in the 1960s, permanent secretaries are allowed to meet the
relevant shadow ministers to learn of their plans during the last six months
of a parliament. This procedure could not be adopted in 1983 or 1987 as the
elections were called before this final six-month period.
With both the main parties planning a Whitehall shake-up, the new prime
minister will have to agree the changes in the machinery of government
before ministers can be appointed. Already a government building has been
earmarked for the super ministry for arts, broadcasting, sport and tourism
promised by Conservatives and Labour. Buildings have also been identified
for the ministries for women, children and overseas development planned by
Labour.
All that remains is the rapid filling of ministers' diaries.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Events in Germany mean tough year ahead for
British economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC strains caused by rising inflation, aggressive trade unions and
an uncompromising monetary policy in Germany will make the remainder of 1992
a tough time for the British economy, regardless of the election result,
writes Edward Balls.
Germany is currently suffering the kinds of industrial strife experienced in
the UK in the late 1970s. The expansionary effects of German unification
have pushed up German inflation, while the public sector unions are
threatening to strike if their demands for higher pay settlements are not
met.
None of which is good news for the UK, France or other European countries
whose interest rates are tied to those of Germany in the European exchange
rate mechanism.
The UK and France would both like to lower interest rates to stimulate
growth. But the Bundesbank looks set to keep German interest rates high for
the rest of this year.
The winners of the UK election will have to endure slow economic growth
throughout 1992. The combination of high real interest rates and heavy
household debts will continue to discourage consumers from borrowing and
spending. The result is that already high UK unemployment will have to rise
further.
One positive side-effect of the depth of the recession is that UK wage
inflation might fall to European levels this year. The cost in terms of lost
output and jobs will have been high. But unless wage inflation does fall,
the competitiveness of UK exports will continue to deteriorate and Britain's
current account will remain in deficit.
This will not be a good background on which to fight a second election this
year. No wonder both parties were praying for a clear majority.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Race was hurdle at Cheltenham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrat gain in Cheltenham and the defeat of the black
Conservative candidate, Mr John Taylor, follows one of the Tories' most
damaging constituency rows over the last few years. Mr Taylor would have
been the Conservatives' first black MP and was seen as a standard-bearer of
Mr Major's classless society.
The loss of Cheltenham is likely to fuel further discord within the local
Conservative party. The selection of Mr Taylor, a 38-year old barrister,
last December after the retirement of Sir Charles Irving, was highly
controversial and led to a split within the local conservative organisation.
While he was supported by the constituency chairman, who said he was an
outstanding candidate, a minority opposed him on the basis that he was not
local.
Mr Taylor was subsequently subjected to personal criticism widely considered
to have been motivated by prejudice. Eventually, Mr Chris Patten, the party
chairman, felt obliged to give Mr Taylor an unprecedented personal
endorsement. He was selected from 254 applicants and a shortlist of 22 who
were interviewed by the executive committee.
The seat is one that the Liberal Democrats have targeted for many years. Mr
Nigel Jones, the Liberal Democrat candidate, said last night the campaign
had been clean and fought on national issues. However, the Liberal Democrats
did stress during the campaign that Mr Jones was a local. They won 47 per
cent of the vote; Conservatives 45 per cent; and Labour 6 per cent. The
Liberal Democrat vote increased by 5 per cent while the Conservative vote
fell by the same amount.
Mr Colin Lear, a local member who challenged Mr Taylor's selection, said
last year that his opposition had nothing to do with his colour, but was
because Mr Taylor would lose the election. Sir Charles had a majority of
4,896 over the Liberal Democrats. Mr Taylor said last night that he was very
disappointed but
was not going to start making any allegations of racism. 'I feel I had the
right background to represent Cheltenham,' Mr Taylor insisted.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Dave Nellist, the former Labour MP expelled from the party for his
alleged links with the far-left Militant Tendency, split Labour's vote in
Coventry South East so that the Conservatives nearly won the seat.
The official Labour candidate Mr Jim Cunningham polled 11,902, Mr Nellist,
Independent Labour, polled 10,551, and Mrs Martine Hyams polled 10,591 for
the Conservatives.
Mr Nellist was expelled after a 12-hour disciplinary tribunal last
September. It decided that he could be reasonably described as a member of
Militant, which Labour members are forbidden from joining.
Mr Nellist warned that his expulsion would damage Labour's prospects of
winning Tory marginals in neighbouring constituencies. He said that an
imposed Labour candidate would not be able to win the seat.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Fallon, the junior education minister, lost his Darlington seat
to Labour.
Mr Alan Milburn overturned Mr Fallon's 2,661 majority, polling 26,556. Mr
Fallon polled 23,758. He had held the seat since winning a 1983 by-election.
Mr Fallon was the only minister with a seat in the 30 constituencies between
the Scottish border and North Yorkshire.
Mr Fallon was a member of the No Turning Back Group, the self-styled
guardian of Thatcherite doctrine. The group called for the dismantling of
the welfare state, the privatisation of British Rail, and considered a
voucher scheme for the NHS.
He began his political career as political adviser to Lord Carrington, the
former foreign secretary, and was appointed education minister in 1990.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour set for Militant clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S battle against Militant and other former members of its left wing
will resume in Liverpool next week as campaigning begins for the May 7 local
government elections.
Twenty-one members of the Broad Left grouping are challenging Labour
candidates in 20 of the city's 33 council wards. Only seven of Broad Left's
25 councillors are fighting to retain their seats.
Since five of the other 18 won against official Labour opposition last year,
it could be four or five years before Labour can eliminate the Broad Left at
the ballot box.
Last year, only one of the Broad Left's six challengers failed. Its
organisation was strong and candidates stood under 'ward Labour' banners,
confusing many voters.
Labour hopes this time for a spillover of image from the general election
campaign to counter the well-run pockets of Broad Left strength in
Liverpool's inner city and poorer suburbs.
'The biggest boost for our campaign against them will be the general
election results,' Mr Mike Graham, one of the party's regional officials at
its north-west headquarters in Warrington, said yesterday.
On the Broad Left slate is Ms Lesley Mahmood, who lost last year's Walton
by-election against Mr Peter Kilfoyle, the full-time party official whose
last position was as Labour's Militant-finder-general.
Ms Mahmood is standing in Netherley, a ward of largely modern council
housing, which was the power base of Mr Derek Hatton, the
Militant-supporting, former deputy council leader.
Heavyweight opposition is coming from Mr Joe Devaney, who almost won Mossley
Hill from the Liberal Democrats in the 1987 general election.
Mr Devaney is one of the 47 Liverpool councillors disqualified in 1987 for
losses incurred when the Militant-dominated Labour group was late in setting
the 1985 rates. Now that their disqualification time is up, nine of the 47
are standing - six for Labour and three for the Broad Left. Mr Devaney is
one of five Labour candidates facing a Broad Left opponent.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Truth begins to sink in at Walworth Rd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY 12.45am officials at Labour's Walworth Road headquarters had conceded
publicly for the first time that the party's chances of achieving an overall
majority were 'not very likely'. They insisted still that Labour would
emerge in a strong enough position to force a change of government.
A senior spokesman for the party said: 'The Conservatives will not have the
moral authority to govern. It is going to be the worst election result of
any government since the Second World War.'
It was the first official reaction at the party headquarters on the result
since an optimistic Mr Bryan Gould had earlier said: 'The only person who
can now form a government is Neil Kinnock. The momentum is with us. The
arithmetic looks most favourable to us . . . a change of government is
inevitable.'
His later comment confirmed the underlying reasons for the continuing
subdued atmosphere at Walworth Road.
Putting a public gloss on the night's proceedings, the party spokesman
described as 'encouraging' the result in Pendle, Nuneaton and Walthamstow.
But he added that Labour was now facing an almost insurmountable 'long haul'
in reaching its original target of an overall majority.
'We would require very substantial swings in the north, the west Midlands
and London to achieve this,' he said.
Mr Gould had earlier discounted any possible deal between the Conservatives
and the Liberal Democrats, claiming that the Scottish Liberals 'would not
allow this to happen now'.
Mr Gould arrived having received last-minute reports from local party
officials in key London marginals. These, he said, suggested that the Labour
vote 'had done exceptionally well'.
There had been was a tangible sense of caution in private among other party
workers as the first results began coming in over the television screens.
Journalists were being deliberately kept away from a party for officials and
campaign organisers which was under way at Labour's temporary campaign
offices at Millbank in Westminster.
The strategy appeared to be to insulate any comments from within the party
which might risk undermining Mr Kinnock's carefully controlled
public-relations exercise which in London appeared to be relying in large
measure on the personality of Mr Gould and a small carefully selected group
of press officers.
At the Walworth Road headquarters party workers who had immediately gone to
the 'celebration' at Millbank gazed with little immediate public expression
of feeling at TV sets as early results began to come in.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: SNP suffers severe blow in Govan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish National party suffered a severe blow early this morning when
Mr Jim Sillars, the party's deputy leader, lost his Glasgow Govan seat to
Labour.
Labour's Mr Ian Davidson took the seat that Mr Sillars won in a sensational
by-election in 1988.
The SNP also failed to take Western Isles, a seat it had held until losing
it to Labour in 1987. In other early results in safe Labour seats the swing
to the SNP was less than the party had hoped.
However, the Nationalists still hoped to win three seats from the
Conservatives including that of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, while
Labour was also expected to take seats from the Tories.
The Conservatives rallied, however, winning Aberdeen South from Labour after
the Labour vote was eroded by the SNP, and regaining Kincardine and Deeside,
its recent by-election loss to the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the junior Scottish Office minister, held Stirling
against a strong Labour challenge.
The SNP and Labour hopes of gains against the Tories were based on
projections of the original BBC exit poll. If realised, they would plunge
Scotland into a constitutional crisis with the Tories suffering a near
wipeout in Scotland while remaining the largest single party in the United
Kingdom with Mr Major staying in Downing Street.
If the Conservatives won half a dozen or fewer Scottish seats they would
have barely the number needed to man the Scottish Office - unable to choose
who to field unless they drafted in MPs from England, which would be
unprecedented.
The outcome would be a further challenge to the legitimacy of the
Conservative party's rule in Scotland and increase the dissatisfaction of
many Scots with the Westminster system. In addition to Mr Lang losing his
seat in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale to the SNP, the Tories would lose two
other seats to the SNP. These are Perth and Kinross where the MP was Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, and Tayside North where the MP was Mr Bill Walker.
In a hung parliament the SNP could come under pressure to do a deal with
Labour, a key element of which might be speedy implementation of Labour's
plans for devolved Scottish parliament.
While the SNP has totally ruled out deals with the Tories, it has been less
categorical with regard to Labour though it has said it will give 'no blank
cheques' to anyone.
A pale-looking Mr Sillars, having lost by about 4,000 votes, summed up the
situation, saying: 'Scotland has not yet resolved the paradox of what it
does when it votes Labour and England votes Tory.'

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Nervous uncertainty hits Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS it was the sweltering heat from the television lights, or perhaps it
was the sudden uncertainty about what the next few days could bring, but
there was a curious lack of celebration at the Liberal Democrats'
headquarters last night.
In a book-lined room high in the elegant building of the National Liberal
Club, almost within sight of Big Ben, party activists and journalists milled
around.
Party officials swallowed their disappointment at not gaining a larger share
of the vote, but seemed almost uneasy that that they may be about to take on
the role of power-brokers.
'We have achieved the objective of increasing our representation in what
could be a pivotal parliament,' said one official. He would not elaborate on
which way his party might be prepared to tip the balance.
Mr Des Wilson, campaign organiser - the strains of the campaign adding an
edge to his antipodean lilt - was equally reluctant to talk about
power-sharing, preferring to concentrate on his party's performance. 'It
would be very difficult for one party to go it alone with the present
figures,' he said. 'But I'd rather wait until tomorrow before saying any
more.'
'But I think you've got to see it in context. Only two years ago we had only
6 per cent in the opinion polls but tonight we've got about one-in-five
votes and at least 25 seats predicted. That's a real achievement.
'The challenge at one stage was to get through this election in what I can
call a state of survival, but in fact we have come through it very strongly
and could end up as the biggest third party presence since the war.'
He ascribed the Lib Dems' success to 'an extraordinarily happy campaign'.
Two decisions, he said, had contributed to the party's success. One was the
decision, taken two years ago, to run a positive campaign, stressing the
party's strengths, and to concentrate resources into campaigning in 40
crucial seats.
A hush fell as the results for Torbay - one of the target seats the Lib Dems
might just have gained - were announced. The hush continued as the news came
through that the Conservatives had held it. The atmosphere was broken by
booing as Mrs Margaret Thatcher appeared on screen. It was going to be a
long and nervous night.
Always the bridesmaid, but never the bride, said one observer. Last night,
the Lib Dems were coming to terms with the fact that they might just be a
very important bridesmaid indeed.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Close fight in three-way contest for TV
viewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in history the British people had a three-way choice of
election night coverage on television. After decades of two-way competition,
the BBC and ITV were joined by Sky News, Mr Rupert Murdoch's satellite
service, and early evidence suggested that Sky would hold its own pretty
impressively.
For the BBC, anchorman David Dimbleby sat on a railed podium at the centre
of a vast command room worthy of Dr Strangelove.
With a wave of the hand he called up electronic graphics, an army of
reporters, psephologists in the studio . . . and Peter Snow who had been
given not only an updated 'Swingometer' to play with, but a video version of
Downing Street.
At ITV, Peter's cousin, Jon Snow, anchored a programme which looked more
downbeat, but proved, as the earliest results came in, to be determined to
be first by hook or by crook. While the BBC audience was being told by ace
reporter Kate Adie how tremendously fast the bank clerks of Torbay were
counting the votes in order to be first in the race to declare, ITV went
live to Sunderland and showed their audience the first result before the BBC
even mentioned it.
More remarkable still, while the BBC cameras continued to show the scene at
Torbay, with no declaration being made, ITV flashed the result on the
screen. In previous elections the BBC has complained bitterly that ITV
announces results before returning officers make their declarations, and
here, sure enough, was clear proof.
The Sky service was a far more relaxed affair. David Frost chaired a panel
with Dennis Healey, Norman Tebbit, and David Owen, all of them now retired
from Westminster, but three of the greatest bruisers in studio politics over
many years. For the few able to monitor all three programmes simultaneously,
the Sky faces made a very tempting alternative to the whizzing around -
electronic and geographical - at the BBC and ITV. With the big turnout among
the electorate leading to long counts at town halls all over Britain, all
three television services dragged and viewers could be forgiven for musing
on the uncannily unchanging nature of these affairs in the UK.
At one moment the three programmes were showing the faces of Robin Day
(ITV), David Dimbleby (BBC) and David Frost (Sky): a trio which would have
been perfectly familiar to audiences in the early 1960s.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Unionists expect a significant role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Unionist MPs in Northern Ireland looked likely last night to play a
significant role in the formation of the next government - if it is the
Conservative party which is looking for a partner to sustain a Commons
majority.
The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) hold
12 safe seats between them and last night gave indications that they would
be prepared to support a minority Conservative government.
Mr John Taylor the sitting UUP member for Strangford, said last night: 'We
are not in the game of making deals. . . but we have no intention of voting
down the Queen's Speech.' He added that the Unionists would be prepared to
support a new government for as long as they considered it was in their
interests to do so.
In practice, that could require significant changes to Conservative policy
on Northern Ireland.
The UUP and DUP have a formal agreement to vote as a block at Westminster.
They see a hung parliament as the opportunity to press for a replacement of
the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement and the introduction of a stronger security
policy for Northern Ireland.
They have also said in recent days that they would vote against proposals
for devolved assemblies in Scotland and Wales, if a similar assembly was not
established in Northern Ireland.
Voting was brisk throughout the day across Northern Ireland, against a
backdrop of a heavy police and army presence on the streets to prevent
possible disturbances. Officials of the four main parties reported a high
turnout.
Breaking a tradition of 25 years, counts began last night in six of the 17
Ulster constituencies and the first results were expected between 3am and
4am.
Two of these seats are in the marginal constituencies of West Belfast and
North Down.
In West Belfast Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein was defending a 2,221 majority
against a challenge from Mr Joe Hendron of the SDLP.
In North Down, the independent Unionist Mr Jim Kilfedder was defending his
seat against a combined challenge from the DUP, the Alliance party and the
Conservatives.
The UUP was also hoping to win back the South Down seat which it lost to the
SDLP in 1987 by a majority of 773.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Small parties' positions in power broking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE minority parties have been prepared to say more than either Labour or
the Tories about how they might broker their support in a hung parliament.
Their opening bargaining positions would be:
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS: Mr Paddy Ashdown has gone further than any other party
leader in setting out his terms for supporting a minority government.
His essential 'pre-requisite' is a promise, in the Queen's Speech, of
legislation to reform the electoral system. He is prepared to have
discussions at a later stage on what form of system.
Mr Ashdown has allowed himself an escape clause however. He would not
necessarily vote against a minority government if Britain faced an economic
or international crisis. Sharp falls in financial markets today could fall
into his definition of 'crisis'.
After electoral reform, Mr Ashdown has set extra spending on education,
Scottish home rule and a positive European policy, including backing for a
single European currency, as his priorities.
Mr Ashdown does not want a repetition of the 1977-78 Lib/Lab pact. He wants
a 'partnership' government in which Liberal Democrat MPs would hold
ministerial posts from cabinet rank downwards. He has not said how many
posts he wants or who might fill what slots. He will not support any
government relying on the support of Northern Ireland's unionist
politicians.
ULSTER UNIONISTS: Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party,
has indicated that he would not be looking for government posts in return
for his party's support. He would support a government on an ad-hoc basis,
probably requiring a drip-feed of concessions.
In theory the party could support either Labour or the Tories, but Ulster
Unionists are more conservative by inclination.
Unionists set the repeal of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement as their top
priority, but they know that would be politically difficult for either
Labour or the Tories and would require negotiations with the Irish
government. They might settle for a reaffirmation of the government's
determination to find a more acceptable alternative.
Other demands would centre on tougher security in Northern Ireland, moves
towards a devolved administration in and the reform of procedures at
Westminster for Ulster business.
DEMOCRATIC UNIONISTS: The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist
party, will act in consultation with Mr Molyneaux. His demands would be
little different, except to perhaps put more emphasis on a return to a
devolved legislative assembly in Ulster, akin to the Stormont parliament
which collapsed in the early 1970s.
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND LABOUR PARTY: The nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party, lead by Mr John Hume, is unlikely to enter a formal pact, but
would support Labour - its sister socialist party - in most circumstances.
If Labour was relying on unionist support they would almost certainly
withdraw their support.
SCOTTISH NATIONALISTS: The SNP has a long standing policy of refusing to
make deals with the Tories. It also has a dislike and distrust of Labour.
But it might support Labour in order to prevent a Conservative government -
particularly as the Labour party proposes Scottish devolution, which the SNP
could justify as a step towards independence.
PLAID CYMRU: The Welsh nationalist party is highly unlikely to make any deal
with the Tories and says it will not support any government without a
promise of a Welsh parliament within a year. It may also see tactical
advantages of keeping Labour in office.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Minority governments outnumber coalitions - A
look at this century's previous hung parliaments and the lessons learned
from them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXIT polls last night suggested that the UK was on course for its sixth
hung parliament this century.
In each case the hung parliament has led to a minority government, not to a
coalition.
The 1910 elections left Mr Herbert Asquith dependent on the Irish
Nationalists who, while the Liberals promised Home Rule, could never support
the Unionist Conservatives. In 1923 and again in 1929 Labour took office
with Liberal support, which later evaporated.
In February 1974 Labour survived abstentions in the early months and then
called an October election. That gave Labour a three-seat clear majority.
But by 1977 that had disappeared through by-elections. Mr Jim Callaghan and
Sir David Steel fixed up a Lib/Lab pact. The Liberals did not join the
government but were consulted on every important issue for the 18 months
that the pact lasted.
The only successful coalitions that 20th-century Britain has known have been
in wartime.
The national emergency of 1931 did produce a coalition but an immediate
election left one party totally dominant, and after a year the coalition
partners either left or were swallowed up by the Conservatives.
The 1931 episode stands out as the last time the monarch took a really
positive role in sorting out a constitutional crisis. It was only the
insistence of George V that led Mr Ramsay Macdonald to abandon 95 per cent
of his own MPs and to switch from being Labour prime minister to being
National Government prime minister
However, 1974 provides a more important precedent. On the afternoon of
Friday March 1, when it became plain that the Conservatives would have fewer
seats than Labour, Mr Heath held a quick cabinet meeting and then went to
Buckingham Palace 'to report on the situation'. He was 21 seats short of a
majority - but there were 12 Liberals and 11 Ulster Unionists.
Over the weekend he offered the Conservative whip to the Unionists and tried
to persuade Mr Jeremy Thorpe, the Liberal leader, to take a cabinet seat. By
Monday it was plain that the Liberals would have no part in keeping 'a
defeated government' in office and Mr Heath gave way to Mr Wilson's minority
government.
The 1977-88 Lib/Lab pact is also instructive. To survive until the economy
had recovered further from the International Monetary Fund crisis, Mr
Callaghan was willing to submit to a Liberal veto. But the Liberals did not
want to be made responsible for all the Labour government's actions;
coalitions can destroy the identity of the lesser partners.
The memory of 1977 is important to current Liberal Democrat thinking. Only
with proportional representation can a minor party be assured that lending
its support to a government will not result in its being submerged.
If general elections do not produce clear-cut majorities, and if the
electoral system assures continued representation to lesser parties, then
the incentive to solve crises by calling a dissolution evaporates. The next
parliament is likely to be much like the last. The politicians are forced to
work out compromise solutions.
Specific problems arise when an election produces no clear majority. When
does the prime minister feel that he has to resign? There seems to be a
certain magic in having most seats. The logic of putting together a majority
would be the same if the Conservatives got 301 seats to Labour's 299 as it
would be if Labour got 301 seats to the Tories' 299.
But the pressure on Mr Major would be far greater in the second instance
than in the first (even if, as with Mr Heath in 1974, the Conservatives had
won more of the popular vote).
With most seats the Conservatives might well soldier on and present a
Queen's Speech on May 6 (as Mr Baldwin did in January 1924), even if all the
other parties were plainly going to vote it down.
If the situation was in doubt Mr Major might continue as a caretaker (after
all we have had a caretaker government for the past three weeks, during the
electoral purdah which civil servants impose on ministers). But the pressure
for instant action will be great. The spectacle of the removal van in
Downing Street on the Friday afternoon is engraved on our television
memories of 1964, 1970 and 1979. The public - and it seems the Palace - want
an election to be seen to produce an instant decision. The Queen's
government must be carried on.
What decisions may the Queen have to take? It is generally agreed that there
are two prerogatives remaining to the sovereign which may in some
circumstances involve a real exercise of choice: nomination of a prime
minister and granting of a dissolution.
The first presents little problem in the present situation. Mr Major is
prime minister until he chooses to resign or until he is defeated in the
Commons. If Mr Major decides to vacate office - or is forced to - the Queen
will send for Mr Kinnock as the leader of the alternative large party. It is
possible that if Labour was very far from having a majority or an
expectation of support from other parties, the Queen might ask Mr Kinnock to
explore whether he could form a government that would command endorsement
from the Commons (as in very different circumstances in 1963 she gave Lord
Home 24 hours to see if he could put together a cabinet). But Mr Kinnock
would almost certainly say that he had a cabinet ready made and that he was
ready to take his chance in a parliament.
The most difficult scenario for the Queen concerns dissolution. If a
narrowly defeated Mr Major asked for a second election at once, she would
certainly refuse. But what if Mr Kinnock were given the chance to present a
Queen's Speech which was then rejected? If by then it was plain that an
alternative coalition had been formed, which did command a majority, would
the Queen be right to give a dissolution to Mr Kinnock who had never had a
parliamentary endorsement? This is dangerous ground.
Politicians are guided usually by the law of anticipated reactions. You do
not have to be knocked down by a car for your whole life to be conditioned
by avoidance of that event. Another election will obviously be a
possibility.
It will not be popular with the public and parties will do their utmost to
avoid being seen as the cause of another dissolution. An election will only
be provoked by those who feel that they will profit by it.
It is clear that messages have already gone out from the cabinet office and
from Buckingham Palace to all the prime actors in the parties about what
they understand to be the rules of the game. Strong pressures may be exerted
to save the Queen from being put in a position where her prerogatives have
to be exerted in ways that some people would interpret as partisan.
The Queen will not act as her grandfather did in August 1931. In the current
style of politics and with the new intrusions of media coverage that would
be impossible. But public opinion may well combine with the inclinations of
the Palace to knock heads together to produce a viable government to get the
country through the coming year's economic difficulties.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Where the last seat could count for
everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW SEATS could make all the difference. For however small the gap between
Labour and the Tories when the final results are declared today, the party
with the most MPs will probably be in government by the start of next week.
Mr Major will almost certainly resign if the Conservatives are not the
largest party, in which case the Queen would automatically send for Mr
Kinnock to take office.
Neither side need talk to Mr Paddy Ashdown before forming a government. In
practice only Labour is likely even to wish to approach the Liberal
Democrats - and then only if it is some way short of an overall majority and
the third party's group of MPs is large enough to provide such a majority.
To do that Mr Ashdown probably needs at least 25 MPs. If talks between
Labour and the Liberal Democrats take place, the formation of the next
government could take up to 10 days.
Far more likely, however, is the possibility that Mr Kinnock would form a
government and challenge the minor parties to defeat him in parliament.
For any minority government the first test would be the debate on the
Queen's Speech in the Commons, to be presented on May 6 and voted on a week
later.
Promises of a Scottish parliament and other constitutional reforms
attractive to the Liberal Democrats would very likely feature in a Labour
Queen's Speech.
The content of a Tory speech is problematic - particularly its approach to
Scotland.
If the Conservatives presented a Queen's Speech as the largest party and
were defeated, the Queen would automatically send for Mr Kinnock.
Were Mr Kinnock in turn defeated, another election would have to follow
immediately. However, there would be strong pressure to avoid two
back-to-back elections and some temporary arrangement - possibly involving a
Tory abstention on Labour's Queen's Speech - could be expected to keep a
minority Labour government in office until the autumn.
So an immediate second election is highly unlikely, but the chances of the
current parliament lasting a year are slim.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Five marginals still to declare result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE spotlight today will shift to the 33 seats where the votes are still to
be counted, as all parties hope for a swing in their favour.
However, only five of those seats look at all likely to change hands.
The Conservatives and the Scottish National party both have hopes of winning
Argyll and Bute from the Liberal Democrats - the result there is expected
shortly after noon.
Labour is aiming to capture Kensington from the Conservatives, while both
Labour and the Conservatives are hopeful of their chances in Liberal-held
Brecon and Radnor.
Conservative-held Cornwall North is one of the Liberal Democrats' main
targets while the Tories have a slim chance of snatching Truro from the
Liberal Democrats.
The seats to declare today are Easington (Lab); Wentworth (Lab,);
Bridlington (Con); Ludlow (Con); Truro (Lib Dem); Argyll &amp; Bute (Lib Dem);
Harborough (Con); Berwick-upon-Tweed (Lib Dem); Devon West &amp; Torridge (Con);
Gainsborough &amp; Horncastle (Con); Richmond, N Yorks (Con); Rother Valley
(Lab); Skipton &amp; Ripon (Con); Chelsea (Con); Daventry (Con); Dorset West
(Con); Kensington (Con); Lewes (Con); Brecon &amp; Radnor (Lib Dem); Lagan
Valley (Ulster Unionist); Antrim East (UU); Antrim South (UU); Boothferry
(Con); Foyle (SDLP); Newry &amp; Armagh (SDLP); Ulster Mid (Democratic
Unionist); Upper Bann (UU); Antrim North (DUP); Buckingham (Con); South Down
(SDLP); Londonderry East (UU); Cornwall North (Con); Fermanagh &amp; South
Tyrone (UU).

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Plaid Cymru set to hold seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh nationalist party, was last night poised to hold its
three seats in its north-west stronghold but to add no others.
The party would not enter into political deals in the event of a hung
parliament, said Mr Dafydd Wigley, its president.
He said: 'There is no question of Plaid Cymru entering into a coalition. Our
MPs would keep their hands free to consider every issue in the House of
Commons.
'We will consider the proposals in the first Queen's Speech in the light of
the policies in our manifesto.'
The party's policies are closest to those of Labour. The Welsh nationalists
would probably be willing to provide ad hoc support to a Labour minority
government, but without the sort of unconditional guarantees required for
stable rule.
Labour has promised a Welsh assembly within the lifetime of a par-liament.
Plaid Cymru has said it would seek a guarantee that Wales would be treated
as favourably as Scotland on devolution. It also wants any Welsh parliament,
which it says should be set up within a year, to have revenue-raising
powers.
Other commitments required might include a comprehensive language act and a
low-interest loan fund for farmers.

FT  10 APR 92 / Collectors beat dealers to Paris furniture: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL and ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE in Paris this week of medieval and Renaissance furniture from the
collection of the French dealer Bruno Perrier, which many had predicted
would be a catastrophe, turned out to be the most successful sale of its
type for years.
Held by Jacques Tajan, the auction comprised 56 lots and made a total of
FFr21.45m (Pounds 2.22m). It also established a number of record prices.
Every leading dealer in Haute Epoque furniture attended the sale, only to be
outbid every time by private collectors who pushed most of the prices high
above estimate.
A New York collector acquired an exceptionally rare late 17th century
Piedmontese set of eight chairs, four armchairs and settee with well
preserved embroidered covers for FFr2.45m, above its FFr1m estimate. Bidding
for a 13th century oak cathedral chest with iron strapwork from Durham
tripled its estimate to reach FFr1.1m, establishing a record for English oak
furniture.
Competition for an oddly-shaped 16th century Lombard dignitary's chair in

FT  10 APR 92 / Blue Arrow judge steps down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JUDGE in the first Blue Arrow trial, who joined calls for a fundamental
review of the way complex fraud cases should be handled by the courts, is
stepping down, the Lord Chancellor's Department confirmed yesterday.
Mr Justice Brooke, another High Court judge, will take the place of Mr
Justice McKinnon, who presided over the year-long trial. Mr Justice Brooke
will preside over the two further Blue Arrow trials which are expected.
The department yesterday said that after a year running the first trial, Mr
Justice McKinnon deserved a break.
When the first trial ended in February with four convicted financial
advisers being given suspended sentences, Mr Justice McKinnon said the
lengthy proceedings had placed an unacceptable burden on all concerned.
Trial by jury in such cases would be threatened unless their presentation
was improved, he warned.
Mr Justice Brooke had a long record at the commercial Bar before being
appointed a judge, and was an inspector for the Department of Trade and
Industry during its investigation into House of Fraser, the stores group.
He will take over Blue Arrow on April 29th when the Serious Fraud Office
will ask him for proceedings against the remaining four defendants to be
split into two trials.

FT  10 APR 92 / US ruling on pollution may cut Names' losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS have won a signif-icant victory in a US court case involving a
dispute over the costs of a pollution clean-up.
The ruling in New Jersey could reduce losses faced by hundreds of Names  -
the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the Lloyd's insurance
market. The decision on Tuesday came in a case involving Diamond Shamrock, a
US company which produced herbicides and other chemicals.
Potential insurance claims from pollution in the US represent a heavy
liability for the London insurance market in general as well as Lloyd's.
Mr John Robson of the Anton members' agency said: 'This is an important case
for the industry. It's a powerful decision in a state which has not always
been sympathetic to insurers.'
Mr Robson considers the case to be as significant as the the case brought by
Shell against its insurers over pollution at the Rocky Mountain arsenal site
in Colorado. A lower court ruling in 1988 favoured insurers, but an appeal
has been lodged against it. Insurers expect the appeal to be heard later
this year.
The latest case arose when Diamond Shamrock was ordered by the US
Environmental Protection Agency to clean up dioxin pollution at a number of
sites where it had formerly manufactured herbicides.
In 1989 the company attempted to have the cost of cleaning one of its sites,
at Newark, New Jersey, paid by its insurers. At the same time it sought to
recover from insurers some Pounds 23m paid to a group of Vietnam war
veterans who had won compensation for disability suffered through their
exposure to Agent Orange, a defoliant also made by Diamond Shamrock. The
company sued more than 100 companies - which have insured it since 1951,
when dioxins were first manufactured at the plant - to recover clean-up
costs of several hundred million dollars.
Aetna Casualty and Surety led coverage, but much of the cost would be borne
by re-insurers including HS Weavers, Dominion and Turegum Insurance as well
as Lloyd's underwriters.
At Lloyd's, syndicate 932 led a group of syndicates whose exposure totals
around Dollars 100m (Pounds 581,000). Judge Reginald Stanton of the New
Jersey superior court found at trial-court level in April 1989 that the
insurers had no responsibility for site clean-ups, but were liable for the
Agent Orange claims.
Diamond Shamrock appealed, but on Tuesday the New Jersey appeals court found
that insurers were liable neither for cleaning up the site nor for the Agent
Orange claims.

FT  10 APR 92 / Policy shift signalled at CBI: Attitude of Davies to
political parties contrasts sharply with Banham stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry is set for a marked shift in its
approach to dealings with the government under Mr Howard Davies, the
controller of the Audit Commission, who will become the CBI's
director-general on July 1.
Mr Davies, whose appointment was approved yesterday by the CBI's governing
council, said he would prefer to work alongside policymakers whichever party
was in power, rather than 'throwing in ideas from the outside'.
He adopted a markedly less critical approach to Labour than either Sir John
Banham, the outgoing director-general, or Sir Brian Corby, the CBI president
who is to retire soon.
Mr Davies said there was an emerging consensus on economic management with
both Labour and the Conservative saying the right things about the economic
climate they wanted to create.
He said the CBI's task would be to work closely with the government to
influence the detail of policymaking from the inside in an attempt to make
sure legislation did not damage business interests.
Mr Davies indicated that while the CBI would be open about its policy
objectives, it would pursue them through detailed analysis of policy
proposals rather than engag-ing in wide-ranging public debate.
Mr Davies' style contrasts with that of Sir John, who has favoured a much
more public role, often outspokenly criticising government and opposition
policy.
Mr Davies' even-handed approach to the policy programmes of the two main
parties also contrasts with the stringent criticisms which Sir John and Sir
Brian have made of Labour party policy.
Early in the election campaign Sir Brian sent a letter to CBI members
reiterating what he saw as the gains that industry had made in the past
decade. It was widely seen as an endorsement for the Conservative party.
The CBI council called on the incoming government to maintain downward
pressure on inflation, to manage pressure for regional government and
devolution to minimise the damage it might do to business and to strengthen
considerably the Department of Trade and Industry.
The council called for the DTI to be refocused, with responsibility for the
National Economic Development Council transferred to it from the Treasury,
and its regulatory functions separated from its support for British
industry. It called for the DTI to take on the Department of Employment's
responsibilities for small businesses and enterprise.

FT  10 APR 92 / Judgment on King's Cross overturned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ST BARTHOLOMEW'S Hosp-ital and the Church of England yesterday lost the
opportunity to make windfall profits of several million pounds from the
proposed Pounds 4.5bn redevelopment of land around London's King's Cross
station.
The Court of Appeal overturned a ruling by a High Court judge two years ago
that the hospital trustees and the Church commissioners had the right to buy
back from British Rail and National Carriers 52 acres of prime development
land at 1850s prices.
The land was compulsorily purchased to make way for rail lines. Bart's
surrendered 43 acres for which it was paid Pounds 53,250. The Church
commissioners sold nine acres, also under compulsory-purchase powers.
The land is part of the 125-acre site north of King's Cross station which
has been earmarked for development which includes the Channel tunnel
rail-link terminus, offices, shops, 1,350 new homes and a 35-acre park.
Under the ruling, Bart's and the Church commissioners could have purchased
the land at the original price of about Pounds 1,100 per acre and then sold
it at a large profit.
However, the Court of Appeal yesterday allowed an appeal brought by BR and
National Carriers. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said he allowed the appeal
without regret. The hospital and the Church commissioners received the full
value of the land in the 1850s.
Bart's and the Church commissioners are to consider an appeal to the House
of Lords.

FT  10 APR 92 / Fed displays its determination: A look at the timing of the
latest easing in monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S surprise easing of monetary policy by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal
Reserve chairman, is a sign of his determination to ensure that this year's
fledgling economic recovery does not fizzle out, as happened last year.
But the timing of the Fed's signal of a  1/4 -point cut, to 3.75 per cent,
in the key federal funds rate also reflected the plunge in share prices in
Japan, which has unsettled the US stockmarket.
The immediate reaction on Wall Street was positive, with both share and bond
prices gaining ground.
The Fed's move was the first since late December, when it announced a
one-point cut in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent and a  1/2 -point cut in
the federal funds rate to 4 per cent. The fed funds rate is the rate at
which banks lend to each other.
Yesterday's announcement followed the release of encouraging inflation
figures. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.2 per cent last
month and by 0.9 per cent in the year to March. Figures for 'core' producer
prices, which exclude food and energy, were also subdued, suggesting that
inflation at the retail level will be moderate even if the sluggish recovery
gathers momentum.
Many analysts had assumed that the next move in interest rates would be up
rather than down. A surge in retail sales in January and February seemed to
indicate the economy was shaking off its lethargy. But in the last week or
so confidence began to be eroded again.
The biggest setback was last Friday's employment report for March. This
showed a paltry 19,000 increase in employment.
Economists fear that, if employment does not recover, personal income will
not grow and the revival of consumer spending will grind to a halt. Many
analysts also worry that the retail figures were distorted by warm weather
and faulty seasonal adjustments, and therefore exaggerated the revival of
demand.
In addition to fears about the real economy's strength, Mr Greenspan is
acutely aware that monetary growth is losing momentum. In recent weeks, M2,
the main targeted measure of broad money, has fallen sharply, reducing its
growth rate to 3 per cent, or just above the bottom of its 2.5-6.5 per cent
target range. The White House, keen to ensure a recovery in election year,
has been warning the Fed not to allow the money supply to stop growing, as
happened last year.
The Fed's move was probably also designed to put downward pressure on
mortgage rates, which have risen in recent months, taking the edge off a
mild recovery in residential housing. A  1/4 -point cut, however, is
unlikely to have a great impact either here or on banks' prime lending
rates, currently 6.5 per cent.
If the economy shows further signs of weakness, speculation about another
cut in the discount rate is likely to mount.

FT  10 APR 92 / Noriega guilty on main counts in drugs trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY HAMMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MIAMI, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEDERAL jury in Miami yesterday found General Manuel Antonio Noriega,
former leader of Panama, guilty on eight of ten drug trafficking and
conspiracy charges.
The verdict, after nearly five days of deliberation, means that Gen Noriega
could face up to 120 years in US jails.
The trial was the first by the US of a foreign head of government. The
general was brought to the US in chains in January 1990, after the invasion
of Panama by US forces the previous month.
For the US government, particularly for the Bush administration, the
decision to try Gen Noriega as a common criminal was a risky move. The
verdict will be widely seen as affirming Mr Bush's decision to send US
forces into Panama to topple the general.
The charges stood on a US claim that Gen Noriega had entered a conspiracy
with the Medelln cocaine cartel, based in Colombia, to use Panama as a route
for the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine to the US and as a haven
for the laundering of drug profits.
The US prosecutors portrayed the general as having sold out his country in
return for millions of dollars in bribes.
The jury agreed with the prosecution's charge that Gen Noriega had used
President Fidel Castro of Cuba to mediate in a dispute between him and the
cartel.
This verdict itself is likely to be used by supporters of a strengthened US
trade embargo against Cuba, an issue being debated in Congress.
The main charges against the general were two of racketeering. Conviction on
these two alone means he could face 40 years in jail and Dollars 500,000 in
fines.
Sentencing is due on July 10. He is expected to appeal against conviction.
The verdict came a day after the jury had pronounced itself deadlocked and
been ordered to return to deliberations by the trial judge.
The only two counts on which the jury found the general not guilty involved
smuggling of several hundred kilogrammes of cocaine on a pleasure boat.
The convictions relieve the US of the possibility of much embarrassment
arising from an acquittal. The administration might have faced questions
about why it went to so much trouble for no avail - especially as the
establishment of a democratic and anti-drug government in Panama now appears
to be in doubt.
The Bush administration has deployed vast sums to bring Gen Noriega to book
 -Dollars 164m spent on the invasion of Panama in 1989 and some Dollars 20m
on the trial.
There is little likelihood that the US will be encouraged by its success
against Gen Noriega to use the same approach again in the near future. In
pursuing its claims against Colonel Muammer Gadaffi of Libya, for example,
the administration has preferred to work through the UN.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress is taking aim once again at what it believes to be
widespread evasion of US taxes by foreign-owned businesses.
Various Congress members claim that foreign companies are systematically
understating the earnings of their US subsidiaries, and so evading US
corporate income taxes, by using inflated transfer prices to siphon profits
back to their home base.
In a hearing at the House ways and means committee yesterday, methods to
plug this hole were suggested, ranging from a new border tax to an
alternative minimum tax levied at 5 per cent of sales on foreign
subsidiaries.
However, officials from the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service urged
Congress not to press ahead with new legislation until they have had time to
see whether reforms on transfer pricing, enacted in 1990, have worked.
Mr Alan Wilensky, Treasury deputy assistant secretary for tax policy,
acknowledged that foreign-owned businesses showed a much lower rate of
return on assets than comparable US-owned companies, but warned that the US
might face retaliation if it were to introduce rules that discriminated
against foreign companies.
New tax data for 1989 - before the new 1990 rules took effect - showed that
foreign-controlled companies made an average return of 0.51 per cent of
assets, compared with 1.97 per cent for US-controlled companies.
Congressman Duncan Hunter argued that the US Treasury was losing more than
Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.4bn) a year because foreign companies were
artificially lowering their US profits.

FT  10 APR 92 / Poverty tests the democratic spirit in Bolivia: Economic
stresses threatening a republic's constitutional procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE COUP last weekend in Peru and the abortive uprising in Venezuela in
February are to have a domino effect in the Andean region of South America,
Bolivia could well be next.
President Jaime Paz Zamora set alarm bells ringing on Wednesday, when he
warned that 'Congress should work properly for there to be no need to close
it.' Officials immediately 'clarified' his statement, promising he had no
intention to threaten Congress.
Diplomats and independent analysts doubt Mr Paz Zamora will copy President
Alberto Fujimori's military-backed takeover in Peru. They say he was voicing
his frustration over the legislature's refusal to pass important government
bills.
Although Bolivia has suffered more coups d'etat in nearly two centuries of
existence than its hard-pressed citizenry can count, it has managed to
stagger from crisis to crisis and retain a democratic regime for the past 10
years.
However, political stresses are growing more severe as Bolivians become
weary of unrelenting orthodox economic policies, corruption, deepening
poverty and intensifying concentration of wealth. Many are wondering how
much longer the democratic regime can survive.
Pessimists wonder whether the weak coalition government can survive until
the presidential election due in May 1993. Optimists expect it will last,
only to hand over power to a strongman with shaky democratic credentials and
little interest in continuing laissez faire economic policies.
Bolivia adopted market reforms in 1985, when hyper-inflation had reached
25,000 per cent a year. It cut the budget deficit, shrank the public sector,
introduced trade liberalisation and virtually eliminated the debt to foreign
commercial banks by buying IOUs on the secondary market.
Despite the huge cost in jobs and income levels, the reforms were popular.
Inflation fell to 15 per cent during each of the past three years and modest
economic growth got under way. The free market consensus became a national
policy embraced by all main parties.
The problem now is that reform has not stimulated enough growth to dent
Bolivia's profound poverty. There is a widespread conviction that the
sacrifices of reform have not been worthwhile. Yet, Bolivians vividly recall
the military coups of the 1970s and the chaos of hyper-inflation, and do not
want a return to instability.
Real incomes are lower than in 1985, unemployment and underemployment are
widespread, urban poverty is growing - as any visitor to the capital La Paz
can see by visiting El Alto, the world's highest urban slum at nearly 4,000
metres.
Last year, government spending on education, health and housing fell to just
Dollars 28m (Pounds 16.2m) - the lowest figure since 1985. The government
has promised to raise the level to Dollars 99m this year. However, it is
trying to hold public sector wage increases below inflation.
The government is paralysed by indecision. It is pulled in opposite
directions by the contradictory demands of special interest groups, the US
government and the local armed forces.
Several groups are watching from the wings. One is led by General Hugo
Banzer, who was a long-serving military president in the 1970s. His ADN
party backs Mr Paz on condition that he help Mr Banzer become president next
year. Mr Banzer's strongman image is one of his chief attractions.
A group of populist parties is capitalising on both worsening poverty and a
resurgent 'endogenous' movement. They would cast aside orthodoxy in favour
of a blend of left-wing economics and traditional tribal organisation.
Then there is the military. The generals appear to back Mr Paz and the
democratic system. But a vocal group of junior officers, with links to the
trade unions, openly identifies with the Venezuelan rebels. They accuse
commanders of corruption, and condemn the conservative consensus, US
influence, and falling military budgets.
Businessmen claim Bolivia's economic problems have dramatically narrowed the
scope for change. Mr Alvaro Ugalde Canedo, general manager of Inti Raymi, a
big US-owned mining company, said: 'The economy is not growing at the same
rate as the expectations of the people. It does not matter which government
comes in - it will have the same economic restrictions as the previous ones.
(Policy) changes will only be nuances.'
For all that, the explosive themes of corruption and poverty are beginning
to combine. A top government official said: 'All we need is a big corruption
scandal or for government people - particularly generals - to be threatened
with exposure, and the whole house of cards will fall.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE annual wage round in the South African mining industry has started, with
the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) apparently backing away from the
historic performance bonuses negotiated last year.
The key demands from NUM, which represents 200,000 black miners, are that
there should be a 20 per cent minimum wage increase on gold mines and a 55
per cent average increase on coal mines. The miners' pay negotiations are
closely watched as a bellwether of union militancy.
Last year's agreement, which included a small basic increase, with
performance-based bonuses on top of this, was hailed as a breakthrough, with
unions recognising that the difficult economic climate required flexibility
in their wage demands. In late January, however, the NUM's central wage
committee resolved not to renew productivity agreements and this week
restated its concern that the schemes have been abused.
Productivity agreements run contrary to a core NUM demand - that wages
should be standardised. They are unhappy that productivity agreements have
benefited workers on some mines, but not on others. Mr Rob Gillan, mining
analyst at stockbrokers Mathison Hollidge, says: 'They're a function of
where you work, not how you work.'
The NUM's position would appear to be that while not rejecting performance
agreements outright, it wants to ensure that they are better monitored. One
of its proposals is that an independent body be set up to monitor agreements
and to promote their effective implementation.

FT  10 APR 92 / Kashmir peace talks may no longer be an impossibility: Both
the military and political sands may be shifting towards a compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SRINAGAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN SRINAGAR, the Indian Kashmir capital increasingly run-down due to nearly
three years of fighting by armed Kashmir separatists and Indian security
forces, the government is seeking to woo the militants into talks.
Heavily sandbagged bunkers at street corners manned by Indian troops
bristling with weapons are a reminder that this is a city still at war and
one from which tourists have fled. On the outskirts of the town, young
militants toting automatic weapons parade their defiance of what they call
Indian occupation.
But Indian strategy is shifting from the display of force and brutality that
was intended to intimidate Kashmiris but which united them in resentment of
India. 'We want to slowly take the lid off' and revive political activity,
says Mr G C Saxena, the governor.
In what was probably the most significant political gesture since the
conflict began, he recently announced the release of five Kashmiri
opposition leaders who had been held without trial.
His hope is that they will show the people of the Moslem-dominated Kashmiri
Valley that political means, rather than force, are the best way to achieve
political goals. 'These are serious politicians,' he says, 'and they know
there is no way they can rise to power on the shoulders of terrorists.'
Both the militant groups and the opposition leaders are dismissive of talks
with the government. 'We say this is a disputed place and that the people
must be given the right of self-determination,' says Mr Abdul Ghani Lone,
leader of the People's Conference and one of the five released. 'The Indians
say it is an integral part of India. So there is no meeting point.'
The government's estimate is that the militants command 5,000 armed men
within the Valley (of whom a third are inactive) and 3,000 waiting in
Pakistan. Informed Kashmiri observers put the pro-Pakistani Hizbol
Mujahideen (the largest militant force) at 24,000, followed by Il Jihad at
22,000. On this reckoning, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF),
the most popular of the groups in Srinagar and which wants independence
rather than accession to Pakistan, has only 4,000 men.
Though the number of militants remains large, on whatever basis the
counting, the ground is shifting beneath their feet. The JKLF recently
suffered the humiliation of having to call off a march into Pakistan Kashmir
because of insufficient support. Its leader, Amanullah Khan, and several of
his colleagues were arrested by the Pakistan government, without whose
support it would be difficult for the militants to operate.
There have been several incidents of popular revulsion at the excesses
committed as the militant groups splintered and became more indisciplined.
More than 300 Moslems demonstrated in protest in Srinagar recently after two
militants killed a Hindu family of three after first raping the mother and
daughter.
Last week's crowded Srinagar streets and heavily laden fruit stalls, as
people stepped out to buy for the Eid holidays, suggested a town with
something of an itch to return to normal life.
Even the most pro-Islamic, pro-Pakistan groups such as the Hizbol
Mujahideen, which is the militant wing of the Jamaat-i-Islam, have cause to
worry. The Jamaat is no longer part of the ruling coalition in Pakistan, and
the administration of Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister, is wary of the Jamaat
extending its influence in Kashmir.
The governor's hope is that both militant groups and opposition leaders will
see a change of mood in the Valley and that their room for manoeuvre is
limited by the larger issues of Indo-Pakistani relations and international
pressures on the countries to settle their differences. 'Let us see how the
situation develops,' he says with a determination to exploit any opening.
On the face of it, the prospects for negotiations look slim. Three of the
leaders released last week - Sayed Ali Shah Gilani, the head of the
Jamaat-i-Islam, Maulana Abbas Ansari, the Kashmiri Shiite leader, and
Professor Adullah Ghani - are hardline pan-Islamic, pro-Pakistani
politicians.
Their distrust of India is likely to have been reinforced by two years of
incarceration and the death or imprisonment of many colleagues, friends and
relations. Conservative estimates are that 3,000 Kashmiris have died in the
three-year struggle.
Anti-Indian sentiment remains strong in the Valley and periodically explodes
in the wake of incidents of brutality by the Indian security forces. Mr
Saxena has been successful in reducing the number of these by getting the
police to show restraint, thereby creating the more relaxed atmosphere in
Srinagar in which he launched his initiative by releasing the five.
Kashmiri emotions could easily flare up again in the wake of fresh
brutality, either accidental or provoked by groups with little interest in
seeing negotiations take place.
But there are also external pressures that favour talks and which are likely
to grow. Pakistan has been scared by the possibility of an independence
movement spilling over to Pakistan occupied Kashmir.
Both India and Pakistan are under strong pressure from the US and other
western governments to agree to a nuclear non-proliferation regime, curb
military spending and reduce tensions between the two countries. Progress
over Kashmir would be a sine qua non of any confidence-building package. In
India's case, a powerful inducement to compromise, and one already dangled
before it, would be the offer of a permanent seat in the UN Security
Council.
Other signs of a shift in Indian opinion over Kashmir have been the growing
number of articles in the Indian press proposing responses to Kashmiri
demands that range from Trieste-style custodianship to opening the border.
Substantive talks still seem a long way off. But they no longer look
impossible.

THE US and its allies warned Iraq's military yesterday that continued use of
its anti-aircraft missile radars and new training flights by Iraqi warplanes
could spark an incident with allied forces, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Bob Hall, the Pentagon spokesman, said Brig Gen Glenn Profitt of the US
Air Force, commander of an allied task force in the region, expressed
concern over military steps by Baghdad to Iraqi officers at a meeting in the
Iraqi city of Zakho.
The meeting was 'to underscore our concerns over their actions and to make
sure there were no misunder-standings. . . the concern is there is a very
big potential risk for an incident,' Mr Hall told reporters.
'They (Iraqis) are aware that we will take whatever actions we deem
necessary to protect our forces,' he said.
The US and Britain have expressed alarm over Iraq's recent movement of SAM-2
and SAM-3 surface-to-air missile batteries and ground troops into northern
Iraq for a possible assault on minority Kurds.
He appeared to dismiss suggestions that the brief training flights were a
legitimate defensive response to an Iranian air raid on Iraq last Sunday.

'STRANGE visitor]' proclaimed the editorial in yesterday's Daily Champion
newspaper in Nigeria, capturing the sense of unreality which attends the
state visit of Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president, to the country
which has long been Pretoria's bitterest enemy.
Last night Mr De Klerk steeped off his presidential jet to hear a Nigerian
army band play 'Bie Stem', the anthem of Afrikaaner nationalism and the
apartheid policy inspired by it. South African flags hung alongside Nigerian
banners on the road from the airport to the capital, Abuja.
South African officials, many in the shiny grey suits and grey shoes which
are the uniform of the Afrikaner bureaucrat, stand out strangely from the
crowd of resplendently robed Nigerian officials in the ultra-modern lobby of
the Hilton Hotel.
In the restaurants, white South Africans eagerly serve themselves Nigerian
specialities from the buffet, traditional dishes like pounded yam and egusi
stew, and fiery pepper soup. Nigerians are referred to officially as 'our
African brothers', and even in private the goodwill is obvious.
Indeed, the Nigerian foreign minister, Mr Ike Nwachukwu, praised Mr de
Klerk's courage yesterday and welcomed the Boers as 'one of the several
tribes that make up Africa'. In an emotional statement after a meeting with
South African foreign minister Pik Botha, he said Nigeria was 'delighted'
with the progress South Africa had made in 'closing the book on apartheid'.
Normal Nigerians, for their part, have gone out of their way to make the
South Africans welcome. At the Paradise restaurant - a shed in the Gariki
Motor Park market, where dishes are ladled into plastic bowls and eaten with
the hand - patrons are enthusiastic about the South Africans, so recently
condemned as racists. They believe business with Pretoria will bring
economic development.
Few normal Nigerians are in evidence: Abuja, the new capital, is a large
building-site with few completed buildings - a hotel, some government
ministries, and an impressive gold-domed mosque.
But the government plans a grand reception even so: a 21-gun salute, a guard
of honour, and red carpets everywhere.
Several newspapers urged the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), the
ultra-radical black South African group, to enter talks on a post-apartheid
constitution, which it has so far boycotted.
A PAC delegation was due in Abuja today to meet Mr Botha, for the
highest-ever official contact between the two sides. The South Africans hope
this will pave the way to membership of the Organisation of African Unity,
of which Nigeria's President Ibrahim Babangida is chairman. African
Development Bank (ADB) president Babacar N'diaye said yesterday the bank
would consider financing South African development as soon as a multi-party
interim government was in place, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
'Once South Africa reaches a point of no return by installing an interim
government, the ADB will do all it can to help finance development
programmes,' Mr N'diaye told reporters at the end of an 11-day fact-finding
visit.

<TEXT>
GERMAN government hopes for a peaceful pay round and spending restraint
suffered a setback yesterday as employers rejected an arbitration proposal
for a 5.4 per cent wage rise for west Germany's 3m public sector workers.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister responsible for federal and local
government wage policy, was joined by private sector employers and other
government politicians in a chorus of protest. 'The arbitrators' suggestion
fails to take account of current economic conditions and therefore cannot be
a basis for agreement,' Mr Seiters said.
Mr Hermann-Otto Solms, leader of the Free Democrat parliamentary group, said
the offer was not acceptable. It would cost federal and state budgets an
additional DM20bn (Pounds 7bn) a year, he claimed.
The non-binding proposal, put forward after a 7-6 vote in favour, included
extra payments totalling DM750 a head. The employers' final offer in the
six-day conciliation talks consisted of 5 per cent from April plus DM400
back-pay.
'Anyone who thinks that is too little must go on strike,' said Mr Friedrich
Zimmermann, the employer-nominated negotiator.
Officials of the OTV and DAG unions, which represent most of the workforce,
said if the employers did not improve their offer when formal negotiations
resumed on Monday, they would hold strike ballots.
The last public sector strike, in 1974, stopped virtually all public
services for three days.
The overall 'compromise' package for the public sector is lower than the
6.34 per cent steelworkers' award, agreed earlier this year, but similar to
the 5.8 per cent deal offered to bank staff last weekend by employers which
enjoyed record profits last year.
Engineering employers negotiating with unions over a 9.5 per cent claim,
said yesterday the offer was too high. Economic recovery in east Germany
could be held up considerably if Bonn plays too interventionist a role in
the region's industry, the Bundesbank warns in its annual report published
yesterday, reports Andrew Fisher from Frankfurt.
The central bank also repeats its concern that the value of the D-Mark as
well as German economic growth and employment were at risk from inflation
and the weak state of foreign economies.
The bank made clear it had no intention yet of relaxing monetary policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S first civilian defence minister yesterday offered to resign,
bringing to a head a power tussle between President Lech Walesa and the
government over who controls the 300,000-strong armed forces.
Mr Jan Parys, who became minister in January, has been sent on two weeks'
holiday in an attempt by Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, to defuse the
row. This followed an accusation by Mr Parys of recent attempts 'to
overthrow democracy with the aid of the army'.
He was referring to meetings between members of President Walesa's staff and
senior army officers at which the officers were told that Mr Parys was
likely to be dismissed and were promised promotion once this had happened.
The Polish president yesterday said he had asked Mr Olszewski to dismiss Mr
Parys about 10 days ago.
At the same time, he confirmed a report that his staff were working on
contingency plans to impose martial law. He described the plans as 'routine'
and said 'the president must have lots of solutions at his disposal but he
doesn't have to resort to them'.
The increasing mistrust between Mr Walesa and Mr Parys arises out of a lack
of clarity in Poland's constitution over who controls the armed forces. It
is a highly sensitive issue in a country where the last attempt at
parliamentary democracy was curtailed by an army coup in 1926.
Under the 1989 constitution - tailored to suit communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski - special responsibility for foreign policy, defence and internal
affairs lies with the president. However the relevant ministers are cabinet
members and answerable to the prime minister.
Since his appointment, Mr Parys, 41, has moved quickly to exert control over
the army, retiring his predecessor, Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk, whom Mr
Walesa wanted as commander of the armed forces. He also removed several
senior officers who had Warsaw Pact connections, but with whom Mr Walesa was
happy. In addition, he made new appointments without consulting the
president.
Mr Walesa said yesterday he had had too many conflicts with Mr Parys.
Mr Olszewski is trying to avoid becoming embroiled in the dispute. But if
accepts Mr Parys' resignation, it will have to be referred to parliament,
opening the rift between Mr Walesa and Mr Olszewski's minister to full
political scrutiny.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mario Segni, the leading reformist politician in the Christian Democrat
party, yesterday offered to head a transitional government to carry out
institutional and electoral reforms.
This is the first concrete proposal to resolve the confusion created by
Sunday's election, which led to unprecedented fragmentation of the political
parties and ended the long-running hegemony of the Christian Democrats.
Mr Segni, 52, son of a former president of the republic, has been the key
figure behind a cross-party movement committed to using the referendum as a
tool of reform.
Mr Segni's initiative yesterday was taken without consulting Mr Arnaldo
Forlani, the Christian Democrat party secretary.
In so doing he is deliberately pressing for a change in the discredited
party hierarchy and staking his claim as the leading figure among the
younger generation.
Mr Segni's position was strengthened by the good showing of the Christian
Democrat vote in his home territory of Sardinia (it fell less than 1 per
cent, against 5 per cent nationally) and the presence of 152 deputies and
senators in the new parliament who had agreed in advance to back his pact
for electoral reform via the referendum.
The next government, he said, had to be formed quickly and should have four
priorities: electoral reform moving towards a first-past-the-post system;
dismantling the party's control over the state apparatus, starting with
local health services and including television; a tough economic austerity
programme and drastic measures to combat corruption; an emergency plan to
fight organised crime, especially in the south.
By throwing his hat into the ring, Mr Segni risks dividing the Christian
Democrats into the old guard and the reformers. But he is one of the party's
few credible political figures and could find cross-party support,
especially if the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) were to support him. At
the moment the PDS, which groups the bulk of the former Communist party, has
been spurning sudden post-electoral advances from both the Christian
Democrats and the Socialists.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, today faces a resolution in the
Congress of People's Deputies condemning the economic policy of his
government and demanding changes in the memorandum on reform it has thrashed
out with the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Yeltsin, who has sat stony-faced through a barrage of criticism for the
past two days, said yesterday he may choose to speak today in reply  -
though he said he may give his response 'after the Congress', implying he
might appeal to the population at large.
The resolution does not call for the government to resign. But the price of
staying in power is high.
The resolution foresees the eventual stripping from Mr Yeltsin of his
special powers to bring in laws by decree and to monopolise the appointment
of ministers.
At the same time, further concessions may be wrung from an already grossly
strained budget.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, gave a short and
well-received speech, in which he told the deputies that the government
would delay the energy price rises (set for June) and instead raise prices
by stages, and would raise pension and social security benefits and lower
taxes. He claimed that the budget deficit had been kept to 1.5 per cent of
the gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year - a figure much
lower than that calculated by foreign economists.
The final clause in the resolution says that 'the congress states to the
world community its decisive and firm intention to continue the policy of
economic reform'.
But it adds that that specific corrections must be made in the programme
submitted by the government to the IMF, and that a parliamentary delegation
would meet IMF representatives to clarify their position on the economy.

FT  10 APR 92 / Congress wounds but dares not strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian Congress, which today enters its fifth hectic day, has trembled
before the prospect of directly challenging Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president.
It has wounded in its rhetoric, and forced Mr Yeltsin to defend economic
reform personally, but it has not yet dared to strike.
It has become plain that the conservative forces in the parliament are
stronger than at first supposed. Of more than 1,000 deputies, 653 are
described as against the government, 483 of these being radicals. A further
266 are 'only partial supporters,' while the core supporters number only
136.
This arithmetic has forced retreat on the central issue of economic reform.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, yesterday told the
deputies the government would further soften its position.
Further ministerial sacrifices have been prepared, and may have to be made.
In turn, a resolution calling for Mr Yeltsin's resignation from his post as
prime minister had been softened to one of condemnation of the government's
economic course.
How far that course will now be trimmed, and under whose effective command,
is unclear; how the government can continue to fund and increase programmes
and subsidies which are already breaking the budget is more clear, since its
only resort is to print money.
The view yesterday was that the government and reform would survive, but
badly weakened.
The second big issue is the constitution, which could come up at the
congress this weekend with a still more dramatic denouement.
The central issue is how much power to give the president and parliament. Mr
Yeltsin has it in mind to dissolve parliament and seek a referendum vote of
confidence if the presidential-style constitution fails.
Here the lines are less clear: radical democrats and extreme nationalists
and communists (the last two having made a pact) are united in their dislike
of a presidential constitution.
The atmosphere is tense and Mr Yeltsin is not by nature a compromiser.
Efforts by centrist deputies to get him to bend a little towards his
opponents have met with a grudging response, and at any moment he may choose
to pull cut out of a forum he regards as invalid and appeal to the people.

UKRAINE and Russia averted a clash over the Black Sea fleet yesterday by
suspending their claims to the former Soviet Union's naval force.
The compromise was negotiated by telephone between Ukrainian President
Leonid Kravchuk and Mr Boris Yeltsin, his Russian counterpart.
It followed a day of tension in Sevastopol, the fleet's headquarters in the
Crimea. Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the fleet's commander, revealed that he had
deployed armoured personnel carriers to patrol the streets following rumours
of a Ukrainian attack.
The seamen are mostly Ukrainian while the officers are mainly Russian.
Crimea itself was once part of Russia and is now a district of Ukraine.
Conflict over the fleet has marked a low point in increasingly hostile
relations between Ukraine and Russia, the two most powerful members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. Ukraine had threatened to leave the CIS
over the issue.
The row has caused anxiety among western leaders concerned about the former
Soviet Union's nuclear weapons. In Brussels yesterday, Nato told Moscow and
Kiev of 'serious allied concerns' about Ukraine's decision to suspend the
transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia.
Ukrainian authorities and the commander of the fleet announced the agreement
on the Black Sea fleet yesterday. A commission will be set up to negotiate
the division of the fleet between the two Slavic giants.
The fleet is strategically important because of its nuclear capacity and
because of its access to the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
It was traditionally, in the former Soviet Union, a counterbalance to the US
Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.
Only 1 per cent of Black Sea fleet sailors had sworn an oath of allegiance
to Ukraine, according to the admiral. But Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, a member of
the Ukrainian negotiating team, said 70 per cent of sailors would like to
swear allegiance to Ukraine.
Symbols were at the heart of the compromise between the two states. Admiral
Kasatonov confirmed that Mr Yeltsin's order to hoist the Russian tricolour
over the ships of the Black Sea fleet had been suspended. The fleet still
flies the old Soviet naval flag, which Admiral Kasatonov acknowledged was
inappropriate since the Soviet Union no longer existed.

MR CHRIS Patten, the Tory party chairman, was the most dramatic election
casualty last night when he lost his Bath constituency to the Liberal

The Liberal Democrat candidate took the seat after overturning Mr Patten's

Mr Patten appeared exhausted as he made his acceptance speech - at least as
much from commuting daily from London where he ran the Conservatives
national campaign, as from the result.
He had a reputation as a donnish Conservative, formerly of wettish political
inclinations who looked uneasy with the job of acting as a political
rottweiler against the Labour party. Mr Patten told his campaign team that,
'we will be back and the Conservative flag will fly over Bath again'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was on the threshold of an unprecedented fourth consecutive
Conservative term early this morning as the first wave of results from
yesterday's general election suggested he was just within sight of an
overall majority.
With 272 seats declared, the results showed a national swing of 1.64 per
cent to Labour from the Conservatives since 1987, well short of the 4 per
cent swing that Mr Neil Kinnock needed to deprive Mr Major of his majority.
Mr Major, criticised over the past four weeks for a lacklustre campaign, now
appears set to lead his party into the longest continuous period of
government of any party since the Napeolonic wars.
The national picture - a massive disappointment for Mr Kinnock after what
was widely judged a slick and effective Labour campaign - disguised a
stronger performance by his party in many key marginals.
But his second election defeat since taking over as leader of the opposition
in 1983 may now put a questionmark over his future. Mr Kinnock led the major
overhaul of Labour's policies after the 1987 defeat, but his leadership was
judged to be a weakness in the party's campaign.
As the results poured in, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats appeared to
be losing ground across the country, but in a bad upset for the government,
the centre party defeated Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman,
in Bath.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, shrugged of his party's failure
to make a substantial break-through to attack Labour. 'If they can't beat
this government in the pit of a second recession and in the face of the poll
tax and everything else, you have to ask the question whether they can ever
challenge the government again.'
With large regional disparities in the results, a poor Labour performance in
the recession-hit south-east and a mixed outcome in London was matched by
patchier results in the Midlands and much stronger results in the
north-west.
Computer projections from the BBC and ITN suggested that the most likely
outcome would leave the Conservatives with an overall majority.
On the basis of a Harris exit poll and the first results, ITN forecast that
the Conservatives would win 327 seats, Labour 274, the Liberal Democrats and
others 50. The BBC forecast that Mr Major would hold 328 seats and Mr
Kinnock 274 seats. It gave the Liberal Democrats 21 and others 28.
The actual results - conflicting with initial exit poll projections pointing
to sweeping Conservative losses - brought jubiliation among Conservative
ministers. They claimed that the party's onslaught against Labour's tax and
spending policies and on Mr Kinnock's leadership qualities had brought a
last-minute surge in support for Mr Major.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that it was clear that his party's
message on tax and the economy had got through. He predicted a warm reaction
from financial markets to the likely outcome.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, said: 'We are going to win the
election against all the pundits, if I may say so. Its a good night for the
Conservatives, it is a very good night for John Major - it is his leadership
and the positive way we have fought this campaign that is coming through.'
Apart from their gain in Bath, the Cheltenham from the Conservatives. But Mr
Ashdown failed to make the breakthrough he had hoped for amid signs that
nationwide many of his potential supporters had moved back to the
Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats lost Southport and the Conservatives
held Portsmouth South after two recounts.
Labour seized the Lancashire marginals of Hyndburn and Pendle with swings of
about 5 per cent and secured a swing of more that 7 per cent to win Nuneaton
in the Midlands. But with a swing to Labour of less than 2 per cent in
Basildon, Essex, the Conservatives held one of their most vulnerable seats,
suggesting that Mr Major might still be in sight of a fourth term in office.
The initial exit polls brought Labour claims that Mr Major had suffered the
biggest defeat of any government since 1945 and the prediction that Mr
Kinnock would form the next administration.
But the later results suggested that even if Mr Major fell short of an
overall majority he would be able to form a government with the tacit
support of the Ulster Unionists.
Exit polls also predicted heavy losses for the government in Scotland, with
Mr Major's strident opposition to devolution leaving him with just three or
four seats out of 72, but early results suggested a stronger performance.
The first indications that the Conservatives might be doing better than had
been expected came at Basildon when Mr David Amess, the sitting
Conservative, easily held off a Labour challenge.
Early results also showed Labour recording swings of 1 per cent - far short
of the four per cent needed to produce a hung parliament. But as the night
wore on Labour began registering better figures. The two Lancashire results
and the Nuneaton gain on a 7 per cent swing appeared to support Labour
claims that it was doing better in its target marginals than in either safe
Tory or their own safe seats.
When the first 'big name' results came in there were sharp divergencies. As
widely predicted, Mr Patten fell to the Liberal Democrats at Bath. In
Putney, Mr David Mellor, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, held his seat
with a comfortable majority over Labour.
Some surprises came in Scotland with the Conservatives capturing the
marginal Labour seat of Aberdeen South and neighbouring Kincardine and
Deeside that last year fell to the Liberal Democrats. Mr Michael Forsyth,
the Thatcherite Scottish health and education minister, holding Stirling
despite a strong Labour challenge.
In Glasgow Govan, Mr Jim Sillars, the Scottish National Party's deputy
leader, was defeated by Labour.
The first Liberal Democrat gain came in Cheltenham where Mr Nigel Jones
captured the seat from Mr John Taylor, a black barrister, with a majority of
just over 2,000 votes. Commentators underlined, however, that a race factor
had probably played some impact in the outcome. But elsewhere, their results
were mixed.
Mr Des Wilson, the Liberal Democrat campaign manager, called for Labour and
the Conservatives to accept the verdict of the electorate and work for a
coalition government.

FT  10 APR 92 / Labour's swing in the south falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY results suggested Labour was failing to achieve the predicted swing in
the south of England outside London despite the effects of recession.
By 1am it was expected Labour might take only three of its nine main targets
in the south-east.
The first signs of setbacks came in Basildon where Labour managed only a 1.5
per cent swing against the Tories with the re-election of Mr David Amess.
The Essex marginal was 31st on Labour's hit list of seats it needed to win
to form the next government.
The signs were that Labour proposals to raise income tax for the top 10 per
cent of earners may have cost it dear in an area of above average affluence.
In the hard-hit area of Portsmouth South, where unemployment has risen
steeply, the vote was so close that the returning officer ordered a second
recount. The Conservatives held on with a majority of 242 even though the
seat had headed the Liberal Democrat target list. In Guildford there was
scarcely any movement in the vote as Mr David Howell retained his seat with
a 13,404 majority.
Mr Rupert Allason retained Torbay, the second result to be declared, with
only a 2 per cent swing against him.
As the results came in the swing became more patchy. In Exeter there was an
8 per cent swing to Labour and at Faversham, 3 per cent.
But although Labour was achieving larger swings in northern and Midlands
marginals than in the Tory heartland of the south early London results were
disappointing.
Mr David Mellor increased his majority in Putney and Mr John Bowis held
Battersea for the Tories even though a swing of less than 1 per cent would
have unseated him.

FT  10 APR 92 / Share prices rally in after-hours trading as Tory hopes rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices rallied, gilt prices rose, and sterling held firm as the
Conservative party edged ahead in the early hours of the morning.
After-hours trading - unprecedented in government-backed bonds - saw gilt
prices rise about a  1/2 point on the close of the official markets after
about 150 seats had been announced.
With hopes for a Tory win increasing, the only orders in a rather thin gilts
market were to buy.
'Gilts could put on about four points on a Tory win,' said Mr Simon Briscoe,
senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu.
The pound held firm as news of the better-than-expected Tory performance
trickled through. Analysts reported share prices had leapt ahead in the
thinly-traded late-night market.
The snap reaction at Smith Newcourt, the London market-makers, to the exit
polls and first official results, was that the leading blue chips were
trading about 3 per cent higher than their official London closing levels.
The utilities - water, electricity and power shares - were trading 5-7 per
cent higher.
Mr David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink, Europe's biggest
executions-only dealer, with about 250,000 private clients, said business
levels equalled those of a busy trading day.
'It is a unique situation - the first time the public has been able to trade
directly in shares while an election result unfolds.'
Earlier in the day, before the polls closed, shares, government gilt-edged
securities and sterling all rose sharply in London.
As voting took place, financial markets reasoned that a Tory defeat was not
a foregone conclusion. However, trading in most markets was thin. This
indicated the extreme caution about efforts to predict the outcome of the
election. Many investors are braced for considerable volatility when the
markets reopen this morning.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose by
43.2 to close at 2,436.4, while gilts saw a half-point gain.
On currency markets, investors bought the pound in place of the D-Mark and
other currencies, on the basis that whichever government is elected is
unlikely to opt for a sterling devaluation.
The support pushed up sterling by 1 1/2 pfennigs to a London close of
DM2.8575. Sterling also rose nearly 2 cents against the dollar, to Dollars
1.7665.

FT  10 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Rally follows president's popular move
 -A look at what has so far been a good year for Peru's stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Alberto Fujimori's surprise dissolution of Peru's Congress on
Sunday night sent a slight tremor through the stock exchange in Lima. But by
midweek, confidence was returning in line with public backing for Mr
Fujimori's action.
In spite of a 9 per cent fall in the general index since last Friday,
trading was reaching normal levels again by Wednesday. One of the key market
indicators, Banco Credito, which had lost some 19 per cent in value on
Monday and Tuesday, staged a rally of 6.5 per cent on Wednesday.
Sunday night's measures, supported by the army, were aimed at the
opposition, which has been attacking the government's free market reforms
and placing obstacles in the way of privatisation.
'Investors and brokers alike generally support the government's action,'
says Mr Jose Almenara, general manager of the stock exchange. 'I believe
economic reforms, including the privatisation process, will now advance much
faster.'
While the enthusiasm of overseas investors was more muted, Baring Securities
in London said its clients - all experienced in the risks involved in
emerging markets - were taking a long-term view. Baring noted that foreign
investors had bought some Dollars 200,000 of stocks on Tuesday and that Mr
Fujimori's announcement of a plebiscite in six weeks was encouraging.
It has been a good year so far on the stock exchange: trading topped Dollars
200m in the first quarter and the daily average of nearly Dollars 3m
contrasts sharply with the daily average of only Dollars 100,000 a year ago.
The general index, after consistent monthly growth of 30 per cent throughout
the final quarter of 1991, leapt from 108 in January to 170 in February,
before falling back some 25 points in March. Last month's dip, in advance of
Sunday's measures, was attributed primarily to companies cashing in on a
rising market to pay large tax bills falling due.
The market had also been disconcerted by a bungled domestic tax package
announced in late February which unexpectedly imposed a 20 per cent tax on
all dollar savings. While income from stocks and dividends was not included
in the measure - issued by supreme decree and swiftly rescinded in the face
of widespread protest - it probably proved an important signal from
investors to the government that fledgling investor confidence is easily
rocked by abrupt changes in the rules.
Investors seeking the next Latin American success story have been flocking
to Lima ever since Peru, long ostracised by the international financial
community for reneging on its Dollars 22bn foreign debt, was welcomed back
to the fold in September. 'Investors love a back-from-disaster story,' says
Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities. 'They are looking for a
repeat of the kind of gain, about 300 per cent a year, made in Argentina.'
So far the market's growth has focused on banking and industrial shares  -
the best performers have been brewers, cement manufacturers and CPT, the
Lima telephone company. CPT continues to rise in anticipation of the
privatisation of the state-held stake.
Another sector showing signs of activity is mining. The industry is Peru's
biggest export earner but has been affected for years by a debilitating
spiral of over-taxation, short-term indebtedness, and decapitalisation. But
prospects for sectoral refinancing and a long-awaited improvement in the
exchange rate are encouraging investors to look again.
Later this month the stock exchange will handle its first important
privatisation - that of Condestable, the state-owned copper mine. Banco de
Comercio is likely to follow and Hierro Peru, the iron monopoly, could also
be sold through the stock exchange.
Mr Jose Luque Otero, president of the board, says: 'The government intends
to privatise as much as possible via the stock exchange. It is the most
transparent mechanism they can get.'
Within two to three months, according to Mr Almenara, Lima will launch two
new ventures - foreign exchange and index futures markets along the lines of
those already well established in Chile. Under a recent agreement between
the stocks and securities commissions of the two countries, Peru is
benefiting from an interchange of information and training of personnel. By
the end of the year the market will be accessible by computer from anywhere
in the world.
For the management of the exchange the biggest current challenge is to
create a 'stock market mentality'. In spite of the tight liquidity, local
companies are still reluctant to launch public offers for shares or bonds
and relinquish their traditional control. But with demand for shares
outstripping supply, analysts believe it will not be long before old
prejudices are laid to rest.

FT  10 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 3.4% on
futures-linked selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE futures-linked selling overwhelmed purchases by investment trusts and
dealers, and the Nikkei average plunged 3.4 per cent, ending below 17,000
for the first time since November 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell 577.38 to close at the day's low of 16,598.15.
The index set a high for the session of 17,585.51 in early trading on
broad-based bargain hunting and index-linked buy programs.
Volume rose slightly from 320m to 350m shares. Declines led advances by 722
to 201, with 117 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks lost 23.69 to 1,196.19, breaching the 1,200 mark for the first time
since March 1986. In London trading, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
improved 15.19 to 977.77.
Sell orders linked to stock-index option contracts, exercised today,
depressed the Nikkei just before the close. Foreigners were also seen
selling heavily across the board. Traders said many overseas investors had
lost confidence in the market.
However, most analysts see the current 'pre-bubble' levels of Japanese
stocks as a chance to buy. Mr Andrew Ballingal, strategist at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, said: 'The market could fall another 20 to 30 per cent in the
next few months, but on a 12 to 18-month view current levels are
attractive.'
Electricals, initially higher on foreign buying, gave way to afternoon
selling. Toshiba shed Y12 to Y550 and NEC Y29 to Y941. However, Hitachi
managed to hold positive territory, gaining Y1 at Y772. Teac, a 'US recovery
theme' favourite among short-term traders, put on Y20 to Y875.
Banks mainly continued to weaken. Mitsubishi Bank fell Y70 to Y1,300 and
Fuji Bank slipped Y20 to Y1,140. Some dealers were seen covering short
positions on Industrial Bank of Japan, which picked up Y30 to Y1,360.
Speculative issues were pushed sharply lower as investors who had bought on
margin sold stock. Nippon Carbon, the most active issue of the day,
plummeted Y100 to Y458 and Clarion Y100 to Y523.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y5,000 to set an all-time low of
Y590,000. Individual investors, trying to prevent further losses, were seen
liquidating their holdings. Mr Masashi Kojima, company president, projected
pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993 to fall below Y300bn due to cuts
in long distance calls.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 199.79 to 18,345.55 in volume of 12.3m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO continued to depress the Pacific Rim yesterday. Bombay and Manila were
closed.
KUALA LUMPUR was affected by news that Malaysia had recorded a trade deficit
in January after showing surpluses in the previous two months. The composite
index closed 9.92 or 1.7 per cent down at 563.69 in volume of 43.8m shares.
up from 28.3m.
Talk that Malayan Banking, one of Malaysia's two leading banks, will raise
its base lending rate also kept investors cautious. The bank later announced
an increase in the rate from 8.5 to 8.9 per cent.
SINGAPORE failed to hold on to brief early gains as nervous investors
resumed their selling. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 11.54
weaker at 1,352.83 and volume increased to 49.87m shares from 42.94m.
HONG KONG retreated sharply in the afternoon, the Hang Seng index
registering a drop of 98.19 or 2.03 per cent at 4,729.39. Turnover rose from
HKDollars 2.13bn to HKDollars 2.49bn.
SEOUL recovered slightly from the year's low after fluctuating in moderate
trading. The composite index firmed 3.01 to 575.98 in turnover of Won256.6bn
(Won247.5bn).
TAIWAN opened firmer, but nervous investors, worried that the rally would
not last, sold before the close. The weighted index ended at 4,528.05, down
24.41, and turnover eased from TDollars 17bn to TDollars 14.87bn. Only
textiles posted slight gains.
AUSTRALIA fell to a new seven-month low. The All Ordinaries index shadowed
the Nikkei all day, falling below the 1,550 support level to close 9 points
down at 1,545.3 in turnover of ADollars 169.7m. The index bounced off a low
of 1,544.2 as last-minute bargain hunters prevented further losses.
NEW ZEALAND recorded a six-month low on nervous selling. The NZSE-40 capital
index receded 10.40 to 1,370.40, partly pulled down by an 11-cent decline in
Fletcher Challenge to NZDollars 3.23.

FT  10 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris recovers losses on
strong start in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARIS bucked a generally easier trend on the Continent, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS dipped below 19,000 before turning upwards as bargain-hunters had to
raise their bids to attract any sellers. The CAC 40 index hit a low of
1,899.90, but a strong opening on Wall Street helped it to close up 36.16 or
1.9 per cent to 1,943.64, recouping more than half of Wednesday's 3.4 per
cent loss. Turnover was high at FFr3.7bn.
Perrier was one of the day's most active stocks, as remaining shareholders
sold out to Nestle. The stock was steady at FFr1,700 with 184,575 shares
traded.
Alcatel Alsthom added FFr22 to FFr617 as its 1991 results came in at the top
of expectations and a stronger oil price pushed Elf up by FFr14.40 to
FFr368.40. Continued pessimism pushed Euro Disney down by FFr3.80 or 2.7 per
cent to FFr137.70. The theme park, which opens this weekend, has fallen 16.6
per cent from its all-time high of FFr165.20 and some analysts believe that
the stock is oversold.
FRANKFURT remained quiet as investors stayed on the sidelines pending the
outcome of the UK election. The overnight fall in Tokyo and the rejection by
the German interior ministry of a 5.4 per cent pay rise for public sector
employees had a limited impact. Talks between unions and employers are due
to restart on Monday, with the unions threatening to strike if the
settlement recommended by arbitrators is not accepted.
The DAX index fell to 1,710.29 before closing up 0.24 at 1,720.25. The FAZ
index, calculated at midsession, closed down 3.41 at 698.65. Turnover fell
to DM5.1bn from DM5.4bn.
The banking sector continued to lead the market following strong 1991
results this week and forecasts of positive earnings in 1992. Commerzbank
was DM3.10 stronger at DM263.80 while Deutsche Bank advanced 70 pfg to
DM711.20.
The pharmaceuticals group Gehe was one of the best performers of the day
gaining DM25 or 2.7 per cent to DM937 after announcing that it was to raise
its dividend by DM2.
MILAN fell to a new 1992 low as an early rebound faltered. However, dealers
were cautiously optimistic that there was good support for the Comit around
the 485 level, which they saw as the floor for the market until the
formation of a new government. Position squaring was in evidence ahead of
the options expiry on Monday and the close of the monthly account on
Wednesday. The Comit index eased 0.51 to 496.23 in turnover estimated at
L50bn after L74.2bn.
The banking sector fell 0.8 per cent, which Mr John Stewart of Pastorino
attributed to the Bank of Italy's announcement of a rise in bad loans. Banca
Nazionale dell'Agricoltura lost L140 or 2.8 per cent to L4,860. San Paolo
rebounded after its recent weakness, adding L55 to L12,005. A block of 5m
shares amounting to 0.8 per cent of the bank was passed through the market
late on Tuesday at the issue price of L12,200. There were rumours that the
shares changed hands between members of the bank's underwriting consortium
rather than being sold to an outside buyer.
Sip fell back L9 to L1,435 in profit-taking after the previous day's news of
a higher dividend. But the savings shares added L9 to L1,424.
AMSTERDAM showed some resistence to the falls in Tokyo and the US. The CBS
Tendency index was off 0.6 at 123.4 in turnover of Fl 578.9m.
A lack of corporate news kept price movements to a minimum. Some
profit-taking in Elsevier was noted and it closed down 70 cents at Fl 110.8.
Other blue chips were quiet: Royal Dutch up 20 cents to Fl 146.20 and
Unilever down 80 cents to Fl 180.60.
VRG declined Fl 1.10 to Fl 46.50 ahead of its results which came after the
close. The paper wholesaler reported a provisional fall of between 25-30 per
cent in first quarter 1992 net profit.
BRUSSELS recovered some of its earlier losses. The Bel-20 index fell 4.93 to
1,165.61.
Solvay, which proposed an unchanged dividend, gained BFr25 to BFr12,025 with
2,500 shares traded.
ZURICH rose in light trading. The SMI index gained 2.8 to 1,829.1. Banks
were firmer with SBC bearers up SFr1 at SFr278 and UBS bearers SFr10
stronger at SFr3,740.
STOCKHOLM followed Tokyo and New York lower. The Affarsvarlden index closed
down 8.2 at 961.0 in turnover of SKr431m.

THE PLATINUM price fell to the lowest level for 11 weeks yesterday after
another bout of Japanese selling. At the London bullion market's afternoon
fixing the it was Dollars 345.20 a troy ounce, down Dollars 4.05 on the day
and Dollars 10.55 on the week so far. Traders believed Japanese operators
had again sold platinum to raise funds to cover equity losses. Other
precious metals were little changed. At the London Metal Exchange the cash
COPPER price reversed an early fall to close Pounds 6.25 higher at Pounds
1,270.75 a tonne. Dealers said the fall had bounced off support at the
equivalent of Dollars 2,230 a tonne and the subsequent gain was encouraged
by expectations that a further fall in LME stocks would be announced today.
But ALUMINIUM stocks were expected to rise to a fresh record and the cash
price closed Dollars 6.25 down at Dollars 1,323.75 a tonne. The prospect of
a further stocks increase also weighed on the NICKEL market. The uptrend in
TIN prices was maintained as concern continued at the lack of quality metal
available for nearby delivery. The cash price closed at Dollars 5,812.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 40 on the day.

half.
Mr Manuel Marin, the EC fisheries commissioner, indignantly rejected this
claim last week, stating that the main problem was overfishing by domestic
and other non-EC vessels inside Canada's 200-mile limit, and the Ottawa
government's political inability to face up to restructuring the Canadian
fleet.
The commission has made it clear that if EC vessels were found to be
responsible for depleting severely the cod stock, they would be withdrawn
from the area.
Canada claims Spanish and Portuguese boats are overfishing the 'straddling
stock' of cod on the 'Nose' and 'Tail' of the Grand Banks, off Newfoundland
but outside the 200-mile limit. The EC says the stock that straddles the
limit amounts to between 3 and 5 per cent of the total.
Brussels contends that even if Canada is right that EC vessels took 20,000
tonnes of undeclared cod out of these international waters last year, the EC
could not be responsible for the claimed collapse of the spawning biomass.
The Commission wants the scientific committee of Nafo - the Northwest
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, which administers the area adjoining
Canada's waters - to examine the claims of Canadian government scientists.
It asked Canada to agree to a Nafo meeting in March, but Ottawa refused, Mr
Marin said.
Brussels is now raising the pressure for a review, having won the backing of
the EC fisheries ministers last Friday. It also announced yesterday it was
willing to suspend part of the EC quota in the Nafo area causing the
dispute, 'whilst pursuing the objective rational conservation and management
of fish resources' that it expected Canada to participate in.

NORTH SEA Petrochemicals yesterday inaugurated the last unit of a
revolutionary Dollars 275m Antwerp-based petrochemicals plant. It is the
first of its kind to embrace, in a single complex, the entire production
process for polypropylene based on propane and refinery propylene.
NSP, formed in 1989, is an equally-owned joint venture between Statoil, the
Norwegian state oil company, and Himont, a member of Italy's Ferruzzi group
and one of the world's leading producers of polypropylene.
The vertically-integrated propylene and polypropylene facility includes the
world's first propane dehydrogenation plant. The complex is also the first
in Europe to manufacture polymer-grade propylene directly from propane gas
and refinery propylene.
The dehydrogenation unit converts 250,000 tonnes of propane annually and is
linked to a 400,000 tonnes - a - year propylene purification unit, which
supplies propylene raw material for NSP's 180,000 tonnes-a-year
polypropylene plant.
The entire complex supplies Himont and Statoil with polypropylene and the
excess propylene for their separate downstream processing and marketing
activities.
The completion of the project comes, however, at a time when the world's
petrochemicals industry is experiencing marketing difficulties that have
been attributed to oversupply. Dr Italo Trapasso, vice president of Italy's
Montedison, president of Montecanini and chairman of Himont, said here
yesterday that during 1983-89 the industry had grown at a faster rate than
world GNP.
Dr Trapasso dismissed the industry's present problems as cyclical and
expressed optimism about recent slight growth in the world economy and the
outlook for polyolefins, which he called products of the future in relation
to environmental concerns and market flexibility.
Mr PM Morrione, Himont's president, said that he believed the industry's
problems were not caused by excess volumes in the market and pointed out
that European and US demand had increased this year by an estimated 17 per
cent.
Mr Harald Norvik, the president of Statoil, defended his company's
investment in the Antwerp facility in spite of prevailing poor market
conditions and said his view of polypropylene as a polymer of the future had
not changed.
Mr Norvik added that Statoil was considering further expansion of
petrochemical operations through the addition of a second polypropylene line
and a second world-scale MTBE plant in Antwerp.
Statoil last year suffered an operating loss of NKr17m (Pounds 1.52m) on its
petrochemicals activities, compared with a profit of NKr718m in 1990. On a
group basis net profits dipped slightly to NKr4.2bn from NKr4.3bn because of
the one-off effect of Norway's tax reform.

FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME warns again on zinc supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS CONSUMERS protested yesterday that the London Metal Exchange's zinc
market was out of touch with reality, the LME board issued its second
warning this year that it was closely monitoring the growing zinc supply
tightness.
It did so after the LME price for zinc for immediate delivery rose above the
three-month price - or moved into backwardation, to use the traders' jargon.
Zinc prices have risen from Dollars 987 a tonne in late October - the lowest
since the special high grade zinc contract was launched - to a 14-month high
of Dollars 1,285 last week, in spite of LME stocks in that time moving up
from about 150,000 tonnes to a record 222,800 tonnes.
In a note to traders yesterday the LME board said: 'The exchange has at its
disposal a variety of courses of action which would be introduced should
circumstances dictate the necessity of such actions.'
After this warning the backwardation, which on Wednesday was Dollars 12 a
tonne, eased to Dollars 8.50 at yesterday's close.
Mr Martin Abbott, director of marketing, described LME's latest move as 'a
warning shot across the bows of anyone who might be thinking of playing any
games in the zinc market.'
However, Mr Malcolm Widdows, managing director of Brock Metals, a British
West Midlands company best known as a supplier of zinc alloys to the motor
industry, suggested: 'The market is too open to manipulation. The LME
doesn't like that word used, so let's say its too open to influence.'
He said the fact that the zinc price in the past few months had gone up in
spite of relatively weak demand and visibly high stocks was very frustrating
for consumers and likely to drive some into using a different metal when
that was possible.
'I'm very unhappy and my customers hate it,' he added.
Mr Widdows suggested that 'some clever person might have worked out that it
pays to hold the majority of the zinc warrants and lend them out to cover
shorts at better returns than bank rate'. (Shorts are those who have sold
metal they do not own in the expectation they can buy it later at a lower
price).
Mr Widdows pointed out that the LME encouraged metal consumers to use the
market to smooth out peaks and troughs in prices. 'But how are consumers to
know when these shenanigans are going to go on. If a consumer covers during
one of these peaks and the price then drops like a stone, it puts that
consumer at a disadvantage to competitors.'
Brock also processes aluminium and Mr Widdows said that the zinc market's
performance was a dire warning of what might happen should a secondary
(scrap) aluminium contract be added to the LME's list.
There were various market rumours yesterday about the cause of the supply
tightness. One company mentioned, Barclays Metals, said that, far from
squeezing the market, it had always provided liquidity to the market if it
was required - provided it had the metal.
If the LME board decides there is danger of a disorderly market, it is
legally obliged to take action to put matters right.
In extreme circumstances in the past it has put an upper limit on the
premium that can be charged to borrow metal (buy spot and sell forward) for
a day.

<TEXT>
THE SIZE of the negotiating group for a new International Coffee Agreement
was proving to be the first obstacle on the road to renewed efforts to
support coffee prices, delegates at the International Coffee Organisation's
London council meeting said yesterday, reports Reuters.
On Tuesday, after a working group had reported on the prospects for agreeing
a new marketing pact, the council gave the go-ahead for negotiations to be
held on an agreement with economic clauses, probably based on a universal
export quota system.
Delegates had differing ideas, however, on the form the negotiations should
take. Consuming country members were seeking open discussions, while most
producers were in favour of a '10 plus 10' consumer/producer group with
observers.
'The doubt is whether they should go immediately to a negotiation group or
leave it open to all members,' said Mr Nestor Osorio of Colombia. 'I feel,
however, that most of the ground to be discussed initially has already been
covered by the working group.'
Another delegate said: 'Small producers want a big negotiating group, while
larger producers want a small negotiating group.'
Consumers, meanwhile, were keen that talks on a new economic pact should be
open to everyone, including non-members.
'I think transparency is an important concept,' commented Mr Myles
Frechette, head of the US delegation.
The question of when negotiations could begin was also at issue. Producers
wanted talks to start as soon as possible, while consumers felt a date in
mid-June was the earliest feasible.
Delegates were hoping to reach agreement on these issues last night,
although the present council meeting is scheduled to continue today.

plan for imports
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN DAIRY farmers are up in arms over a Bush administration plan to
promote capitalism in Hungary by making room in the US market place for goya
cheese.
The proposal - to eliminate the import duty for goya under the US
Generalised System of Preferences - would be 'simply the straw that breaks
the dairy farmers backs', insists Congressman Jim Moody of Wisconsin, the
number one US dairy state.
As efficient at lobbying Congress as they are at overproducing, dairy
farmers turned out en masse yesterday for a hearing of a House agriculture
subcommittee where the proposal was predictably decried.
Unwilling to attack a new democracy, the congressmen argued that giving GSP
to goya would open the way for a flood of new duty-free imports that would
chiefly benefit Argentina and Uruguay. They said imports of goya would rise
by up to 100,000 tonnes.
Goya can be used as a substitute for Parmesan produced in the US. This, in
turn, would drive farmers into manufacture of cheddar, which is purchased by
the US government (when in surplus) and dumped on the world market.
'In our zealousness to help the newly democratic states, we need to proceed
with at least enough caution to ensure that we do not undertake proposals
that hurt ourselves more than they help the nations on whose behalf they are
intended,' Congressman Moody said.
Farmers thought they had won this point when a petition to admit goya to the
GSP was rejected by the US Trade Representative last year. However, it is
now being reconsidered after President Bush waived the three-year limit on
resubmitting rejected petitions and raised the issue again. A final decision
is due by the end of the month.
Meanwhile, Congressmen have mounted an attack against the State Department,
which they claim is once again using agriculture 'as a tool of foreign
policy'. They said that without a duty, imported Goya would sell in US food
stores at 30 cents below the US price.
'If we can find ways to effectively help countries like Hungary develop
market economies, we should do so,' said Congressman Moody. 'But this
particular prescription won't help the patient and will most certainly hurt
the doctor.'

FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japan likely to set back metals
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S PRESENT economic problems will hold back worldwide metals demand and
consequently western world consumption growth this year will be only
'modest', the Metal Bulletin Research organisation says in its latest
report.
MBR suggests that Japan is going into recession and 'metals demand there
will be disappointing throughout 1992. Nearly all the indicators suggest
that the short-term prospects for base metal demand are poor and they are
likely to continue to deteriorate during the remainder of the second
quarter'.
Analyst Mr Neil Buxton says that, given the weakness of the first half-year,
'there will be little, if any, growth in base metals demand in Japan for
1992 as a whole'.
As that country's industries consumes between 10 and 25 per cent of the
traded metals, when Japan's slowdown is added to the continuing sluggish
demand in Europe, 'these combined factors will offset the revival that
appears to be gaining ground in the US,' he says in MBR's Base Metals
Monthly.
Drawing together some statistics to back his case, Mr Buxton says that the
Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry is forecasting that
crude steel output in Japan will fall by 16.8 per cent in the second quarter
and that speciality steel production will be 17.2 per cent down from the
same months last year.
In the copper market, the Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers'
Association saw copper electric wire orders in January dip below 90,000
tonnes for the first time since January 1990. They were down more than 5 per
cent from January last year. The Japan Aluminium Alloy Refiners' Association
forecast that demand for secondary (scrap) aluminium will fall 3.6 per cent
in the 1992 fiscal year.
The International Lead and Zinc Study group recently forecast a slight fall
in zinc consumption in Japan in 1992, while lead consumption was predicted
to be unchaged from last year's level.
According to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics, aluminium consumption in
Japan grew by 1.8 per cent last year compared with 9.5 per cent in 1990;
copper consumption was up 2.3 per cent (9 per cent); nickel 10.4 per cent
(down 2.3 per cent) and zinc 3.7 per cent (6 per cent.)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENAGAS, Spain's state-owned natural gas distributor, will begin importing
liquefied natural gas from Nigeria in 1997 under the terms of a 22-year-long
agreement worth in excess of Pta200bn (Pounds 1.1bn) that was signed
yesterday in Lagos with a consortium formed by the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, Shell, Elf and Agip.
The contract, part of a package negotiated by the consortium with Italy's
Enel, Cabot of the US and Gaz de France, represents a further step in the
diversification and increase of Spain's LNG imports.
Enagas, which has traditionally bought from Algeria and Libya, will be
receiving Norwegian natural gas through a new trans-Pyrenees pipeline in
October next year. Towards the end of the 1990s a second pipeline will
supply Spain with LNG from Algeria via Morocco.
Spain wants to increase its use of natural gas from 6bn cubic metres a year
to 15bn in the year 2000. The agreement specifies that, in an initial phase,
Spain will annually ship 1bn cu m of Nigerian LNG for domestic distribution.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Bonds: Finland returns to market with Dollars
500m, five-year issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND yesterday made a cautious return to the Eurodollar bond market
yesterday, although its plans were disrupted by an easing of US interest
rates and the unwillingness of investors to commit new funds to the market.
The Dollars 500m five-year issue was smaller and shorter in maturity than
many syndicate officials had anticipated. Earlier this week firms were
expecting a Dollars 1bn issue of between seven and 10-years.
Finland and Morgan Stanley International, which lead managed the issue, were
also cautious in pricing the deal. Initial price talk indicated a yield
spread of 40 to 43 basis points more than US Treasury paper, but this was
seen as too aggressive by many market participants.
The deal was launched yesterday morning at an indicated yield spread of 42
to 45 basis points over Treasuries, and priced in the afternoon at the
higher level.
Finland is rated AA2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA plus by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the two big US credit rating agencies. This is only one notch below
Norway, which has a Dollars 1bn five-year issue, launched last week, trading
at a yield spread of 27 basis points in the grey market.
Despite compromise over the issue amount, maturity and pricing, the deal
received a mixed response early in the day. Participants said investors
remained uncertain about the outlook for Finland's credit quality, following
measures to stabilise the markka last week.
In the afternoon the Eurodollar market was disrupted as the US authorities
moved to relax monetary conditions. US Treasury bonds at the five-year
maturity rallied by around  1/2 a point.
Although the lead manager said it was committed to holding the yield spread
at 45 basis points, the spread widened as Treasury bond yields fell.
By the close of trading in London only around half the issue was in the firm
hands of investors. The deal was quoted at 100.16, against a fixed re-offer
price of 99.675. The yield spread was around 50 basis points in a volatile
market.
Elsewhere, SNCF, the French state railway company, doubled the size of its
outstanding FFr3bn domestic/international hybrid bond issue maturing 2004.
Lead managers CCF and Credit Agricole offered FFr1.5bn bonds to
international investors yesterday, with the same amount allocated to
domestic institutions.
The 8.6 per cent paper was reoffered at a fixed price of 96.695, where the
yield is 9.06 per cent, in line with the yield available on the outstanding
bonds in the secondary market.

THE RACE to create a debt rating market in Spain intensified yesterday when
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, entered into a partnership with the
local stock markets, and two official credit institutions, Instituto de
Credito Oficial (ICO) and the export credit guarantor, CESCE, writes Peter
Bruce in Madrid.
Efforts to begin Spanish rating operations began after the amount of
corporate paper in circulation rose more than 300 per cent to about Dollars
21bn by the beginning of last year. There are, currently, about 55 issues
outstanding, making Spain one of the most active corporate debt markets in
Europe.
Mr Leo O'Niell, S&amp;P's president and chief rating officer, said that in spite
of the rapid growth of corporate paper issues - caused largely by Bank of
Spain lifting borrowing restrictions more than two years ago, Spain was a
good long-term proposition.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Globex launch threatens to
disrupt Europe's future - The 24-hour trading system which may increase
competition between European exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch in June of Globex, the around-the-clock futures trading system,
could increase the level of competition between Europe's futures exchanges.
The system, developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Reuter, will initially list US products; pressure on European
exchanges to join the system will increase when Globex starts to trade
European products later this year.
So far, the Matif in Paris is the only European exchange to sign up. Its
Paris interbank offered rate (Pibor), notional French government bond and
Ecu bond contracts will be listed when the exchange links up in about six
months time. Several other exchanges are in fairly advanced discussions with
Globex.
The system is expected 'to capture new customers (for existing products) by
reducing barriers like time-zone differentials and lack of familiarity,'
said Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex. It is an order-matching
system designed to complement open-outcry trading on exchanges. However, its
impact will be stronger where competition between exchange-traded products
already exists.
For example, the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange's Eurodollar futures contract, which is hardly thriving with
average daily volume of around 4,000 contracts a day, could be virtually
wiped out.
The CME's highly liquid Eurodollar contract, along with the CBOT's 30-year
Treasury future, will be added to the system later this year. The first
contracts to be traded will be the less active currency contracts listed on
the CME, and the 10-year Treasury contract on the CBOT.
The CME is currently deep in discussions with Simex, the Singapore futures
exchange, which has a highly successful Eurodollar contract, on how to
continue to work together. Talks with Simex over Globex will then resume.
A more serious threat is that the Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures
exchange, may join Globex soon and list its German Bund contract on the
system. Under Globex rules, rival contracts cannot be listed until a clear
winner has been established - if both exchanges involved are members of the
system.
Liffe's Bund contract is more heavily traded than the DTB's but the German
exchange has been battling to win back market share, and trading on Globex
could help advance that cause. Mr Friedrich Wahl, chief executive of DTB,
said the exchange 'will intensify the dialogue' with Globex. Discussions
will focus on which contracts could be traded on the system and how to
create the necessary technical links, he said.
Liffe, however, is still not close to an agreement. 'We have been having
discussions with Globex for three years, but the restrictions in the Globex
agreement are still not acceptable to the Liffe board,' said Mr David
Burton, Liffe's chairman.
However, Mr Burton is aware the competitive threat from Globex is 'something
we have to address'. It is still possible that Liffe will join Globex at a
later date; alternatively, Liffe's APT after-hours screen trading system
could be developed to operate as a global system to compete with Globex (an
order-matching rather than a trading system). The issue will be discussed at
a strategic planning meeting of Liffe board members later this month.
Globex - with just the CBOT, the CME, the Matif and the New York exchanges
(excluding Nymex which is developing a rival system) - can claim to give
access to 60-70 per cent of the world's futures trading. Banks and brokers
do not doubt that they will need to use the system in order to meet customer
demand.
'We have to use the system because our competitors will be using it,' said
Mr John Woodbyrne, futures desk manager at Credit Lyonnais Rouse.
Claims that Globex is set to transform derivatives trading may have been
exaggerated. Mr Burton believes 'the competitive threat is minimal in
markets based in Europe,' because of the concentration of liquidity. But
there is little doubt the system will concentrate the minds of Europe's
competing futures exchanges.
OM, the Swedish futures exchange, will start trading futures and options on
its LDCx index of less developed country debt on May 5.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Net profits at Israel Chemicals
slip 20%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL Chemicals, the flagship of the government's slow privatisation
programme, has reported a 20 per cent drop in net profits in 1991, down to
Shk142m (USDollars 62m) from Shk179m in 1990, the second year running
profits have slipped.
The government announced last week it intends to float 31 per cent of Israel
Chemicals on stock markets in the US and Europe at an unspecified time later
this year.
The move would bring down the state's holding to 49 per cent of the company,
which exploits Israel's only real natural resource by extracting chemicals
from the Dead Sea and surrounding desert area.
In late February, some 20 per cent of Israel Chemicals was sold to the
public, chiefly through a Dollars 225m flotation on the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange. Plans are to run down the state's share in the company to less
than 30 per cent.
After running into political objections to its original plan to sell a
controlling stake to foreign investors, the Treasury now intends placing
privately only a 15 per cent block.
Despite the fall in profits, Israel Chemicals maintained its position as the
most profitable of the state's 150-strong portfolio of companies, with
return on capital of 10 per cent.
The decline in profits was blamed mainly on declining demand and prices for
fertilisers in western Europe.
Sales, about half of which go for export, were down slightly at Shk2.78bn,
compared with Shk2.82bn in 1990.

VME GROUP, the world's third largest construction equipment producer, may

other manufacturers, said Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief

VME, jointly owned by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, has

through the acquisition of Zettelmeyer, a German producer of small
earthmoving equipment, and Akerman, a Swedish hydraulic excavator company.
Mr Johannesson, interviewed at Bauma, the Munich construction equipment
exhibition, stressed that any further acquisitions or co-operation with
other manufacturers would be in specific geographic or product areas, or
could involve components. Industry speculation, fuelled at Bauma by
uncertainty over unresolved takeover and joint venture discussions, has
linked VME with O &amp; K, the German construction and mining equipment concern.
VME had no comment yesterday on the rumours. O &amp; K is owned by Hoesch, the
steel group being taken over by its German rival Krupp, which also has
construction and mining equipment interests.
VME has recently focused on building a strong presence in the German market.
Mr Johannesson said the company's integrated German distribution network was
fundamentally complete, although there were a couple of pieces still to fall
in place. The Zettelmeyer acquisition gave VME an important foothold in a
market where customers traditionally prefer domestically-produced equipment.
But Mr Johannesson added that the German company was also benefiting from
its access to Volvo BM technology.
VME is in the throes of reducing its fixed asset base by 10 per cent
worldwide in response to recession in most world markets and the industry's
chronic overcapacity. The programme will be completed by the end of this
year. The Brussels-based group lost Dollars 44.7m last year, due to heavy
restructuring at Akerman in Sweden and tough market conditions, especially
in North America and Brazil.
Mr Johannesson said VME's resource allocation planning for this year assumes
a slightly worse business environment than in 1991, but this did not imply
that it foresees a deeper loss for 1992. VME is best known for its Volvo BM,
Michigan and Euclid brands, which joined forces in one of the biggest
international construction equipment mergers of the mid-1980s.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Gold Fields holds earnings in
spite of weaker prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IMPROVED cost control at the large producers allowed the gold mines in the
Gold Fields group to maintain earnings in the March quarter, despite a
weaker gold price, but all the group's marginal producers made significant
losses.
Gold production in the group rose marginally to 29,594kg, from 29,450kg the
previous quarter, with a rise in the average grade, to 8.4 grams per tonne
from 8.1, offsetting a lower milling rate. Likewise, a 1.5 per cent drop in
the average price received, to R31,911 per kg, was offset by a decline in
average working costs to R21,246 per kg from R21,432 per kg. After-tax
profit slipped to R208m (Dollars 74.2m) from R212m.
The main influence on the results was the unchanged performance of
Driefontein Consolidated, the group's largest mine, which made after-tax
profits of R132m. Both East and West Driefontein lifted their grades and
gold production, but costs rose in the West mine while declining in the
East. The mine produced 14,614kg of gold.
Kloof, the other rich mine in the group had a good quarter, with gold
production rising to 7,521kg from 7,193 on account of a significant rise in
the grade to 14.2g/t from 13.3g/t. Unit costs declined and profits were 5
per cent higher at R111.5m. The Leeudoorn extension to Kloof produced
1,303kg of gold, but made a R9.3m loss.
Mr Alan Munro, executive director at Gold Fields, said improvement would
come when the mine, which is still in the development stage, managed to
achieve better grades and economies of scale.
The three marginal producers, Doornfontein, Libanon and Venterspost made
after-tax losses of R7m, R3.2m and R3.3m respectively, with Libanon and
Venterspost both performing worse than in the December quarter. Mr Munro
said the position of these two mines gave 'cause for concern'.
Venterspost, he said, was 'living from hand to mouth'. Attempts to increase
production from the old mine had not succeeded and difficulties had been
encountered in bringing the new No 4 shaft into production.
Further efforts are being made to rationalise activities at Libanon. Mr
Munro said the mine should break even in the coming quarter and made a
similar prediction for Doornfontein. He said Doornfontein had made
considerable progress in recovering from the dismissal of half the workforce
in December. The aim is to try to keep the mine viable until new areas, in
the south of the mine, can be opened up.
In terms of capital expenditure, Mr Munro said that on the profitable mines
they were doing what was necessary to maintain their viability.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Chief executive of ANZ to retire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Australia's most senior bankers, Mr Will Bailey, is to retire as
deputy chairman and group chief executive of the Melbourne-based ANZ Bank.
His retirement heads a 'changing of the guard' at ANZ, also involving the
retirement of the bank's chairman, Mr Milton Bridgland, who will leave the
board in June on reaching retirement age.
The bank announced the changes yesterday, saying Mr Bailey would retire in
the December quarter of this year and his successor would be announced in a
few months.
But some clues on the succession were given with the appointment of two new
executive directors, the bank's New Zealand chief executive, Mr Alister
Maitland, and the chief general manager of Australian retailing operations,
Mr Don Mercer.
Mr Bridgland will be replaced as chairman by ANZ director Mr John Gough, who
is also chairman of Pacific Dunlop, the Melbourne industrial conglomerate.
The changes end an era of growth at ANZ since Mr Bailey became chief
executive in 1984. This included integration of the UK-based Grindlays
banking group and New Zealand's Postbank.
Mr Bailey also presided over the takeovers of the National Mutual Royal Bank
and the Town and Country Bank. His tenure saw ANZ group assets jump to
ADollars 98bn (USDollars 75bn) from ADollars 35bn and gross income grow to
ADollars 7.6bn from ADollars 3.3bn.
Mr Bailey was the main architect of an ambitious attempt by ANZ to take
control of the country's second largest life insurance group, the National
Mutual. The plan was blocked by the federal government, forcing the parties
to fall back on increased commercial links. But earlier this year the two
organisations announced they would develop their businesses independently.
Mr Bailey's era has also seen a large rise in ANZ's bad debts through
exposure to a brigade of so-called Australian entrepreneurs. No leading
Australian bank has been immune from these effects which have hit earnings.
Yesterday the bank also said it was restructuring and reducing non-core
assets 'to ensure that the bank makes a strong recovery from the adverse
effects of the 1980's.
'This programme is progressing well, and Mr Bailey feels the time is
opportune to retire,' ANZ said.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Frontier spirit rebuilds a
crippled economy / A look at how German banks have found a world of
opportunity in their own back yard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days when would-be high-fliers in Germany's big banks felt obliged to
spend a year or two in Tokyo, London or New York are over.
The opportunities are now in the banks' back yard, in the eastern part of
Germany.
There, in the five new Bundeslander, a frontier spirit prevails as German
executives try to build a modern market system on the ruins of a centrally
planned economy. From the start the banks have been in the vanguard.
They began setting up branches in the new territories in the weeks before
monetary union on July 1 1990 and have built a modern banking system
virtually from scratch.
So far, and rather surprisingly, given the level of investment, many of the
banks have made a profit in the east. Business there - though no more than
about one-tenth of the the banks' total domestic lending - helped fuel the
spectacular increases in 1991 profits announced in the past few days.
However, the attractions of doing business there may wither away, as the
government in Bonn reduces the financial favours it grants to eastern
Germany.
Before reunification, east Germany's banking system was under-developed and
inefficient. The old Staatsbank, the former state sector bank, was
responsible for printing money and was a tool for central planning. It
distributed state handouts and facilitated payments from one Kombinat (state
sector business) to another.
The vast majority of private individuals were obliged to bank with a network
of Sparkassen, savings and loans organisations which all paid interest of
3.5 per cent.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks, bought the
Staatsbank from the Treuhand privatisation agency and parcelled out its
branch network and staff between them.
Other west German banks have had to build up their eastern operations from
scratch and an estimated 2,500 west German bankers have moved to eastern
Germany.
The eastward march of German banks has required large logistical efforts and
substantial investment. Billions of D-Marks have been spent on buying and
refurbishing property, establishing computer links with the west, installing
cash dispensers and other computer hardware.
There have been substantial costs, above all in training the 12,500 east
Germans who work in banking in the new Bundeslander.
The banks are coy about the precise sums being poured into the east. But in
the case of Deutsche Bank, the costs of its expansion were a significant
factor in raising its staff and operating costs last year by DM1.5bn
(Dollars 900m) to DM10bn, disappointing analysts when the figures were
released last Thursday.
The presence of the banks has enabled east Germans to borrow money or to
finance a small business. For the first time, they have access to a plethora
of savings products such as interest-bearing cheque accounts, unit trusts
and share trading accounts.
The banks have acted as a catalyst for the first stirrings of an economic
upswing in the east, lending to start-up ventures, to the subsidiaries of
west German companies, and to the thousands of companies owned by the
Treuhand privatisation agency.
Bankers see themselves less as businessmen than agents of reform,
missionaries of capitalism.
'Our task is to optimise our corporate clients' understanding,' said Mr
Rudiger Wrede of the Deutsche Bank in Leipzig.
According to the Association of German Banks, private sector banks have
advanced credits of some DM45bn in the east, of which the lion's share has
gone to east Germany's fledgling corporate sector.
In spite of the scale of investment, the eastwards expansion has so far been
profitable for the banks. 'The only obstacle to growth is a lack of skilled
personnel,' said Mr Klaus-Peter Muller, main board director at Commerzbank
with responsibilities for the bank's activities in the east.
This is partly because staff costs are still lower there than in the west.
But there are two other important reasons. Although some east Germans have
opened share accounts and experimented with more exotic forms of investment,
such as options and warrants, the majority of private customers in the east
have proved to be very conservative, preferring to leave their savings in
accounts paying minimal rates of interest.
Industry observers say this reflects east Germans' lack of financial
sophistication. Ossies - east Germans - want their money to be safe and
easily accessible, providing a cheap source of finance for the banks.
The second reason is that bank lending has been insulated from the full
problems of the east German economy. In June 1990, the Treuhand agency
extended a so-called credit umbrella to the former state sector companies
under its charge, guaranteeing loans taken out by German enterprises.
Loans made under the terms of this guarantee are totally free from risk.
The Association of German Banks estimates that DM15bn of credit is covered
by the guarantees, a third of the total advanced by west German banks in the
east. For some of the big banks, up to half the loan portfolio is protected
in this way.
The interest rate the banks received for these loans is lower than that
charged to normal commercial clients, reflecting the lack of risks, but it
is still a tidy two or three percentage points above the banks' cost of
funds in the money markets - and as much as two or three times the interest
rate paid out to retail depositors.
Bankers maintain they deserve the margin paid by the Treuhand because of the
amount of consultancy and administrative work associated with the loans.
'We have to deal with a fantastic amount of paperwork,' said Mr Kurt Kasch,
head of corporate lending at Deutsche Bank in Berlin and Brandenburg in
north-east Germany. 'The Treuhand expects us to give advice on all aspects
of business.'
The advantageous terms extracted from the Treuhand and hence the salad days
for the banks in eastern Germany may be drawing to an end.
The privatisation agency - under pressure from the government to cut its
costs - has decided it is not going to continue subsidising the banks in
this way. In December it announced that banks would have to take more of the
lending risks on to their own books.
The gradual elimination of guarantees will make it much more difficult for
banks to lend money profitably in the east. As the Treuhand's credit
umbrella is gradually removed in the coming months, the banks will have to
start using normal commercial criteria when lending to businesses in the
east.
It is likely that the banks will continue to lend to the eastern
subsidiaries of west German companies, and to dentists, plumbers and other
small-scale entrepreneurs where the risks are limited.
Otherwise they may be reluctant to lend at all - given the lack of credit
history and management experience in the east.
When they do lend, the prospects of bad debts and provisions against these
debts will make business in the east far less profitable than it is now.

QUAKER Oats, the Chicago-based food, beverage and pet foods company, warned
yesterday that its third-quarter earnings per share, for the three months to
end-March, could fall by 10-15 per cent from the previous year's figure.
The company, which saw earnings per share of 82 cents in the third quarter
of 1990-91 and net profits from continuing operations of Dollars 63.1m,
blamed the downturn on lower sales volumes for its ready-to-eat cereals and
its Gatorade sports beverage.
Higher marketing expenditures in the US and Europe compounded the problems.
Quaker stressed that it expected results for the first nine months of the
year to be up on the previous year.
In the first six months, the company reported earnings from continuing
operations of Dollars 1.12 a share, compared with 85 cents in 1990-91.
On Wall street, its shares took the news fairly calmly, easing Dollars 1/4
to Dollars 52 1/4 , in early trading.

<TEXT>
TELEVISA, Mexico's privately-owned television company, has joined up with a
group of investors in a bid to buy Univision, the main Spanish-language
television network in the US.
The group, headed by California businessman Mr Jerrold Perenchio, hopes to
acquire Univision Holdings for Dollars 550m from Hallmark Cards.
Univision reported earnings of more than Dollars 200m last year.
Miami-based Univision reaches almost 90 per cent of US Hispanic television
households via cable and satellite broadcasts. The transaction includes nine
full-power Spanish-language television stations.
Televisa is expected to put up Dollars 50m to acquire a 12 per cent stake in
Univision's television stations and 25 per cent of the network.
This move is seen as an attempt to strengthen its presence in broadcasting
north of the border.
In 1986, the company was forced to sell its profitable Spanish language
network of 12 television stations after the US Federal Communications
Commission accused it of controlling the stations in violation of foreign
ownership laws, which allow only a 20 per cent foreign interest in US
stations.
Televisa's television stations formed the basis of the Univision system, so
if this new deal goes through, the company will recover ground lost after
the 1986 sale.
Venevision, a Venezuelan broadcasting company, is also part of the
investment group bidding for Univision.

LAIDLAW, the Ontario waste services and school bus operator, boosted
quarterly earnings by 58 per cent, thanks to an improved contribution from
its interests in ADT, the Bermuda-based security and vehicle auction group,
and Attwoods, the waste management company.
Earnings from continuing operations rose to USDollars 28.2m, or 11 cents a
share, in the three months to February 29, the second quarter of Laidlaw's
fiscal year, from Dollars 17.8m, or 6 cents, a year earlier. Last year's
figure excludes a Dollars 15.1m charge, reflecting Laidlaw's share of losses
suffered by ADT.
Revenues edged up to Dollars 462.5m from Dollars 454.9m.
Equity earnings from ADT and Attwoods totalled Dollars 8.9m, compared with a
Dollars 3.3m loss a year earlier.
However, income from Laidlaw's own operations slipped to Dollars 53.4m, from
Dollars 54.2m, reflecting mainly the impact of the recession in the
waste-management business.
Hazardous waste margins fell to 11.8 per cent from 13.6 per cent, and solid
waste margins to 9.5 per cent from 10.5 per cent.
The company said that lower fuel prices had contributed to an improvement in
school bus operations.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) reported its fifth
consecutive quarter of record earnings yesterday.
The largest residential mortgage provider in the US made a profit of Dollars
381.6m in the first three months of the year, compared with the Dollars 320m
it earned at the same stage a year ago.
The first quarter was the busiest in the association's history in terms of
the number of loans Fannie Mae bought from mortgage originators and the
amount of mortgage-backed securities it subsequently sold to investors, the
combined volume of which totalled Dollars 55.6bn.
Previous record business volume was Dollars 41.7bn, recorded in the fourth
quarter of last year.
Three factors in particular had contributed to the increase in earnings
during the opening quarter, said Fannie Mae. The average net mortgage
balance rose Dollars 5.8bn, in spite of a near-record level of mortgage
portfolio liquidations, as homeowners took advantage of low interest rates
to refinance their mortgages.
A rise of 3 basis points in Fannie Mae's net interest margin to 145 basis
points also boosted earnings.
Thirdly, guaranty fee income from mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rose
Dollars 10.9m to Dollars 193.6m. The increase reflected a record amount of
total MBS issues (Dollars 41.2bn) and a jump in total MBS outstandings to
Dollars 389.9bn.
Fannie Mae did not completely escape the affects of the recent recession
during the first quarter, however. The company's acquisition of foreclosed
properties rose 17 per cent to 2,238, primarily because of difficulties in
the north-eastern states, where the economic slump has hit hardest.
Consequently, charge-offs to Fannie Mae's allowance for loan losses rose
slightly in the quarter to Dollars 56.7m, taking the total allowance for
loan losses to Dollars 727.3m.
Profits were boosted by a modest decline in administrative expenses, which
fell to Dollars 86.1m.

<TEXT>
DR Pepper/Seven-Up Com-panies, the third largest producer of soft drinks in
the US, is planning to float its shares on the stock market.
The Dallas-based company said yesterday that in two weeks it intended to
file the necessary registration statement for an 'initial public offering'
(IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities
industry watchdog.
The proceeds of the offer, which is expected to involve the issue of new
shares in the company, would be used to reduce debt and retire preferred
stock.
The company was formed through the merger of the Dr Pepper holding company
and Seven-Up in 1988. The combination created a third force to compete with
the two giants of the soft drinks industry, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.
Dr Pepper and Seven-Up were both purchased in 1986 by separate investment
groups, led by the same Dallas-based investment firm. Even prior to the
merger, management of the businesses was integrated to some extent, and
production was centralised.
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up currently employs around 905 people and has its
production operations in St Louis. Its corporate headquarters is in Dallas.
The company's turnover last year increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 600.9m,
while operating profits advanced to Dollars 138.2m, up 12 per cent on 1990.

PWA, the parent of Canadian Airlines International, is seeking CDollars 200m
(USDollars 169.5m) cash in return for selling 25 per cent of the airline to
American Airlines.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of PWA and the airline, said in Toronto that
effective control of Canadian Airlines would remain in Canada, in spite of
pooling of computer resources and ground personnel.
He was confident AMR, parent of American, was ready 'to consider an equity
infusion of more than CDollars 200m to Canadian Airlines in exchange for the
25 per cent interest and the right to provide management services'.
Analysts had estimated Mr Eyton would seek about CDollars 100m in new equity
for Canadian. Both companies are now in negotiations.
Mr Eyton said PWA's common shareholders would be favourably affected because
it would be Canadian Airlines issuing new Treasury shares to American in
return for the cash infusion and 'a comprehensive strategic alliance'.
'We cannot be absolutely sure the deal with American will be finalised, and
that is why we're negotiating with our lenders to double our operating
credit lines to CDollars 400m,' said Mr Eyton.
He estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 ground workers would lose their
jobs, but there would be no impact on pilots, flight attendants, counter
staff, and the maintenance base in Vancouver.

BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), the large Spanish commercial bank, has agreed to
buy the Royal Bank of Puerto Rico, the Royal Bank of Canada's Puerto Rico
affiliate, in yet another strong Spanish move into the US dependency's
financial sector.
BBV officials yesterday said that a price for Royal Bank of Canada's network
of 17 branches on the island was still being negotiated. It is likely to be
merged with BBV Puerto Rico's 10-branch commercial banking network.
BBV said it wanted to increase its presence in Puerto Rico in order to make
it a regional centre for banking business in the Caribbean, Miami, Mexico
and Panama.
Spanish institutions have begun to take a great interest in Puerto Rico in
the past few years. Banco Santander now owns three banks on the island, with
about 80 branches in all, and is the second largest banking presence in the
dependency.
In 1990, Mapfre, Spain's biggest insurance group, paid Dollars 100m for
Praico, the island's biggest insurer.

<TEXT>
MR Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of Skandia, has long held an ambition to
turn the Swedish insurance group into a pan-Nordic giant by forging close
links with insurers in the region.
Under his leadership, Skandia has built up its position in the Nordic
markets through a series of strategic acquisitions in Denmark and Norway and
share exchanges with Pohjola, Finland's leading insurer.
However, much to Mr Wolrath's chagrin, over the last 18 months his well-laid
plans have met obstacles in the shape of various unwanted Nordic suitors -
in particular Hafnia, the Danish insurer, and Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian
insurance group, who snapped up shares in Skandia last autumn.
The conclusion yesterday of an agreement in principle with Hafnia and Uni
Storebrand after months of negotiations means that Skandia can get on with
pursuing its pan-Nordic strategy. In future, Mr Wolrath said, the group
would concentrate on consumer life and non-life business.
Skandia said that following the Hafnia acquisition it would have 20 per cent
of the direct non-life insurance business in Denmark, 15 per cent in Norway,
and 23 per cent in Sweden. It would also have 11 per cent of the life
business in Denmark and 32 per cent of the life in Sweden.
The deal also helps Skandia build up its position in the important UK
market: Hafnia owns Prolific, a life company, and Economic, a general
insurance company. Skandia plans to merge Economic with its own UK motor
insurance operations - known as NIG Skandia - but said that Prolific would
operate in parallel with Skandia Life, its own UK life business.
Although Skandia was eager to highlight the advantages of acquiring Hafnia,
privately, executives admit Hafnia was really Skandia's second choice of
partner. Originally, it was intent on forging close links with another
Danish insurer - Baltica - which it felt was better managed and more similar
to Skandia.
However, Skandia was forced to consider a tie-up with Hafnia after attempts
by Sweden's leading commercial bank, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, to
establish a closer relationship with Skandia fell through.
SE-Banken bought an option on 28.2 per cent of the shares in Skandia in
October 1990, hoping to persuade the insurance group to help create a large
financial services concern.
Skandia rejected SEB's overtures and the bank then sold its shareholding to
Hafnia and Uni Storebrand last autumn, to the annoyance of Mr Wolrath.
Under the terms of yesterday's deal, however, Skandia hopes Uni Storebrand
will agree to reduce its shareholding in Skandia from 28 per cent to 4 per
cent.
According to the agreement in principle, Uni Storebrand's shares in Skandia
will be offered to shareholders in Hafnia and, in exchange, Uni Storebrand
will acquire Skandia's troubled reinsurance operations outside North
America.

FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Industry recovery helps lift
Total net 42% to FFr5.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TOTAL, the world's eighth largest oil group, yesterday attributed a 42 per
cent rise in group annual profits to a sharp recovery in refining and
chemicals.
Net profits at the French state-controlled group rose from FFr4.1bn (Dollars
730m) in 1990 to FFr5.8bn last year, confirming the group's January
estimate. Turnover was up by 11.4 per cent, from FFr128.4bn to FFr143bn,
over the same period, due to a rise in volumes, said Mr Serge Tchuruk,
chairman.
This contrasts with the 7.5 per cent net profits decline at Elf Aquitaine,
Total's larger state-controlled rival, over the same period. The difference
reflected Total's larger exposure to refining and distribution, which
accounted for nearly half of its operating profits last year, against a
quarter of Elf's operating earnings.
Total's operating profits rose 30 per cent to FFr10.3bn last year.
With European demand for refined products strong, the refining and
distribution division's operating profits rose 63 per cent to FFr4.9bn.
Total makes two thirds of its refining sales in Europe, where capacity was
practically saturated, said Mr Tchuruk. He expected little fresh European
capacity to open in the near future because of concerns about environmental
impact. At the same time, demand for refined products from southern and
eastern Europe was likely to grow.
Total's operating profits in exploration and production fell slightly, from
FFr3bn to FFr2.9bn, as margins were squeezed by the fall in oil prices.
Profits in the trading division stagnated at FFr1bn, while chemicals'
operating earnings rose from FFr900m to FFr1.5bn.
Proven reserves rose by 3.8 per cent last year, to 513m tonnes of oil
equivalent. This was led by a 16 per cent expansion outside the Middle East,
where it is the largest western oil producer. Currently, just short of 60
per cent of Total's reserves are in the region.
Although it plans to continue expansion beyond the Middle East, Total would
also increase reserves in the region, said Mr Tchuruk.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), the commercial banking group
owned by some of France's biggest banks, recovered last year by boosting net
profits from FFr8m (Dollars 1.42m) in 1990 to FFr115m in 1991, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
The bank said it had benefited from a radical restructuring which included
heavy investment in technology.
BFCE's net banking income rose from FFr1.84bn in 1990 to FFr2.04bn in 1991,
while gross operating profits were up from FFr401m to FFr671m. The group's
total balance sheet was reduced from FFr239.4bn to FFr218.2bn.
The cover rate on its sovereign risks was raised from 51 per cent to 60 per
cent. Broken down, it was 60 per cent cover for most debtor countries and 35
per cent for the states within the former Soviet Union. BFCE's Cooke ratio
increased from 7.3 per cent to 8.1 per cent.
Assurance Generales de France, a large insurance group, is the biggest
shareholder in BFCE, with a 43 per cent stake.

Norish, the Irish-based food services group, reported a recovery in the 1991
year with pre-tax profits up from IPounds 1.47m to IPounds 2.2m (Pounds

The disposal of the trading assets of the distribution business during 1990

Earnings per share rose from 12.3p to 17.14p and the final dividend is

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL costs have again hit Britannia Group, the Cheltenham-based
construction concern. But this time they led to a loss and the omission of
the final dividend.
For 1991 the profit slumped from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 410,000. The
provision for the diminution in land stocks was cut to Pounds 775,000
(Pounds 1.2m) and there were reorganisation costs of Pounds 325,000 (nil);
that led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 690,000 (profit Pounds 631,000).
Losses per share came to 5p (earnings 3.5p). When announcing a cut in the
interim dividend to 1p (1.9p) directors said they intended to pay a final
(1.1p) - but they now considered that inappropriate.
Total turnover fell to Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 36.9m).
Rental income arising on development and investment properties was affected
by the insolvency of two tenants. The development company was disposing of
its land stocks with the exception of the site at Quedgeley, Gloucester, and
its holdings at Rugby.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: 'Bloody nose' at Dowding &amp; Mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFECTS of recession around the world hit Dowding &amp; Mills, the
electrical and mechanical repair group, which reported a 28 per cent drop in
interim profits, from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 3.7m.
'We are in recession and we are taking a bloody nose,' said Mr Jim Cole,
chief executive. 'But I think we have performed in the depth of this
recession better than many other companies have in the good times.'
Outlook for the second half remained uncertain, however. 'January to March
have returned to the miserable levels we experienced last year,' he said.
'We see absolutely no sign of an upturn in the UK and in most parts of the
world.'
Turnover fell from Pounds 41m to Pounds 38m for the six months to December
31. Mr Cole said the group had maintained gross margins, despite the drop in
demand.
Decline in sales was felt almost equally across the group's geographical
regions. Dowding, which rewinds and calibrates engines among other
activities, operates in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and
Australia. Expanding its international presence - overseas sales account for
about 18 per cent of turnover - was one of the main reasons behind its
unsuccessful bid for niche engineer Torday &amp; Carlisle last year.
The Pounds 632,000 costs of the failed takeover were taken below the line.
Dowding still holds 8.7 per cent of Torday. Mr Cole said the group would
retain the stake, keeping its options open until Torday's annual results are
published in the summer.
Interest charges were 10 times covered at Pounds 382,000 (Pounds 331,000).
Mr Cole said Dowding retained a strong balance sheet with gearing at 22 per
cent.
Earnings per share fell from 2.46p to 1.76p. The dividend is increased 'in
line with inflation,' from 0.88p to 0.92p.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Three Harland arms up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARLAND SIMON, the control systems specialist rocked by a profits warning in
February, yesterday confirmed that it was seeking buyers for three
subsidiaries in a move to cut borrowings and concentrate on mainstream
businesses.
Mr David Mahony, who returned as chairman following the resignation of Mr
Roy Ashman, said negotiations were at an 'advanced stage' for the sale of
Vickerys, which makes blades and screens for the water and paper industries.
NEF, a Swedish subsidiary, and Pro-Aqua, involved in water control, are also
being targeted for sale. Following the disposals, Harland will focus on its
electrical and electronic businesses.
Harland's shares rallied 15p to 94p on the news. The shares have collapsed
from 585p in February.
Several institutional shareholders liquidated their holdings following the
profits warning, which also revealed provisions of Pounds 750,000 to cover
disputed payments due from two companies controlled by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell. Mr Ashman resigned following the profits warning. Mr Mahony said
that despite the fall in the share price, Harland had not run into trading
difficulties.
In June Harland is due to announce results for the year to March 31. Hoare
Govett, the company's broker, has cut its forecast from Pounds 13m to Pounds
4m.
Vickerys made operating profits in excess of Pounds 1m in the year to March
31 from turnover of Pounds 11m. However, NEF and Pro-Aqua are expected to
incur combined losses of Pounds 700,000 for the period.
Proceeds from any sales will be used to reduce borrowings, which have
increased from Pounds 3.3m a year ago to about Pounds 13m. Most of the
increase is due to last year's Pounds 7m-worth of acquisitions.
Mr Mahony said Harland's relationship with Perfect Information, an on-line
news cuttings service with links to Mr Ashman, was 'under review'. Harland
owns a Pounds 600,000 debenture in PI which, if converted, is equal to 18
per cent of the company's equity. Harland's pension scheme also has an
investment of Pounds 500,000 in the service.
He said PI was now 'making progress', despite a warning in February that
delays and start-up costs would reduce profits due to Harland by Pounds 3m.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: International expansion for Amec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC, the construction and engineering group which announced a Pounds 9.9m
pre-tax loss yesterday, said it would use some of its Pounds 76.7m cash to
expand on the Continent, in the Middle East and in south-east Asia via a new
headquarters in Hong Kong.
Mr Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said the proportion of group turnover derived
from outside the UK was set to rise from just over 20 per cent in 1991 to 30
per cent this year.
In building and civil engineering operating profit fell from Pounds 30.3m to
Pounds 24.2m on turnover of Pounds 772m (Pounds 865m). Mr John Early,
finance director, said the order book was down 5 per cent overall since the
beginning of 1991. Commercial work declined by 30 per cent and now only
accounted for 10 per cent of the total, whereas the fall-off was slight in
industrial and public sector work.
Mechanical and electrical engineering made Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 38.6m)
profit on Pounds 1.41bn (Pounds 1.2bn) turnover. Orders had fallen by 10 per
cent. and the proportion of commercial work declined from 16 to 9 per cent.
Housing and property increased its loss from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 11.3m.
Rationalisation included cutting the regional organisation from 10 units to
six.
The diluted loss per share figure of 3.2p counted convertible preference
shares as equity. Taking it as debt, the basic loss per share was 11.9p (or
11.8p of earnings before the exceptional costs), compared with earnings of
20.8p.
COMMENT
It proved to be a good PR move for Amec to bring out results nities for
favourable comparisons included a maintained dividend, cash in the bank,
housing land valued conservatively at 20 per cent of selling prices (as
opposed to 30 per cent) and no Channel tunnel involvement. Throw in some
reassurance about the resilience of off-shore work, through refurbishment,
and the welcome international expansion and Amec might be classed as one of
the few buys in the building sector. This sentiment was reflected in an 11p
rise in the share price to 149p (still well below the 200p rights issue
price a year ago). The yield is attractive at just over 9 per cent. On a
Pounds 45m pre-tax profit forecast the prospective p/e is less than 16 on
the unfavourable basic earnings figures. But recovery potential is a bit
awkward to assess because of lingering doubts about a late-cycle downturn in
long-term contracting. For those braving this sector, it looks a quality
stock.

Mr Robert Birchall of the Bristol office of Cork Gully has been appointed

The main trading company within the group is Isis Construction, which
specialises in commercial and industrial building work. It has a turnover of

The other two companies are relatively small; Wessex Guild, a maker of
architectural metalwork, with turnover of Pounds 3m employing 25 staff and
Isis Pneumatics, which has turnover of Pounds 4m and about 50 employees.
Mr Birchall said the group had been in difficulties for some time. There had

not been concluded.
Shares in Isis, an over-the counter stock, were last dealt in June 1991 at

For the third year in succession William Sindall, the builder, civil
engineer and property developer, had to provide for exceptional charges.
That forced it into a loss of Pounds 4.19m for 1991, from a profit of Pounds
1.69m. The final dividend is omitted, leaving the total at 1.5p, against 6p.
Mr John Mott, chairman, said the exceptional charges reflected 'the
continuing ravages' of the prolonged recession on asset values and work
prospects. This time they amounted to Pounds 5m (Pounds 1.25m) and comprised
redundancy and closure costs totalling Pounds 517,000, and a write-down of
the carrying value of housing and developments to Pounds 4.67m.
Turnover fell to Pounds 64m (Pounds 85.5m) and operating profit to Pounds
2.4m (Pounds 4.48m). Rental income held up better than forecast, at Pounds
1.37m (Pounds 1.38m).
Losses per share were 64.5p (earnings 14.37p).

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Whatman knocked by US recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US recession was blamed by Whatman, the specialist paper and filtration
equipment maker, for a 16 per cent fall, from Pounds 11m to Pounds 9.2m, in
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31.
More than 60 per cent of the group's Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 44.6m) turnover is
US-based. The UK accounts for just 17 per cent with the rest in continental
Europe and the Far East.
A strong performance from miro-filtration products in North America shielded
the group from the worst effects of the US downturn.
Mr Hugh Perrott, finance director, said: 'A worst economic background than
we had experienced was partly offset by gains from our new focused products
where we had increased investment.'
Reorganisation costs of Pounds 300,000, relating to the discontinuation of
manufacturing filter systems, was taken above the line.
A net interest charge of Pounds 378,000, compared with net interest income
of Pounds 733,000, mainly due to tax increases in Japan and the US. Earnings
per share fell from 33.1p to 26.6p.
While capital expenditure fell from Pounds 10m to Pounds 4.7m, marketing and
product development expenditure is expected to rise as a proportion of sales
over the current year.
The final dividend is increased to 5.8p making a total of 8.7p compared with
7.75p. Mr Perrott said the group aimed to increase the dividend steadily.

Films

<TEXT>
MAJESTIC FILMS, the British film distribution company that put up half the
finance for the hit film Dances With Wolves and has been involved with more
than 20 feature films, including Henry V and Driving Miss Daisy, has sold a
majority stake to RCS Video of Italy.
RCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rizzoli-Corriere Sera, the large Italian
publisher which has been expanding in the European media.
The London company - to be renamed Majestic Films &amp; Television International
 -plans to expand, particularly in the production and distribution of
television programmes. Its latest project is Maxwell: The Outsider, a
two-hour film for television based on Mr Tom Bower's biography which will be
shot during the summer for showing at Christmas.
Mr Guy East, the former head of sales at Goldcrest and founder of Majestic
in 1988, will become chief executive and will retain a significant minority
stake in the venture. He declined to say what the deal was worth or what his
residual stake would be, but he said it was wise to have a relationship with
one of the most powerful groups in European media. Mr Paolo Glisenti,
managing director of RCS Video, becomes Majestic chairman.
The deal will give Majestic an entree into Italy and the London-based
company will also distribute films and television programmes in which RCS
has an interest.
RCS also has small minority stakes in Carlton Television, which won the
London weekday ITV licence, TF1, the French broadcaster, and Carolco, the
independent US film studio.

FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ramsden's bets on HK biting into its batter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HARRY RAMSDEN'S, Yorkshire's premier fish and chip operator, is betting on
Hong Kong Chinese taking a liking to its secret batter with the announcement
of a new joint venture in the colony.
The first overseas Harry Ramsden's is being set up, complete with
chandeliers, in Wanchai, formerly known for its Suzie Wong girlie bars but
now an up-and-coming business district.
Ramsden's has a one third stake in the venture, Bluelane, which also holds
the franchise for the Asia-Pacific region. Other partners include Mr Andrew
Bull, a concert promoter, and a garment trading company.
The UK company has been trying to break into Hong Kong since 1990, but has
only now found the right site, a 6,600 sq ft and 200-seat restaurant being
leased from Mr Gordon Wu, chairman of Hopewell Holdings and best known for
building power stations and roads in southern China.
Mr John Barnes, Ramsden's chairman, said haddock will be the main fish on
offer. But the company has been experimenting with garoupa and pomfret,
which are plentiful in the South China Sea and taste 'really quite good', he
said.
Bluelane is looking at Singapore next and also has hopes for New Zealand and
Japan.

FT  10 APR 92 / Cash from across the sea / The US as a source of long-term
funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A casual observer of the corporate finance scene may think UK companies have
gone into hibernation. The spree of rights issues seen last year has dried
up, public bond issues are increasingly rare and the syndicated loans market
is moribund.
But a stream of UK companies are crossing the Atlantic to find the type of
long-term funding not available at home. This week Pilkington, Tate &amp; Lyle
and Senior Engineering are in the market. Last week, deals closed for Lucas
Industries and Harrisons &amp; Crosfield.
Over the last two years the list of UK companies which have tapped the US
private placement market included big names: Trafalgar House, Allied Lyons,
Rank Organisation, NFC, Cookson and Bowater. The reason is simple: the US
private placement market is one of the few remaining sources of long-term
committed debt finance.
Banks are increasingly unwilling to make unsecured loans of more than five
years, and will only do so at a punitive cost.
The public Eurobond market remains open to large companies but investors are
also wary of buying bonds of more than 10-years maturity. US institutional
investors are still prepared to buy corporate bonds of up to 20-years
maturity.
It is also doubtful whether a company the size of Dawson Group, the
commercial vehicles company, or Ransomes, the engineering and property
development group, could launch a public Eurobond issue. Yet both have
raised debt finance from private placements in the US.
Private placements can often be structured to match the borrowers'
requirements: for example, a Dollars 260m (Pounds 149m) placement for
Trafalgar House in 1990 comprised securities of between seven years and 17
years maturities. The pattern of maturities was designed to match
depreciation charges on Trafalgar's fleet of ships.
Many UK companies are using the proceeds of US debt placements to repay less
reliable sources of funding. Lucas Industries used the proceeds of its
Dollars 100m 12-year placement to repay most of its US commercial paper
borrowings. The company's short-term credit rating is under review for
possible downgrade by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the big US credit
rating agencies. Normally Lucas would see its cost of funds increase, but
all but Dollars 30m of the commercial paper has been repaid. Similarly, Rank
Organisation used the proceeds of a Dollars 200m debt placement last year to
repay auction-market preferred shares (AMPS) when a downgrading threatened
to increase its cost of funds.
Buyers of private placements are also concerned with credit quality. In
fact, US institutions buying long-term, largely illiquid, debt securities
are highly sensitive to credit risk.
Some UK companies have found that funding was simply not available on
acceptable terms. For example, Dixons, the electrical retailer, withdrew
plans for a US debt placement last year because investors were demanding a
higher return than it was prepared to offer.
According to Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director responsible for private
placements with Wertheim Schroder in New York, the quality of debt analysis
by US institutions is generally higher than in the more equity-oriented UK
market. Investment regulations which have forced US institutions to buy
bonds rather than equities have bred an investment culture receptive to
long-term debt securities.
UK accounting standards are at least adjacent to the US but for UK
companies, the accounting and disclosure requirements of US securities
regulators can be a headache. For this reason most placements by UK
companies have not been made under the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rule 144a, which gives overseas companies greater access to the US capital
markets. Bonds placed under rule 144a can be traded, but only between
qualified investment institutions. In return, borrowers are exempt from many
of reporting requirements applied to issuers of public securities.
The small number of US institutions willing to buy private placements means
that liquidity is very limited even under rule 144a. Any slight saving for
the borrower in cost of funds is outweighed by additional financial
disclosure requirements.
One drawback is that covenants demanded by US institutions can be
restrictive. As with most bank lending agreements, interest cover and core
borrowing limits are normal. But US institutions also demand 'event risk'
put options, which give them the right to retrieve their cash in case of a
takeover bid.
The biggest limitation to the future growth of the market could be the small
number of US institutions willing to buy cross-border placements. Around
3,000 US institutions are qualified to buy private placements under SEC
regulations, but only 300 have done so. Just 50 of these will buy bonds
placed by overseas corporations.
However, last year the US private placement market amounted to Dollars 160bn
with overseas companies accounting for around 10 per cent of the total
raised, compared with 2 per cent in the late 1980s.

FT  10 APR 92 / BAe arms subsidiary buys Astracompany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL ORDNANCE, the armaments subsidiary of British Aerospace, has
consolidated its hold on the UK munitions business by buying BMARC, the
largest trading arm of Astra Holdings, which went into receivership two
months ago.
The purchase is understood to involve a payment of just under Pounds 10m,
which will go to paying Astra's Pounds 50m bank debt.
The agreement announced yesterday comes after a week of negotiations by the
receivers, Cork Gully. Royal Ordnance won the deal over several bidders
including the French state-controlled arms company Giat Industries and an
attempted management buy-out.
BMARC, based in Lincolnshire, makes guns and ammunition. Astra bought BMARC
for Pounds 35m from Swiss arms company Oerlikon-Buehrle in 1988. Astra was
put into receivership on February 3, and BMARC the following day, after the
failure of a five-bank consortium to agree on restructuring Astra's debt.
The acquisition is expected to come under scrutiny by the Office of Fair
Trading as it will make Royal Ordnance the sole UK supplier of
medium-calibre ammunition, but the group will defend it on the grounds of
the Ministry of Defence's policy of encouraging international competition
for procurement contracts.
The purchase is expected to increase Royal Ordance's estimated share of the
world market for medium-calibre guns and ammunition from 7 per cent to 13
per cent.
BMARC, which has continued to trade since receivership, is expected to have
sales of about Pounds 25m this year. Royal Ordnance said Oerlikon-Buehrle
had agreed to continue licensing arrangements covering a range of products
and collaboration on future projects.
BMARC - formerly British Manufacturing and Research Company - was set up
before the Second World War by the British government and Hispano Suiza.
Oerlikon-Buehrle bought it in 1971.
Astra purchased the company as a main plank of an ambitious plan to become a
competitor to Royal Ordnance as a munitions supplier. But it had to contend
with interim arrangements guaranteeing Royal Ordnance a large share of
Ministry of Defence purchases.
Astra announced a Pounds 3.5 pre-tax loss for the six months to September
30.
Cork Gully said Astra still had substantial assets in US companies as well
as its other main trading subsidiary, the pyrotechnics company Haley and
Weller.

FT  10 APR 92 / O&amp;Y poised to replace Johnson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the financially stretched Canadian property
group, is close to appointing a senior businessman to replace Mr Tom Johnson
as president.
Earlier this week, O&amp;Y was contemplating leaving the post of president empty
after Mr Johnson's imminent departure, so that Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's
founder, would be in complete control.
However, yesterday it emerged a replacement is likely.
Mr Johnson, the senior banker brought in as president only two weeks ago,
returned to his home in New Jersey on Friday. He is in talks with O&amp;Y over
whether he will have a continuing role at the company and whether he should
be compensated for loss of office.
Sources close to the negotiations between Mr Johnson and O&amp;Y said the rift
between the two stemmed in part from a disagreement over the terms of Mr
Johnson's contract, including how much and when he should be paid.
Mr Steve Miller, a partner in James D Wolfensohn, the US investment bank, is
expected to replace Mr Johnson as chairman of O&amp;Y's planning and finance
committee, which is drafting the plan to restructure O&amp;Y's debt of more than
Dollars 20bn. Mr Miller has been taking the lead in formulating the
reconstruction plan.
Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong
magnate, will be in Toronto next Tuesday for talks with O&amp;Y and its bankers.
Mr Li, who forged a partnership with O&amp;Y late last year in a New York office
building, has expressed interest in buying some of the assets likely to be
put up for sale.
Besides property holdings, these include controlling interests in several
large Canadian natural resource companies.
An O&amp;Y spokesman said yesterday a separate meeting with representatives of
about 100 of the company's bank lenders was scheduled to go ahead amid
strict security in Toronto's Sheraton Centre on Monday. Between 200 to 300
people are expected to attend the meeting.
Mr Johnson, who was formerly president of Manufacturers Hanover, was brought
into O&amp;Y at the suggestion of the company's main lenders to support the two
Reichmann brothers, Paul and Albert.

FT  10 APR 92 / German hopes of peaceful pay round suffer public sector blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government hopes for a peaceful pay round and spending restraint
suffered a setback yesterday as employers rejected an arbitration proposal
for a 5.4 per cent wage rise for west Germany's 3m public sector workers.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister responsible for federal and local
government wage policy, was joined by private sector employers and other
government politicians in a chorus of protest.
'The arbitrators' suggestion fails to take account of current economic
conditions and therefore cannot be a basis for agreement,' Mr Seiters said.
Mr Hermann-Otto Solms, leader of the Free Democrat parliamentary group, said
the offer was not acceptable. It would cost federal and state budgets an
additional DM20bn (Pounds 7bn) a year, he claimed.
The non-binding proposal, put forward after a seven to six vote in favour,
included extra payments totalling DM750 a head. The employers' final offer
in the six-day conciliation talks consisted of 5 per cent from April plus
DM400 back-pay.
'Anyone who thinks that is too little must go on strike,' said Mr Friedrich
Zimmermann, the employer-nominated negotiator.
Officials of the OTV and DAG unions, which represent most of the workforce,
said they had gone to the limits of their flexibility. If the employers did
not improve their offer when formal negotiations resumed on Monday, they
would hold strike ballots.
The last public sector strike, in 1974, stopped virtually all public
services for three days.
The overall 'compromise' package for the public sector is lower than the
6.34 per cent steelworkers' award, agreed earlier this year. It is, however,
similar to the 5.8 per cent deal offered to bank staff last weekend by
employers which enjoyed record profits last year.
Engineering employers, currently negotiating with unions pressing for a 9.5
per cent increase for 4m workers, said yesterday that the offer was too
high, and could not be read as an indicator of what they could pay. The
public sector award, the first agreed in last year's pay round, set the
pattern for subsequent negotiations, in which the engineers won a 6.7 per
cent basic increase.
This year, however, engineering companies have said the increase should be
based on expected productivity rises of about 2.5 per cent. West German
inflation last month reached 4.7 per cent, and is widely expected to peak at
around 5 per cent in June.
The last stages of negotiations for the building industry, the strongest
sector in the German economy at present, opened in Frankfurt yesterday with
unions, demanding 9.8 per cent, faced with a 3.4 per cent offer.
In Bavaria, the longest strike in German history ended yesterday as 260
granite quarry workers voted to return to work after a stoppage lasting 301
days.

FT  10 APR 92 / Black Sea fleet compromise agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEVASTOPOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE and Russia averted a clash over the future of the Black Sea fleet
yesterday by suspending their unilateral claims to the former Soviet Union's
most powerful warm-water naval force.
The compromise was negotiated by telephone between Ukrainian President
Leonid Kravchuk and Mr Boris Yeltsin, his Russian counterpart.
It followed a day of acute tension in Sevastopol, the fleet's headquarters
in the Crimea. Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the fleet's commander, revealed that
he had deployed armoured personnel carriers to patrol the streets following
rumours of a Ukrainian attack. The carriers have now returned to base.
The fleet personnel is made up largely of Ukrainians although its command is
mainly Russian. Crimea itself was once part of Russia and is now a district
of Ukraine.
Conflict over the fleet has marked a low point in increasingly hostile
relations between Ukraine and Russia, the two most powerful members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. Ukraine had threatened to leave the CIS
over the issue, it emerged.
The row has caused anxiety among western leaders concerned about the former
Soviet Union's nuclear capacity. In Brussels yesterday, Nato officials said
the alliance had told Moscow and Kiev of 'serious allied concerns' about
Ukraine's decision to suspend the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to
Russia for destruction as previously agreed.
It said in a statement that the transfer of all such weapons to Russia
should be completed by the agreed deadline of July 1.
However the Ukrainian parliament yesterday ratified the government's
decision not to hand over its tactical weapons to Russia for destruction
until satisfactory international guarantees were in place.
Ukrainian authorities and the commander of the fleet announced the agreement
on the Black Sea fleet yesterday. A commission will be set up to negotiate
the division of the fleet between the two Slavic giants. Ukrainian and
Russian foreign ministers are due to meet in the next few days to discuss
the issue.
Earlier this week, Mr Kravchuk claimed jurisdiction over the entire fleet.
Mr Yeltsin responded with a decree also laying claim to the fleet, numbering
350 ships, including 45 battleships, more than 150 aircraft, and 28
submarines with nuclear capacity.
The fleet is strategically important because of its nuclear capacity and
because of its access to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It was
traditionally, in the former Soviet Union, a counterbalance to the US Sixth
Fleet in the Mediterranean.
Only 1 per cent of Black Sea fleet sailors had sworn an oath of allegiance
to Ukraine, according to the admiral. But Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, a member of
the Ukrainian negotiating team, said 70 per cent of sailors would like to
swear allegiance to Ukraine.
Symbols were at the heart of the compromise between the two states. Admiral
Kasatonov confirmed that Mr Yeltsin's order to hoist the Russian tricolour
over the ships of the Black Sea fleet had been suspended. The fleet still
flies the old Soviet naval flag, which Admiral Kasatonov acknowledged was
inappropriate since the Soviet Union no longer existed.
The Ukrainians said the second article of the Ukrainian presidential decree,
which provided for the creation of a Ukrainian navy based on the fleet, has
been temporarily rescinded.
Mr Pavlychko said that the compromise was the result of Ukrainian
brinkmanship.

London's City University has a new research fellow in Jewish Music. Or
rather it has what is claimed to be the first research fellow in the world
in this specialist area, with a brief stretching from liturgical music of
the 12th century to Broadway musicals. And all thanks to Joe Loss, the band
leader.
Joe Loss - for many decades a familiar figure in nightclubs and a reassuring
sound over the radio waves - died last year. His family is financing the
research fellowship in his memory.
The first Joe Loss fellow is to be Alexander Knapp, formerly of Wolfson
College, Cambridge, a synagogue cantor and an expert on the Judeo-Hispanic
ballade. He will be expected to lecture on the Jewish Foundations of
Christian Liturgy - as well as handle the third year option on Tin Pan

Australian ballet-goers wishing to see the Sydney Opera House's performance
of Giselle right through, had better know Adolphe Adam's score
note-for-note.
They look likely to have to sing along to keep the dancers going; the
orchestra is threatening to stage a strike mid-way.
The musicians complain that their pit is too small and too noisy even though
it was renovated earlier this year. While it has room for only 65, they say,
the management often requires 70 or more of them to squeeze in.
They are also afraid that their hearing will be damaged by excessive noise
levels, says Carla Thackrah, a flautist with the Australian Opera and Ballet
Orchestra.
So far, the opera house's governing trust seems to have done little to avert
the unscheduled interval. General manager Lloyd Martin has confined himself
to reminding the orchestra of the dangers of causing discord with patrons.
The best hope perhaps lies in compromise.
After all, if the musicians would agree to delay their stoppage until within
five minutes from the end of Giselle, the management could pretend they had
switched to playing the American composer John Cage's 'Four minutes, 33
seconds' in which the performer makes no sound at all.

The Morning Star seems a slightly off-beat publication for a City
scribbler's thoughts on the economy. But Neil MacKinnon, chief European
economist at Japanese securities house Yamaichi, is spread across one and a
half pages of that worthy organ this week - with an interview he says he
gave the paper before the budget.
'They just rang me up out of the blue. I was rather taken aback actually,
but I have no rule that I speak only to the FT.' When Observer raised the
matter with the Morning Star, it said that his analysis was in several
respects sympathetic to its own editorial line.
MacKinnon is a Labour party member and has been advising, 'very informally',
John Smith and Gordon Brown on matters economic.
The main point of the interview is to highlight the familiar dangers of the
'fiscal time bomb' he alleges chancellor Norman Lamont has created for
himself. The Yamaichi economist's views on devaluation emerge clearly too.
John Smith may have firmly ruled out devaluing the pound, but his 'informal'
adviser appears to think otherwise.
While acknowledging the onus on a Labour chancellor to appear 'whiter than
white' to financial markets, MacKinnon argues: 'I think there must be a
devaluation at some stage.'

FT  10 APR 92 / Observer: Kohl's belt tightener
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The great pear, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl is known in impolite Rhineside
society, yesterday struck an exemplary blow against inflation and came down
heavily on the side of belt-tightening.
Starting his Easter hols in Hofgastein, Austria, he has forsworn not just
his favourite dish of Saumagen (stuffed stomach), but also pork, dumplings
and beer for a whole fortnight. For the first week of his annual fast, he
will consume only tea and mineral water.
His reward comes in the second week, when he lets his hair down and allows
himself milk and two dry rolls a day.
The reward for those who have to live with the man, grumpy even when he is
well-fed, is the prospect of a slenderised chancellor returning for the
spring and summer term ready to get his teeth into an opposition also
tenderised by last weekend's elections.
The great man can be counted on not to overdo his diet; he needs plenty of
weight if he is to throw it around effectively in a tensely combative
domestic arena.
His starting weight is a state secret, but his trainers claim that last year
a similar regime helped him cast off 16 lb of his then 230 lb bulk.

FT  10 APR 92 / Letter: CBI concerned at penal rent liabilities arising from
assigned leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir JOHN BANHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Tenants squeezed', April 6) raises an important problem
that will worsen given the current recession and the massive over-supply of
commercial property.
The CBI receives daily complaints from people facing demands for rent for
property they assigned, with the landlord's consent and often many years
ago, because the present tenant cannot pay. Small businesses are being
forced into bankruptcy and their owners into penury (and sometimes illness)
through no fault of their own. In the worst cases, landlords have allowed
many months of arrears to build up, and made no serious attempt to force the
present tenant to pay. Some tenants continue to use the premises rent free.
For if the landlord pursues the forfeiture procedure he would, if
successful, then be unable to claim rent from the previous tenants.
This cannot be right. In 1988, following a two-year review, the Law
Commission recommended urgent reform. But nothing has happened. The CBI
supports the compromise proposed by the Law Commission: tenants should only
guarantee the covenants of their immediate successor. We proposed that the
landlord would retain a right to indemnity from the previous tenant for 10
years and provided there are not material changes to the property, only if
he:
notifies the previous tenant he proposes to hold responsible for the rent
within one month of the current tenant defaulting;
secures vacant possession for that previous tenant if the latter wishes; and
if he
advises that previous tenant of the name and address of the other previous
tenants (if any) who are equally liable to contribute to unpaid rent.
VAT liability is also concerning tenants. Since 1989, landlords have been
able to charge VAT on commercial rents. Should the tenant go bankrupt, or
not pay for over one year, the landlord may deduct the unpaid VAT from his
output liability.
However, the previous tenant would be liable for the VAT and be unable to
claim recovery as the payment was not for services received. This again
cannot be right.
CBI members accept that many long leases of major properties are held as
pension fund investments. They realise that rents were fixed after indemnity
provided by previous tenants. But our Common Market partners (and Scotland)
do not similarly penalise tenants. The proposals put forward by the Law
Commission and the CBI strike a fair balance between landlord and tenant.
The Lord Chancellor should consider them, and urgently.

FT  10 APR 92 / With western help, a wing and a prayer: Efforts to
restructure the former Soviet Union's civil aviation industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aeroflot, the world's biggest but probably most inefficient airline, was
already in deep trouble before the break-up of the Soviet Union. Not for
nothing was it nicknamed Aeroflop. Its problems have now multiplied.
Only months before the collapse of the Soviet Union, senior officials of the
aviation ministry in Moscow approached British Airways with a proposal to
reshape the airline into a competitive western-style international carrier.
BA had started discussions with Moscow in 1987 on how best to develop the
airline business in the former Soviet Union. Several ideas, including the
total overhaul of Aeroflot, were assessed, and rejected as being beyond
local management capabilities.
Instead, BA agreed in October 1990 to invest Pounds 20m for a 31 per cent
stake in a joint venture with Aeroflot and other Soviet partners to create
an international airline called Air Russia and transform Moscow's decrepit
Domodedovo airport into an international hub.
The project has survived the political and economic upheavals that have
shaken the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) during the past 12
months. Mr John Borkowski, BA's head of strategy, expects Air Russia to
start flying with a fleet of seven Boeing 767 airliners in 1994. The idea
continues to be to create what he calls a 'luxury airline' operating
international services out of the Domodedovo hub.
Such plans should probably be treated with scepticism. Aeroflot, like other
CIS institutions, is in turmoil. Since the beginning of this year, the
carrier's domestic operations have been dismembered among its republican and
regional directorates. By the end of February, each of its 34 operational
divisions had registered as a separate airline.
International flights, for the time being at least, are still carried on in
the Aeroflot name, under the aegis of an interstate aviation committee set
up by CIS heads of government in December. The idea is to maintain a central
civil air transport regulatory body to co-ordinate services during the
industry's restructuring and redevelopment.
'For us nothing has changed,' says Mr Vladimir Potapov, director-general of
Aeroflot's international air service department based at Sheremetievo,
Moscow's main international airport. But he has also become increasingly
worried by stirrings of independence among new CIS airlines on international
markets.
But elsewhere upheaval is commonplace. Many of the republics have already
set about painting aircraft in their national colours. Former Aeroflot
divisions are now called Ukrainian Airlines, Azerbaijan Airlines,
Baikalavia, Sibavia or Lithuanian Airlines. They are all suffering from
shortages of funds, fuel or spares. Their fleets of Soviet-built aircraft
are worn out. About 40 per cent of all aircraft in the republics are
grounded, making up what has become known as the 'iron row' of idle aircraft
crowding airport tarmacs.
Fares have trebled on internal flights and risen by as much as 30 times on
international routes since prices were liberalised in January. This, in
turn, has caused a fall in traffic. Rising costs and fewer passengers are
expected to increase the number of closures of unprofitable domestic routes.
As a result, regions which had depended on the old Aeroflot to link them to
the rest of the country could be isolated.
These risks are compounded by concerns about safety. With money in short
supply, there is a danger of large cuts in maintenance budgets. Although
accident rates for 1990 and 1991 are not available yet, safety standards
appear to be declining. The most recent official records show there were 23
accidents in 1989, compared with 16 in 1988 and 13 in 1987.
For all these reasons, the new airlines of the Commonwealth have been
scrambling to forge co-operation links with western airlines to help them
improve standards, fund new western aircraft acquisitions and overhaul
operations. Apart from the Air Russia venture with BA, Lithuanian Airlines
has just signed a marketing and sales agreement with American Airlines and
has leased a Boeing 737 from GPA, the Irish leasing group. Aeroflot-St
Petersburg agreed with Finnair in February to set up a joint airline based
in St Petersburg.
A joint venture with Lufthansa is planned to transform the old Sheremetievo
domestic terminal into a new international one. And the international
operations based there have approached the German carrier to co-operate on
reviving an airline first established by Weimar Germany and the Bolshevik
state in the 1920s.
Whatever the republics' longings for their own national airlines as a status
symbol, economic and political realities have compelled them to stick
together when operating international services. None has sufficient hard
currency to set up its own international offices, while international
agreements inherited from the Soviet Union cannot be renegotiated overnight.
The December interstate aviation agreement has assured continued
international services, a significant source of foreign currency for the
republics. For now, it has also reduced the risk that international air
transport will join the list of growing problems facing the republics as
they struggle to revive their economies.
But if Aeroflot has so far survived as an international carrier, it is only
a shadow of its former self. Internationally, it serves 135 cities in 102
countries with a fleet of slightly more than 100 jets. But more than 90 per
cent of its traffic has traditionally been carried domestically to 3,600
towns and cities. Its domestic operations have employed the bulk of its
600,000 staff.
The inevitable restructuring of the industry risks making as many as half
Aeroflot's 57,000 pilots redundant, according to Mr Alfred Malinovsky,
chairman of the pilots' union.
Even on the international front, many of Aeroflot's newly independent
regional branches and several start-up airlines are likely eventually to
challenge its international division.
But the difficulties are just as great for the new airlines emerging in the
Commonwealth. Mr Borkowski of BA concedes that finding money to finance new
operations with western aircraft based in Russia is a Herculean venture in
the current circumstances.
Aeroflot is still struggling to finance its first batch of Airbus A310
wide-body aircraft. The first of the five airliners was due to be delivered
last November. It is now unlikely to arrive before June.
But western aircraft manufacturers and airlines still continue to regard the
CIS as offering promising long-term growth prospects. Rolls-Royce, for
example, is expected to sign a deal soon to provide engines for a new
Tupolev airliner while France's Aerospatiale is discussing co-operation with
Russian manufacturers on a new 600-seater passenger jet.
The short term, however, remains extremely uncertain. A British
businessman's recent description of Moscow's Domodedovo airport summed up
the scale of the reconstruction problem. 'It's a toilet,' he said.

Sir, Your Leader today is challenging and well-argued; the cases you make
for and against both leading parties not unconvincing.
However, it is for the very reasons you expostulate so cogently that your
conclusion is so utterly flawed and your recommendation bad.
In the most unlikely event that the result you recommend should be achieved
which, at the time of writing (during the morning of election day) I am
convinced it will not, I believe that you will have done an enormous
disservice to what I see as your 'natural' constituency, the vast majority
of whom, I am sure, would be very considerably disadvantaged - as, much more
importantly, would be the nation as a whole.
A return to a Socialist government full of its traditional doctrinaire
principles, however well disguised, would undo so many of the great
achievements of the past 13 years.

Sir, I was stunned to read your leader ('The day of decision', April 9)
advising a vote for Labour. For the FT to espouse the cause of a party whose
philosophy is essentially anti-market beggars belief. It is true that the
Tories have made mistakes, but their values have never been in doubt.
You have swallowed the slogan 'Time for a change' on the view that the
current team is tired and it would be bad for democracy if the Tories were
given a fourth term. Your piece reminded me of a research note whose whole
tenor was bearish, but the conclusion is that one should buy.
Professionals in the City surely subscribe to the FT because its views and
advice are bedded in hard financial fact. You have broken that rule. Shame
on you for being so slack and self-indulgent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK ALLAN

<TEXT>
Sir, Clement Crisp's review of the Moscow City Ballet's Sleeping Beauty
(Arts, April 8) was, as so often, extremely funny. However, it would have
been more useful had he concentrated on the quality of the dancing and the
overall impression of the performance.
Instead, nearly half the review dealt with the costumes. Clearly they were
poor - no doubt as a result of budget constraints which should not surprise
us.
Passing reference to this should have been enough. What the reader wants to
know is whether the performance was enjoyable.
When he eventually referred to the quality of the dancing, he praised it.
But the effect was completely destroyed by his self-indulgent introduction.
Let us take for granted Mr Crisp's literary ability and keen sense of
humour. Let him get on with fulfilling the prime task of a critic - giving a
balanced, informative review.

FT  10 APR 92 / Leading Article: Public sector union harmony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREND towards merger and concentration among the UK's trades unions
continues apace. This week, three large public sector unions announced
details of their plans to form a new super-union with 1.4m members, to be
named Unison. The AEU engineers union and the EETPU electricians are to
merge next month. And there are rumours of a courtship between the two
largest general unions, the TGWU and GMB.
Most Unison members work in local government and the health service, giving
the merger a sensible industrial logic. The existence of a single union
should reduce restrictive practices and demarcation disputes and simplify
collective bargaining. But while fewer unions may help personnel managers
improve flexibility in the workplace, the process of concentration also
strengthens the hands of the unions in negotiations with their employers.
A single union spanning manual and white-collar employees enjoys greater
power than several unions with sectional interests. If it is the only or
main union in the industry, it can adopt a divide and rule approach to
winning its objectives - picking off the weakest employers piecemeal. This
strategy has been used to devastating effect in the past by Nalgo, the local
government union representing white collar staff which is one of the three
unions forming Unison.
Selective action
For example, selective action by Nalgo members in recent years has forced
several London boroughs - all Labour-led and less inclined to resist union
pressure - to pay additional allowances to town-hall staff. The most recent
example is Ealing, west London, where the newly-elected Labour council found
its schools closed and town hall departments disrupted by a month-long
strike in 1987 as Nalgo members demanded allowances paid in harder-pressed
inner London boroughs.
The same approach has been used to resist attempts to improve the efficiency
of local services. Plans by the London borough of Lewisham to re-organise
offices to improve service to the public were disrupted by Nalgo strikes in
1986. And in 1991, the moderate leadership of Liverpool city council found
itself unable to collect the poll tax or administer its finances for seven
months because militant Nalgo members were on strike in protest against
plans to cut jobs. The Nalgo strikers were on full pay from the national
union at a cost of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m a month, costing the
union up to Pounds 5m in strike pay. At one stage, the strikers attempted to
force Liverpool into default on capital and interest payments to banks and
other lenders.
Public interest
Such tactics suggest that there could be a public interest case for
regulating union mergers in the same way as industrial mergers, to curb the
abuse of monopoly power. Yet it would be perverse to argue against the
creation of industrial unions such as Unison when it has been common wisdom
for decades that such unions were desirable. Since the 1960s, many UK
industrialists and trades unionists have cast envious eyes over the system
bequeathed on Germany by the victorious allies after the last war, where a
handful of large unions represent and bargain on behalf of all employees in
an industry.
In practice, the ability of unions to hold individual councils to ransom has
been considerably weakened by compulsory competitive tendering. Council or
health authority manual workers must now work to targets they agree in
contracts with the employer. If they take industrial action and fail to hit
those targets, they may lose the contracts to the private sector. In the
1991 Liverpool strike, the council's manual workers abandoned their action
before the white-collar staff, after losing some contracts to outside
companies. It is unlikely that council white collar staff will be able to
hold out for as long as they did in Liverpool with the imminent extension of
compulsory competitive tendering to their jobs.
The formation of Unison, increasing as it does the potential for abuse of
union power, makes it essential that compulsory competitive tendering should
continue in public services. The Conservatives are committed to continuing
and extending it: a government of any other complexion will abandon the
principle at its peril.

FT  10 APR 92 / Shock waves around the globe: Turmoil in Japanese financial
markets could herald uncertainty in the economy as a whole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest plunge in Japanese equities has produced an unmistakeable sign of
panic: top-flight Japanese financial companies have seen an increase in
calls from foreign customers inquiring about their soundness.
The fall of the Nikkei average to its lowest levels since 1986 has, with
good reason, unnerved investors around the world. They are worried about the
health of Japanese banks, about the slowdown in the Japanese economy and
about the implications for their own countries of the turmoil in Tokyo.
'Japanese stocks are in free fall,' said Mr Takanori Tanabe, vice-president
of Tokio Marine MC Asset Management, a fund manager, yesterday after the
Nikkei plunged 577.38 points to 16,598.15.
For optimists, there is a glimmer of light. The latest decline has been
caused almost entirely by a sharp sell-off in bank shares, which have fallen
by more than 30 per cent since the beginning of the month, compared with an
overall 14 per cent decline in the Nikkei. A few fund managers are buying
shares in blue-chip industrial companies, arguing that Japanese equities are
now trading at their lowest valuations since 1985.
But even these brave souls do not predict a recovery soon. Rather, the
turmoil in stocks could herald considerable uncertainty in the financial
markets and in the economy as a whole. Few investors would ignore the
possibility of further nasty shocks, particularly from the hard-pressed
banking system. Mr Tadashi Okuda, the president of Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank,
warned yesterday that the sharp falls in stock prices was plunging banks
into 'a very difficult situation'.
Banks have become the most important victims of the collapse of the
speculative boom of the 1980s. Leading banks alone have been left holding an
estimated Y20,000bn (Pounds 86.5bn) in bad and doubtful debts which restrict
their capacity to make new loans. Because they count some of their stock
portfolios as capital, the decline in equities has also eroded their
reserves. While the Nikkei index was above 20,000, the ratio of capital to
assets of leading Japanese banks stood just above the minimum level of 8 per
cent which the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) regards as adequate.
Now the figure is about 7.5 per cent.
There is, however, little risk that big Japanese banks will collapse. In
extremis, banks can expect other members of their corporate families, or
Keiretsu, to provide them with new capital. The Bank of Japan has stressed
that it will not allow failures. If a leading bank were to run into
difficulties, the Bank would organise a merger with a stronger institution,
bankers say, before depositors were aware of the gravity of the problem.
However, there is a danger that with barely sufficient capital, banks will
be increasingly unable to lend. This could make borrowing difficult and
expensive, leading to a further slowing of investment and a prolonged
contraction of the economy.
So far, economists find little evidence of a general credit crunch in Japan.
Companies are pulling in their horns and so have less need of loans. The
ratio of cash to sales, a measure of liquidity, is down from its peak of 2.0
to 1.7 but is well above its early 1980s average of 1.2.
Broad economic statistics do not tell the whole story. Hard-pressed property
companies and some small and medium-sized companies face difficulties in
refinancing. Some economists worry that credit shortages might spread from
the property sector if the economy recovers and loan demand increases. Last
year, lending grew by just 4.4 per cent, down from a peak of 12.5 per cent
in 1987. This year's figure could be even lower - far too low to sustain
annual economic growth at 2 per cent, let alone the government's target of
3.5 per cent.
As Mr Yukio Takayama, senior managing director at the Sakura Research
Institute, an affiliate of Sakura Bank, says: 'When companies start asking
for loans we will need official action to avoid a credit crunch - such as a
temporary relaxation of BIS rules.'
However, other central banks would probably only acquiesce in any request
from the Bank of Japan for such a relaxation of BIS rules if the outlook for
Japanese banks threatened to cause a crisis for the world's financial
system.
With property prices down 30-40 per cent from their peak in Tokyo and Osaka
and still weak, the full extent of the damage inflicted by the property
crash to banks' capital has yet to emerge. Other pockets of potential bad
debt also lurk in the wings - for example, loans to stock speculators such
as Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, head of Koshin, an investment syndicate, who was
declared bankrupt this week with debts of Y250bn.
Normally banks could raise fresh equity. But this has been impossible since
1989 and is likely to remain so because fund managers are wary of Japanese
bank shares. Fortunately, banks have so far managed to juggle their balance
sheets to accommodate their loan customers. In the life companies, the
biggest group of institutional investors, they have a ready source of
subordinated loans, which they are allowed to count as capital rather than
debt for BIS purposes. They raised about Y2,000bn in the financial year to
March, on top of Y4,000bn the previous year.
But there is a limit to what can be raised by subordinated loans, not least
because the life companies also lend directly to industrial companies.
To make matters worse, the implosion in the stock market has robbed Japanese
companies of alternative equity capital. Companies have closed the funding
gap by issuing bonds, raising a total of Y12,500bn on capital markets in the
year to March. But the cost of debt is above 6 per cent, compared with less
than 1 per cent for equity-linked capital in 1989. Such an increase acts as
a powerful drag on investment.
As for the international impact of Tokyo's plunge, there are three main
effects: the retreat of Japanese banks from international markets; the
repatriation of capital into Japan; and the loss of confidence in the
markets.
Japanese banks have cut their assets in overseas markets more than at home.
In international markets, the Japanese share of new credits to non-bank
companies has fallen from 46 per cent in 1985-89 to 5 per cent in 1989 to
mid-1991, according to the BIS.
This has less effect than it might seem, because other banks, notably
German, have filled the gap left by the Japanese. Banks do not generally
raise funds in one industrialised country to lend in another. They operate
in the same market, usually borrowing short-term and lending long, acting as
intermediaries.
Even if there is no overall shortage of credit, some individual borrowers
previously favoured by Japanese banks are under pressure. Japanese banks
were big lenders to property developers, particularly in the US, to people
such as Mr Donald Trump. Given the depressed state of the property market, a
developer, even a sound one, might have trouble replacing his Japanese bank.
As one Japanese banker says: 'There are plenty of mismatches between lenders
and borrowers.'
The impact of capital repatriation is more serious. In the late 1980s Japan
was the world's biggest capital exporter - investing a net Dollars 136bn
overseas in 1987, mostly in securities. Last year the outflow turned to a
net inflow of Dollars 36.6bn.
Japanese investments in bonds have held up, since foreign yields are mostly
higher than Japan's. But investments with higher risks - equities, property
and direct investments - have fallen. This mainly reflects the slowing of
foreign economies, especially the US. But the slump in the Tokyo markets has
cut the outflow further.
The effects of the switch in capital flows has yet to become apparent, since
the world economy has been in recession since 1989. But when growth
recovers, the shortage of Japanese capital could emerge as a brake.
This is particularly true for the US, where Japanese companies are most
active. Mr Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, an
affiliate of Nomura Securities, says: 'Japanese companies paid almost zero
for capital in the late 1980s. Now they are in the real world. There are
many investments they made then that they would not make now.'
As for Japanese consumers, the direct effect of the stock and property price
plunges has been to reduce wealth. But this is not a widespread problem - on
average, the Japanese keep more than half their financial assets in cash or
deposit accounts.
For foreign portfolio investors the big question is whether to buy stock,
now the Nikkei is 57 per cent off its peak. At current levels, the shares in
the Nikkei index trade at about 35 times their earnings for the year to
March 1992, down from a peak of 92 in 1987. The last time the ratio was in
the mid-30s was in 1985, before the asset price explosion. But given the
continuing weakness of the economy, many stockbrokers expect a further
decline in corporate profits in 1992-93, of up to 10 per cent.
The government and the central bank, the Bank of Japan, are unlikely to come
to the rescue. The Bank has cut interest rates over the past year to raise
business confidence, but it has yet to commit itself to a whole-hearted
boost to the economy. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank, is still
haunted by the ghosts of speculative excess. Meanwhile, the government had
announced plans to accelerate public spending this year but, torn by
scandals, it is too weak to intervene more decisively in the economy.
Japanese financiers will have to work out their own salvation. Bankers say
it could take three to five years to deal with their biggest problem -
clearing the mountain of bad debt. But stock markets tend to anticipate the
real economy by up to two years. So at some stage between now and 1997,
yesterday's prices may look like a steal - as long as the target company
does not go bankrupt in the meantime.

BEYOND BEEF: the rise and fall of the cattle culture By Jeremy Rifkin Dutton
books. Dollars 21. 353 pages
Beef consumption represents one of the gravest threats to the future
well-being of the earth and its human population. A week ago, I would have
dismissed Jeremy Rifkin's claim as absurd. Having read Beyond Beef, I am not
so sure. Mr Rifkin, an American author and green activist, has doubtless
overstated his case. But his diatribe raises questions that deserve far
greater attention.
His first, startling point concerns the world's extraordinary reliance on
beef. There are nearly 1.3bn cattle spread across six continents. They
occupy nearly a quarter of the total land space and consume about a third of
the world's grain harvest. This passion for beef is increasing poverty in
the Third World, damaging the global environment and threatening the health
of affluent consumers in the US, Europe and - increasingly - Japan.
The argument about poverty is straightforward. An acre of cereal can produce
five times as much protein as an acre devoted to meat production; an acre of
legumes (beans or lentils) 10 times more; an acre of leafy vegetables, 15
times more. More than 1.3bn people in the Third World are reckoned to be
chronically underfed. If only a portion of the land occupied by cattle were
turned over to crop production, most could be fed at no net cost to the
developed world.
The environmental case against cattle appears equally compelling. The
billions of hooves trampling the world's surface are destroying natural
habitats, stripping away vegetation, eroding soil and contributing to
desert-like conditions in Asia, Africa and the Americas. Some 40 per cent of
the Amazon rain forest has been cleared for cattle-grazing, despite
unsuitable soil conditions. The obsession with cattle is also leading to
water shortages. Nearly half the water consumed in the US goes to grow feed
for cattle and other livestock. Cattle account for a sizeable portion of all
methane emissions, thus contributing directly to global warming.
If red meat were good for us, all this might perhaps be justified. Yet
scientific opinion is shifting towards the view that an ideal human diet
would be based mainly on vegetables, grains and fruit. Some three-quarters
of deaths in the US are reckoned to result directly from poor diets,
including excessive intake of saturated fats and cholesterol. The incidence
of colon cancer in the west, for example, is up to 10 times higher than in
non-beef-eating Asian cultures.
Beef addiction (nearly 7bn hamburgers a year are consumed in the US alone)
also helps explain why more than a quarter of Americans are clinically
overweight. While lack of grain leads to starvation in developing countries,
these portly individuals spend Dollars 5bn a year trying to get thin.
Billions of dollars are also wasted on wholly unnecessary medical bills.
Rifkin, while strong on the practical cost to human beings of excessive beef
consumption, also raises troubling ethical questions about the things we do
to cattle.
'Modern meat is a testimonial to the utilitarian ethos . . . Cattle are
dehorned, castrated, injected with hormones and antibiotics, sprayed with
insecticides, placed on a cement slab, and fed grains, sawdust, sludge and
sewage until they reach the appropriate weight. The animals are transported
by truck to automated slaughterhouses, where they are killed, disassembled
into their constituent parts, mixed, moulded, shaped and reconstituted into
useful products . . .' Can we really justify this behaviour when more people
could be fed - and more kept healthy - by growing beans?
Rifkin reminds us that the word 'cattle' is derived from the words 'capital'
and 'chattel'. In a fascinating historical discussion, he traces man's
relationship with the bovine from ancient Egypt, where the bull and cow were
worshipped as icons of our virility and fertility, to the mass concrete
feedlots of the American mid-west, where they are raw industrial inputs. He
shows how the British aristocracy's love for fatty cuts of beef - and its
willingness to finance American ranches in the 19th century - helped change
tastes throughout the world. And he documents how the cattle industry - the
first form of mobile capital - repeatedly led developments in other sectors:
Henry Ford, for example, got the idea of an assembly line from the Chicago
meat-packers.
The author sees the changed status of cattle as a metaphor for the evils
wrought by modern capitalism: 'We have substituted mechanism for organism,
utilitarianism for spiritualism, and market values for community standards,
turning ourselves from beings to resources.' He exaggerates.
But the over-production of cattle, while encouraged by public subsidies,
remains a good example of the way capitalism can have globally irrational
consequences if it fails to take all the costs of production into account.
In calling for the renunciation of beef today, Rifkin is decades ahead of
public opinion: in due course, however, I have no doubt that red meat will
go the same way as tobacco. We must prepare to apologise for this
anti-social and unhealthy habit.

<TEXT>
Everything about Deadly Serious, a combined homage to Alfred Hitchcock and
spoof on his films, by the aptly named 'Adventures in Motion Pictures',
seems promising. The publicity material has a nice wit.
The evening is divided between the performance of two 'films': Overwrought
is black and white and firmly located in 1939; Rear Entry is very
technicolour indeed, and evokes Hitchcock's blondes and the vertiginous
perils of hanging about in high places.
But alas for promise. What I eventually saw on Wednesday night was a series
of production gimmicks dimly connected with the tensions and terrors of
Hitchcock's film-making, which are sent up in amateurish fashion.
Matthew Bourne, director and choreographer of AMP, and also one of its six
dancers (four male and six female), is part of the young generation of new
British dance-makers who appear more caught up with presentation than with
choreography.
Like Lea Anderson and her Cholmondeleys and Featherstonehaughs troupes,
there is a concern with message rather than movement, with production rather
then dynamic invention.
In the work of an ensemble such as DV8 we can see how movement in this genre
of Physical Theatre has been forged into a language capable of urgent
political, social, sexual statements.
With such gifted performer-creators as Laurie Booth, Julyen Hamilton,
Yolande Snaith, we find dance expressive, subtle, imaginatively stimulating.
'Adventures in Motion Pictures', in Deadly Serious, as in last year's Town
and Country, provides unfocused sketches that are glosses upon existing
cliches. It is supposed to be the most tremendous fun - and The Place
audience has a whale of a time (though memory asks 'When do they not?') -
and it leaves me stony-faced.
There is a certain endearing undergraduate innocence about this show - which
is excellently designed by David Manners and well lit by Rick Fisher - but
its conflation of Hitchcockian characters and situations is neither
ingenious enough, nor witty enough, to seem more than a brief sketch that
has run to mountains of self-indulgent fat.
The strain of homosexual intrigue that runs through it - one in three
clinches, because of the balance of sexes in the cast, is between chaps  -
is singularly unlike Hitchcock.
The other thing that runs through the piece is the cast - who dash about
ceaselessly, but to little purpose.
Adventures in Motion Pictures is playing Deadly Serious at The Place
Theatre, Dukes Road, London WC1, until April 18. Thereafter, the company
tours southern and south-west England through May and June.

To say that the BBC will be hoping Bruce's Guest Night does as much for them
in ratings terms as 'The Generation Game' used to is an understatement. They
will be crossing everything they've got. We are told the new series (8.00
BBC1) is a 'glitzy cocktail of entertainment' with Forsyth as compere, chat
show host, and song and dance man.
Those appearing in today's first show include American comedian Rita Rudner,
singer Lisa Stansfield, tennis player Pat Cash, and Cliff Richard.
By the sound of it there will not be a dry eye in the house after today's
Short Stories on C4 (8.30): this is a documentary about Brinsworth House, a
retirement home for old troupers, average age 86, many still game to go into
their act.
ITV begins a 10-part drama series called Heartbeat (9.00) set in the 1960s
(miniskirts, Radio Caroline, mods and rockers) inspired by Nicholas Rhea's
'Constable' books. Nick Berry stars as a young policeman who moves from
London to the Yorkshire moors, and Niamh Cusack plays his wife Kate, a
doctor.
Arena considers the work and life of Spanish artist Javier Mariscal who has
won the design commission for the Barcelona Olympics.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you dislike the election result or are simply looking for a pleasant
evening, here is a fine diversion. Ronald Harwood's Reflected Glory is the
definition of a middlebrow play: not unduly demanding, but clever enough to
make you laugh, admire the invention and even be puzzled by the ending.
It also has Albert Finney back on the West End stage, where he last
appeared, in another play by Harwood, in 1989. Finney plays Alfred, elder
brother to Michael (Stephen Moore). Alfred is a restaurant owner, Michael a
playwright. When young, they often quarrelled, not least when playing
tennis, but usually made it up with a joint rendering of 'Me and My Shadow',
with a kind of Fred Astaire dancing to go with it.
Their estrangement began when their father divided his will unequally:
Pounds 40,000 to Michael because he would need it as an artist, and only
Pounds 20,000 to Alfred because his restaurant would be expected to pay for
itself. The real trouble between the brothers, however, is that Michael
keeps writing plays about the family, which Alfred regards as an intrusion
on his private life. Sometimes he takes out an injunction to stop them.
After 10 years of not seeing each other, Michael is seeking a reconciliation
because his latest play Brother Mine, as distinct from his earlier Family
Matters, is not about the family in general, but about the relationship
between the brothers.
That is the essence of it. Alfred is tempted automatically to injunct: his
lawyer is conveniently at hand, being the lover of Michael's theatrical
agent. He agrees to see a private viewing before the play is launched. The
performance leads to a stream of pleasing theatrical in-jokes.
This not a huge part for Finney. For about quarter of an hour in the second
act, he simply sits at the side watching the rehearsal, consulting his
lawyer and taking notes.
From time to time he interrupts, objecting for instance that the actor
playing him is left-handed with insufficient swing to his backhand. All that
is very jolly. Alfred, however, is not a complete philistine. He rather
takes to the actors, especially when he recognises one of them as the man
who plays the pirate in the Planters' Rum in the commercial.
The action takes place in a fringe theatre known as the Acropolis, which
Alfred says reminds him of a Greek taverna. The direction is by Elijah
Moshinsky and you would have to be in a grim mood not to like it.

FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: Dog-days with Clodion and Bonington - Exhibitions in
Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To call Clodion the Fragonard of French sculpture is hardly original, but it
helps. For Clodion, now the subject of his first major exhibition at the
Louvre in Paris (until 29 June), is well known in France but not much
elsewhere - certainly nothing like so well as such painters as Fragonard and
Hubert Robert.
The dates fit rather neatly. Fragonard was born in 1732 and died in 1806.
Claude Michel, alias Clodion or 'little Claude', was born in Nancy in 1738,
one of 10 children: he died at Paris in 1814.
As a matter of course, both young men studied in Rome. Neither became a full
master of the French Academy, but both did very nicely all the same out of
private patrons.
And that was perhaps hardly surprising, given that Fragonard and Clodion
were each masters of the erotic. Still admired - although considerably less
rich after the Revolution - aged Clodion had his design for a fountain of
nymphs at the Carrousel rejected by Napoleon himself, on grounds that it was
'too indecent'.
But if the Emperor had his scruples, generations of French art-lovers
admired Clodion's style anacreontique which, translated, refers to his
light-as-air, exquisitely seductive ladies from Arcadia.
Before the Revolution, bankers and financiers were particular patrons of
Clodion. But even in 1900, gentlemen looking for a delicious little bronze
would thumb through the catalogue of Thiebault &amp; Fils and find dozens of
copies after Clodion and his imitators. 'A last grace-note of douceur de
vivre,' Michael Levey called Clodion.
Unfamiliar the name may be, but British visitors to this attractive and
beautifully-lit exhibition will surely find Clodion striking a chord of
memory.
It may be that, like me, you thought him author of the outrageous little
terracotta statuette called 'La Gimblette' in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs.
Not so, according to this exhibition; it was an imitator who borrowed this
wicked design from Fragonard.
A naked girl lies on her back with her feet in the air, holding up her pet
dog who hangs there, snout pointing towards her. To increase the poor
brute's sense of vertigo and frustration, she holds out a gimblette, a kind
of biscuit-with-a-hole.
If this is how ladies of the Empire regularly played with their dogs, no
wonder Clodion was asked to design neo-classical mausolea for mutts who, we
may suppose, died of over-excitement.
The most notable features of the Louvre exhibition are examples of Clodion's
monumental work, such as the large marble sculpture of St Cecilia from Rouen
cathedral and his statue of Montesquieu, and the stucco friezes from his
architectural decorations. The former leave me cold; how much more sharply
etched and graceful St Cecilia is in clay, which Clodion had the most
uncanny skill in modelling.
His partnership with the architect Alexandre-Theodore Brogniart, produced
large, delightfully frivolous scenes from Ovid and Virgil for the new houses
of the seriously wealthy and, in the case of Baron de Besenval, lubricious.
Lent by the Metropolitan in New York are two friezes of Bacchanalian babies
made for the elegant home the Prince de built for his daughter. But she, a
reluctant deb, looked coldly on the decorations, took the veil, and became
an abbess.
* * *
A retrospective exhibition, Richard Parkes Bonington: 1802-28 at the Petit
Palais (closed on Mondays), continues until 17 May. Sponsored by United
Technologies Corporation, it has travelled from the Yale Center for British
Art, and contains over 160 paintings and watercolours.
Bonington's tragically short career is unusual in two main respects: he not
only fascinated, but taught, his French contemporaries something, and he
managed to die from sunstroke contracted after sketching in Normandy.
This popular exhibition is very nearly a complete delight, and the more
interesting for including paintings by Bonington's admirers, and above all
Delacroix. Looking at their twin recreations of a jewel-bright Renaissance
past and the lure of the East, is a vision of high Romanticism's high noon.
But what an astonishing decision to hang the work of an artist with such
exquisite colour sense against walls of intense scarlet, blue, emerald, and
purple. Painful throughout, the colour-clash reached a crescendo in the last
room where the purple met the gold frames and brilliant turquoise skies of
Bonington's Venice.
No serious devotee of Bonington will want to miss the catalogue, although at
FF300 it makes our British ones seem modest indeed.

FT  10 APR 92 / The Property Market: Why bricks are no longer bankable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the commercial property market in Britain has had an
unusually wide airing in the media recently. But does it really matter to
anyone who is not directly involved?
The market's problems, it is sometimes argued, are solely the concern of
overstretched developers, their banks and the property profession. But there
is a strong case that a property crash on this scale has implications for
the country as a whole.
First, the sector's problems are very visible. The overbuilding of the late
1980s has left a trail of empty buildings in its wake. Cities are blighted
by the empty hulks of dilapidated office blocks awaiting demolition, as
redevelopment projects have become unviable. Rows of empty shops give town
centres a neglected, depressed atmosphere, damaging the business of
neighbouring retailers.
But a second - and even more important - matter concerns the importance of
property to banks and business.
Three quarters of bank lending is dependent on property, says Mr Julian
Robins, a banking analyst at BZW. 'The size of the banks' asset base which
is reliant on property is mind-boggling.' This is illustrated by the
striking relationship between the UK banks' bad debts and commercial
property prices.
The banks' exposure to property is three-fold: their own branches and
offices; their loans to property companies; and as the security that
underpins their loans.
The falling value of property that is used as security is perhaps the most
important aspect of this problem, although it is difficult to quantify so it
is often ignored. 'This is potentially the largest and most frightening
(threat), the one that gives bankers the biggest headaches,' says Mr Robins
of BZW.
The collapse in property prices affects the banks' ability to make new loans
 -as it cuts into their capital base - and their willingness to do so.
The UK banks play down the concern about a 'credit crunch' resulting from
their difficulty in making new loans. 'It is an exaggeration,' says Mr Bruce
Kensall, head of marketing and communications at Barclays. 'It is not the
availability of money that is the problem but good opportunities to spend
it,' he says.
But there is no doubt that banks are being more cautious. 'One is being more
discerning as a result of bad debts,' says Mr Kensall.
The fall in asset values is an important ingredient of this cautious
attitude. 'If asset prices fall, the collateral provided by these assets
will diminish in quality and lending institutions may become increasingly
reluctant to lend to companies, leading to a decline of investment, demand
and output,' said a report by the London Business School last year.
'The banks are frightened of lending on collateral,' says Mr Robins. 'This
factor is having a huge effect on new lending.'
The Forum of Private Business, a lobby group for small businesses agrees.
'Falling property prices are having a sizeable impact,' says its spokesman
Mr David Harrop.
For the most part, the problem is confined to new loans. But in some cases,
banks are accused of pulling in existing loans, when the loan covenant has
been breached as a result of a fall in asset value.
Banks stress that they are not looking for excuses to call in loans if there
is a prospect of a company covering its interest payments. Moreover, the
slump in the market means that a forced sale of a property would often not
recoup the value of the loan. (On average, this would happen with a fall of
more than 30 per cent of the property's value.)
Businesses do not necessarily take solace from this point. They fear that
loans will be called in when the market recovers. Moreover, they fear that
banks are demanding extra security to cover themselves against falling asset
prices.
'Bank managers say they need more security. But as soon as they have more
security to make sure the loan is covered, they call it in. There is a lot
of sharp practice,' says Mr Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small
Businesses.
But there is a silver lining of sorts for some businesses. The landlords'
problems represents opportunities for their tenants. While tenants locked
into upwards-only leases are benefiting little from the property recession,
those seeking new premises have low costs and an exceptionally wide choice
on offer.

FT  10 APR 92 / Technology: Designing chips that defy logic / A look at a
faster way of building the next generation of semiconductors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defying conventional wisdom that American semiconductor chip makers lag
their Japanese competitors in manufacturing technology, LSI Logic, a leading
Silicon Valley chipmaker, has developed what it claims is a world-beating
semiconductor production process.
LSI's technology will enable the company to produce chips with about twice
as many miniature transistors as today's most complex commercial devices.
This level of chip density could make the much vaunted 'computer system on a
chip' a reality.
By reducing the 'line width' of circuit elements on a chip to just 0.6
micron, LSI appears to have leapfrogged its competitors. The process is
'clearly one step ahead of most of the competition,' says Ron Collet,
principal semiconductor analyst at Dataquest, a US market research group.
LSI's feat is surprising, not only because it comes from a US chipmaker but
also because LSI's semiconductors are not mass-produced memory chips like
those which the Japanese have turned into a commodity product. Instead LSI
is a specialist in the production of Application Specific Integrated
Circuits (ASICs), semiconductor devices tailored to meet the needs of
individual customers.
Traditionally, memory chip makers such as Hitachi, Toshiba and NEC Japan
have led the chip-density race. Dynamic Random Access Memory (D-Ram) chips
have been used as a vehicle to prove new semiconductor production processes.
When several US chip makers dropped out of the D-Ram market in the mid-1980s
in the face of mounting Japanese competition and alleged Japanese 'dumping'
of D-Rams at prices below production costs, a concern among US semiconductor
industry and government officials was the potential impact upon the US chip
industry's ability to keep pace in process technology.
Fears that US chip makers would not be able to develop leading-edge
chip-making technology without D-Rams to drive them led to the formation of
Sematech, an industry consortium that receives half of its funding from the
US Defence Department.
Sematech set ambitious goals to develop world-beating manufacturing
techniques or 'process technology' on behalf of its US semiconductor
industry members. LSI Logic was one of the 14 founding members of Sematech,
but in January the company withdrew from the consortium, saying that its
research and development funds were better spent internally.
LSI had recognised that the process technology requirements of its ASIC
products were diverging from those of mass production commodity chips such
as D-Rams, which remain the focus of Sematech's efforts.
Indeed, the notion that D-Rams are a critical 'technology driver' for the
semiconductor production process has been widely called into question by US
semiconductor experts over the past few years. However, for LSI Logic, the
development of leading-edge process technology was imperative if the company
was not to sink beneath the rising tide of competition.
With revenues last year of close to Dollars 700m, LSI ranks as the eighth
largest US semiconductor producer, but it is dwarfed by Japanese
competitors.
To accelerate its process technology development time, LSI turned to
computer simulation as a faster, cost-effective method to advance process
technology. While it can take several weeks to get the results of an
experimental production process run, the same results can be obtained using
computer simulations in a matter of days.
A long-time expert in the use of simulation in the design of semiconductor
chips, LSI put computer modelling to work for itself. The company
acknowledges that it also drew upon research performed at several US
universities that was funded by the semiconductor industry's Semiconductor
Research Corporation, to which it contributes.
LSI also made the decision to refit its California production facility,
which might otherwise have been closed down, for research uses and
pilot-line production, thus providing its R&amp;D team with faster access to a
factory test bed.
The result, says Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI Logic, is that the
company has accelerated its 'learning cycles', the number of experimental
production runs (real or simulated) that it can perform in a given period.
But getting one step ahead is not enough in the highly competitive chip
market. To maintain its process technology lead, LSI will have to continue
to redouble the pace of process innovation.
Already, however, LSI Logic has created a quandary for its competitors.
Typically, the largest Japanese semiconductor producers 'recycle' their
semiconductor plants. New plants are designed for the latest generation of
D-Rams, then after a few years they are turned over to produce
microprocessors and ASICs, and ultimately to chips such as those used in
calculators and consumer electronics products.
By applying the latest semiconductor production technology to ASICs, LSI
aims to gain a competitive advantage over much larger companies that do not
focus their process development efforts on this segment of the semiconductor
market.

FT  10 APR 92 / Technology: FBI sets snare for hackers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's difficult to look natural while committing a computer crime. A sweaty
brow or quickened heart beat is not going to give you away, but activities
like logging on in the middle of the night or accessing a file that you
normally have no interest in, may.
For a year now, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation has been testing a
new kind of security system which attempts to trap malicious computer users,
or intruders masquerading as staff, by highlighting statistically-unusual
behaviour.
At present the system is confined to one IBM mainframe serving three or four
field officers in the Washington DC area, but there are plans to extend it
across the country.
Over the next few years similar systems are likely to surface at other
sensitive computer sites in government agencies, defence ministries and also
the armed forces.
The FBI's package, called Intruder Detection Expert System (Ides), has been
developed over six years by SRI International of Menlo Park, California,
with Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.5m) of funding, mainly from the US Navy. The
software monitors individual users and groups of users and builds up a
historical profile of their 'normal' behaviour on the computer.
It then monitors their current activity, and sends out an immediate alert if
there is a significant difference between the two.
In this way Ides detects intrusions that go unnoticed by conventional
password and access-control systems. For example, it can detect hackers who
have gained access to a computer through exploiting unknown vulnerabilities.
The FBI has uncovered some 'interesting events' says Teresa Lunt, programme
director at SRI. 'Typically,' she says, 'they're concerned that a user might
be providing information to someone on the street. An FBI employee who
normally works on stolen cars, for example, might be contacted by a
drug-related criminal and asked to look something up.'
FBI cases tend to overlap departmental boundaries, says Lunt, so computer
users may have the authority to access a wide range of files. With Ides,
however, they will be asked to justify any unusual actions.
Ides also includes a second kind of snare - it is able to recognise specific
actions that are regarded as suspicious, such as a string of unsuccessful
attempts at logging on. It achieves this with an expert or 'knowledge-based'
system programmed to look for particular sets of circumstances.
Hackers are predictable, says Lunt. 'There's a cookbook of ways to break
into a Unix or Vax system for example - you can encode that information and
look for those particular exploitations.'
Lunt says the prototype Ides, which runs on a Sun workstation connected to
the computer being monitored, may spawn a product within two to three years.
The institute has funding for another three years of research but 'we think
we can start turning out useful prototypes now,' says Lunt. SRI is not
product-orientated but the research group is looking for a joint-venture
partner to bring Ides to market.

Scottish Legal Life Assurance Society, the Glasgow-based friendly society,
has taken a big step into the 20th century by appointing its first chief
executive in 142 years.
Ron Baxter, 40, will join the society at the end of this month from Scottish
Amicable, where he is assistant general manager of sales and marketing.
Scottish Legal, a much smaller organisation with total assets of Pounds
130m, has only been able to appoint a chief executive since its constitution
was changed last year.
The move will also enable it to take advantage of the new opportunities for
friendly societies created by the Friendly Societies Act, which was passed
in the last week before the election campaign.
At present, the society has 570 employees, and total income for last year
was Pounds 19m. Like much of the Scottish life industry, it concentrates on
selling regular premium with-profits savings policies.

Stephen Wells, 43, now takes over as managing director of National
Westminster Insurance Services, while his predecessor, Stuart Frost, takes
responsibility for integrating the new joint venture company with the bank's
organisation.
Wells joined NatWest in 1971, having gone to Royal Exchange Assurance when
he left school. He is also a director of Ulster Bank Insurance Services.

Toshiba said it will introduce a new series of linear image sensor modules
that are half the size and weight of the conventional sensors based on
charge coupled devices (CCDs) which lie at the heart of equipment used to

A NEW MICROCHIP developed by a British university research group allows
computers to carry out complex tasks like financial forecasting and business
modelling better than humans, writes Frank Brown.
The chip, dubbed the probabilistic Ram (pRam), mimics the behaviour of brain
cells more closely than any previous technology. 'This is the first time
that some of the important functions of a nerve cell have been harnessed
electronically,' said JG Taylor of the University of London team which
developed the device. 'It accepts data from its teacher, makes decisions,
changes its connections internally and becomes as good as its teacher,' he
said.
The pRam contains 256 cells, or neural nodes, and is 1,000 times faster than
existing software-based neural networks. By linking them together
large-scale artificial neural networks can be created.
In addition to business and financial forecasting, applications include
speech, vision and pattern recognition, scientific and statistical
modelling. University College London Initiative: UK, 071 636 7668.

FT  10 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Court appoints substitute arbitrator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAZIELLA FERRAZ
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: March 27 1992
THE DEATH of an arbitrator appointed under an agreement providing for
reference to two arbitrators, does not entitle the party who appointed him
to appoint a new one in his place as would be the case on a reference to
three arbitrators, and the appropriate procedure is to apply to the court to
appoint a substitute.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when dismissing a claim by Rocco Giuseppe &amp; Figli
SpA, charterers of Graziella Ferraz, for a declaration that their
appointment of a replacement arbitrator in a claim against the defendant
shipowners, Tupinave, was valid under section 7(a) of the Arbitration Act
1950. The court made an order appointing a replacement arbitrator under
section 10(1)(b) of the Act.
Section 7 of the Arbitration Act 1950 provides: 'Where an arbitration
agreement provides that the reference shall be to two arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each party then . . . (a) if either of the appointed
arbitrators dies . . . the party who appointed him may appoint a new
arbitrator in his place . . .'
Section (10)(1)(b): 'If an appointed arbitrator . . . dies . . . the High
Court . . . may . . . appoint an arbitrator . . .'
HIS LORDSHIP said that by a charterparty on the New York Produce Exchange
form dated April 29 1083, Tupinave chartered Graziella Ferraz to Rocco
Giuseppe.
The arbitration clause provided that any dispute should be referred 'to
three persons at London one to be appointed by each of the parties hereto'.
Disputes having arisen between the parties, Mr John Potter was appointed
arbitrator on behalf of the charterers, and Mr Michael Mabbs on behalf of
the shipowners.
Those two arbitrators then appointed Captain Baskerville as third
arbitrator.
An oral hearing was held in June 1985, after which the arbitrators issued an
interim final award dated July 12 1985. They awarded that the shipowners
should pay the charterers 82m Italian lire in damages plus interest. They
stipulated that they made no order in respect of costs 'leaving it that the
parties can always, if they so wish, make application at a later date for
such an order'.
A number of attempts had been made by the charterers to agree costs with the
shipowners, but they had proved fruitless. Consequently, the charterers
wished to revert to the arbitrators to obtain a final award dealing with
costs.
Unfortunately, however, since the interim final award was issued Mr Potter
had died.
It was therefore necessary for another arbitrator for charterers to be
appointed in his place, to enable them to pursue their application for costs
before a properly constituted tribunal.
By letter dated November 16 1990, the charterers' solicitors invited Mr John
Besman, a well-known maritime arbitrator, to accept appointment in Mr
Potter's place. He accepted on November 19.
By the present originating summons the charterers sought a declaration that
Mr Besman's appointment was a valid appointment pursuant to section 7(a) of
the Arbitration Act 1950.
Section 7(a) provided that, where the arbitration agreement was for
reference 'to two arbitrators' and one died, the party who appointed him
might appoint another.
Appreciating possible pitfalls under section 7, the charterers also went
through the prescribed procedure under section 10 of the Act, which
empowered the court to appoint a substitute arbitrator.
Under section 10, if an appointed arbitrator died, any party might serve the
other with written notice to appoint, and if appointment was not made within
seven days of service the High Court might appoint an arbitrator.
The requisite notice under section 10 had been duly served on the shipowners
in Brazil.
Consequently, the originating summons sought in the alternative an order
pursuant to section 10(1)(b) that Mr Besman be appointed in Mr Potter's
place.
Leave to serve the originating summons out of the jurisdiction in Brazil was
granted on January 30 1992 and the summons was duly served. No
acknowledgement of service had been received and the shipowners did not
appear at the hearing.
As the arbitration clause provided for appointment of three arbitrators, the
difficulty in applying section 7(a) which was explicitly limited to cases
where the reference was to two arbitrators, was obvious.
In Re Smith and Services and Nelson &amp; Sons (1890) 25 QBD 545, where there
was a submission to three arbitrators, the Court of Appeal upheld a
concession that section 6 of the Arbitration Act 1889 (which was re-enacted
as section 7 of the 1950 Act) was inapplicable.
That was followed by Mr Justice Megaw in Marinos and Frangos v Dulien Steel
Products (1961) 2 Lloyd's Rep 192 in relation to a similar agreement.
He went on to hold that the provisions of section 9(1) of the 1950 Act as
they then stood, stipulating that an agreement for reference to three
arbitrators should have effect as if it provided for appointment of an
umpire, not a third arbitrator, brought the agreement back into section 7,
so that the agreement was to be treated as providing that the reference
should be to two arbitrators.
That avenue was no longer available to the charterers, because section 9 had
since been amended by the 1979 Act which repealed section 9(1) in relation
to any arbitration, such as the present, to which the 1979 Act applied.
The court must therefore regretfully conclude, in line with the view
expressed in Mustill &amp; Boyd, Commercial Arbitration, ed 2 page 187, that the
charterers were not entitled to invoke section 7 in the present case.
Accordingly, the declaration sought must be refused.
The charterers having gone through all the necessary steps under section 10,
and Mr Besman being a thoroughly suitable replacement for the late Mr
Potter, the court made the order sought under section 10(1)(b) that Mr
Besman be appointed to act as arbitrator in Mr Potter's place.
There was a lacuna in arbitration procedure worthy of rectification now that
further statutory amendments were under consideration. The drawbacks were
exemplified by the present case seeing that, in addition to the costs
incurred in relation to the originating summons itself, the charterers had
to undertake two long and expensive service processes in Brazil in order to
invoke section 10, rather than the very simple and inexpensive procedure
under section 7 which would have been available to them in a reference to
two arbitrators.
For the charterers: Christopher Butcher (Middleton Potts).
The shipowners did not appear.

FT  10 APR 92 / Management: Revealed, how to pull off the Italian job /
Billion lire executive pay packages excite only limited Latin passions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and American executives, reeling from criticism of their 'excessive'
pay rises, will draw little comfort from their Italian colleagues' recent
plight.
The sums earned in Italy are just as large, yet the public outcry that
greeted the disclosure in the press of the tax returns of some leading
public sector managers was pretty perfunctory. Despite the ritual yearly
disclosures, 'top people's' pay in Italy is not particularly contentious.
Topping this year's list with L1.9bn (Pounds 885,700) was Pier Giusto
Jaeger, deputy chairman of the STET telecommunications group. Two
state-sector bankers followed, both also declaring incomes of more than
L1bn.
The brevity of the salaries' storm derives from the fact that it is largely
artificial. The earnings, published by the prime minister's office,
represent not just pay, but total income. Many of the 'top 10' immediately
emphasised that the figures included items like consultancy, dividends and
royalties.
Laws and culture explain why executive pay arouses relatively few passions
in Italy. Unlike Britain and America, companies are not obliged to disclose
directors' earnings, and annual reports are silent on the subject.
Eager sleuths can drop into the local tax office, where a company's annual
returns include details on executives' pay. But few take the trouble. This
may be the result of the chummy relationship between big companies and the
press, which stifles investigative reporting. 'People are quite well
protected in that respect,' says Patrizia Macaluso of International Human
Resources, the Milan-based consultants
Yet some information is available. Although non-disclosure rules apply as
much to public as to private companies, details on state sector pay are
easier to come by.
The salary of Franco Nobili, chairman of IRI, Italy's biggest state holding
company, and Gabriele Cagliari, who heads Eni, the second biggest holding
group, are published in the Official Gazette. The latest figure, which dates
back to 1987 in the case of Eni, shows the chairman earned L250m. The same
figure is quoted by IRI for its chairman.
Meanwhile, headhunters can shed some light on private-sector pay. Most agree
that the chief executive of a quoted company, with sales of around L1,000bn,
should make about L500,000m-L600,000m. But they emphasise that private
sector pay levels can differ widely, even between similar sized companies.
'In the very biggest groups, earnings can easily exceed L1bn,' says Lodovico
Floriani, chairman of Hay Management Consultants in Italy.
The lack of uniformity stems from the very personal nature of Italian
business. Most big, private-sector groups, even when quoted, are dominated
by an individual or family shareholder.
Top executives' pay can depend as much on owners' whims as on comparative
salaries. Shareholder-chairmen like Fiat's Gianni Agnelli and Carlo De
Benedetti of Olivetti are highly influential in deciding pay levels.
Personal considerations are also paramount. Floriani says that while a
company's performance, inflation and the general economic climate play a
part, pay rates are also affected by the rapport between a hired executive
and the controlling shareholder, who is usually chairman.
Even at the highest levels, public sector salaries are appreciably lower,
with earnings seldom exceeding L500,000-L600,000. But here too, figures can
be deceptive. For high profile jobs like the IRI and Eni chairmanships,
non-salary perks boost earnings that need to look restrained for political
reasons.
Non-salary perks can account for as much as 50 per cent of the total for
some top state industry jobs, the headhunters reckon. Job security can also
compensate for lower pay levels when working for the state. Italy's public
sector plays a much bigger role in business than in most other European
countries.
Top appointments are highly politicised, with a delicate balance between
representatives of the governing parties on the boards of the big holding
companies and their subsidiaries. However, a senior executive belonging to
one of the main parties can usually expect a job for life.
Public sector pay rises appear to be handled much more objectively than for
private companies. IRI uses Hay Management Consultants to advise on a
'policy line' each year, which is then implemented with a variation based on
performance.
Jobs are ranked on the basis of 'Hay points', to which appropriate salaries
are ascribed. But the system also allows for differences of up to 20 per
cent on either side of the base level, depending on personal evaluations.
Both public and private-sector executives put a car first when it comes to
perks. In deference to the domestic motor industry, that usually means a big
Lancia Thema or Alfa 164. Chauffeurs are not uncommon, even below managing
director level, and the number of aerials sprouting from the car's bodywork
tends to indicate the occupant's importance.
Insurance is the other standard perk. Senior executives expect both private
health insurance and private pensions, along with life cover as part of
their packages.
More surprisingly for a country where second or even third homes are common,
few managers would demand a place in the country as a perk.
'If a top executive takes some holiday, the last place he'll go is somewhere
where he might risk bumping into his colleagues,' says one consultant.

FT  10 APR 92 / Management: In the court of Lord King - British Airways'
name-dropping chairman in full flight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord King of Wartnaby has just arrived back at his St James's office from a
long lunch across town. The 74-year-old chairman of British Airways is late,
and does not look in a particularly good mood. 'Close the door, there's a
good man,' he growls, a fat cigar stub between his lips, at his PR man. The
message does not get through. 'Jane,' he bellows at one of the two
secretaries who sit outside, guarding his office. 'Close the door.'
The task accomplished, he turns his attention to the job in hand: writing
'King' with a beautiful black and gold fountain pen on gaudy certificates
that each British Airways employee receives after 25 and 35 years of
service.
'Well?', he says, abruptly starting the interview. His PR man, a
wheeler-dealer from Northern Ireland, and a good match for his boss, shows
him a clipping of a previous article in the 'My Office' series. ''Sir
Christopher Hogg does his own filing'' Lord King reads out aloud. 'Does he,
indeed?' he scoffs and casts the paper aside.
Warming to the task of describing his own spacious room, Lord King starts
with his large collection of pictures and photographs that cover the walls
and are stacked on bookcases and side tables.
He gets up from behind his heavy, leather desk and lumbers over to the
photographs. 'There's me with the Pope, and my wife with the Pope,' he
starts. 'That is me in the Oval Office with Bush, me with John Major outside
Number 10, and me with Billy Graham.' He rattles through the collection at
great speed. Clearly this is not the first time he has shown them off.
Lord King is fussy about who he has his picture taken with. He does not like
being snapped with a cigar or a drink in hand: however, he once arranged to
have the schedule of Corcorde changed so that he could be photographed
beside it at Heathrow.
'That's me on holiday with Reagan,' he continues, pointing at a photograph
of the two men in cowboy gear, enjoying a week's holiday with the
'Rancheros' riding down the west coast.
Horses feature strongly. There are many pictures of him hunting with his
daughter; there is even a sickly oil, showing the two returning after a hunt
at sunset.
Lord King's office leaves one in no doubt that the man is a name dropper and
a lover of expensive things. The polished wooden furniture does not have the
cheap reproduction sheen of most 'traditional' offices; Lord King's has a
more worn, blue-blooded look about it.
Yet blue-blooded is exactly what the man is not. He comes from humble
origins and started out selling second-hand cars. Rather than capitalise on
his rags-to-riches success, he prefers to draw a veil over the rags -
showing an insecurity that is so blatant, and so unnecessary, it is almost
touching.
His is the old-fashioned style of management: he rules with charm of a
pugnacious kind, pays no lip service to modernity. There are no computers in
his room: 'You have to manage, not let yourself be managed by computers.
I've got plenty of people to tell me what computers do,' he says.
In addition to the two top secretaries, he has as a special adviser, Sir
Francis Kennedy - whose distinguished Foreign Office career King races
through by way of introduction. 'If I'm going to a foreign country, he
organises for me to see the prime minister or president.'
It is on this level that King operates best. His contacts are impressive by
any standards; he is a great fixer. By his side is Sir Colin Marshall, the
chief executive who plays the professional manager.
King, by contrast, is not frightened to take decisions on impulse. On a
large dining table in the middle of the room, a single letter sits next to a
model of a British airways jet.
'The table is very convenient for anything that is impossible to answer. If
I put something there I know I must tackle it,' he says. What is the letter?
He can't remember and moves over to check. 'Someone wants me to do
something. I don't know whether I should or not. Yes, perhaps I will.'
What about his average day? When he is in London ('The week before last I
was in Venezuela, last week I was in New York') he puts in long hours.
He starts reading papers at five each morning. He gets into the office
early, talking on the phone in his private London taxi as he goes.
It is good preparation for a day of solid talking at the meetings that his
secretary has set up back-to-back, months in advance.' Secretaries love to
fill up diaries', he says. 'Its my job to deal with it.'
A favourite slot in the day is lunch. If on his own, he goes to White's, his
club. If he is entertaining, it is Green's, either in St James or in
Westminster.
The advantage of trekking across to Westminster is that he can keep an eye
on his political friends. Otherwise he goes to the Savoy Grill which, he
says, is where 'all the editors of your distinguished profession' eat their
lunch.
Lord King is not particularly articulate and tends to sound pompous.
'My office has reminders and comforts of a certain tranquility,' he says,
summing up its charms.
On the way out, he stops in his secretaries' room to show off their word
processors, which are neither new nor remarkable. He points out the four
clocks showing the times in different parts of the world, suddenly noticing
that something is amiss.
'That clock is not straight,' he says, lunging at it.
Behind his back, his secretaries exchange looks: exasperated, but not
unaffectionate.

FT  10 APR 92 / From revolution to recovery: Radical zeal is ebbing as Iran
goes to the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL FIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The parliamentary elections which take place in Iran today may mark the end
of the country's international isolation if the moderate politicians who
seek to liberalise the economy and forge better relations with the world
outside strengthen their hold on power.
President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has been moving Iran in a pragmatic
direction since he came to power after the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in
1989. He has been aided by the fact that, outside parliament, where the
influence of radical deputies has only recently been weakened, Iranians'
revolutionary zeal has ebbed in the past few years. The country has been
isolated in international arenas and is on the defensive; and it is short of
money. It is coming to terms with the loss of 13 years' potential economic
growth since the revolution of 1979, and realises its economic position is
far worse than it was a decade ago.
It suffered great material damage in the war with Iraq in 1980-88, when two
of its main towns, Abadan and Khorramshahr, were reduced to rubble, and an
international trade embargo caused its industry to run at a quarter of
capacity. Since the revolution, meanwhile, Iran's population has grown from
34m to some 55m-60m, one of the highest rates of increase in the world. This
boom will soon lead to the appearance of a large class of unemployed young
men. Every building in the country seems to need refurbishment. Most
vehicles and machines are worn out.
Government organisations and banks have lost touch with the conventions of
international business. Relatively little English is spoken. Credit cards
are unknown and travellers' cheques viewed with suspicion. Most of the
economy is run by big corporations of the old east European type, which have
functioned without the need to compete either in the domestic or global
arenas.
In its efforts to stimulate economic recovery, Iran can rely on oil revenues
running at about Dollars 15bn a year. It is trying to increase its oil
export capacity from 2.4m barrels a day to 3.8m b/d by the end of 1994, but
this target is optimistic and even if it can be achieved the investment in
production facilities will cost nearly a year's oil revenue.
Any of the annual Dollars 17bn in hard currency earned from exports that is
not being spent on the oil industry is going to subsidise basic foodstuffs,
mostly imported, at a cost of Dollars 4bn a year; to pay for a vigorous
re-armament programme, much of it involving the development and assembly of
weapons in co-operation with Pakistan and North Korea; to finance
reconstruction of the country's infrastructure and a few new projects; and
to get existing manufacturing industries back into production.
Fortunately, the government has little debt to service. At the end of last
year, its obligations on medium-term loans and 360-day letters of credit
were a combined total of Dollars 12bn. Although the state and private
business have repayment records described by a western banker in Tehran as
'exemplary' the build-up of official foreign debt from virtually nothing
three years ago has been fast enough to cause Britain's Export Credit
Guarantee Department to call a meeting of European export credit guarantee
agencies in London in February to review Iran's position.
Clearly, Iran's resources are being stretched and the government is having
to make some tough choices. Advised by the International Monetary Fund whose
influence is denied because officially the body is regarded as an instrument
of the hated Americans, it has started a programme of reform.
First, Iran is trying to reduce its foodstuffs subsidies and eliminate the
subsidies to some industries - both of which come in the form of
preferential exchange rates.
At present basic foodstuffs are sold on the fictitious basis of their having
been imported at 70 rials to the dollar, and some state corporations are
granted foreign exchange at a rate of 600 rials. But the 'real', free market
rate, used by the private sector, is 1,440 rials to the dollar. The
government has already eliminated a few items, such as chicken, from its
subsidised foods list and it aims to drop the rest - including rice, bread
and sugar - and amalgamate the three exchange rates by the spring of 1994 or
1995. It is being resolute in this action. As the minister of mines and
metals, Hussein Mahlouji, says: 'Whatever happens, we are not going to
borrow just to feed our people - that is sure.'
The plan is to drop food subsidies over this year and next, and at the same
time to increase the salaries of the poorer government employees. In theory
the government will only be switching the way in which it helps the poor
from one method to another, but given that the private sector is bound to
have to follow the wage rises, the effect will be inflationary.
Inflation is already running at more than 20 per cent annually. In
parliament recently the notorious 'hanging judge', Sadeq Khalkali, declared:
'God bless Hoveyda (the Shah's prime minister whom he had executed after the
revolution). Under him, a Bic biro stayed at five rials for 13 years. Now
the price of chicken is going up by the hour.'
The second arm of government reform policy is an attempt to stimulate growth
through the privatisation of companies seized after the revolution. In the
past two years, the government has floated shares in 70 companies and it has
recently decided to privatise 15 more, including the big vehicle assembly
businesses. Some smaller enterprises are simply being handed back to their
former private owners.
Iranians who are well informed and working outside the government are
sceptical about whether either of the government's major policies will be a
success. The relentless growth of population and the pressure this will put
on family incomes may force the government to keep its food subsidies in
place, because it will not want to alienate the poorest classes, who are its
main constituents. And privatisation may not generate sufficient growth to
provide the new masses with employment.
The failure of either policy would only increase people's disenchantment
with the government. Ever since the revolution, ordinary Iranians have felt
free to speak their minds on politics, and grumbling has been commonplace,
but recently their disillusionment has become deeper.
After the revolution, I returned from studying in Britain because I wanted
to help my country in the war,' says a taxi driver. 'I joined the Baseej
(the volunteer army used in the early mass attacks against Iraq) because I
believed that it doesn't matter what you do, if God wants you to stay alive
you will. But now everybody I know is disappointed with the revolution. We
attacked the Shah and America and Britain, and now we realise we were wrong
to do it - but it's too late.'
Rising prices and political disenchantment have led to a number of strikes
and other minor disturbances in the bazaars, in one or two of the
universities and in state-owned corporations. The government, remembering
how it came to power itself, has been anxious to suppress these
manifestations of unrest. In fact, for the time being there is little for
the government to fear because there is no plausible opposition to the basic
concept of Islamic government either in the country or among Iranians living
abroad. The traditional focus of opposition under the Qajar and Pahlavi
monarchies was the clergy, and the clergy is now in power.
The government's response to its problems is to increase the dose of
medicine it is already giving the economy to try to liberalise it faster. It
wants foreign investment, but so far, although there have been many
inquiries, hardly any companies have committed themselves. The concern is
not the ambiguity of the constitution on foreign investment, but worries
about political stability. 'Iran needs a sense of political acceptability if
it is to get investment,' said the ambassador of a neighbouring country. 'So
far not even the Japanese banks and government are signalling that Iran is
an area where Japanese companies (which do a lot of trade with Iran) should
go forward.'
The government is hampered in changing its image overseas in two ways.
First, it faces obstruction from within the ranks of the clergy. The
moderates who at present dominate the government favour a freer economy, a
bigger role for the private sector, better relations with the outside world,
and, possibly, a freer society and freer dress code in Iran. The radicals
want social and economic 'justice', they are anti-capitalist, against the
minor luxury imports of the private sector and anti western 'arrogance' and
'cultural aggression'. They fear a re-opening of a US embassy in Tehran, and
they want, or pretend to want, direct Iranian intervention in the fight
against Israel. The president, Mr Rafsanjani is moderately inclined, but he
normally tries to stay above politics.
Most Iranians of the middle and working classes seem to hope that the
radicals will be decisively beaten in today's elections, though the outcome
may be distorted in the radicals' favour because their supporters are more
committed to their cause and are thus more likely to vote.
If the radicals do badly it is feared that they may organise some
international outrage in order to frustrate the government's opening to the
outside world. There was great satisfaction in the radical press after
agents of a remaining radical clique in the government murdered the Shah's
last prime minister, Shahpour Bakhtiar, in Paris last summer.
The government cannot simply imprison the radicals because within certain
limits it believes in democracy. Internally Iran is much freer than most
westerners imagine.
The other difficulty the government faces is that it cannot abandon its
revolutionary Islamic rhetoric. The reality is that the revolution is nearly
dead - except in the radicals' support for organisations such as Islamic
Jihad, the armed revolutionary group, and other similar organisations abroad
 -but nobody in government can afford to say it. To do so would be to betray
the Imam Khomeini and the 400,000 young men who died in the war against
Iraq. Anyone visiting Iran is continually reminded of these 'martyrs'. The
country is one of new cemeteries and memorials, like France after the First
World War.
Maintaining a revolutionary image is still very important. When 100 Danish
MPs recently signed a letter asking Iran to cancel the sentence on Salman
Rushdie, the author condemned to death for writing the novel The Satanic
Verses, the government felt obliged in public to dismiss their idea. But the
newspaper Jomhuri Islami (Islamic Republic) explained the real government
position in an editorial: 'Given that the Imam's edict that Rushdie must be
killed is irrevocable, attempts such as this to exert pressure on the
Republic can only be considered attempts to keep the episode alive. This is
what international Zionism is desperately after.'
In other words, the mainstream of the Iranian government cannot overturn an
edict of the revered Ayatollah Khomeini and it wishes that westerners would
understand this fact and not embarrass it by referring to the sentence when,
it feels, they should know perfectly well that it is not doing anything to
carry it out. The truth is that the Iranian government wishes that the death
sentence on Rushdie, and some of the other embarrassing revolutionary
impediments it carries, would simply fade away. Its problem is that it
cannot say so in public.
If more moderate deputies are returned in the elections, this situation will
not change overnight. However, an increase in the number of moderate
deputies will free the government of some of its inhibitions - both about
being more friendly to the western world and about pursuing its economic
liberalisation policies.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Count in Scotland off to a flying start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE campaign in Scotland has already produced one clear winner: the
helicopter companies that ferried politicians around its remote regions.
Helicopters are no longer used only by Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Paddy
Ashdown and others cultivating an action-man image. The final days of the
campaign saw unlikely figures such as Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish
secretary, taking to the air in a last-minute dash around the marginals.
Last night the choppers were standing by to bring in ballot boxes from all
over the highlands and islands to achieve the earliest declarations ever in
the north of Scotland.
Mr Keith Nichols, election officer at the Highlands regional council, is
organising the count for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, Ross, Cromarty and
Skye, and Caithness and Sutherland. In 1987 results for these three
northernmost mainland constituencies were not announced until 1.30pm on
Friday afternoon. This time the last one should be out by 2.30am.
Mr Nichols has chartered three twin-engined helicopters from Black Isle
Helicopters, the Scottish subsidiary of Dollar Helicopters. Twin engines
allow the helicopters to fly at night, and the 27 pick-up points have been
equipped with temporary lights.
Argyll and Bute, a Conservative/Liberal Democrat marginal composed of
islands and sparsely populated farmland, is expected to be the last Scottish
constituency to declare, at about 12.30pm on Friday.
A single-engined helicopter has been chartered from PLM Helicopters to pick
up 22 ballot boxes from the most far-flung villages. Single-engined aircraft
cost less to charter, about Pounds 500 per flying hour, but cannot fly in
the dark, so the run will begin after dawn on Friday.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Biggest aims for the best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGE hoardings promoting Birmingham before a mass television audience
last night gave a glimpse of election counts of the future when the results
for 12 constituencies were assembled in the city's National Indoor Arena.
A military-style operation went into action as soon as the polling booths
closed at 10pm with the aim of ensuring that Britain's largest ballot count
under one roof - handling more than half a million votes - went ahead
without a hitch.
With four key marginals contested in the city - Hall Green, Northfield,
Yardley and Selly Oak - Birmingham was a prime focus of media attention and
the city council lost no opportunity to promote the city as one of the
nation's top sporting, cultural and exhibition centres.
The 800 counting staff and scrutineers were herded into pens for each
constituency, separated by eight-foot partitions. Wide-angle television
cameras suspended above the hall were able to provide a panoramic view of
the event.
To avoid the crush of more than 600 cars and vans carrying ballot boxes into
the city centre at one time - as happened in the last general election -
security vans were loaded at collection points outside the centre and driven
straight on to the arena floor.
Mr Peter Hatch, Birmingham's elections officer, said: 'To make sure we had
the arena we pre-booked Thursday night as early as last October through to
July 9, the latest date for a general election.'
The Midlands, where many of the crucial marginals that decided today's
result were being fought, has a long tradition of historic election results.
In 1900, when general elections were held over several days, Derby returned
Britain's second Labour MP - Richard Bell - a day after Keir Hardie won his
seat.
Birmingham itself, however, maintained a Conservative tradition for many
years because of the influence of Joseph Chamberlain and his two sons,
Neville and Austen, who ensured that a Chamberlain was in the House of
Commons representing some part of the city from 1876 to the Second World
War.
One of the city's closest results was in 1924, when Neville Chamberlain
defeated Oswald Mosley by just 77 votes after two earlier counts which had
given the seat to Mosley. After last night's count the arena, which opened
last October and cost Pounds 51m to build, will return to staging more
peaceful contests. Later this month it hosts the national karate
championships.
Before the general election count the venue's biggest event had been Disney
on Ice.

FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Villagers wait for the tide to turn / Taking
in the view from the Holy Island polling station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE HOLY Island's village hall, the sun warmed the picturesque cottages;
through a heat haze the castle loomed on its rock and daffodils around the
graves beside the ruined Lindisfarne priory bobbed in the spring breeze.
Inside the hall retired fisherman Mr Ralph Wilson - presiding officer for
the day - surveyed his pile of ham sandwiches and flasks of tea and coffee
and daydreamed about how a nip of whisky might relieve the chill of the
building, which remained stubbornly cold.
Beside him his daughter Morag watched the door. 'Number 51 father' she said,
almost before a silverhaired villager crossed the threshold. On an island
where most voters have known each other since birth, presentation of a poll
card is something of a formality.
Holy Island, cut off from the Northumberland coast twice every 24 hours and
accessible at low tide across the same strait of water that Saints Aidan and
Cuthbert negotiated in the seventh century, is just one example of the
challenge of organising polling in Britain's more rural constituencies.
The island's village hall, built as a gift in 1931 by Sir Edward de Stein,
then owner of the castle, is one of 104 polling stations in the Berwick
constituency, the most northerly in England.
The presiding officers and poll clerks who run the stations, set up in
village halls, schools and even the annexe of the Rose and Crown pub in
Alwinton, a Cheviot shepherds' watering hole, are mostly local government
officers. But as Holy Island's tides, coupled with the 15-hour polling day,
would oblige visiting officials to stay overnight, villagers are entrusted
with the task.
Berwick is one of more than 30 constituencies nationally where counting will
not begin until this morning. Some delay is because of the cost of retaining
staff late into the night, others, like Berwick, because of the logistics of
collecting ballot boxes from outlying areas.
By 11am yesterday, 40 Holy Islanders had voted. About 20 others from the 171
islanders eligible had opted for postal ballots; many were fishermen, away
catching prawns and scallops. But Mr Billy Shell, part of a fishing family
known to have been on the island for at least 600 years, called in person to
vote as his boat was laid up with engine trouble. With him came his
80-year-old father Mr Livingston Shell, a veteran of more general elections
than he could remember.
By midday the voting rate had settled down to about five an hour; it looked
like a long day. Anticipating boredom Morag, a craft shop proprietor, had
brought with her a bag of 100 home-made 'willy winkies'  - shell figures
sold for 55p each - on which she had to ink in the eyes.
Her father stood on the step, having a smoke in the sun. Officially, the
causeway could not be safely crossed last night until 11.15pm. But Mr
Wilson, drawing on a lifetime's knowledge, knew he could drive the ballot
box across, on the start of its journey to the count, a little sooner. 'I'd
say I'll get it away at 10.30,' he said. 'The tides are low at the moment.'

FT  10 APR 92 / Move to block private Marchioness action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to block a private prosecution over the Marchioness pleasure-boat
disaster on the Thames, in which 51 people died, began in the High Court
yesterday.
Last November a London magistrate gave the go-ahead for committal
proceedings on a manslaughter charge against South Coast Shipping Company,
owner of the dredger Bowbelle, the other vessel involved in the collision,
and four senior managers, brought by Mr Ivor Glogg, whose wife died in the
accident.
Yesterday South Coast Shipping Company and Mr Peter Butcher, operations
manager, Mr Brian Darwell, marine manager, Mr Edward Greenwood, company
superintendent, and Mr Robert Samuel, general manager, asked two judges to
quash the magistrate's decision.
The tragedy occurred in the early hours of August 21 1989 when the
Marchioness, on which a party was being held, collided with the dredger.
Sir David Hopkin, the chief stipendiary magistrate, ruled that Mr Glogg had
the legal standing necessary to give him the right to bring a private
prosecution.
The defendants argue that Mr Glogg lacks sufficient legal standing; that the
private prosecution is 'a misuse or manipulation of the process of the
court' which amounts to an abuse; that the case is not a genuine prosecution
but a means of conducting a public inquiry and airing grievances; and that
delay and publicity have led to unfairness.

FT  10 APR 92 / Firms make plans for summer lull in work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY firms are gearing up for a substantial lull in work during the
summer with a variety of tactics to keep their employees occupied.
Some are placing extra emphasis on staff taking all their holidays during
the late summer, when the volume of audit work is traditionally lowest.
Others are seconding them to other departments or giving them projects for
their firms' internal use.
Managers have been pincered by two effects of the recession: a decline in
some areas of business activity, and - because there are fewer jobs
elsewhere - reluctance by younger staff to leave.
With most companies' financial year-ends in December and March, audit staff
will be kept busy into June. Many of the more junior accountants are likely
to be at a loose end for the subsequent three or four months.
Mr Paul Woodrow, public relations manager at Robson Rhodes, said: 'There has
been a vacuum in work for auditors during the summer since Noah was a boy.'
But he agreed that some areas of work had been lower this year than in the
past.
Mr Richard Owen, national director of personnel at Touche Ross, said that
while audit work might be heading for a lull, insolvency work was 'insanely
busy'.
KPMG Peat Marwick took what the firm describes as 'the most definitive
solution' to the problem of spare capacity last month when it made more than
300 audit staff redundant.
Meanwhile Price Waterhouse has given senior personnel discretion to allow
their staff to take unpaid leave, lifting a rule that no employee can take
more than two weeks a year of unpaid leave in lieu of overtime.
Other firms point out that the late summer is the period when students
should be spending the most time training and studying for their accountancy
exams.

FT  10 APR 92 / Fears of collapse behind a brave front: Worries about
prospects for industrial survival in Northumberland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULLDOZERS are levelling the ground for a Pounds 40m industrial estate on
the site in the Wansbeck district of Northumberland where thousands of men
went underground to dig for coal for more than a century, earning the town
of Ashington the tag of 'largest pit village in the world'.
A road, funded partly by EC money, now bypasses Ashington town centre. From
it the view of British Alcan's Lynemouth power station and aluminium plant,
one of only two big smelters in Britain, dominates the skyline.
A few miles south is National Power's Blyth power station. Slightly north of
the smelter, just outside Wansbeck district but drawing most of its
workforce from within it, is Ellington colliery, a profitable pit with large
reserves, where pit ponies work alongside the newest technology at coal
faces eight miles under the North Sea.
If Wansbeck is compared with many of Britain's traditional mining areas,
where pit closures have left no manual jobs for men, Wansbeck may seem
fortunate.
In just six months, however, it has suffered nearly 700 direct job losses
from Alcan, Blyth power station and Ellington, the coalfield's last pit,
raising fears of the total collapse of the area's three biggest industrial
employers and the loss of 2,400 mostly male jobs in an area where 3,000 men
are already unemployed.
According to a newly-published report commissioned by a working group
comprising the area's local authorities, MPs, unions and some employers,
Wansbeck can either resign itself to the collapse of its primary industries
or fight to improve their survival prospects by promoting their potential in
a 'greener' future of clean coal technology, sustainable energy and
recycling.
The report, A Future for South East Northumberland, produced by John Tomaney
of Newcastle University's Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies
for the Newcastle-based Trade Union Studies Information Unit, recommends the
'green' option. The area's political leaders agree. Mr John McCormack,
Labour leader of Wansbeck council, says: 'We haven't lost all the major
industries yet; this report is saying before it gets too late there are
steps which can be taken to preserve what we've got. We're very much at the
crossroads. If the right decisions are made we can pull out of this.'
A moratorium on building gas-fired power stations, a brake on pit closures
and coal imports and abandonment of British Coal's privatisation - all
proposed by Labour before yesterday's election - would raise the survival
chances, at least in the short term, of Blyth power station and Ellington
pit, earmarked for closure in the Rothschild report commissioned by the last
government.
Other items on Wansbeck's lobbying list - a more generous regime of inward
investment grants, an Enterprise Zone and state intervention to aid the
survival of Alcan's smelter on the grounds of UK strategic importance -
would be prickly issues for any government.
Wansbeck's problem is, ironically, partly due to earlier success in building
on its traditional industry with Blyth power station and Alcan, both of
which are big coal-burners.
When the government reviewed regional policy in the early 1980s, Wansbeck's
unemployment problems were not considered acute enough to justify
continuation of its top-tier status. It was demoted to intermediate-area
status, hampering its fight with other parts of north-east England for
inward investment from development-area grants to incoming employers,
development corporations and enterprise zones.
Wansbeck's failure to win any significant inward investment in the past
decade has heightened its dependence on a shrinking coal industry; deep
mining in Northumberland has shrunk from 60 pits employing 40,385 men when
the industry was nationalised to one, Ellington, with 1,657 men, plus
Ashington workshops, employing 240.
Ellington, producing only industrial coal, sells half its 2m tonnes annual
output to Alcan at Lynemouth; Blyth power station is also a big customer.
However, Alcan has been badly hit by a steep worldwide drop in aluminium
prices, which last winter forced it to halve production from Lynemouth. Mr
Paul Belanger, managing director of Alcan's UK primary and recycling
division, supports the emphasis in Mr Tomaney's report on aluminium's future
potential because of its potential for recycling. But Mr Belanger says there
is 'no immediate optimism' about any rapid improvement in the market.
Blyth power station, opened in the 1960s, would in any case now be nearing
the end of the average coal-fired station's 40 -year life. Its prospects
have been worsened by the creation of a competitive electricity generating
market and the 'dash for gas' - the construction of a wave of gas-fired
stations - and uncertainty over the generators' future demand from British
Coal once the present supply contract expires next March.
Mr Tomaney's report suggests that Blyth and Ellington could be linked to
form a demonstration site for clean coal technology, the only one of its
kind in Britain.
National Power says any such departure would have to be judged on its
economic viability.
Undeterred, Mr McCormack is now enlisting more employers to help promote
Wansbeck's cause. 'We feel it will have more weight in lobbying Westminster
and Europe, no matter who is in power, if we can say the whole community is
represented and we're speaking with one voice.'

Lord Justice Lloyd and Mr Justice Waterhouse held that only the home

Unless the home secretary declared a home-seeker an illegal entrant who
obtained leave to enter the UK by fraud, the applicant was entitled to be

ST JOHNS Hospital, near Leicester Square in central London, has been sold
for redevelopment to a Chinese buyer for almost Pounds 3m, Vanessa Houlder
writes.
The sale, by South East Thames Regional Health Authority, reflects the
health service's efforts to rationalise its estate.
The buyer is considering asking for planning permission for restaurants, a
community centre, housing and a private hospital. Existing planning
permission for offices is unlikely to be acted on. The facade is listed and
will be kept.
Allsop, the agent which conducted the sale, said the building had attracted
strong interest, particularly from Hong Kong.

FT  10 APR 92 / Big output boost by Nissan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID build-up of output in the UK by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker,
compensated last year for a steep decline by established producers such as
Rover, Peugeot and Jaguar.
Nissan, which began volume-car assembly in the UK in 1986, increased
production last year by 63.6 per cent to 124,666 from 76,190 in 1990
according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Nissan will remain a vital factor in the development of UK car production
for the next two years with output forecast to rise to 175,000 this year and
270,000 next year. The company's efforts will be helped by the introduction
of a second car range this summer.
Honda and Toyota, the other Japanese carmakers developing assembly plants in
the UK, will both begin volume assembly by the end of the year. Honda will
start at its Swindon, Wiltshire, plant in October and Toyota in Burnaston
near Derby in December.
Overall UK car output fell 4.5 per cent to 1,236,900 last year, largely as a
result of a 13.8 per cent fall in Rover car production and a 24.5 per cent
drop in output by Peugeot, the French carmaker, at its Ryton, Coventry,
assembly plant. Rover car output fell last year to 359,951, a figure which
includes 35,952 Honda Concertos assembled by Rover.
Ford's UK vehicle output (including Jaguar and Aston Martin) fell 3.7 per
cent to 484,639 from 503,525 a year earlier, largely as a result of the 45.2
per cent decline in production by Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary.
The recession in the UK and in the US took a heavy toll on UK luxury car
output, hitting Rolls-Royce as well as Jaguar.

FT  10 APR 92 / Congress attack on foreigners' tax reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress is taking aim once again at what it believes to be
widespread evasion of US taxes by foreign-owned businesses.
A number of Congress members claims that foreign companies are
systematically understating the earnings of their US subsidiaries, and so
evading US corporate income taxes, by using inflated transfer prices to
siphon profits back to their home base.
In a hearing at the House ways and means committee yesterday, methods to
plug this hole were suggested, ranging from a new border tax to an
alternative minimum tax levied at 5 per cent of sales on foreign
subsidiaries.
'In our society, a teacher or a factory worker can pay more in federal
income tax than a major multinational corporation with billions in annual US
sales,' complained Congressman Jake Pickle, chairman of the ways and means
sub-committee on oversight.
But Treasury and Internal Revenue Service officials urged Congress not to
press ahead with new legislation until they have had time to see whether
reforms on transfer pricing, enacted in 1990, have worked.
Mr Alan Wilensky, treasury deputy assistant secretary for tax policy,
acknowledged that foreign-owned businesses showed a much lower rate of
return on assets than comparable US-owned companies, but warned that the US
might face retaliation if it introduced rules that discriminated against
foreign companies.
New tax data for 1989 - before the new 1990 rules took effect - showed that
foreign-controlled companies made an average return of 0.51 per cent of
assets, compared with 1.97 per cent for US-controlled companies. Gross
profits amounted to 22.01 per cent of sales for foreign companies, compared
with 29.89 per cent for US-owned companies.
Congressman Duncan Hunter argued that the US Treasury was losing more than
Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.4bn) a year because foreign companies were
artificially lowering their US profits.
Ms Shirley Peterson, IRS commissioner, acknowledged that there might be some
income shifting by foreign-owned businesses, but estimated the maximum tax
loss at Dollars 3bn.
Even so, a study commissioned from the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick by
the Organisation for International Investment, a Washington-based lobbying
group, argued that, although foreign-owned companies' rates of return were
much lower than US-owned companies, this was partly accounted for by the
fact that their new investments have been growing three times faster.
KPMG suggested that IRS data were inadequate for a conclusion that transfer
price abuses were occurring, and that comparisons of gross profit margins
were probably misleading.

FT  10 APR 92 / Tsongas stays out of presidential contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Tsongas, former senator from Massachusetts, decided yesterday not to
revive his bid for the White House, virtually conceding the Democratic
party's presidential nomination to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
The New Englander had suspended his campaign after mediocre support in
Illinois and Michigan had convinced him that he would not be able to take on
the southerner in the New York primary this week.
Yet Mr Tsongas continued to win votes. His 29 per cent in New York - second
to Mr Clinton's 41 per cent but ahead of former governor Jerry Brown of
California, the only other candidate still formally in the race - prompted
him to consider relaunching his bid.
Yesterday, Mr Tsongas said he could have re-entered the race only as a
spoiler, a role he rejected. He said he wanted to preserve his message -
liberal social policies and pro-business economics - but declined to endorse
either of the two remaining candidates.
The Clinton campaign estimates that it now has 1,327 of the 4,288 delegates
who will pick the Democratic nominee at the party's convention in July. Mr
Tsongas would have had to win virtually every remaining delegate.

<TEXT>
THE head of the United Nations mission in Cambodia threatened yesterday to
report Khmer Rouge guerrillas to the Security Council unless they allowed
international peace-keepers into zones under their control, Reuter reports
from Phnom Penh.
'Our people are very frustrated,' Mr Yasushi Akashi told a news briefing.
'Time is running out.'
Officials of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) needed to
inspect Khmer Rouge zones to prepare for the gathering together and
demobilisation of the rival Cambodian armies as laid down in the Paris peace
accord signed last October.
So far the radical guerrilla group had refused them access, Mr Akashi said.
The multinational UNTAC force, eventually to number 23,000 military and
civilian personnel, is to implement the accord that ended 13 years of war
between the Phnom Penh government and a three-faction guerrilla alliance
spearheaded by the Maoist Khmer Rouge.
It will supervise the partial disbanding and disarming of the rival armies,
monitor a ceasefire and virtually run the devastated country in tandem with
a provisional national council uniting all factions until elections next
year.

A showdown over the body of the late former Philippines president, Mr
Ferdinand Marcos, loomed yesterday following a government move banning its
return until after the May election, Jose Galang reports from Manila.
The ban, explained Mr Franklin Drilon, the executive secretary, was imposed
owing to concerns of national security officials that a return to the
country of Mr Marcos' remains 'will create public disturbance.'
He said the current campaign for the May 11 poll, at which Mr Marcos' widow,
Imelda, is seeking the presidency, is hotting up and the return of Mr
Marcos' body could affect public safety and order.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE North Korean parliament yesterday ratified an agreement with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to open the country's nuclear
facilities to inspection, but the decision still leaves unclear when
inspection will begin.
South Korean officials noted that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung must still
formally notify the IAEA of the ratification in a written statement. Once
the IAEA receives the notice, the inspection accord with North Korea goes
into effect.
North Korea will then have 30 days to submit an inventory report on nuclear
materials it possesses and 90 days to disclose construction details of its
nuclear facilities.
This would mean that the IAEA inspections will begin in August at the
earliest once the North Korean information is studied by the IAEA, according
to South Korean officials.
If nuclear reprocessing facilities are found in North Korea, the agreement
betwen the two Koreas would require that they be dismantled.
The US and South Korea have been pressing for a June deadline for
inspections to begin in the belief that further delays would allow North
Korea to hide some of its nuclear equipment.
The two countries claim that North Korea could develop a nuclear weapon
within a year.
Prosecutors said yesterday they planned to arrest a son of Mr Chung Yu-jung,
the founder of Hyundai, for alleged tax evasion.
It is the harshest action yet against Hyundai since Mr Chung's new political
party won an influencial parliamentary position against the government in
last month's National Assembly elections.

FT  10 APR 92 / Forty more face trial in Kuwait for collaboration with
Iraqis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT opens trial proceedings tomorrow against 40 more people suspected of
having collaborated with the Iraqis during the emirate's seven-month
occupation. This resumes a process which was suspended last June and will
revive the close attention of human rights organisations.
The suspects are to be tried for 20 cases arising from the Iraqi occupation,
including allegations of torture or complicity in torture, in what are
expected to be open hearings in a state security court.
Human rights groups estimate that around 100 people are still detained for
alleged offences during the occupation, while 164 have already been tried,
in proceedings which began in May last year and were widely condemned for
their harshness.
In these trials 29 people were sentenced to death - later commuted to life
imprisonment - 72 were jailed, many for life, 15 fined, three passed on to
other courts and 45 acquitted. Many of the acquitted, particularly
Palestinians and Jordanians, are believed to have been deported under a
programme, now supervised by the International Committee of the Red Cross,
which has seen between 50 and 100 people bussed out of Kuwait weekly.
International anger over the initial trials - during which one Iraqi youth
was jailed for 15 years for wearing a Saddam Hussein T-shirt - combined with
Kuwait's lifting of martial law has, in the view of human rights
organisations, led Kuwait to improve trial procedures.
It has abolished indefinite detention without trial, set up regular review
courts for detainees, introduced an appeal court and freed many suspects for
lack of evidence.
But groups such as Amnesty International, which says it will send an
observer to the latest trials, say the procedure is still far from ideal:
many defendants still do not have defence lawyers. Moreover, they still do
not know whether adequate witness testimony will be available for people
charged with torture.
Although some charges in the present trial could carry the death penalty,
human rights activists suggest that even if some are imposed, they are
likely later to be commuted. However, they also suggest that Kuwaitis remain
unforgiving towards those accused of collaborating in atrocities during the
occupation.

</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has agreed to Indonesia's request that it set up and chair a
donor consultative forum. The request was made after Indonesia dissolved the
Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), the previous forum, in March.
Indonesia had accused the Netherlands, which chaired the IGGI, of using aid
as a political tool to interfere in its internal affairs.
The decision to set up a new forum was made after consulting 'the
traditional members of Indonesia's donor community' from whom the bank
'received broad support', the World Bank said in a letter to the Indonesian
government.
The first meeting of the new forum will take place in Paris on July 16 and
17, only one month after the cancelled annual meeting of the IGGI. Indonesia
received Dollars 4.75bn (Pounds 2.76bn) in donor commitments at the last
IGGI meeting, and officials say they are confident of a similar response in
July.
The meeting is likely to be a test of how far donors regard Indonesia as
having moved on the issue of human rights. Many donors have expressed
concern at the killing of civilians by security forces in East Timor last
November but have since welcomed a government report criticising the role of
the armed forces in the event.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 220 Filipino domestic servants are detained at the Philippine embassy
in Kuwait, awaiting repatriation after fleeing employers whom they had
accused of maltreatment.
The Philippines government has expressed surprise, however, not at
complaints of abuse, but that the women are in Kuwait - the government
outlawed the sending of servants there in 1989 and plans to investigate how
they got jobs in Kuwait illegally.
Illegal employment is just one of many problems that have accompanied the
increase in Filipinos working abroad. Despite the problems they have to
contend with, including rape, physical abuse, non-payment of wages,
infidelity of spouses left behind and even racial discrimination, Philippine
workers still go abroad in droves, in search of jobs which their economy
cannot provide.
Overseas workers send home more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) a year,
according to official estimates, although other informal remittances could
amount to another Dollars 500m. These revenues exceed earnings of the
country's leading merchandise exports, such as garments at Dollars 2.2bn and
semiconductors' Dollars 1.5bn.
Throughout the Middle East, Europe, US and Asia, an estimated 1.2m Filipinos
work as construction workers, seamen, hospital staff, domestic servants or
entertainers. A teacher can earn six times as much as a servant in Hong Kong
as in a public school in Manila.
A report by the Central Bank said that increased remittances helped offset a
Dollars 3.2bn trade deficit last year and contributed to a Dollars 1.4bn
surplus in the balance-of-payments position.
The overseas workers' contribution to the economy is expected to expand
further in the coming years, according to Mr Jose Sarmiento, head of the
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).
Overseas employment will remain an attractive option as long as Philippine
economic growth remains slow. Last year, about 2.4m people, or 9.5 per cent
of the work force of 25.58m, had no job and an estimated 750,000 young
people join the labour force each year.
Employment of workers abroad increased last year, with POEA-approved
departures reaching 615,019, an increase of 38 per cent from 1990, with a
further increase expected this year.
While the Middle East will remain 'a healthy market', he said, POEA is
looking at Japan and South Korea, where serious labour shortages are already
curtailing industrial expansion.
Representatives from Japanese companies have already called on the POEA
chief and expressed interest in hiring Filipino workers even though they are
awaiting Japanese government policy allowing the entry of foreign workers.
When that happens, Mr Sarmiento said, the Philippines should enjoy a
head-start.
Whether the government can cope with the corresponding increase in social
problems related to overseas employment is another matter, however.
Embassies' response to cases involving Filipino expatriates have been
tentative - bordering on indifference, according to some employers.
Meanwhile, a company belonging to Philippines businessman Mr Joseph Noel
Ducat has set up a foundation, with financial help from foreign partners,
that aims to give help to Filipino migrant workers in case of emergencies
and to establish ties with employers to prevent abuse.
Mr Ducat was captured, with two American companions, by Iraqi troops along
the Iraq-Kuwait border during the Gulf war. He says attempts to assist him
were snubbed by embassy staff and Foreign Ministry officials in Manila.
Mr Sarmiento believes that Philippine diplomats, particularly in countries
that hire big numbers of Filipino workers, 'should now look at labour as a
principal function'.
For instance, in the Middle East, the POEA chief notes, 'practically all the
oilfields are manned by Filipino workers. Most of the households of the
royal families are staffed by Filipino domestics. So are hospitals,
airports, and even the bureaucracy.'
On the basis of these 'strategic positions', he says, 'we should develop a
new diplomacy consistent with this reality.' Domestic-help diplomacy could
be unfolding in the Philippines.

CITROEN, the French car maker, has concluded a deal, backed heavily by
French state guaranteed credits, on the financing of a FFr5.2bn (Pounds
530m) joint venture to make small family cars in the central Chinese
province of Hubei, its most ambitious project outside Europe.
The company, part of the Peugeot group, said assembly of the Citroen ZX
hatchback will begin in Hubei this year.
Initially, the car will be put together from imported French kits, at a
temporary plant in Xiangfan. Output is to rise from 12,000 units in 1993 to
37,500 units by 1997, eventually climbing to 150,000.
The French group's partner is the Dongfeng Company, the leading Chinese
truck maker which will hold 70 per cent of the joint venture. Citroen will
hold 25 per cent, with 4 per cent held by the French bank, Societe Generale,
and 1 per cent by Banque Nationale de Paris.
This is the Peugeot group's second plant in China, where it already has a
factory in the southern city of Guangzhou which produced 17,000 Peugeot
cars.
Of the initial FFr4bn first stage of the project - capacity for 37,500
vehicles annually - low-interest loans guaranteed by the French government
represent FFr1.7bn, with FFr1.2bn of buyer credits from French banks
guaranteed by Coface, the state-owned export credit guarantee agency, and
FFr1.1bn from Chinese banks.
The second stage requires FFr1.2bn of investment, covered by the partners'
contribution to the start-up capital.

FT  10 APR 92 / World Trade News: German export credit policy to be reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S uniform export credit insurance rate is likely to be replaced by
the end of the year. A new system, involving at least five different premium
rates, will make it more expensive for German exporters to insure contracts
in risky countries, but cheaper in low-risk countries.
Germany has for many years been alone in providing exporters with a standard
premium rate. It has drawn criticism from exporters from other countries,
who complain that German exporters win an unfair advantage in competition
for contracts in risky third world countries.
'We accept that we cannot maintain (the standard rate) any more,' the
finance ministry said yesterday. 'There is a good case that we are making it
too difficult for exporters to win good risk business, while at the same
time attracting bad-risk contracts.'
Other pressure on Bonn has come from efforts inside the European Community
and the OECD to harmonise the terms on which countries provide export credit
cover.
The ministry emphasised that details of the new system, which will be
operated on the government's behalf by the Hamburg-based Hermes as at
present, have yet to be worked out. It will aim to reflect both country risk
and risk linked to particular buyers. Neither the number of different rates,
nor the spread between the cheapest and most expensive, has yet been
decided.
'The single-rate system has its advantages, and that is why it has survived
so long,' an official said. 'For exporters to risky countries, the advantage
is obvious. For the government, it avoided the need for difficult decisions
about political situations in different countries.'
The change comes at a time of increasing anxiety over Germany's exposure to
possible non-payment on many contracts in the former Soviet Union. Official
export credit cover amounts to about DM29bn (Pounds 10bn), but is larger if
direct aid and uncovered contracts are taken into account.
Germany has in recent years faced a widening gap between premium income and
payments made for contracts that go bad. Its accumulated deficit is about
DM12bn, according to the finance ministry.

TURKISH and Russian trade officials have failed to agree terms on settling
an outstanding debt owed by the former Soviet Union, throwing into jeopardy
a multi-million-dollar gas agreement, John Murray Brown writes from Ankara.
In talks in Ankara last week, the sides were unable to agree the repayment
of an estimated Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m). This amount represents credits
extended by Turkey's Eximbank to support Turkish companies in the former
Soviet Union, on the back of a 25-year gas protocol signed in 1984.
Russia argues that some of the credit lines were extended for contracts with
the other republics. Today it is unclear who assumes these obligations.

THE EC yesterday delivered its annual broadside on US barriers to trade in a
report that particularly targets Washington's 'increasing tendency' to
undermine the Gatt world trading system with unilateral or bilateral
solutions.
In addition to the 'Super 301' provisions of US trade law, often used to
trigger unilateral retaliatory action, Washington is tending to reach
bilateral deals with Japan, Korea and China, to the detriment of third
countries, as well as trying to extend extra-territorial legislation to
others.
As a result of last year's amendments to its Marine Mammal Protection act,
the US is boycotting tuna from Mexico and Venezuela for failing to keep
dolphins out of their nets, and threatening to extend a secondary boycott to
all countries, including the EC, which do not also ban their tuna.
However, the EC executive was also careful to point out that bilateral trade
flows between the US and EC still run at about Dollars 190bn a year, and to
laud the benefits of recently increased dialogue.

FT  10 APR 92 / World Trade News: Unfinished business over EC bananas - The
quota deal could cause some problems with Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's apparent resolution of the EC's banana conundrum has the look of
unfinished business about it.
The European Commission's decision to set a quota on banana imports from
Latin America may begin to resolve the long-standing problem of how to
protect traditional, high-cost banana producers within the single market.
But lobbyists acting in their interests are not yet convinced.
At the same time, opting for quotas rather than tariffs is likely to cause
collateral problems within the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation
negotiations, which will probably see their last chance of conclusion this
year on April 22, at an EC-US summit in the US.
It would be surprising, given the current state of EC-US trade relations, if
Washington were not to demand concessions for a Brussels waiver on bananas,
which, as one EC official put it, 'our farmers will have to pay for.'
The Commission has still to bring forward detailed regulations, but
officials say the quota system should work like this. The predominantly
Caribbean and African producers linked to the EC by the Lome Convention on
trade and development, plus the outlying territories like France's
Martinique and Spain's Canary Islands, will have the fifth of the west
European market they each have safeguarded. The first group has 19 per cent,
the second 21 per cent of what was 3.34m tonnes consumption in 1990.
The rest of this market, over 2m tonnes, is supplied by Central American,
so-called dollar zone exporters, who produce at around a half to a third of
the price of the EC's protected suppliers. Their share will be consolidated,
subject to the existing 20 per cent tariff which will now extend to Germany
too, and be allowed to 'evolve', officials say, at a growth rate of about 3
per cent a year. This the banana market, and protected suppliers are now
more or less at the limit of their capacity to produce.
But there is still uncertainty. Until Brussels produces de-tails, it will
remain unclear whether the dollar quota will be fixed at the 1.4m tonnes
originally envisaged - average imports in 1986-88 - or actual imports of
over 2m tonnes.
Equally, lobbyists for the Caribbean producers and companies marketing their
produce maintain that with no increase in protection but a rising quota,
Eurobananas would face growing price pressure.
One British analyst maintained that Windward Island fruit - supplying two
out of every three bananas eaten in the UK - could lose 30 per cent of their
price, erasing Eurobanana profitability.
Ms Clare Wenner, of GJW which represents the Caribbean Banana Exporters'
Association, advocates tradeable licences for dollar zone quota, so that
Eurobanana suppliers with access to them could average out their
profitability through cross-subsidy.
UK banana importers such as Geest get most produce from the Windward
Islands. Like some of their competitors, they signed contracts with dollar
zone producers, as a hedge against the more free circulation of bananas once
the EC single market comes into effect. Their prospects of selling dollar
fruit depend now on access to the new quota.
There is almost certain to be a cost for this arrangement within the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is hoping to conclude the Uruguay
Round this month. The five-year old Round requires all farm products to have
tariffs, which would be gradually lowered over the next six years.
Hopes are rising moderately that the US and EC can agree on farm subsidy
cuts - the main obstacles to a deal, along with services and market access.
Senior officials from both sides meet in London on Tuesday, before Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission president, meets President Bush in Washington on
April 22.
If there is a farm trade deal, the US will agree to allow subsidies to
farmers as compensation for price cuts, so long as the EC furnishes proof
they will restrict production, and they become degressive after six years.
The EC will agree to restrain the volume of its subsidised exports as long
as the US restrains exports of corn gluten, a cheap cereals feedstock.
The EC would also like export subsidy cuts to be on sectors like dairy
produce as a whole, rather than each product, hitting, say, high added value
products like cheese as much as skimmed milk powder. But within this
outline, the EC may now have to pay an additional price for protecting the
banana producers of Dominica and Guadeloupe.

FT  10 APR 92 / World Trade News: EC asks Japan to cut exports of cars by
100,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has asked Japan to export 100,000 fewer cars this
year than the 1.26m vehicles it shipped to the Community last year, because
of the downturn in EC, particularly German, demand.
But EC-Japanese talks in Brussels this week ended inconclusively, with
Japanese officials declining to accept the Commission's estimate of reduced
demand.
Further discussions are expected, perhaps in the margin of the visit that Mr
Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, is due to make on
business connected with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to Tokyo
in late April.
Last year's EC-Japan agreement on freeing the Community car market over the
1993-99 period sets no ceiling on Japanese imports into the EC for 1991, or
indeed any year in the transition period, except its very end. The agreement
simply 'forecasts' that Japanese exports to the EC in 1999 will be 1.23m,
assuming total Community demand in the previous year of 15.1m cars.
The Commission is not on very strong ground in seeking a cut in Japanese
imports for this year.
In Tokyo, Japan's ministry of international trade and industry (Miti) said
that another round of discussions with EC representatives was likely early
next month, and that the outstanding problem was an agreement on an EC
estimate of likely car sales within the Community this year.
A senior Miti official said the 'monitoring' agreement with the EC was
unlike the self-imposed ceiling set in 1981 for car exports to the US. That
ceiling was lowered from 2.3m vehicles to 1.65m for the fiscal year
beginning this month, as a response to increasing criticism from the US car
industry.
'In the case of the US, there is a government limit, but there is no
specific obligation in the case of the EC. We have agreed to monitor those
exports, but there is no legal requirement. What we do is consult with our
industry,' the Miti official said.
'We haven't stopped negotiating with the EC. They feel that car sales will
fall this year, and that the export level should be less than last year's
1.26m vehicles. But it seems that they are not sure how much car sales will
fall.'

FT  10 APR 92 / Yeltsin to pay a price for support of deputies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, today faces a resolution in the
Congress of People's Deputies condemning the economic policy of his
government and demanding changes in the memorandum on reform it has already
thrashed out with the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Yeltsin, who has sat stony faced through a barrage of criticism bordering
on insults for the past two days, said yesterday he may choose to speak
today in reply - though he that added he may give his response 'after the
Congress', implying he might, if he feels too hemmed in by the deputies,
carry the fight outside and appeal to the population at large.
However, the resolution which the parliament's editorial commission has
wrangled over for a day-and-a-half now has no clause demanding Mr Yeltsin's
surrender of his extraordinary powers, or of his position as head of the
government. Mr Andrei Nechaev, the economics minister, said after the
Congress session last night that 'this is the very most we could accept: any
more and we would have to resign.'
The price, however, of the government's staying in power - though it is not
yet completely certain that it is safe - is high.
The resolution calls for Mr Yeltsin to present a law on a new government to
parliament in a month's time - a demand which allows the government room to
manoeuvre.
However, it foreshadows the eventual stripping from Mr Yeltsin of his
special powers to bring in laws by decree and to monopolise the appointment
of ministers.
At the same time, further concessions will be made from an already grossly
strained budget.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, gave a short and well
received speech of controlled passion, in which he told the deputies that
the government would delay the energy price rises (set for June) and instead
raise prices by stages, would raise pension and social security benefits and
lower taxes. He claimed that the budget deficit had been kept to 1.5 per
cent of the gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year - a
figure much lower than that calculated by foreign economists.
'If this is failure, I do not know what success is,' said Mr Gaidar.
However, he added: 'Maybe the government made a mistake in creating an image
of a technocratic government'.
The final clause in the resolution says that 'the congress states to the
world community its decisive and firm intention to continue the policy of
economic reform'.
But it adds that that specific corrections must be made in the programme
submitted by the government to the IMF, and that a parliamentary delegation
would meet IMF representatives to clarify their position on the economy.

FT  10 APR 92 / Congress trembles before a president of the people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian Congress, which today enters its fifth hectic day, has trembled
before the prospect of directly challenging Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president.
It has wounded in its rhetoric, and forced Mr Yeltsin to defend economic
reform personally, but it has not yet dared to strike.
It has become plain that the conservative forces in the parliament are
stronger than at first supposed. Of more than 1,000 deputies, 653 are
described as against the government, 483 of these being radicals. A further
266 are 'only partial supporters,' while the core supporters number only
136.
This arithmetic has forced retreat on the central issue of economic reform.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, yesterday told the
deputies the government would further soften its position.
Further ministerial sacrifices have been prepared, and may have to be made.
In turn, a resolution calling for Mr Yeltsin's resignation from his post as
prime minister had been softened to one of condemnation of the government's
economic course.
How far that course will now be trimmed, and under whose effective command,
is unclear; how the government can continue to fund and increase programmes
and subsidies which are already breaking the budget is more clear, since the
only resort possible is to print money.
The view yesterday was that the government and reform would survive, but
badly weakened.
The second big issue is the constitution, which could come up at the
congress this weekend with a still more dramatic denouement. There are three
drafts: the official one, put out by the constitutional commission of the
parliament under Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, social democrat leader; the
'parliamentary' variant, drawn up by Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St
Petersburg; and the 'presidential' version, drawn up by Mr Sergei Shakhrai,
the president's legal adviser.
The central issue is how much power they give the president and parliament:
Mr Shakhrai's gives the most, Mr Sobchak's probably the least. Mr Yeltsin
has it in mind to dissolve parliament and seek a referendum vote of
confidence if the presidential version fails.
Here the lines are less clear: radical democrats and extreme nationalists
and communists (the last two having made a pact) are united in their dislike
of the presidential version. The constitutional commission's draft attracts
much criticism for its vagueness. And Mr Sobchak's plan, which would
reorganise Russia into new administrative units overriding the present
republican and district divisions which are a legacy of the Soviet system,
appears to have little support. It is possible that none will attract the
required two-thirds majority. Mr Yeltsin's position would be unchanged but
he would lack the constitutional support for his temporary extraordinary
powers.
The atmosphere is tense and laden, the debate at times harsh and extreme. Mr
Yeltsin is not by nature a compromiser. Efforts by centrist deputies to get
him to bend a little have met with a grudging response, and at any moment he
may choose to pull out of a forum he regards as invalid and appeal to the
people.

FT  10 APR 92 / Prophets of doom proved correct as the conflict in Bosnia
escalates / A report on how western recognition made the war inevitable.
Fighting will not be house-to-house but flat-to-flat
</HEADLINE>

THE DARKEST predictions of the outcome of the Yugoslav crisis are being
realised. Civil war appears to have begun in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the latest
Yugoslav republic to gain international recognition.
Serb irregulars seized the town of Zvornik on the eastern frontier with
Serbia yesterday and Belgrade radio said the predominantly Moslem town was
now a 'free city' under Serbian control. The radio also reported artillery
duels between the federal army and Croats in Mostar, southern Bosnia.
Many observers warned that violence in this central republic was inevitable
following the European Community's recognition in January of neighbouring
Croatia and Slovenia as independent states.
Germany, believing that immediate recognition would end the war in Croatia,
pressurised the EC to recognise the former Yugoslav republics. But this left
Bosnia in the rump Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation which remained.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy to Yugoslavia, said yesterday that US
and EC recognition of Bosnia had damaged the peace process. 'When we had
recognition of Bosnia . . . that again threw another factor of instability
into the stew, just as early recognition of the republics of Slovenia and
Croatia did.'
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, felt he had no choice
but to insist on independence for Bosnia before reaching agreement among the
three ethnic groups on the republic's future shape.
Bosnia, sandwiched between Croatia and Serbia, is now the scene of several
wars. These include a war among the ethnic groups within Bosnia to take
control of local communities, and a war waged by Croats, from outside the
republic, for control of western Hercegovina against Serbs and the Yugoslav
federal army. But the most serious war is that being waged by the Serbs
against Moslems and Croats, a war which is being masterminded behind the
scenes by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, and General
Blagoje Adzic, the acting federal defence minister.
Western diplomats based in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, say
Serbia appears set to fight a full-scale war in Bosnia despite a
deteriorating economy. They say that Mr Milosevic is ignoring diplomatic
pressure to stop the war and is making no effort to calm Bosnia's Serb
leaders who are known to take orders from him. Mr Radovan Karadzic, one of
these leaders, says Bosnia's Serbs, who account for one-third of the
population, have the rightful claim to 68 per cent of Bosnia's territory
based on their definition of ethnic occupancy.
In a pattern already made familiar in Croatia thousands of Serbian
ultra-nationalist fighters have been despatched to Bosnia on the pretext of
defending 'endangered' Serbs. They see themselves as threatened in an
independent Bosnia and want to remain in Yugoslavia with Serbia and
Montenegro, Serbia's close ally.
The current fighting is reviving bitter historical memories. The First World
War began in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, with the assassination of
Austrian Archduke Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist. And
during World War Two Serbs again showed their determination to fight for
their perceived right to live together.
Croats, who make up 17 per cent of the population, have also drawn their map
which includes 35 per cent of Bosnia. Diplomats say that Mr Franjo Tudjman,
the president of Croatia, is obsessed with annexing western Hercegovina,
despite Croatia's formal recognition of Bosnian independence.
The carve-up of Bosnia by Serbs and Croats would leave Bosnian Moslems, 43
per cent of the population, without a homeland. Moslems, backed by Croats,
support Bosnian independence but the descent into anarchy leaves all the
ethnic groups with no choice but to fight to defend their very existence.
The pattern of war in Bosnia risks following that of Croatia, which left at
least 6,000 people dead and 1m homeless. But in Bosnia, the stakes are even
higher. In Croatia the ethnic divide between Serbs and Croats was generally
clear. But there are no such precise divisions in the main towns of Bosnia.
All three communities have warned that fighting would not just be
house-to-house but flat-to-flat in the numerous high rise buildings which
surround Sarajevo. In ethnically mixed towns the fighting peaks and dies
without warning, only to ignite in other towns. A plethora of militia groups
is fighting in many local wars while military observers say at least
one-third of the federal army is deployed in the republic.
Later this month the main body of 14,000 UN peacekeepers is due to be
despatched to Croatia. But despite unsubstantiated hopes that their presence
will calm Bosnia it now appears more likely that the UN will have to
relocate its headquarters from Sarajevo which on Wednesday night came under
heavy bombardment by Serb irregulars.

FT  10 APR 92 / Demirel attempts to negotiate the Kurdish labyrinth: An
economic and human rights plan, has put reform back on to Turkey's political
agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS ALWAYS going to be difficult to argue the case for reform after the
recent bloodshed in Turkey's Kurdish region. But Turkish Prime Minister
Suleyman Demirel's bold pitch in introducing an economic package for the
region and submitting human-rights legislation to parliament has taken even
his closest supporters by surprise.
Incensed perhaps by the criticism from Germany, the European Community and
now by the Social Democrats within his own conservative-led coalition, the
veteran Turkish politician has seized the initiative to put Kurdish reform
back onto the political agenda.
The government can breathe more easily on the military front, having
thwarted the threat of a general Kurdish insurrection and drawn the sting of
the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), even though the military gains may prove
harder to translate into political advantage. The prime minister can also
point to some other achievements: two Kurdish-language newspapers have been
established and a private Kurdish cultural centre is being started. Even the
possibility of a Kurdish political party, another long-held taboo, is now
being discussed at the national level.
Nevertheless, many of Turkey's 10m Kurds remain disillusioned with Ankara's
politicians, the resentment exacerbated by what has been the security
forces' increasingly harsh counter-insurgency tactics. The latest violence,
with more than 100 people killed following demonstrations to mark the
Kurdish new year, has merely played into rebel hands.
Mr Demirel may now even find himself charged with caving in to PKK pressure:
by seeking social and political answers to the problem he is challenging the
hard-line view that only a military solution can bring peace. General Dogan
Gures, chief of the general staff, only last week repeated his threat to
crush the PKK, whose eight-year campaign for Kurdish independence has
claimed more than 3,000 lives. There have been renewed air attacks on
alleged rebel targets in north Iraq, underlining the government's claim that
the PKK represents an external threat, despite the growing evidence that it
is taking root inside Turkey.
Mr Demirel seems obliged to endorse his military publicly and has launched
an unusually forthright attack on the PKK's Syrian backers. He is planning
to send his interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin, to Damascus next week to
reiterate Turkey's concern at what it sees as Syrian complicity.
However, Mr Demirel's real fear is probably closer to home, with the
prospect of a racial backlash by ethnic Turks growing every day. Turkish
newspapers have become almost ghoulish in their profiles of the young
conscript casualties in the Kurdish east, bringing home to many Turks a
conflict which had until recently seemed quite remote. In some provincial
cities, Turkish businessmen already are refusing to employ ethnic Kurds.
Against this background, Mr Demirel's forthcoming submission of his
programme to parliament will be a difficult balancing act. This will be made
more so by the weak coalition between his True Path party and the Social
Democratic Populists (SHP). The coalition has insufficient support to throw
out the military's 1982 constitution, which many government officials still
maintain is at the root of the Kurdish problem.
Moreover, 16 of the 22 radical Kurdish deputies have resigned from the
coalition. While few Turks regret the departure of the Kurds' combative and
often disputatious parliamentary performance, Mr Demirel has lost a
potential channel for negotiations with the guerrillas.
All hopes are resting with Mr Demirel's human rights legislation, which was
approved last week by the Justice Ministry. The proposals envisage changes
in the criminal procedure code, particularly on police conduct during the
period of arrest and interrogation. The aim is to reduce detention periods,
provide suspects with access to legal counsel and thereby stamp out torture.
In an interview last week in the nationalist daily newspaper Hurriyet, Mr
Demirel also unveiled spending plans to introduce financial support for free
health care in the Kurdish region and for its unemployed.
The measures may well seem modest but, taken together with the human rights
legislation, they represent the first concrete measures in what is expected
to be a major political initiative to address Kurdish problem.

FT  10 APR 92 / Bundesbank warns on state aid for east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recovery in east Germany could be held up considerably if Bonn
plays too interventionist a role in the region's industry, the Bundesbank
warns in its annual report released yesterday.
The central bank also repeats its concern that the value of the D-Mark, as
well as German economic growth and employment, was at risk from inflation
and the weak state of foreign economies.
The bank made clear it had no intention yet of relaxing monetary policy. It
said consumer prices last year rose at their steepest rate since 1983.
Interest rates reached a post-war high in December.
While the annual inflation rate in March was more than 4.5 per cent, the
strength of demand in the construction sector had pushed up building prices
by 7 per cent. The bank repeated its warnings about high wage increases,
saying these would endanger stability.
On east Germany, the Bundesbank opposed any attempt at 'industrial policy',
saying: 'This could delay the necessary economic restructuring and increase
the risk that east Germany would remain an economically weak region for a
long time.'
The Bundesbank's view highlights a central dilemma of policy towards east
Germany. The government wants to avoid social unrest by keeping as many
people in work as possible, but also sees the need for a full-scale overhaul
of industry there. Thus uncompetitive sectors like shipbuilding and
chemicals are being supported in the hope of eventual recovery after costly
restructuring.
In this context, the Bundesbank again stressed the need to bring down state
borrowing and budget deficits, which have shot up as a result of
unification. Germany's public finances could be burdened too much if
transfer payments to east Germany - likely to total DM180bn (Pounds 63bn) -
continue to be high while more financial help is also required for eastern
Europe and EC financial demands increase.

FT  10 APR 92 / Late surge in support for Tories cheers investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES, government gilt-edged securities and sterling all rose sharply
yesterday in London, as investors were cheered by opinion polls indicating a
last-minute surge in support for the Conservative party.
As voting took place in the general election, financial markets reasoned
that a Tory defeat was not a foregone conclusion, in spite of the polls
which have pointed either to a Labour victory or a hung parliament for most
of the campaign.
However, trading in most markets was thin. This was indicative of the
extreme caution about efforts to predict the outcome of the election.
Many investors are braced for considerable volatility when the markets
reopen today.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose by
43.2 to close at 2,436.4, while gilts saw a half-point gain.
On currency markets, investors bought the pound in place of the D-Mark and
other units, on the basis that whichever government is elected is unlikely
to opt for a sterling devaluation.
The support pushed up sterling by 1 1/2 pfennigs to a London close of
DM2.8575.
Sterling also rose nearly 2 cents against the dollar, to Dollars 1.7665.
During the campaign, markets have generally expressed negative sentiments
about the possibility of a Tory defeat. However, after a 65-point fall in
the FT-SE index last week, the index has recovered 54 points in the past
four days.
Meanwhile, sterling has climbed this week by more than 2 pfennigs,
depressing expectations that a new government might be faced by a run on the
pound which could force up base rates, now 10.5 per cent.
Reflecting the more sanguine view in the money markets about such a
possibility, the three-month interbank rate was quoted last night at about
10 3/4 per cent, down about one-eighth of a percentage point. Last week, the
three-month rate, at which banks lend among themselves, had climbed to about
11 1/2 per cent, signalling that many investors thought a base-rate rise was
imminent.

FT  10 APR 92 / Fine weather signals high poll turnout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS

<TEXT>
FINE weather across the country promised a high turnout in yesterday's UK
general election, the closest contest for decades with the Conservative and
Labour parties running neck and neck, writes Richard Evans.
The Tory and Labour leaders, Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, both
maintained confidence that victory was just hours away.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, pictured after voting early this morning in his Yeovil
constituency, although confident of a high vote for the Liberal Democrats
said he had election day jitters.
With the Conservatives seeking a fourth consecutive term, Labour anxious to
regain power after 13 years in opposition and the Liberal Democrats gambling
on a hung parliament, there was a great deal at stake.
The fine balance as voting finished was shown by estimates from bookmakers
that of the Pounds 7m in bets placed, 45 per cent had gone on a Labour
victory and 45 per cent on a Tory win.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government's dilemma on abortion deepened yesterday, following a
decision to hold a new referendum on the issue after a referendum to ratify
the Maastricht treaty tentatively scheduled for June.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, told members of his Fianna Fail
parliamentary group that he wants to avoid the two issues become 'entangled'
and that the ratification of the treaty is the government's top priority.
Mr Noel Dempsey, the party chief whip, said: 'It would be devastating for
this country and future generations if we were to let these two issues
become entangled. . . we are not going to be stampeded into making hasty and
ill-judged decisions by any groups. We don't want to rush into another
abortion referendum as we did in 1983 with the results that we have now.'
It looks increasingly likely, however, that the abortion issue will become
central to the debate on the Maastricht treaty. EC law guarantees the right
of all citizens to travel freely within the community to avail themselves of
services legally available.
Dr Mary Lucey, president of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn
Child (SPUC), said yesterday: 'The Maastricht treaty will sell Irish unborn
lives for a mess of pottage, for money - as it's going this referendum on
Maastricht will be a referendum on abortion.' SPUC is the principal pro-life
lobby group in Ireland and played a key role in inserting the right-to-life
amendment into the constitution in a referendum in 1983.
The abortion referendum would be aimed at guaranteeing the right of women to
travel abroad for an abortion, and for them to receive abortion information
in Ireland. It would also seek to rectify the situation created by a Supreme
Court ruling last month which permits pregnant women who face a threat to
their lives to obtain an abortion abroad, but not otherwise.

FT  09 APR 92 / Wayward Bulgaria returns to path of reform: Plans for the
privatisation of state enterprises have put Sofia back in the International
Monetary Fund's good books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA'S economic reform programme is back on course following a
brain-storming session involving officials from Phare, the European
Community's special technical assistance programme for eastern Europe, the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the recently elected
Bulgarian government.
Also at what one Phare official described as 'a very big round table' were
experts from Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
'Their presence was important for all of us,' explained Ms Tania Brisby, a
consultant at DFC, a Spanish firm which Phare is financing to advise the
Bulgarian government. 'They made valuable contributions about their own
experiences on privatisation.'
The end result is a privatisation bill which parliament is now debating. 'It
is a very flexible bill. Its aim was to allow for all types of methods of
sale,' explained Ms Brisby. These would include public auctions and tenders,
and will be open to foreign investors.
Pushing through this privatisation bill is crucial. It will put Bulgaria
back on the reform track; it will secure a second World Bank tranche of
Dollars 100m which was delayed because the reforms were slowed down; it will
attract much-needed foreign investment; it could bring an earlier end to the
recession.
The bill envisages:
Establishing a privatisation agency to implement the programme.
Privatisation is expected to be a lengthy process because 95 per cent of
Bulgaria's enterprises are state-owned.
Transforming state or municipally owned enterprises into joint stock
companies for partial or total sale. Placing proceeds from privatisation in
a special bank account to cover part of the privatisation expenses.
Allocating 20 per cent of the stock or shares of privatised enterprises to a
mutual fund established by the government. An additional 20 per cent of the
proceeds from privatisation will be allocated to the same mutual fund. The
fund will be used to finance transfers to social security funds, and for
compensating former owners. The mutual funds will be managed by the
privatisation agency. Bulgaria, like Hungary, has avoided the cumbersome
Czechoslovak-type voucher scheme.
Giving employees of the state or municipal companies which will be
transformed into joint stock companies options to subscribe on preferential
terms for up to 20 per cent of the shares.
The preferential price will be half the share price. The number of
preferential shares an employee can hold will depend on length of service.
Bulgaria, unlike Czechoslovakia, has also avoided giving shares away free.
A year ago, Bulgaria was well on the course to economic reform. A coalition
government introduced the first phase of an IMF-backed stabilisation
programme to introduce tight monetary policy which would slash subsidies,
curb inflation, and reduce soft bank credits to enterprises.
The implementation of the initial phase of austerity measures had a much
greater impact on Bulgaria than several of the other east European
countries.
The reforms were introduced at a time when trade with the former Soviet
Union, which had accounted for more than 65 per cent of Bulgaria's foreign
trade, was collapsing. The country's enterprises were in no position to find
new markets.
Second, Bulgaria was dependent on the Soviet Union for about 70 per cent of
its energy supplies. The switch to the dollar clearing system, and Russia's
own economic problems led to sharp falls in energy supplies to Bulgaria.
The loss of the Soviet market, and energy shortages accelerated the decline
in industrial output. In 1991, output had fallen by 27.8 per cent compared
to 1990. Over the same period, imports fell by 17 per cent, and exports rose
by 0.1 per cent. Higher food prices and wage increases kept the inflation
rate at around 80 per cent. By the end of 1991, unemployment exceeded
400,000, or more than 10 per cent of the labour force.
Also, Bulgaria had little access to fresh loans from western governments or
commercial banks, mainly because all loans to Bulgaria were frozen after
March 1990, when the communist government imposed a moratorium on all
payments of interest and principal on its western commercial and government
debts.
Until the Bulgarian state recently agreed to guarantee its hard-currency
debt of Dollars 9.6bn to its commercial creditors, there was little prospect
of negotiating a long-term rescheduling of that loan. The government, headed
by Mr Filip Dimitrov from the Union of Democratic Forces, is now saddled
with this debt.
In the meantime, Bulgaria has been relying on an IMF stand-by arrangement,
which last year totalled Dollars 150m, and the first of two World Bank
structural adjustment Loans, which total Dollars 250m.
Despite the economic hardships of the reforms, the public backed them. But
in the latter half of 1991, the pace of reforms slowed, largely because
Bulgaria was preoccupied with the presidential and parliamentary elections.
In addition, internal bickering in the parliament, where the communists
remain the largest opposition party, virtually paralysed legislation,
particularly on privatisation and land reform.
The delay in pushing ahead with the reforms prompted the World Bank to
consider withholding a second tranche of Dollars 100m. There were also fears
that the recession would be prolonged. Hence the present sense of purpose.
'Bulgaria lost the momentum over the past few months,' a World Bank official
said. 'But the privatisation bill shows it is now getting back on the
rails.'

FT  09 APR 92 / Sweden ponders barring politicians from company
directorships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S politicians could soon find their moonlighting days are numbered.
For years, politicians have been able to supplement their income by sitting
on company boards, earning up to SKr100,000 a year (Dollars 17,200),
according to some estimates.
However, following a number of embarrassing scandals in recent months -
which have suggested that some politicians have little aptitude for
financial matters in their capacity as directors on a company board - the
Finance Ministry is looking at ways of reducing the influence of politicians
in the financial sector. The new Centre-Right government may then introduce
a bill in parliament this autumn.
The move is seen as long overdue by some members of the business community.
Already, the government has announced plans to privatise 35 state companies.
In addition, some Swedish savings banks - which are owned by foundations
with separate boards of directors - plan to merge to form a large banking
group listed on the stock exchange. Both measures are expected to encourage
a more 'business-like' attitude, with directors appointed to the board on
the basis of their expertise, and with responsibility to shareholders.
The Ministry of Finance says the decision to reduce the influence of
politicians in the financial sector stems from a number of recent scandals.
Only last month, Forsta Sparbanken, a savings bank with customers mainly in
the Stockholm and Gothenburg areas, announced losses of SKr5.7bn for 1991.
Forsta's financial problems emerged over a year ago, and have been blamed on
bad management, poor credit analysis and overexposure to the finance company
and real estate sectors. The bank's management resigned in April 1991 but
some members of the financial community question the responsibility of the
board of directors at the foundation which controls the bank.
At present, local authorities and county councils select the members of the
board for the foundations which control each savings bank.
'Surely it is up to the board to take steps to reduce the risk exposure,'
says Mr Leif Vindevag, a senior official at the stock exchange.
Like many of the other savings banks, the board of directors on the
foundation which controls Forsta contains several political appointees. Mr
Tommy Lindell, executive vice president of Forsta, says: 'Most of our board
members are political appointees  .. it is rather common in the savings
banks.' The board members are from across the political spectrum, he adds.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance says that under the present law, the
government appoints the chairman of the board and must approve the other
board members for the foundations controlling the savings banks. However,
this could change.
In addition, some observers believe the question of responsibility needs to
be addressed. In February 1992, Folksam, a mutual insurance group whose
board of directors is dominated by trade union representatives, revealed
heavy losses of SKr220m for 1991 with the prospect of further losses up to
1995. The company's managing director was forced to resign.
However, much to the surprise of the business community, Mr Stig Malm, the
chairman of Folksam's board and the head of LO, the powerful Swedish
Confederation of Trade Unions (which is closely associated with the Social
Democrats) announced that neither he nor the board would take responsibility
for Folksam's losses. Despite his lack of experience in running a business,
Mr Malm is still chairman of Folksam's board.
Even more embarrassing for the Social Democrats - who were ousted from power
last September - was the collapse of A-Pressen, the Social Democrats'
newspaper publishing group, in February. A-Pressen revealed that its
financial situation was far worse than expected - partly due to bad
management, but also due to the tough economic environment. In this case
heads did roll: the managing director was sacked, and Mr Bo Toresson, a
board member and Social Democrat party secretary, resigned from the company.
Mr Bjorn Karlin, who heads the Swedish share promotion organisation, an
independent body financed by listed companies, claims some change is already
taking place: 'The new government has put in fewer politicians and more
professionals.'

THE YUGOSLAV federal army said yesterday it had gained control of a key town
in western Bosnia-Hercegovina amid renewed clashes in the newly-independent
republic, writes Laura Silber. The army said it had found 20 corpses on the
streets in the strategic town of Kupres. It said Croat forces had suffered
heavy losses in the town, which a western diplomat said was vital for Croat
interests to gain control of the western Hercegovina region. Belgrade radio
reported heavy fighting for the second consecutive day in Mostar, south-west
Bosnia. Violence among the republic's main ethnic groups, has sharply
escalated over the issue of international recognition of Bosnia. Clashes
raged yesterday despite appeals for peace from Bosnian leaders. Artillery
and gunfire blasted Sarajevo, the capital, where municipal leaders said at
least 30 people have been killed this week. Sarajevo media warned people
should stay indoors and observe the night curfew.

   ZVORNIK, BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I DO NOT know if we will be able to defend the police station tonight,'
said the police chief of Zvornik as shots rang out piercing the silence.
The police station lies tucked beneath the hills from where the Moslem
police officers say their former colleagues, Serbs, are launching mortar and
artillery assaults on Zvornik.
Most of the 13,000 inhabitants of Zvornik, about 60 per cent Moslem and 40
per cent Serb, fearing war, have fled the town over the past week. It stands
deserted except for men wielding Kalashnikovs and hunting rifles.
Serbs control one section of Zvornik. The Moslem-controlled part can be
reached by crossing the bridge from Serbia over the River Drina. It leads to
a dead end, blocked by heavy vehicles and several Moslem guards carrying
automatic weapons.
'There is war, hysteria and panic. But no one has been killed,' said the
police chief who is afraid of retaliation and refuses to give his name. He
appears confused about what went wrong in the once-harmonious town. Last
week 40 Serb officers took weapons, cars and walky-talkies to form their own
police station. 'The situation detoriated over independence. Serbs want to
be part of Greater Serbia - we want an independent Bosnia,' says a Moslem
officer.
Zvornik is now under siege. The Moslem police and reserve officers pledge to
defend the town but a local journalist says: 'This area cannot be defended
whenever they want Zvornik will be captured.' While they maintain their
all-night vigil, the police chief, is trying to organise an exchange of
prisoners. 'We captured four Chetniks (Serb extremists) last night with
automatic weapons, knives and a metal chain used for strangulation.' He
tells an army intelligence officer in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal
capital: 'I want them to get out of town safely, not only because of them -
but because of the situation.'
The policemen wonder if their Serbian prisoners, who say they were in town
awaiting orders, were a provocation. They believe that it may have been an
attempt to provoke real violence instead of this bloodless war. A panicky
officer reports news of an imminent attack. The shooting becomes louder.
They peer through the windows looking for the invisible snipers.
The police chief says: 'The future of Zvornik is not decided here.' He
estimates that at least 2,000 ultra-nationalist Serb fighters have come from
Serbia and are in the region waiting to attack.
Back across the river, dozens of Serb police officers and irregulars stand
guard, waving away bystanders.
'Hey, where are you going? Don't cross the bridges,' one officer in full
combat gear, calls out to two Serb peasant women. 'They're shooting over
there.' Another Serb woman tells how she must reach her children in Malesic,
a village by Zvornik. But a Serb policeman angrily interrupts her and tells
watching journalists to go home. 'Get away, go back to America,' he shouts,
showing his anger at the US and EC recognition of Bosnia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK OF an opinion poll indicating a late swing in favour of the
Conservative party ahead of today's UK general election sent stock index
futures sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo.
A four-point decline to 2,400 in the June contract on the FT-SE, shortly
after the market's opening, was halted as independent traders turned buyers
on talk of a change in fortunes for the Tories.
That fall, to 2,400, proved to be the low of the day, for June continued to
advance for almost the rest of the session, buoyed by strong performances in
the gilts and sterling markets and ignoring the weakness on Wall Street.
A notable feature came in the closing minutes of the session, when a
well-known independent trader bought 150 contracts as June stood at a high
premium to cash. The filling of that order sent June into retreat to finish
at 2,438, up 10 from the previous day and some 23 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of about 22.
Trading in the FT-SE options accounted for a large part of the day's total
LTOM turnover of 35,410; there were 18,656 FT-SE lots dealt, up from
Tuesday's 12,028. BTR was the busiest stock option, having 1,255 contracts
transacted.

FT  09 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: US loses appetite for BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP change of attitude towards British Petroleum in the US, where
investors have been strong buyers for some time, knocked the shares, which
fell 6 1/2 to 245 1/2 p.
US investment house Smith Barney revised its recommendation from buy to
hold. Oil analyst Mr Michael Young said he had 'lost confidence in BP's
earnings power over the next few years'. He predicts first-quarter earnings
of 20 cents per American Depositary Rec-eipt and is holding his 1992 oil
price estimate of Dollars 19 a barrel.
In London, where the attitude is distinctly disenchanted, there was also
talk in the market of extensive redundancies within the oil company.
Finally, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull was telling clients that it was
increasingly cautious about the potential benefits of Columbia's Cusiana
oilfield, in which BP has a large stake.
Owners inquiry
The second Stock Exchange inquiry in as many weeks was launched into Owners
Abroad, the UK's second largest holiday group. Yesterday's move is believed
to centre on the collapse of the group's share price over the past month.
This has coincided with chairman Mr Howard Klein selling 690,000 shares to a
trust owned by the company for an employee share scheme.
It has also coincided with a series of anonymous notes being circulated to
Owners' employees and national newspapers suggesting that the group was
about to fall prey to rival Airtours. Both companies have denied that there
is any truth in the suggestion.
There was brisk business in Owners yesterday, 1.1m shares being traded, and
the stock ended half a penny down at 89p. Airtours slipped 5 to 239p.
Queens Moat falls
There was a mixed response to figures from Queens Moat Houses, one of the
leading UK and Continental hotel groups. While the profits were largely in
line with expectations, a warning from the group that there would be no
earnings growth over the next year hurt the stock, which fell 5 to 71p.
As expected, UK occupancy rates were dismal but a continued strong showing
in Europe underpinned what was seen as a generally solid performance. Mr
Paul Heath at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said he was likely to move from a hold to
a buy over the next few months, but expressed caution over the stock, which
has been prone to recent underperformance.
Kleinwort Benson, a bull of the shares, shaved its 1992 profits forecast to
Pounds 103m.
Power generators and regional electricity companies staged a late surge amid
speculation that an imminent opinion poll would give the Conservatives a
lead over Labour. On the other hand, traders noted that water issues, also
particularly vulnerable to changes in the political climate, did not show
similar gains.
Analysts suggested that the regional electricity groups have become cheap to
water shares recently and were due for a bounce, but this does not apply to
the power generators, which have remained relatively strong, with the
exception of the Scottish power companies. The Electricity Package rallied
Pounds 92 to Pounds 2,360.
Utilities analyst Ms Liz Christie at Goldman Sachs regards the Scottish
power companies as particularly attractive, believing them to be less
vulnerable to regulatory controls, and at the present price 'no one can
accuse the government of selling them too cheaply'. Water shares had a much
softer tone.
Costain Group dropped to 56p immediately following the preliminary figures
but rallied in the wake of a positive post results meeting with analysts to
close a penny firmer at 66p. Turnover in the shares was a hefty 6.5m.
However, Mr Graham Foster at Nomura, who reduced his forecast for this year
to Pounds 17m, said: 'The feeling still remains with Costain that they are
again promising jam tomorrow. I remain very cautious.' Hoare Govett cut its
forecast to Pounds 15m, while UBS is looking for Pounds 17.5m.
Information organisation Reuters Holdings retreated 36 to 1105p in reaction
to sharp falls on Wall Street, where traders said about 40 per cent of
Reuters shares were held in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).
There was also a note of caution from securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
at its morning meeting following the statement that Reuters' trading system
Globex is to be launched on June 25. The house said Globex was good news but
the shares had been at a substantial premium to the market.
Other UK stocks with a significant ADR weighting suffered as well.
SmithKline Beecham, about 33 per cent held in ADR form and which had been
heavily sold in New York, showed falls of 22 to 830p for the 'A' shares and
110 to 3750p for the Units.
Among transport issues, international freight company Ocean Group bounced
from recent weakness to add 7 at 309p after reporting a 6 per cent
improvement in 1991 profits at Pounds 51m.
Rolls-Royce put on 3 to 150p, boosted by a Smith New Court recommendation.
Speculation that Vickers would soon announce the outright sale of its
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary sent the shares moving forward 7 to 144p.
One analyst, however, discounted the talk.
British Airways retreated 8 to 240p, hurt by selling in New York and a stock
overhang in London, together with the rise in oil prices.
Pharmaceuticals group Fisons finished a penny firmer at 323p, after being 4
ahead at one stage, with 3.8m shares traded. Securities house Hoare Govett
hosted a 'reassuring' presentation by the company. New chief executive Mr
Cedric Scroggs and chairman Mr Patrick Egan spoke to representatives from
about 25 institutions. Hoare also reiterated its buy stance on Fisons,
arguing that the shares had underperformed ahead of Mr Scroggs' appointment.
Cynical fund managers and analysts returned unimpressed with the new Euro
Disney site outside Paris. The visit on Tuesday was meant to present a
bright image of the resort ahead of its opening this weekend. Yesterday the
shares tumbled 85 to 1465p.
Among insurers, Prudential stood out with a rise of 7 1/2 to 208p. Smith New
Court decided that the stock looked cheap after sustained underperformance
and was discussing the company with clients yesterday.

FT  09 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities slide on Japanese bank fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about the possibility that one of the leading Japanese banks may
have defaulted on a swaps deal, triggering a crisis in the Japanese banking
system, caused a wholesale retreat by a London market which had only just
regained its poise after a prolonged bout of election jitters. London was
one of many leading European stock markets losing ground during the day.
However, the equity market managed to regain a measure of stability ahead of
today's general election, recouping around two thirds of losses incurred
during the early part of the trading session.
The international developments hit London hard as the market opened. Dealers
cut their opening quotations in reaction to a fresh bout of turbulence on
Wall Street and in Tokyo.
The latter's recent plunge, which has seen the Nikkei average drop from
about 22,000 to around 17,000, was seen as the catalyst for an overnight
62-point setback by Wall Street.
The FT-SE Index was initially quoted down just over 30 points but
immediately began a sustained rally. The trend was attributed to hints that
the ruling Conservative party had begun an eleventh-hour rally in the polls.
Rumours abounded that at least one of the opinion polls published this
morning would show the Tories ahead of Labour.
The Footsie came within a whisker of being up on the day - showing a 0.7
decline at 2,403.5 - but Wall Street came in sharply lower amid the Japanese
banking stories and proceeded to demolish London's painstakingly rebuilt,
but still fragile, confidence. The index ended the session a net 11 lower at
2,393.2.
International markets have for some while been concerned about the slide in
Tokyo. One leading economist said that further setbacks would cause serious
weakening of the Japanese banks' capital ratios and force them to sell US
shares, bonds and property. 'It follows that Wall Street would slide, taking
London and other markets with it,' he added.
In spite of such fears, traders in London took heart from the stability of
sterling and persistent demand for gilt-edged. At the close, sterling was up
against the dollar and D-Mark. The three-month interbank rate, an important
guide to UK domestic interest rate trends, eased further to around the 10
1/2 per cent mark.
The opinion poll rumours sparked a flurry of buying of the regional
electricity companies (recs), but the demand was at the expense of water
shares, which moved in the opposite direction, still spooked by worries of a
windfall profits tax.
Tuesday's strong support for Reuters evaporated after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
and BZW were said to have been keen sellers of the shares.
Fisons, still regarded by many as a takeover candidate, attracted persistent
buying, helped by a broker's presentation. BP, on the other hand, fell
further after a leading US brokerage removed the stock from its buy list.
Turnover in London held up relatively well at 472.9m shares, considering
that most fund managers have already put the finishing touches to their
pre-election portfolios.

FT  09 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls for second day in
nervous trading
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
CONTINUED weakness in Japanese stocks, concern that US equities are
over-priced, and another wave of index-related program selling pushed Wall
Street sharply lower for the second day, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after dropping as low as 3,163.47 in the
morning, closed 32.20 down on balance at 3,181.35 for a two-day plunge of 94
points. Total New York SE volume was a heavy 249.3m shares. Declining issues
led advances by 1,392 to 409 on the big board. The Dow's lowest close of the
year was 3,172.41 on January 2.
The falls were less dramatic in other market indices, which analysts said
had started to correct ahead of the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.56
off at 394.50, while the Nasdaq composite lost 7.93 to 573.68.
Bank issues were particularly hard hit by the erosion in their Japanese
counterparts. Rumours that a Japanese bank had failed to make a payment on a
swap contract swept through the market in the morning, prompting Bankers
Trust to deny rumours that it had taken a large loss from the failure of a
swap transaction.
JP Morgan and Bankers Trust dipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/8 and
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 respectively. BankAmerica shed Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 38 7/8 but Citicorp edged forward Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 1/4
.
IBM was one of the few blue chips to buck the trend yesterday, adding
Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 84 7/8 . The improvement was attributed to a higher
rating of the stock by Merrill Lynch.
Blue chips falling in active trading included AT&amp;T, off Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 40 7/8 , and General Electric, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 72 7/8
.
Wal-Mart continued to see active trading following the death of the
company's founder earlier this week. The stock, which had moved higher
immediately after the news of the death of Mr Sam Walton, lost Dollars 1/4
yesterday to Dollars 51 3/8 .
Among big retailers, Sears rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 44 5/8 , Woolworth
improved Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 29 and The Limited slipped Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 26 1/8 .
In the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
55 7/8 but Microsoft improved Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 117 1/4 .
Teledyne plunged Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 22 3/4 after the electronics
equipment company posted first-quarter operating profits of 21 cents a
share, compared with 28 cents a year earlier.
Primerica, which owns Smith Barney Harris Upham, fell Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 37 on fears that the securities sector may not be able to maintain
its record earnings.
Canada
TORONTO continued its downward trend but ended above the day's worst. The
composite index lost 18.5 to 3,318.1, after Tuesday's 49-point drop. The
index touched 3,299.1 at its low for the day. Falls outscored gains by 443
to 152 after volume of 27.4m shares.
Traders said the market is nervously looking ahead to the US producer and
consumer price indices for March due today and tomorrow respectively.
Depending on the figures, the market could see the US Federal Reserve ease
its monetary policy.
Power Corp dipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 14 1/2 after the company
reported slightly lower fourth-quarter earnings. Power Financial gave up
CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 19 1/4 after announcing higher fourth-quarter
earnings.
Alberta Energy, up CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 10 1/4 , increased its annual
dividend to 35 cents a share from 33 cents.

FT  09 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris hit as most bourses
contain losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARIS was the worst hit on the Continent, as other bourses contained their
losses, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS suffered more than other European bourses because of its gearing to
Wall Street. The CAC 40 index fell 67.90 or 3.4 per cent to 1,907.48 as
turnover accelerated to FFr3bn at the close from just FFr1.2bn at lunchtime.
Euro Disney was one of the day's most conspicuous fallers, losing FFr7.40 to
FFr141.50 in trading of 2m shares. The stock has been depressed by an
increasing number of sell notes from brokers and there were also reports
that analysts and fund managers had not been impressed by their visit to the
theme park this week. Worries about Euro Disney's rapid turnover of staff
and fears of industrial action by Parisian RER train drivers and the
domestic airline Air Inter also weighed on the stock.
Alcatel fell back FFr29 to FFr595 after its recent rise. After the close it
reported a 20 per cent increase in net attributable profit to FFr6.18bn,
ahead of expectations of FFr5.9bn.
FRANKFURT was cautious ahead of the result of arbitration in the public
service sector pay dispute. The deadline was due to expire last night.
The DAX index closed down 19.41 or 1.1 per cent at 1,720.01, up from its
intraday low of 1,717.52. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, shed 9.43
to 702.06. Turnover fell to DM5.4bn from DM6.7bn.
News that Volkswagen was recalling 650,000 Golf and Jetta cars in the US to
correct a problem connected with the cooling system pushed the shares down
DM8.50 or 2.3 per cent to DM366.90. Volkswagen is understood to have made
provision for the problem, which could cost up to Dollars 100 per car. Other
car stocks were weaker: BMW was down DM8.5 at DM575 and Porsche DM3 lower at
DM550.
BHF Bank became the latest bank to report strong 1991 earnings results with
group net profit up 11 per cent. Its shares fell 40 pfg to DM433.60 in spite
of news that the first quarter of 1992 had been positive and forecasts of
steady growth for the rest of the year. Other bank shares were depressed:
Deutsche Bank slipped DM7.5 to DM710.50 and Dresdner Bank was DM3 weaker at
DM350.50.
The shipbuilding and engineering group Bremer Vulkan bucked the trend after
it announced that it was to pay its first dividend in 15 years. It closed up
DM1.30 at DM78.60.
MILAN continued to fall, depressed by the overnight declines in Tokyo and
New York, and political uncertainty at home as the parties started
consultations to form a government. The Comit index fell 6.66 or 1.3 per
cent to 496.74 in turnover of around L100bn after L93.4bn.
Among leading stocks, Fiat fell L60 to L4,710, Montedison shed L22 to L1,325
and Generali dropped L480 to L28,300. San Paolo, the recently-listed bank,
dropped L85 to L11,950.
Telecoms showed some resilience. Sip rose L3 to L1,444 after announcing a
rise in the 1991 dividend, which came as a surprise to some analysts. Stet
eased L39 to L2,109. Benetton lost just L30 to L13,320, supported by US
buying.
AMSTERDAM was weakened by Wall Street. The CBS Tendency Index was 1.6 lower
at 125.8 in turnover of Fl 600m.
Philips, which announced that it was to exercise its option to purchase 6m
shares in Blockbuster of the US, the world's largest video rental company,
finished 30 cents down at Fl 36.40.
A forecast of strong earnings in 1992 from Nijverdal-Ten Cate lifted its
shares by Fl 2.80 to Fl 108.50. The plastics manufacturer also said it was
launching a Fl 100m convertible bond. IHC Caland, the
dredging-to-engineering group, put on Fl 1.20 to Fl 66.00 after telling a
London presentation that it expects good 1992 earnings.
ZURICH closed 1 per cent lower with the SMI index down 23.4 at 1,827.1.
Roche certificates eased SFr60 to SFr3,100 and Nestle bearers were SFr70
weaker at SFr9,430.
BRUSSELS closed at its lowest level since mid-February. The Bel-20 index
shed 17.73 to 1,170.54 in turnover of BFr970m.
LISBON bucked the global trend, the BTA index rising 13.8 to 2,094.2.

FT  09 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates still soft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRISKY trading at the short end of the UK money markets sent the June
sterling contract higher in the last day before the general election.
'It has been a whippy day,' said one dealer. 'Short sterling has been up and
down and all over the place.'
The June contract touched a high of 89.17 from an opening of 88.93 in very
high volume of trading.
During the mid-morning, rumours of an opinion poll putting the Conservatives
three points ahead of Labour excited the market.
Since the pollsters, still crunching the findings of the poll, were unable
to confirm the rumour the market had to wait until after the close for the
final outcome.
Nevertheless, the rumour permeated dealing rooms, creating a grain of
optimism. Rates, helped by large amounts of money 'sloshing around' the
short end, held their earlier improvement.
The three-month sterling interbank rate opened  1/8 point down at 10 7/8 -10
3/4 per cent after touching a high of 11 1/2 per cent last week. It eased
further to close at 10 13/16 -10 per cent. One year rates also eased to
11-10 7/8 per cent from Tuesday's close of 11 3/16 -11 1/16 .
The market is still expecting base rates - currently at 10.5 per cent - to
rise by at least half a percentage point after the election.
There seems little doubt that the foreign exchange market will test a Labour
chancellor's commitment to keeping sterling at its current value within the
European exchange rate mechanism, but opinion is divided as to whether rates
will have to rise. Some dealers believe central bank intervention will be
suff-icient to shore up sterling without the need for a base rate rise.
The Bank of England continued to pursue its aim of keeping the market calm
during the last few days of political uncertainty.
The Bank's initial forecast of liquidity shortage was Pounds 550m, later
revised to Pounds 700m. It operated in the morning, buying Pounds 650m of
band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The shortage was further revised in
the afternoon, this time to Pounds 800m, and the Bank bought a further
Pounds 25m of band-1 bank bills at the same rate.
Although the market was apparently left some Pounds 125m under-relieved,
dealers said there was no tightness in the closing stages. Overnight rates
finished at 8 7/8 -8 3/4 per cent.

FT  09 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen moves to centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN took centre stage in London yesterday, as another steep fall in
Tokyo stocks prompted worries that Japanese banks would repatriate their
money to prop up weakened balance sheets, writes Emma Tucker.
The Nikkei's further 616-point drop in Tokyo prompted the market to dwell on
three scenarios: that Japanese investors would move funds abroad; that
foreign investors would move out of yen; that Japanese institutions would
bring their money home. The last argument dominated.
A US bank trader said: 'Repatriation has been the buzz-word all day and it
has shaken a lot of people out of long mark/yen positions.'
A modest dollar rally in the morning was stopped when Wall Street opened. An
early 50-point slide by the Dow Industrial Average, on top of Tuesday's
62-point plunge, was just another factor making investors nervous about
holding US assets - they are already worried about faltering Tokyo stock
prices, a feeble US recovery and political concern in Europe.
By mid-afternoon the dollar stood at DM1.6255/65 after a DM1.6220/30 finish
in Asia and at Y132.25/32 from Y132.32/39. It closed in London at DM1.6255.
Later in New York it ended at DM1.6274/79 and Y132.68/75.
Mr Steven Barrow, an analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said no clear trend
for the dollar emerged yesterday. 'The market is still unclear about the US
recovery and what sort of momentum it has.'
Meanwhile, sterling continued to look perky against the D-Mark in the face
of political uncertainty. Rumours that an NOP poll would put the
Conservatives 3 points ahead of the Labour party swept through the markets
in the morning, buoying the UK currency even though the findings could not
be confirmed until the evening.
'It was an obviously silly rumour, but perhaps it helped pull the pound up a
bit,' said one analyst.
The UK currency opened at DM2.8392, rose to a high of DM2.8454 in late
trading and closed at DM2.8425. Against the dollar it was static at the
Dollars 1.75 level for most of the session.
The escudo, still a very volatile currency, ended its third day in the ERM
on a softer note at 86.07/12 to the D-Mark, from 85.70/75 on Wednesday
night. Traders said the slip may have helped sterling.
An analyst commented: 'Perhaps the market was anxious that the escudo could
put pressure on sterling by rising strongly within the EMS, but that has not
happened.'
It remained the EMS grid's second highest currency, after the Spanish
peseta, but slipped to 4.69 per cent above its pivot rate against sterling
from 5.27 per cent.
In spite of its gains elsewhere, the pound ended against the Spanish
currency at Pta180.58/62, the lowest level permitted by the ERM.

FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IPE nears deal on oil contracts
links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S International Petroleum Exchange is close to agreement with the New
York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) on a cross-margining link for the two
exchanges' crude oil contracts. That would make it cheaper for international
traders to use both markets and could increase the IPE's turnover.
Mr Alastair Harris, IPE's director of marketing and Research, said that
although talks had progressed slowly, the exchanges could reach agreement by
mid-year. Both exchanges were keen to agree such a link - it was up to the
clearing houses for the two markets to work out the technical details.
A cross-margining link means that traders taking out positions in London
could use them to offset higher margin (collateral) charges for business
done in New York. It would make it cheaper for international trading houses
to continue trading through the night or early morning once the London or
New York market had closed.
The IPE got off to a slower start than the Nymex where crude oil futures
traded 21.6m contracts last year. However, volume slipped slightly from 1990
when crude oil traded 23.7m contracts.
Mr Harris pointed out that trading on the IPE is increasing, with volume
rising to about 30 per cent of that seen by Nymex.

INDONESIA HAS protested to the US about its ban on imports of Indonesian
tuna and has intimated that it will not accept conditions which would allow
the ban to be lifted.
The embargo, which began in January, is the result of US concern that the
catches of yellow fin tuna had entailed the netting of sea dolphins, and
that Indonesia was importing tuna from other countries with similar
practices.
A statement from the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture said that Indonesian
fishermen did not catch dolphins, and that there was an active environmental
programme to protect rare wildlife species.
The statement said that Indonesia had never imported tuna from Mexico,
Venezuela and Vanuatu - countries which the US says are the worst offenders.
Nevertheless, the statement said that Indonesia expected the ban to be
withdrawn soon.
Indonesia will not ban the possible import of tuna from these countries.
That would be contrary to the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, the statement says.
The US embassy in Jakarta said it had noted the protest but had not been
asked for an official response. Indonesia's raw and processed tuna exports
to the US in 1990 were worth Dollars 25.4m (Pounds 14.70m).
Indonesia's main export market for fish products is Japan, which has itself
recently complained about residue levels of the anti-biotic tetracyclin in
Indonesian shrimps. In 1990, Indonesia exported Dollars 918m of fish
products, mostly to Japan, of which shrimps made up about three-quarters of
the total. Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture is checking procedures to
ensure shrimps meet export quality standards.

FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Algeria throws gas export sales
policy into reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SONATRACH, the Algerian state oil and gas monopoly, has decided that all
future natural gas export deals, over and above volumes already contracted,
will be channelled through joint ventures with foreign partners. That
reverses the previous policy of going it alone on gas sales.
Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the Algerian Minister of Hydrocarbons told a
recent seminar in Washington that the joint ventures would cover not simply
gas production but the whole chain, from well head to burner tip. As many of
the foreign partners would be based in Europe, they would be able to assist
Sonatrach's gas sales in Algeria's natural market, he said.
Algeria has sold all the gas its present production and export capacity can
cope with until well beyond the turn of the century. A gas-hungry Europe
wants more. To meet any expansion of demand, Algeria's oil and gas monopoly
must invest in new capacity: in gas production, pipelines, liquefied natural
gas ships and perhaps new plants.
According to Mr James Ball, director of the Gasmatters newsletter, the
European Community's other principal suppliers - the Netherlands, Norway and
the Commonwealth of Independent States - have sold all the gas they are able
to produce by 1995.
The Algerian action, he says, 'steals a march on the other exporters by
positioning Algerian gas at the front of its competitors'.
Sonatrach has been holding discussions with Ruhrgas, which is apparently
seeking to buy 3-5bn cubic metres of gas a year from 1995. Discussions are
also proceeding, according to the weekly Petrostrategies newsletter, with
British gas and Enron, the US gas and power company. The latter is building,
with ICI, the world's largest combined heat and power gas plant on Teeside
and has plans to build more such plants in Europe.

FT  09 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally as dealers cover short
positions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GILT prices rallied  3/8 point as dealers rushed to cover short positions
ahead of today's general election. The market was boosted by buying interest
from foreign investors, suggesting that fears about sterling weakness may be
subsiding.
Many dealers have been running short positions ahead of the election, and so
were caught short of bonds by the rally. However, some traders have been
flattening their positions on the grounds that a Labour victory in the
election has been largely discounted.
The short end led the way, with the short sterling future on Liffe up 1/4
point, suggesting that fears of interest rate rises after the election may
be subsiding. The market was also boosted by rumours of a new poll showing
the Tories three points ahead of Labour.
The short end of the market outperformed long-dated government bonds in
France and Germany, in choppy trading conditions. French and German 10-year
government bond future contracts failed to break through key resistance
levels, and dealers reported some profit-taking.
The OAT future on the Matif, the French futures exchange, ended down 0.10
point at 107.90, while the Bund future on Liffe in London closed a touch
lower at 87.90.
A speech by France's new prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, underlining a
stronger emphasis on economic growth, had been largely discounted by the
market, according to dealers. Improved retail demand for short-dated paper
should help the market absorb this month's auction of two- and five-year
bonds, dealers added.
US Treasury prices edged lower yesterday on the back of the Treasury's
seven-year note auction and a sharp drop in the US equity market.
In late trading, the bellwether 30-year bond was  7/16 lower at 1001 7/8 ,
yielding 7.92 per cent, while the two-year note slid  1/32 to yield 5.28 per
cent
The Federal Reserve refrained from intervening in the open market, and in
late trading Fed funds were changing hands at 3 3/4 per cent.
Trading was dominated by the poor results of the afternoon's auction of
Dollars 9.75bn in seven-year notes. Players were unsettled by the 1.93 per
cent bid;cover ratio and the average yield of 7.11 per cent with a
three-point tail.
The short end received some support from renewed speculation that weak money
supply growth and a sluggish recovery might prompt the Fed to ease monetary
policy.
IN the German market, the yield curve steepened further, as the Euromark
contract rallied by  1/8 point. Dealers said the view that inflation had
peaked and an interest cut may come sooner than had been thought, helped
buoy the short end. There were further rumours, again denied, of a public
sector wage settlement.
JAPANESE government bond prices stabilised, helped by the stock market,
which ended off its lows. The market remained nervous, though, with rumours
of further problems in the banking sector.
However, there was also some speculation that the Bank of Japan may speed up
the process of easing interest rates.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Bonds: Italians snap up World Bank's Ecu200m
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW issues received positive response from investors in the
international bond market yesterday, although syndicate officials were
unwilling to predict an end to the current uncertain tone of the market.
The World Bank launched a Ecu200m 10-year floating-rate note issue,
lead-managed by UBS Phillips and Drew. The paper pays  5/8 per cent less
than the three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), but was
re-offered to investors at 99.85. At this level the discounted margin was
0.57 per cent under Libor.
The paper appealed to investors anxious to buy a floating-rate asset at a
time of growing uncertainty over the future direction of interest rates.
However, most of the bonds were snapped up by Italian investors, who pay no
withholding tax on bonds issued by the World Bank and other supranational
bodies of which Italy is a member.
The syndicate of banks selling the issue was half composed of Italian banks,
with Credito Italiano joint lead manager. Italian syndicate officials said
uncertainty following parliamentary elections in Italy this week, and
persistent speculation about a revaluation of the lira within the European
exchange rate mechanism, added to the attraction of a floating-rate
investment denominated in a foreign currency.
Buying by Italian investors created a shortage of paper in the market. This
was only partly relieved by a decision to increase the size of the
transactions from Ecu150m to Ecu200m.
By the close of trading, the lead manager was quoting the bonds at 100.25
bid, well above the re-offer price.
Elsewhere, Toyota Credit Canada, a finance arm of the Japanese automotive
company, launched a well-received CDollars 125m five-year issue. The deal,
lead-managed by Wood Gundy, was slightly smaller than many syndicate
officials had expected, suggesting a cautious approach to the market
following the poor performance of other Canadian dollar issues this week.
For example, Province of British Columbia's Dollars 300m five-year deal,
launched on Monday at a yield spread of 54 basis points over Canadian
government bonds, was yesterday trading on a yield spread of around 58 basis
points.
The 9 per cent Toyota bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.50, where the yield is 48 basis points more than Canadian government
paper. The borrower carries a triple-A credit rating, higher than British
Columbia.
Participants in the deal reported good buying from retail and institutional
investors hoping that the yield spread would tighten over time. Outstanding
four-year bonds from the same borrower were yesterday trading in the
secondary market at a yield spread of 25 basis points.
Buying was easily enough to support the modest size of yesterday's issue,
and the launch yield spread held throughout the day despite a rally in the
Canadian bond market.

NEC, the Japanese electronics company, and MIPS Computer Systems, the US
microprocessor manufacturer, have agreed to develop jointly a 64-bit Risc
(reduced instruction set computing) chip for a wide range of uses, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
Risc chips, which process information faster than conventional
microprocessors because they have fewer instructions in a computer
operation, are mostly used in workstations.
Under the agreement, MIPS will design VRX chips according to NEC's
specifications, and NEC will get exclusive manufacturing and marketing
rights for the first year. NEC said it hopes to launch VRX products in the
latter half of 1993.
The new chip will be modelled on the MIPS R4000 central processing unit.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Hughes to head GM in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors of the US has moved quickly to fill the management vacuum at
its European operations with the appointment of Mr Louis Hughes as president
of General Motors Europe.
The promotion of Mr Hughes from his post as chief executive of Opel, GM's
German subsidiary, follows the surprise appointment last month of Mr Robert
Eaton as chairman-elect of Chrysler, the third largest of the big three US
vehicle makers.
Mr Eaton will succeed Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman and chief executive of
Chrysler at the end of the year.
Although educated as a mechanical engineer Mr Hughes, 43, has enjoyed a
rapid rise through the finance hierarchy of the world's biggest car maker.
Before becoming chairman and managing director of Opel in April 1989, he
held successive posts as finance vice-president of GM of Canada and then GM
Europe.
He was previously assistant treasurer in the US with general responsibility
for international activities involving financing and new business ventures
and played a key role in GM's negotiations with Toyota to set up a
manufacturing joint venture in Fremont, California, in the early 1980s.
As president of GM Europe Mr Hughes is taking over the leadership of
probably the most profitable volume car maker in Europe and the most
successful part of GM's troubled automotive operations.
While GM worldwide made a net loss of Dollars 4.5bn last year, GM Europe,
with a workforce of 128,000, achieved a net profit of Dollars 1.76bn last
year on a turnover of Dollars 25.4bn. GM Europe's core Opel/Vauxhall
operations produced a record net profit of Dollars 1.96bn.
GM, whose US management hierarchy has been thrown into turmoil this week by
board changes which have effectively limited the power of Mr Robert Stempel,
chairman, and have demoted his chief lieutenant Mr Lloyd Reuss, is vitally
dependent on its European operations as it seeks to staunch massive losses
in North America.
As chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, Mr Hughes, who was born in
Cleveland, Ohio, has taken pains to assimilate himself into the higher
echelons of the European motor industry. He has learned German well enough
to use it as his everyday business language at Opel's headquarters at
Russelsheim, near Frankfurt.
His presence in the inner circles of German business has been helped by the
high profile role GM is playing in investment in eastern Germany with the
building of a 150,000 cars-a-year assembly plant at Eisenach, close to the
site of the old East German Wartburg factory.
At GM Europe he will have overall responsibility for continuing the group's
effort to increase its production capacity by 25 per cent by the mid-1990s
in the face of mounting Japanese competition.
Mr Hughes will lead the company's vital new product programme - a key to its
recent success - with the launch next year of the new generation Opel
Corsa/Vauxhall Nova small car range.
GM Europe is also committed to an ambitious expansion in eastern Europe, not
only with the Eisenach plant but also with important projects in Poland and
Hungary.
At Opel Mr Hughes has been closely identified with GM Europe's efforts to
introduce so-called 'lean production' techniques, and with the Eisenach
plant GM is seeking to reach levels of productivity and efficiency to match
some of the best Japanese car makers.

CANAL PLUS, Europe's leading pay-television station, increased its 1991
consolidated net attributable profit by 18.8 per cent to FFr1.08bn (Dollars
190m) from FFr910m a year earlier, agencies report from Paris.
Operating profit increased to FFr1.91bn from FFr1.66bn. The figures allow
for a loss from affiliated companies of FFr354m against a loss of FFr194m in
1990.
Turnover amounted to FFr7bn, up from FFr6.13bn.
The net profit figure was in line with the company's own estimate. Earnings
per share rose by 16.9 per cent to FFr58.7 from FFr50.2 and Canal Plus said
it intends to raise its net dividend to FFr23 a share from FFr20.
Canal Plus said the strong rise in net profit last year occurred despite
provisions of FFr115.5m for TV South, a UK TV station in which the French
company has a 12 per cent stake, and for Carolco, a US film production
company in which a Canal Plus unit has a 10 per cent interest.
Last year's earnings were also affected by Canal Plus's share of the cost of
new ventures, which almost doubled to FFr290m from FFr150.2m.
Looking ahead, Canal Plus said it expects to maintain its growth momentum in
France, while subsidiaries are expected to grow at an even faster pace,
especially outside France.

FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: USF&amp;G sees first-quarter profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USF&amp;G, the large but troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday told
analysts that it expected to beat current market expectations when it
reports figures for the first quarter of 1992, posting a very small profit
for the period.
Mr Norman Blake, the company's chairman, said that net income for the
quarter will be around Dollars 2m to Dollars 5m, and that this will
translate into a loss per share of around 9 to 12 cents after paying
preferred stock dividends. Analysts had been predicting a loss of some 30
cents a share.
In the previous year, the first-quarter figures showed a net loss of Dollars
55m, or 70 cents a share.
For the full year, the deficit amounted to Dollars 176m, having reached
Dollars 569m in 1990 - in part, a reflection of charges arising from a
restructuring of the business.
Mr Blake acknowledged yesterday that the insurance environment remains
'soft', but suggested that the improved figures stemmed for the realignment
of the business. USF&amp;G has taken steps to overhaul its business under Mr
Blake's command - pulling out of workers' compensation business in certain
states, for example, ceasing to write new personal lines insurance in
others, and slashing both head office staff and branch offices.
Analysts, however, have questioned whether - in the process of improving the
bottom-line results - the fairly drastic cutbacks would undermine USF&amp;G's
franchise.
Part of the insurer's problems stem from souring real estate investments,
and Mr Blake acknowledged yesterday that his predictions for the first
quarter allowed for some further strengthening of real estate reserves,
together with core insurance loss reserves.
Shares in USF&amp;G increased by Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 9 3/8 on Wall
Street yesterday, having been close to Dollars 50 in the late-1980s.
Value Line ranks USF&amp;G as the 13th largest property-casualty insurer in
terms of premium volume, and around 60 per cent of its written premiums
relate to commercial coverage.
There has been talk of some improvement in personal lines pricing, although
few insurers think the cycle has turned, but commercial lines pricing has
been highly competitive and a further shake-out in capacity is thought
necessary.

THE FATE of LTV Corporation's aerospace and missiles business hung in the
balance last night as two rival bidding groups - one of them including
France's Thomson-CSF - twice increased their offers for the company in a New
York bankruptcy court hearing.
LTV has been operating under the protection of the court for the past five
years and needs its approval for the sale of any business.
Martin Marietta and Lockheed, the US defence groups which made a joint offer
for the LTV company, late yesterday raised their bid to Dollars 385m.
However this was still below the Dollars 430m offered by Thomson-CSF and
Carlyle, a Washington-based investment firm.
Thomson wants the LTV missiles business, while Carlyle would take the
aircraft side.
Northrop, another US defence contractor, decided against a last-minute bid
in conjunction with the Carlyle group.

investments

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBERIA Airlines would invest Pta760bn (Dollars 7.35bn) between now and 1996
to carry out medium-term strategic plans, chairman Mr Miguel Aguilo, said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Madrid.
He told a government committee the plan foresaw an average annual revenue
rise of 13.7 per cent between 1992 and 1996, and a 9.5 per cent rise in
costs. This should mean profits of about Pta4.9bn in 1992, rising to
Pta55.9bn in 1996.
He said 51 per cent of the investments would come from internal cash-flow,
33 per cent from bank debt, and 16 per cent from the company's
recently-authorised Pta120bn capital increase.
The state airline's financial costs are projected at Pta23bn a year until
1996, with total debt rising from Pta240bn at the end of 1992 to Pta345bn at
the end of the period.
Mr Aguilo said Iberia was not seeking alliances with European airlines.
'Alliances with European partners are not envisaged for now as our main
priority is the strategic plan,' he said.
He said the plan involved a greater international profile, improved service
and a stronger role in European, Latin American and east Asian markets.
Mr Aguilo said Iberia's fleet would incorporate 130 new aircraft between
1989 and 1996, and that 50 others would be retired from service during this
period.
Spain's new high-velocity train (AVE) and development of the country's road
network threatened Iberia, he said. Domestic traffic was expected to grow by
only 7.7 per cent, against a European average of 11.7 per cent, between 1992
and 1996.
Mr Aguilo said Iberia had not yet signed contracts to build its own terminal
at Barajas airport in Madrid. Nor had it decided whether to sell its
headquarters in the centre of the capital.
Iberia made a group pre-tax loss of Pta51.32bn in 1991, after Pta26.11bn the
previous year.

credibility

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of General Motors, which this week announced a large executive
shake-up, yesterday sought to shore up the battered credibility of Mr Robert
Stempel, the company's chairman, with a declaration that non-executive
directors did not intend to interfere in his day-to-day running of the
business.
A board meeting on Monday demoted Mr Stempel's long-time lieutenant, Mr
Lloyd Reuss, and also appeared to clip the chairman's wings when it
announced that Mr John Smale, a non-executive director, would take over Mr
Stempel's leadership of the board's executive committee.
This was generally interpreted as a rebuke to Mr Stempel, since the
committee has enjoyed the power to run General Motors between regular board
meetings.
However, the company yesterday belatedly explained that the executive
committee had never actually met, and its function had been changed at
Monday's meeting: it was no longer authorised to act on behalf of the full
board but now had the role of advising the chairman. The aim was to make
communication between the board and the chairman quicker and more effective.
Explaining Mr Stempel's replacement by Mr Smale, a company spokesman said:
'The chairman could not be the chairman of a committee that is meant to
advise him.'
Mr Smale, who played a leading behind-the-scenes role in encouraging
Monday's shake-up, himself issued a brief statement saying that outside
directors did not 'intend to involve ourselves in the day-to-day business of
GM.
'That job is the responsibility of Bob Stempel and he has the board's full
support and confidence in pursuing the goal to accelerate the return to
profitability of GM's North American operations.'
Despite these explanations, Wall Street observers said the new
responsibilities of the executive committee, together with the staff
changes, underlined the concern of non-executive directors at the pace of
change within the company, and their determination to get a more rapid and
thorough flow of information on developing events.

share offering

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Pepper/Seven-Up Com-panies, the third largest producer of soft drinks in
the US, is planning to float its shares on the stock market.
The Dallas-based company said yesterday that in two weeks it intended to
file the necessary registration statement for an 'initial public offering'
(IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities
industry watchdog.
The proceeds of the offer, which is expected to involve the issue of new
shares in the company, would be used to reduce debt and retire preferred
stock.
The company was formed through the merger of the Dr Pepper holding company
and Seven-Up in 1988. The combination created a third force to compete with
the two giants of the soft drinks industry, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.
Dr Pepper and Seven-Up were both purchased in 1986 by separate investment
groups, led by the same Dallas-based investment firm. Even prior to the
merger, management of the businesses was integrated to some extent, and
production centralised.
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up currently employs around 905 people and has its
production operations in St Louis, although the corporate headquarters is in
Dallas.
Its turnover last year increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 600.9m, while
operating profits were Dollars 138.2m, up 12 per cent on the previous year.
Aside from institutional shareholders, who are significant equity-holders,
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up's management holds a 19 per cent interest in the company,
making it the single largest shareholder at present.
Ahead of the filing, the group declined to say how many shares might be
issued or what sums it expected to raise.

frozen the pay of Mr Kenneth Derr, chairman and chief executive, and other
officers and personnel as part of the company's cost-cutting programme.
Mr Derr said the pay freeze, at 1991 levels, took effect on April 1 and
would remain for at least three months. In addition, bonuses tied to
Chevron's annual performance were significantly lower.
Chevron, which had a difficult fourth quarter, said it would cut capital and
exploratory spending by 11 per cent this year to Dollars 4.7bn.
Cost-cutting is expected to reduce operating expenses by at least Dollars
600m by the third quarter of 1993.
In addition, Chevron is shifting the focus of its upstream activities
overseas.
'The oil business is mostly moving overseas, partly by choice, but mostly
because we have no choice,' said Mr Derr. 'High potential areas for finding
new reserves are now off-limits to us.'
Mr Derr said the company expected to raise as much as Dollars 700m from the
sale of existing oil and gas fields in the US.
On Wall Street, shares in Chevron fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 64 7/8 in a
declining market.

COMPAGNIE Generale d'Industrie et de Participations (CGIP), the French
holding group controlled by the Wendel steel family, yesterday reported a
slight decline in net annual earnings.
The group - which is a principal shareholder in both CMB Packaging, the
Franco-British packaging group, and in Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's leading
provider of computer services - saw provisional net income decline to
FFr664m (Dollars 118.57m) last year from FFr698m in 1990.
This was 'a stable performance in a difficult economic environment', said Mr
Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, CGIP's chairman.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cadbury Schweppes gets German sweet
foothold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CADBURY SCHWEPPES is to acquire a foothold in the German confectionery
market with the cash purchase of 70 per cent of Piasten Schokoladenfabrik
Hoffmann, a privately-owned Bavarian chocolate and sweets manufacturer.
No price was disclosed. Cadbury said its planned holding had a net book
value of DM3.5m (Pounds 1.23m) and would contribute 2p per share to its
earnings next year. The balance sheet impact of the deal was negligible.
Piasten, which has 439 employees and its own sales force, had sales of
DM126.1m in the year to June and is said to be profitable. It is a leader in
the German boxed chocolate assortment market and also sells chocolate
liqueurs and bars, chocolate covered sweets and sugar confectionery.
Cadbury said the deal would allow it to introduce some of its confectionery
products in Germany and provided low-risk access to central and eastern
European markets, particularly Poland.
Piasten products might also be sold through Cadbury's operations in other
parts of Europe.
The deal, which is subject to approval by the Federal Cartel Office, gives
Cadbury an option to buy the remaining shares in Piasten at a price based on
the partial acquisition terms.

Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club controlled by Mr Alan

dividend payments. The company said a Pounds 6.8m deficit on the profit and
loss account prevented a dividend being paid, even though it had returned to

To eliminate the deficit, Pounds 7m would be taken from the share premium
account, which stood at Pounds 8.2m after a rights issue in December. A High

Clayform Properties blamed the continuing recession in the property and
retail sectors for another loss as a further fall in values necessitated
exceptional provisions against the group's development portfolio.
For the year to end-December, the property developer and shoe retailing
group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 39.1m)on increased
sales of Pounds 91.5m (Pounds 83.9m). Exceptional items of Pounds 9m (Pounds
31.5m) related to write-downs on development sites.
Net assets per share declined to 137p (201p).
Borrowings were almost halved to Pounds 58m (Pounds 108.5m). During the past
year 44 investments were sold realising Pounds 55m compared to their 1990
valuation of Pounds 58.1m. Although sales of developments proved more
difficult to achieve than investments, Pounds 25.8m was realised during the
year. The remaining portfolio was valued at Pounds 49.1m, a 7.9 per cent
fall.
Losses per share were 46.7p (101p). The final dividend is again passed
leaving shareholders without a pay-out compared to a total of 2p in 1990.

LOSSES AT Stylo, the footwear manufacturer and retailer, continued to build
up through the second half and for the year to February 1 totalled Pounds
9.06m at the pre-tax level.
The deficit, which compared with sharply reduced profits of Pounds 1.67m for
the previous year, was incurred from turnover of Pounds 91.9m (Pounds
87.5m).
Losses per share emerged at 42p (4.07p earnings) and the annual dividend is
cut to 2.5p (9p). The shares fell 30p to 143p.
Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman, blamed the loss on a number of factors, including
the increase in VAT.
He explained that as all of the company's shoes for the summer and autumn
seasons had already been purchased and because of competitive pressures it
was unable to pass the rise on to customers.

FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Stock Exchange launches probe into Owners
Abroad share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange have launched an inquiry into share dealings of Owners
Abroad, the UK's second biggest tour operator.
The probe is believed to centre on two issues: the dramatic fall in the
Owners share price in the past month - it has collapsed 37 per cent in that
period; and the sale of 690,000 shares by Mr Howard Klein, chairman, to the
company's employee share option plan.
While there is no suggestion that the latter transaction was in any way
illegal, the sale on March 31 was followed by a further slump in the share
price.
Mr Klein yesterday denied there was anything improper in the share sale. 'I
had made it known to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the company's broker, many months
ago that I needed to dispose of the shares for personal reasons. Phillips &amp;
Drew were consulted on the basis of the sale of my shares to the Esop and
they advised that it was perfectly in order.'
On the day that Mr Klein sold the shares to the Esop at 108p, the price
closed at 105p, to be followed over the next week by a rapid decline. Owners
lent the Esop the money to complete the transaction. Yesterday, the shares
finished  1/2 p down at 89p in busy trading.
It is the second inquiry in as many weeks into the holiday group. The first,
which is still believed to be under way, is investigating anonymous notes
sent to national newspapers and company employees that Owners was about to
be taken over by Airtours, its rival tour group. Both companies have denied
the story.
Yesterday's move by the authorities came only a day after Owners published
its reports and accounts for 1991, which caused concern in the market.
Analysts drew attention to the company's depreciation policy, particularly
on the treatment of one of its leased aircraft.

FT  09 APR 92 / Japanese bank shareslose their lustre: Heavy selling has
sent the sector down twice as fast as the Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slide of Japanese bank shares has been an important factor in the
remarkable loss of confidence in the Tokyo market this week. Heavy selling
of bank shares has sent the sector index down by 28 per cent over the past
11 days, while the Nikkei average has declined 15 per cent.
In the past, banks shares have traded at an exaggerated premium to the
market as a whole. The price/earnings ratio of the banking sector was 55 per
cent higher than that of the Nikkei index in August last year; now it is
only 8 per cent higher. 'The asset premium of Japanese bank stocks is
starting to be stripped,' says Mr Alan Bell, of Baring Securities in Tokyo.
Banks own 22 per cent of Japanese equity. Their strategic shareholdings in
leading clients and in fellow members of larger corporate groups, the
keiretsu, are seen as the glue that holds the Japanese corporate system
together.
In return, bank shares are held by bank affiliates, client companies and
members of the same corporate groups.
Even after companies raised increasing amounts of capital from bond and
equity markets in the 1980s, these relationships continued to be close.
For banks and companies, the obligation to maintain stable stakes in each
other was not a burden when the market was rising.
As a result, bank shares are seen in Japan as the least traded, most
illiquid sector of the market. While the ratio of stable shareholdings for
Tokyo stocks is estimated at 60 per cent, the ratio for bank stocks was
about 85 per cent.
Once the stock market turned downwards, however, companies started to look
again at their holdings of bank shares.
'Companies, already squeezed for profits due to the economic downturn, have
started to liquidate holdings of loss-making bank shares,' says Mrs Mineko
Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.
A company typically owns shares not only in its main bank, but also in a
range of related banks. It is these less-strategic holdings that are now
being sold.
Meanwhile, banking relationships have forced banks to support ailing
clients. For example, to help out Tobishima, an ailing property developer,
its banks have agreed to cut interest rates on Y210bn (Pounds 900m) in debt
from about 6 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent for a year; an affiliate, Tobishima
Urban, will have the interest rate on Y790bn of debt cut to 1 per cent
indefinitely.
This restructuring, announced last week, has added to the pressure on bank
shares - especially those of Fuji Bank, Tobishima's lead lender.
The bank had already forecast a 74.9 per cent decline in net profits to
Y30bn, due to losses associated with a fraudulent loan scheme. Its share
price has dropped 42 per cent during the past two weeks.
More downwards pressure has come from selling by foreign investors. Last
year, as the stock market slid, foreign investors were almost the only
buyers around, concentrating their purchases disproportionately on the
banking sector. They hoped to benefit from the impact of falling interest
rates on banks' profit margins.
Bank shares totalled 20 per cent of foreign exposure to the Tokyo market in
September 1991, up from 13 per cent the previous year. Now interest rates
seem to have bottomed, and foreign investors have been disillusioned by the
continued slide in the market.
In short, investors in Japan and abroad have realised that the banks have
been more badly bruised by Japan's financial turmoil than they had
previously conceded.
There is a deeper worry at work, however, than simply a re-rating of an
underperforming sector.
Banks had been leading beneficiaries from the sharp rise in stock and
property prices in the late 1980s. They made big unrealised gains on their
cross-shareholdings, and were allowed to count a proportion of these
unrealised gains as capital under the Basle standards agreed by central
banks, which take effect at the end of this year.
What was a benefit has now become a burden. As unrealised gains have fallen
in line with the stock market, the banks' once healthy capital-to-asset
ratios have dropped below the 8 per cent ratio set by the Basle accord. With
the Nikkei index at the 17,000 level, the average ratio of capital to assets
for Japan's long-term credit banks and city banks is at around 7.5 per cent,
according to Mr David Atkinson of Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.
To bolster the ratio, banks have turned increasingly to selling subordinated
debt to life assurance companies, traditionally stable holders of bank
shares. The life companies have indicated that they would like to maintain
their net exposure to the banking sector unchanged, by selling bank stocks.
The fear of a wave of selling by the life companies hangs over bank shares.
It is unclear, however, whether life assurers are really selling: they are
likely to get better returns by exercising patience.
Bank shares probably have further to fall. Baring Securities' Mr Bell says
they could drop another 20 per cent and - since they make up a quarter of
the Nikkei index - the fall could push the stock average down another 1,000
to 2,000 points.
The leading city banks, who are expected to post an average 30 per cent
increase in basic business profits, argue that their balance sheets remain
sound. A Sanwa Bank official says: 'the fall in our share price is not very
good for our image, but there's no real harm'.
Image has certainly suffered. The Industrial Bank of Japan, the country's
most prestigious bank, has seen its market value drop 79 per cent since the
height of the 1989 bull market. Where once it towered above its western
rivals in market capitalisation, it is now worth only slightly more than
Deutsche Bank. Even if, as the Japanese banks insist, they suffer no long
term damage from the decline in their share prices, they will not soon
recover the lustre of the 1980s.

FT  09 APR 92 / Tension rises over Iraqi missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and the US voiced alarm yesterday that the Baghdad regime had moved
anti-aircraft missiles into a northern Iraqi exclusion zone, posing a threat
to western military aircraft patrolling the area.
The US said Iraqi ground forces had also moved closer to Kurdish settlements
in the area, raising fears of military action against the Kurds.
The rising tension in northern Iraq has revived the possibility of a strike
by the US and its allies against Iraqi forces. General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, refused to rule out this option in
London yesterday after talks with Mr John Major, UK prime minister.
Allied aircraft in the region are understood to be on a state of alert. The
Iraqi missiles' radars have been tracking US, British and French aircraft,
based in Turkey, and the US has informally warned Iraqi commanders that any
attempt to lock missiles on to allied flights would be viewed as a hostile
act. The US state department was last night preparing a formal warning.
Allied officials said the Soviet-made SAM-2 and SAM-3 missile batteries were
moved within the last 10 days to Mosul, 32km north of the 36th parallel.
After the Gulf war, Britain and the US ordered Iraq not to stage military
operations against the Kurds north of this parallel on pain of possible
allied counter-attack.
Admiral David Jeremiah, vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said
in Washington the allied powers were concerned about Iraq's motives in
deploying the anti-aircraft missiles in the protected area.
'We view the presence of these systems with considerable concern because
surface-to-air missiles have no purpose other than to be used against
aircraft, and the only aircraft flying in that area are allied,' he said.
The movement of missiles follows reports of renewed attacks by Iraqi forces
on the southern fringe of Kurdish held areas in the north and signs of a
build-up of Iraqi armour in the region.
Iraqi opposition groups in London also claim an Iraqi force last week
launched a three-day offensive against Shias in the country's southern
marshes.
These skirmishes and the missile deployment have intensified Anglo-US
consultations on a possible punitive raid to deter Iraq from threatening the
Kurds - or from testing too far the resolve of the Gulf war allies in their
undertaking to protect them.

FT  09 APR 92 / Beregovoy puts employment first: Opposition clamour over
party financing interrupts new premier's speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, yesterday undertook to
make the fight against unemployment the first priority of his government,
but without undermining the existing policy of economic rigour and monetary
stability.
His opening declaration to the National Assembly, however, was subjected to
a systematic barrage of hostile clamour from the conservative opposition
benches, indicating that the new government is likely to face a rough ride
in the 11 months left before the next general election.
Mr Beregovoy lived up to his reputation for straight dealing when he
announced that there would be no change in France's electoral system before
those elections.
Last autumn President Francois Mitterrand urged a shift towards more
proportional representation, which set off a ferment of suspicion that he
intended to change the voting rules to evade defeat. That way out has now
been closed, in a demonstration of the new premier's authority.
The crescendo in the uproar came when Mr Beregovoy undertook to wage war
against corruption in public life. Scandals concerning illegal party
financing have in recent years tarnished the reputation of the French
political establishment, especially the Socialist party, and Mr Beregovoy
promised his government would give full support to judicial investigations.
He said: 'If there are cases which have been delayed, believe me, they will
not be delayed any more.'
At this point, his speech was effectively drowned out by opposition
barracking. Mr Beregovoy then ominously waved a piece of paper which, he
said, contained 'a list of persons about whom I might want to speak to you'.
After even louder roars of protest, about a quarter of the opposition
members walked out. When they had gone, Mr Beregovoy said that none of the
names on his list was a member of the National Assembly.
To accelerate the recovery, Mr Beregovoy said value added tax applied to
cars and luxury goods at a higher rate of 22 per cent would be reduced to
the standard rate of 18.6 per cent from next Monday, nine months ahead of
the timing set by the European Community's single market.
The finance ministry indicated that the VAT cut would cost FFr4.3bn (Pounds
448m) in 1992 and FFr7bn in a full year. But Mr Beregovoy made clear his
government intended to maintain a firm grip to control the budget deficit.
He promised that by the end of October 900,000 of the long-term unemployed,
out of a total figure just short of 3m, would be offered either a job, or
training, or a suitable form of community service. In addition, he said the
government would promote part-time working, in part by reducing social
security charges.
He promised that any new spending in the fight against unemployment would be
financed either by the sale of state assets or by cost savings.
As a gesture of support for nuclear disarmament, meanwhile, finally Mr
Beregovoy announced that France would suspend all nuclear weapon tests for
the rest of this year.

FT  09 APR 92 / Heavy truck sales show recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST sign of recovery in the UK new vehicle market emerged last month
with a rise in sales of heavy trucks, the first monthly year-on-year
increase since September 1989.
The commercial vehicle sector is a significant economic barometer, with
vehicles going to many sectors from retail distribution to construction.
While new registrations at the light end of the commercial vehicle market,
led by sales of small vans, continued to fall heavily in March - in line
with the continuing decline in the car market - registrations of trucks
above 15 tonnes last month were 18 per cent higher than a year ago. As a
result, heavy truck sales for the first three months, at 4,250, showed a
year-on-year increase of 2.7 per cent.
Truck makers have suffered their steepest decline of the post-war period
with sales falling last year to the lowest level since 1954.
In part, heavy truck sales last month were artificially inflated by a change
in safety regulations, with mandatory fitting of anti-lock braking systems
from April 1 pulling some registrations forward into March, but heavy truck
makers insisted yesterday that the market had bottomed out.
'The market (for heavy tractors and articulated trucks) stopped falling in
the last two months of last year and there is now an upward trend,' said Mr
David Thomas, director of the truck division of Mercedes-Benz (United
Kingdom).
Mr Dieter Merz, managing director of Scania (Great Britain), UK subsidiary
of the Swedish heavy truck maker, said 'generally we are seeing a trend that
the market is stabilising at a low level.
'I am confident that the market is moving up slowly. Fleet operators that
have delayed replacing vehicles for two years can hold off no longer.'
The rise in demand is coming from the medium and long range distribution
sectors, including sectors such as the oil industry, where safety
regulations limit the age of trucks in service. Sales to the construction
industry remain very depressed.

FT  09 APR 92 / Retailers accused of penalising card users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK yesterday accused high street retailers of holding their
customers to ransom in their efforts to prevent banks raising charges for
credit and debit card transactions.
The claim followed revelations earlier this week by Tesco, the food store
which chairs the Debit Card Users Group, that banks charge substantially
more for electronic debit card transactions than they do for cheques.
Mr David Malpas, Tesco's managing director, speaking on Tuesday after the
company announced increased annual pretax profits, said his company might
fight the increased prices for card services on its customers' behalf - if
necessary by banning card payments.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays Central Retail Services
Division, the largest credit and debit card organisation in the UK, said:
'Over the last three years, card processing charges levied on retailers have
reduced sharply - by over 25 per cent on credit cards and over 40 per cent
on debit cards.
'Consumers have not seen the benefits of these reductions in the prices they
pay at the point of sale.'
Banks claim that retailers enjoy substantial benefits through accepting
debit and credit cards. These include quicker guaranteed payment, reductions
in processing and security costs and a flow of extra customers who prefer to
pay by card.
Barclays confirmed yesterday that banks charge some retailers more for debit
card transactions than for cheques.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MURRAY GUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Conservatives and the Union' (April 7), is quite
incorrect in criticising John Major for believing autonomy for Scotland can
be stopped 'by just saying no'.
Quite a substantial amount of people in the centre-right of the Scottish
political spectrum have been taken in by the SNP's vision of independence
for Scotland. This 'opinion poll' support seems to have drifted somewhat in
recent days and I believe that one of the reasons for this is that potential
voters have been scared off by the thought of the SNP (in the words of Jim
Sillars) 'realising their socialist dreams'. The unfortunate reality is
that, by voting for Labour, the people of Scotland are merely delaying the
process of independence by means of a half-way house that will, as your
editorial quite correctly says, bring far-reaching changes to the entire UK
constitution. The 'west Lothian question' will substantiate the irresistible
move to federalism and the consequent break-up of the UK as we know it.
That is why the Conservatives' stance on the Union is one that should have
great bearing on the way that people place their 'x'. Why vote away a
constitution that has made the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland the envy of the world? The Scots have always been nationalistic - as
have the English, Welsh and Irish - but why we should suddenly now feel that
the last 285 years have been sheer hell is, quite frankly, beyond my
comprehension. Should Scotland's endeavours of the last three centuries be
dismissed out of hand? The sad thing is that the Labour party, having jumped
on the band wagon in order to try to please everybody, has once more given
evidence of its lack of responsibility and backbone.
By 'just saying no' the Conservative party stands out as a party of
principle and reliability. Qualities such as these should not be scoffed at,
especially when the issue concerns the preservation of the Union.

Sir, Your leader ('Labour and the economy', April 8) deserves recognition
for a most ingenious defence of inequality. Forget the interests (and
spending) of pensioners on Pounds 50 per week and others who would benefit
from Labour's plans for redistribution. Higher taxation of the better off is
apparently bad for all of us because they are the people who can borrow most
against their post-tax incomes and spend the rest of the economy out of the
recession. Apart from all other considerations, wasn't this just how we got
into the present mess?

Afterwards the magistrate admitted he had been a bit severe, but explained

The usually lightning-fast news reporting of Israel Radio lapsed somewhat -
by two hours or so - when it came to confirming that PLO leader Yasser
Arafat had survived his aircraft's crash-landing in a Libyan desert
sandstorm.
True, the state-owned network was as speedy as any of its media competitors
in reporting that he was missing. Then, about 11 am, the PLO's Tunis
headquarters announced he had escaped, and the rest of the world's media
promptly passed on the news, not one expressing doubt of its truth.
But wait, said Israel Radio, we only have the PLO's word for this . . . Even
at 1 pm defence minister Moshe Arens was on the air saying, 'If it turns out
he's dead, I think that no one in Israel is going to mourn.'
It was not until some minutes later that the radio admitted Arafat seemed to
be alive after all.
In the meantime, however, it had lavishly reported reaction to the then
likely-seeming demise of the top-ranked mortal in Israel's demonology. The
coverage included an interview with MP and ex-minister Geula Cohen, of the
far-right Tehiya party, in which she said: 'Even if we find out he's still
alive, I believe he deserves to die.'
'You mean Israel should kill him?' the interviewer asked.
'Yes. One hundred per cent.'

Despite widespread opprobrium, European Community farmers still demur at
reforming their inefficient farm sector. But Vladimir Dlouhy, economics
minister of the Czech and Slovak Republic, is determined to learn from that
mess of potage.
'We don't intend to repeat the same mistakes as the European Community in
our farm sector,' says he. 'We don't want to see our farmers become a
spoiled part of society. They must feel the iron fist of foreign
competition.
'We were asked to reform our economy in 1989; we did it and we have borne
the consequences. We have fulfilled the conditions imposed on us, and we
expect more flexibility on the part of the EC.'
Now, Dlouhy thinks, it's time for the community to fulfil its side of the
bargain, and to take a ploughshare to tariff barriers blocking Czech and
Slovak Republic exports into the EC.
When a minister of a former socialist country starts dispensing lessons in
simple market economics, the question has to be asked: Can Vladimir Dlouhy
succeed where all others have failed?

John Major has tried to make capital of Neil Kinnock's membership of the
notoriously long-winded 'boyo' tendency. He claims that the Labour leader's
yacking would not go down at all well at European summit meetings.
Perhaps he has overlooked that Kinnock has much in common with that
successful Euro-politician, Germany's Helmut Kohl. Both are blustering,
sentimental, and occasionally impetuous. Neither has a head for detail, and
both can be remarkably verbose in a provincial brogue.
Each was compared badly to a rival who regularly trounced him in the
political arena - Helmut Schmidt and Margaret Thatcher, respec-
tively. If Kinnock wins, he will move into 10 Downing Street in his ninth
year as party leader. Kohl took over the chancellorship nine years after
becoming chairman of the West German Christian Democrats in 1973.
The two evidently got on well when they last met in Bonn about 18 months
ago. And Kohl and his entourage are moderately impressed by Kinnock's
pro-European rhetoric, although the feeling in Bonn is that a change of
prime minister would make little difference to Britain's European policies.
Admittedly, the German chancellor would prefer his friend John Major to stay
in power. But if Kinnock makes it, they could soon be serving leek as well
as Kohl's favourite Saumagen (stuffed stomach), at the Bonn chancellery.

Italian voters have been especially unkind in their judgment of those
dealing with the economy. Veteran treasury minister Guido Carli and
forthright industry minister Guido Bodrato both lost their seats, as did
economist Nino Andreatta, head of the senate budget committee.
Carli's fate was especially poignant. Having co-opted him into government in
1989, the Christian Democratic party was keen to keep him on board even if
at first he could not be found a seat. At the 11th hour he was parachuted in
as a candidate for the senate in Genoa - alas, a city with which he had no
connection.
Just 78, the former central bank governor has been a lone voice in the
cabinet consistently urging fiscal discipline. But this held no appeal for
his new-found Genoese constituents. His sole consolation was that the native
Genoese Moana Pozzi, the self-styled porno-star and leading light of the
Love Party, also failed to get elected.
Among other prominent losers in the elections were the Christian Democrat
Gianuario Carta and the Socialist Guido Gerosa, respectively president and
vice-president of the senate commission investigating the Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro and its Atlanta branch's Dollars 4bn plus loans to Iraq.
Those with suspicious minds are seeing this decapitation as a conspiracy to
impede the investigation.

FT  09 APR 92 / Arts: Bournonville Festival II
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Danish Ballet has just ended a week's festival dedicated to its
founding father, August Bournonville. The occasion was of the happiest. The
Royal Danes had guarded a Bournonville heritage for nearly a century before,
in 1951, they invited a handful of English critics to visit Copenhagen to
sample some precious survivals of the poetic and vividly dramatic ballets
that Bournonville had created between 1830 and 1877.
Two years later, emboldened by critical delight, the company played a season
at Covent Garden, and the London public yielded eagerly to the Danes' joyous
dancing, their mellifluous and whole-hearted acting, and Bournonville's
choreographic masterpieces which shaped and enshrined these virtues.
Thus launched upon the international scene, the Danish ballet - and
Bournonville - conquered the world. The company and its old repertory were
everywhere in demand, everywhere admired. Yet the troupe faced an evident
need to reconcile its historic identity with a desire to catch up with a
more international style of classic dancing, after its years of
Bournonvillian quietude.
The task was complicated by the world's insistence that the Royal Danish
Ballet meant Bournonville (which indeed it did) somewhat to the exclusion of
any later creativity. That Bournonville prepared the Danes for most dance
challenges seems to have escaped the generality of the public, and the fact
remains that the Danes - admirable in many balletic styles - must needs
still concentrate upon Bournonville to win a world public. And rightly so,
when they present the extant repertory of six long works and some shorter
pieces with the enthusiasm and undimmed freshness that they have just shown.
In 1979 the Royal Danes staged a first Bournonville Festival in which all
the old repertory was displayed. The Festival was a huge success. The second
Bournonville Festival has been no less rewarding. Significantly, it brought
a new staging of Napoli to mark the 150th anniversary of the ballet's first
performance on March 29, which told much about the Danes' continuing concern
with Bournonville's emotional and theatrical values, and the truest way of
showing his work for future generations.
One of the great strengths of the Royal Danish Ballet is its use of dancers
of all ages in the theatre. The children of the school are vitally part of
the crowd in Napoli's first act, and they watch the final scene from the
bridge that traditionally spans the stage. In a few years some will be on
stage in the solos that explode with fizzing vitality in the closing
celebrations. As muscles tire, the great soloists renew their skills in the
mime roles that give such richness and depth to the dramatic fabric of the
piece. An artist like Kjeld Noack, marking 60 years on the stage this year,
has made this progress, and still delights us with masterly mime playing.
Sorella Englund, celebrating her silver jubilee on stage in La Sylphide, was
an obsessed and terrifying Madge, who had latterly been a delicately
touching sylph.
The new Napoli - well designed by Soren Frandsen - has received imaginative
refurbishment. Napoli's flaw has long been its second act. Now it has been
carefully re-thought (all the Bournonville steps have been lost for years)
and is less of a bore than heretofore, though I thought the costuming for
the tritons somewhat inapt with bare chests, Newgate frill beards, and what
looked like varicose veins, as indications of their watery nature.
Everything else about the staging was radiant, from the bustle of quay-side
life to the feu de joie of the finale's dances. In its central roles I saw
superb performances from Lis Jeppeson and Nikolaj Hubbe. Miss Jeppeson is
the ideal Bournonville heroine: by turns grave or child-like in her
innocence, then sparkling in dance, or as the wicked Birthe in A Folk Tale,
a demon of malign energy, she has an exquisite sensibility about the
dramatic and technical nuance of her roles. Her dancing is ever-fresh. Mr
Hubbe, the hero of this festival, is ardent in drama as in dance. His
Gennaro in Napoli is all passion, raging with grief when he thinks his love
is drowned, then cutting with a flashing physical edge through his dances.
His James in La Sylphide was romantic fever personified; his Dancing Master
in Le Conservatoire a grand statement about Bournonvillian bravura and
elegance.
Two other men offered typically Danish dance power and clarity. Johan
Kobborg, a young soloist, exemplified those Copenhagen virtues of brilliancy
in step and buoyancy in jumps. His account of the Flower Festival duet on
the opening night of the Festival was the best possible introduction to joys
to come.
Lloyd Riggins, American-born, joined the company five years ago at the age
of 17. His debut as Gennaro at Napoli's 150th anniversary performance was
youthfully ebullient, and he was paired with the no less delightful Heidi
Ryom as Teresina.
In the vaudeville mime of Far from Denmark he was a sincere Vilhelm, and in
the 'reconstructed' (that is, revived from notations and written sources)
staging of Abdallah, his verve and dashing technique helped one believe in
this curiously hollow example of Bournonville pietism.
The Bournonville repertory and the Royal Danish Ballet, as they were shown
to crowded and ecstatic houses during the festival are in fine fettle.
Bournonville's past and present mingle like the generations of performers on
the stage.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Vaudeville Theatre Box Office 071 836 9987
If you don't like the election result or are simply looking for a pleasant
evening, here is a fine diversion. Ronald Harwood's Reflected Glory is the
definition of a middlebrow play: not unduly demanding, but clever enough to
make you laugh, admire the invention and even be puzzled by the ending.
It also has Albert Finney making a welcome return to the West End where he
last appeared, in another play by Harwood, in 1989.
Finney plays Alfred, elder brother to Michael (Stephen Moore). Alfred is a
restaurant owner, Michael a playwright. When young, they often quarrelled,
not least when playing tennis, but usually made it up with a joint rendering
of 'Me and My Shadow', with a kind of Fred Astaire dancing to go with it.
Their estrangement began when their father divided his will unequally:
Pounds 40,000 to Michael because he would need it as an artist, and only
Pounds 20,000 to Alfred because his restaurant would be expected to pay for
itself.
The real trouble between the brothers, however, is that Michael keeps
writing plays about the family, which Alfred regards as an intrusion on his
private life. Sometimes he takes out an injunction to stop them. After 10
years of not seeing each other, Michael is seeking a reconciliation because
his new play Brother Mine, as distinct from his earlier Family Matters, is
not about the family in general, but about the relationship between the
brothers. 'Me and My Shadow' features prominently.
That is the essence of it. Alfred is tempted automatically to injunct: his
lawyer is conveniently at hand, being the lover of Michael's theatrical
agent. He agrees to see a private viewing before the play is launched. The
performance leads to a stream of pleasing theatrical in-jokes, none of them
esoteric, but few of the groan variety.
This not a huge part for Finney. For about quarter of an hour in the second
act, he simply sits at the side watching the rehearsal, consulting his
lawyer and taking notes, but even in the shadows see his splendidly
expressive face and body. From time to time he interrupts, objecting for
instance that the actor playing him is left-handed with insufficient swing
to his backhand. All that is very jolly.
Alfred, however, is not a complete philistine. He rather takes to the
actors, especially when he recognises one of them as the man who plays the
pirate in the Planters' Rum in the commercial. The actor (Nicky Henson)
agrees to do a little turn on one leg. Indeed both Henson and the other
actor, Mark Tandy, have rather good parts.
The action takes place in a fringe theatre known as the Acropolis, which
Alfred says reminds him of a Greek taverna. Ever the restaurateur, see his
face again when inadvertently he drinks some white wine not up to his
standards. The direction is by Elijah Moshinsky and you would have to be in
a grim mood not to like it.

FT  09 APR 92 / Arts: The Beggar's Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is this latest RSC The Beggar's Opera the same play which prompted Sir John
Hawkins to comment in 1776: 'Rapine and violence have been gradually
increasing since its first representation'? Director John Caird's anodyne
middle-of-the road version would scarcely seem to be so. This pleasant,
pasteurised production at The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, capitalises on the
longueurs of John Gay's 1728 original, but fails to catch the trenchancy of
Gay's urban-pastoral wit. This results in undemanding, easy theatre which
belies the demands levied on a cast enjoined to sing and act.
Caird has homogenised the action in an RSC period blend of costume, set and
manner. If Kendra Ullyart's fine tumbledown design pleases the eye, the
play's issues hardly touch the mind; after all, the Opera was important
enough to be condemned by Burke and copied by Brecht. Gay deserves more
stringency, for this is funny social satire which pillories the usual
eighteenth-century targets (lawyers, medics, bankers) by siding with the
underworld of pimps and pick-pockets. The message is that 'of all animals of
prey, man is the only sociable one'.
The plot follows Captain Macheath, a polygamist highwayman loved by Polly
and Lucy, the daughters of his fence and his gaoler. The play opens in a
bedlam of competing sights and voices, and slowly untangles itself. The
action takes place as a performance in St Giles, London, topped and tailed
with an induction and moral; this gives actors licence to play actors, and
the customary RSC clap-along finale knitting up the play is especially
protracted.
The Opera has as much opera as drama. Ilona Sekacz's Muzak score amounts to
folksong soundbites ('Over the Hills', 'Lillibullero') with more bass and
wire brushes than suits the music. Even easy listening can be entertaining,
but these snippets are never consistently melodic enough to build a musical
structure, so one does not identify characters by how or what they sing. The
best musical scene has Macheath's two wives, Polly and Lucy, simultaneously
and separately pining for him below stage - that makes melodic sense. The
singing needs to be everywhere more confident and relaxed; individuals sound
painfully exposed against the amplified background.
The sprawling action finds its high points: a wonderful coach chase and
highway robbery, a trawl of trollops from Cheapside called to solace
Macheath, and some grubby Newgate scenes from a tightly-run, privatised
gaol. Paul Jesson as Peachum the fence and Anthony O'Donnell as Lockit the
gaoler stay on terms with Gay's text, trading the great line 'I can forgive,
as well as resent'. David Burt rightly plays a hopeful Macheath, orbited by
Elizabeth Renihan (Polly) and Jenna Russell (Lucy). Nick Holder as a rough
'Brummie' brigand enlivens every scene he acts.
In the end, the entire cast is either hanged or transported, until the
author's companion (played by the dignified Griffith Jones) intervenes for a
happy conclusion.

FT  09 APR 92 / People: Barclays' Italian job changes hands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is change at the top in Barclays Bank's operations in Italy - a
country that in the past has proved fraught with difficulties for the UK
clearer.
Richard Adams, general manager in Italy for the past six years, has been
battling with the legacy of years of over-expansion combined with losses and
fraud in leasing. Adams, one of whose tasks on arrival was to beat a retreat
from retail banking in general, returns to London 'after a very satisfying
time making the operation more focused - and profitable'. He becomes head of
financial institutions within the corporate banking division.
Italy returned a small profit in 1991, compared with losses estimated in the
region of Pounds 30m a year when Adams took over.
His replacement is Hugh Malim (pictured), who was actually in Italy during
the 1980s troubles, but was responsible for other areas, the bank says -
setting up factoring and consumer finance as well as opening the Rome
office. Malim, an ex-Navy man and keen pilot, has headed export finance at
Barclays in London since 1988, and comes back to Italy with big plans to
build the investment banking capability.
Returning to the country will suit his wife, who has a fashion design
business based in Milan - and will put him closer to the Cresta run, his
other love.
Of his own new job, Adams says that while it would once have meant donning
an ambassadorial hat to make endless visits around the correspondent banking
network, the trick these days is to tailor Barclays' services to the
individual and very different strengths of financial institutions around the
world. He replaces Michael Tomalin whose new appointment within the group
has yet to be announced.

FT  09 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Adveritising): Cleaning up on the
housewives' choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who is the TV advertisement for sanitary towels with wings supposed to be
aimed at?
Who are those 'housewives' who sit around with Clare Rayner, the agony aunt,
enjoying a televised discussion about how dry their panties are?
Where are the women who are moved by those whizzo cookers that produce food
good enough to please the in-laws?
Selling to women is a profitable business: the market is expected to reach
Pounds 90bn by the end of the decade. Women are big buyers not just of
cosmetics and cleaning fluids, but increasingly of cars and financial
services, markets which were once the preserve of men.
Yet the content of advertisements meant to tap this market often bears
little relation to the kind of women likely to buy the products.
The ad agency's 'housewife' still loves cleaning and cooking - she sometimes
even spills things for the fun of cleaning up again. The new and equally
implausible stereotype shows female top executives with sheer stockings and
trim briefcases slipping into chauffeur-driven cars.
Four real-life women, all ex-advertising agency and all with families, last
week got together to form what they claim is the first advertising and
marketing service geared at selling to women.
They say it takes one to know one: as 90 per cent of ads are written by men,
it is not surprising they fail to hit the mark.
But surely these big companies have done their homework, and continue to use
such advertisements because they work?
'They spend millions on advertising. If they used more tasteful
advertisements, they might not have to spend so much,' says Anne
Irwin-Brown, one of the four.
An example of an advertisement that she thinks has got the balance right is
for Oxo, in which the woman has a job, a sense of humour and a family, and
is dashing out to an evening class.
The problem goes deeper than just advertising, according to Irwin-Brown.
While car companies, for instance, have long recognised that they should aim
their advertising at women, the marketing message has not really got
through.
Indeed, the average car dealer, who is going to be making the sale, still
tends either to flirt with or patronise his female customers.

FT  09 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Time to clarify the obligations of
auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DERMOT GLYNN and DEREK RIDYARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1990s pose fundamental problems for UK accounting firms. In addition to
increased commercial pressures, the profession faces a threat from public
policy makers. There is increasing suspicion about the effectiveness of
self-regulation. Who audits the auditor? And who should do so?
The debate on auditor regulation and accounting firm competition is taking
place across the EC. A patchwork of regulatory structures and accountancy
cultures has generated a confusing array of calls for action. Many are
addressed in a study commissioned by DG IV, the EC Directorate in charge of
competition policy, from economic consultants NERA.*
The root of the regulatory debate is the auditor's position between, on one
hand, the managers of public companies, and, on the other, their owners and
other groups such as employees, pension fund beneficiaries, creditors and
government departments which rely on the accuracy of the audited accounts.
The auditor is hired by the managers to protect the interests of this latter
group of 'stakeholders'.
There are obvious tensions when the interests of the two groups diverge  -
perhaps because of suspected fraud or more typically because managers have
an interest in the reported results being well received by investors and
others. Economists analyse such divergences of interest between one party
and the agent employed to work on its behalf as a 'principal/agent' problem.
Traditional solutions of professional self-regulation backed up by legal
redress as a last resort appear to be ripe for reform. Recent financial
scandals have cast doubts on whether the threat of public disgrace is
sufficient to safeguard audit standards.
These doubts are confirmed by the experiences of investors who have sought
redress for auditor malpractice in the courts. Almost all such cases are
settled out of court without any clarification of the legal duties. The
Caparo case, which clarified auditors' responsibilties, underlined the gulf
between what users expect, and what the auditor is prepared to offer.
The auditor's signature is treated by users of company accounts as an
assurance of the quality of the information they contain - a kind of
insurance policy against the risk that the company's true financial state is
not what it appears.
The leading audit firms, whose strong brand names command a substantial
price premium, have an interest in sustaining this belief. Yet attempts to
make a claim on this policy show that pay-out terms are unreliable and
highly uncertain.
The most common form of audit regulation proposed is to prevent auditors
carrying out consultancy assignments for their audit clients - a feature of
several EC markets.
The NERA study showed that the major accounting firms rely heavily on audit
clients for their non-audit business. But it also found the firms had
managed to avoid the regulations in these countries.
A second mechanism, favoured in Italy and Spain and suggested elsewhere, is
to have periodic compulsory rotation of auditors, to prevent too cosy a
relationship between the audit partner and the management of the firm. But
this causes potentially high disruption costs and raises questions as to the
quality of the audit scrutiny during the transition period.
A third solution, favoured by some accounting firms, is to introduce
measures to reduce the intensity of competition for the audit contract,
removing the temptation to reduce audit quality as a means of cutting costs.
Protection from competition might reduce the tendency of the client to
question the value for money offered by the auditor. But the idea that
protectionism guarantees higher standards holds no more water in this
context than elsewhere.
None of the models for reform suggested by the other EC states really
addresses the principal/agent problem which underlies the need for reform.
If the question of auditor independence is to be tackled, more fundamental
issues need to be addressed.
The crucial question in devising a more effective regulatory structure is
how to ensure that the auditor's incentives are aligned with those whom the
audit is designed to serve, and not with those who pay their fees. The first
step in enforcing this alignment is to clarify the nature of the audit. What
guarantees does the audit signature entail? And what class of user is
entitled to make a claim on those guarantees? If we think of the audit as an
insurance policy, the current 'expectations gap' means that many who believe
they have insurance cover find they have none at all.
The extent of cover against inaccuracy in the audited accounts is tied up
with the meaning of the 'true and fair view' promise contained in each set
of audited accounts. There is almost complete uncertainty as to the meaning
of this phrase, and a desperate requirement for further clarification.
There is also a pressing need for the identity of the policy-holders to be
made clearer. A strong public policy argument exists for ensuring that the
auditor has a clear duty of care towards all stakeholders in a company,
including creditors, employees and pension fund beneficiaries as well as
present and future equity investors. All these classes of consumer rely on
the information which is certified as true and fair by the audit statement,
and all feel cheated when financial scandals reveal that their confidence is
misplaced and they have no adequate redress.
Deepening the auditor's statutory obligation by imposing some concrete
meaning on the true and fair view, and widening that obligation by extending
the class of users to whom the auditor owes a duty of care, would imply an
increase in audit costs. The current lack of transparency makes it
impossible to judge the optimal mix in this public policy cost-benefit
trade-off.
In a sense, however, the exact nature of the rules which determine the
auditor's obligation is less important than that the rules should be clear
and transparent. If, for example, the auditor's duties were confirmed to be
exceptionally shallow and only to apply to a narrow group of users, this
would have two important effects.
First, it would place a harsh focus on the prices charged for the audit
signature. Why should such high sums be paid, and why should the 'Big 6'
firms' audit signatures command such a high premium, if the value of the
product is so limited?
Second, it would better expose the gap in the market for financial
guarantees. This would stimulate the development of a variety of
non-statutory audit products which really met the demands of the users of
financial information. The financial institutions would be able to develop
meaningful financial guarantees backed by accounting firm signatures and
connected to clear obligations as to the accuracy of the data being
certified. This would open the way to real competition on price and quality.
Audited accounts are of such importance to such a wide class of users that
one would hope the statutory audit obligation will in practice settle some
way above this minimum level. The statutory audit should offer real benefits
to these users for which they would be prepared to pay. Policy reforms which
fudge the issues, or which attempt to solve the principal/agent problem by
marginal tinkering with the existing system, are unlikely to deliver the
benefits which the financial system requires.

<TEXT>
MR Nick Temple, IBM's UK chief executive, today opens the company's first
building in the UK to implement fully its 'office of the future' concept.
Many staff will have no desks.
Half the 120 employees at the IBM North East England regional headquarters
in Newcastle upon Tyne have been equipped with laptop computers and mobile
telephones so they no longer need to travel to the office every day.
The staff, who work in sales, client support, servicing and engineering, use
the equipment to communicate by telephone from their homes and cars or their
clients' offices with IBM's computer network, accessing information and
messages.
The concept, dubbed Smart - Space, Morale and Remote Technology - by IBM,
has been partly introduced by the company at its London and Glasgow offices,
but Newcastle, where employees have just moved from old premises to new
accommodation, is the first to switch entirely to the concept for all field
staff.
Mr Peter Austin, Newcastle location manager, said the staff response had
been enthusiastic. It allowed them to work more flexibly, with greater
control over their hours.

FT  09 APR 92 / Harrods active at Vung Tau auction: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRODS, the London department store, was a prominent buyer yesterday at
Christie's two-day sale of the Vung Tau cargo in Amsterdam. It will be
offering the porcelain for sale from Monday.
The shipload of Chinese blue and white export porcelain, lost off the coast
of Vietnam in the early 1690s and rediscovered in 1989, is selling far above
target. Christie's was estimating about Pounds 1.5m for the 28,000 items -
originally destined for display in the homes of Dutch burghers - but after
three of the four sessions it had already raised Fl 9.75m (Pounds 3m).
The top price at yesterday morning's sale was Fl 126,500 (Pounds 39,655),
far in excess of the Fl 10,000 estimate, for a blue and white five-piece
garniture decorated with what the Chinese imagined a Dutch canal house
looked like. A similar garniture realised Fl 112,700 (Pounds 35,329).
There was strong international bidding from dealers and private collectors.
Sotheby's auction of British paintings in London yesterday brought in Pounds
1.18m, but with more than 35 per cent unsold. That resulted mainly from the
failure of two important lots - a Constable sketch of Dedham Vale and a
portrait by John Webber of the young Captain Bligh of the Bounty, to find
buyers.
The top price was Pounds 61,600, almost double the estimate, paid for a rare
portrait of King James V of Scotland by Corneille de Lyon. A portrait by
Lely of Barbara Villiers, mistress of King Charles II, was on target at
Pounds 57,200. Historical portraits did well, as did shipping scenes, but
sporting pictures are still proving difficult to sell. A portrait by
Reynolds of Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Shannon made Pounds 41,800.

FT  09 APR 92 / A mission to mother invention: Efforts by the Patents Office
to market itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATENTS PENDING is in danger of becoming an under-used phrase in Britain,
according to the man responsible for marketing the services of the Patent
Office.
Mr George Hamlyn can reel off unpleasant statistics at the drop of a hat: in
the EC, annual spending on wasted research has reached Pounds 20bn; and this
year only 50,000 patents have been registered by the UK compared with 20,000
alone from the Japanese company Hitachi.
The importance of the Patent Office, part of the Department of Trade and
Industry, is underrated by companies, according to Mr Hamlyn, who travels
throughout the UK to promote the office as a resource for businessmen -
containing 25km of archives, with about 32m patents, 2m of them from the UK.
'More than four fifths of the information in patents you cannot find in any
other published form,' he says. 'One of the uses of patent information, if
you have a technical problem, is to find out whether it has been solved
previously.'
Mr Hamlyn says too many companies fail to contact the Patent Office in
central London before embarking on costly research to solve technical
questions. 'They come up with the answer, they then go to patent it, we do a
search and, surprise surprise, we discover that it's been done half a dozen
times before. They have reinvented the wheel.'
Mr Hamlyn recalls a company that unsuccessfully tried to replicate a
laboratory result on a larger, pre-production scale. 'For weeks they
employed the whole R&amp;D department, trying to puzzle out what was going
wrong. One of them finally suggested doing a patent search. We found them a
30-year-old document which offered a solution. They were delighted and so
were we. But that 30-year-old document was their very own patent; they
hadn't even thought to look.'
An amusing tale, but it contains a sting that British companies would do
well to consider. According to Mr Hamlyn, Japanese companies will this year
file more than 350,000 patents, about a third of the world total and seven
times as many as will be put up by British companies. The top three
patenting companies in the US now are Hitachi, Toshiba and Canon. Hitachi
has 150 full-time employees devoted to studying patents, feeding that
information into company research.
Mr Hamlyn dismisses as 'nonsense' the idea that Japan's dominance of patents
is explained by superior inventive skills. 'That just doesn't hold water.
Japanese research shows that in the last few decades 50 per cent of the
economically valuable inventions around the world came from the UK. But we
just don't exploit them. The UK and US are very good at fundamental research
 -just look at their lists of Nobel prize-winners. The UK has had 61 in
physics, medicine and chemistry since the start of the Nobel prizes (in
1901), the Japanese have only had four. But if you look in the shops you'd
think it was entirely the other way round.'
Mr Hamlyn and his team are trying to market two related items: the
importance of protecting new ideas by patents and the Patent Office's search
and advisory services, with its access to massive archives of patents.
The Patent Office has experts for everything from paperclips to oil rigs,
with instant access to more than 40 computer databases across the world. It
is not a monopoly supplier of patent search services - anyone can use the
science, reference and information service to do a patent search themselves,
but it can save a lot of time to use one of the many individual patent or
searching agencies.
Search charges vary from about Pounds 100 for a simple search, through more
complex, computer-based searches costing Pounds 200, to labour-intensive
searches using an expert examiner with an average price of Pounds 400. Some
large companies requiring in-depth surveys pay several thousand pounds.
To market itself, though, the Patent Office roadshow has been running for
three years, has made 64 tours of the UK and is making a presentation in
Lisbon between May 18 and 20. It demonstrates its commitment to advanced
technology with its video laser disc package on patents training - price
Pounds 2,000, including hardware.
Mr Hamlyn said: 'The awareness campaign is really directed at making people
aware of what patents, registered designs, trademarks, copyright can do for
them. We are trying to make people aware of intellectual property. We are
not saying that every time you have a bright idea you rush out and get a
patent. These are expensive things; an average invention of average length
would probably cost about Pounds 2,000 for the UK alone. That goes up if you
apply for patenting abroad; it can go up to Pounds 50,000 for patenting in
some 15 countries.'
On the other hand, Pounds 2,000 to prevent industrial theft might prove to
be a cheap insurance policy. Patents are about money, as Mr Hamlyn
emphasised: 'We're concerned to get through to business that if it
understands the broad basis of the system it's obvious you will make better
informed commercial decisions in the future.'

FT  09 APR 92 / Transport union urges stricter sea safety law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RMT transport union yesterday urged the government to break ranks with
the world community and introduce tougher legislation on sea safety.
Mr Tony McGregor, RMT assistant general secretary with responsibility for
shipping, said: 'British seafarers should not have to wait for the world to
agree safety standards. Our members' lives are at risk while other countries
prevaricate.'
The statement follows remarks made at a meeting in London of the
International Maritime Organisation, the UN agency that draws up sea safety
standards. The organisation emphasises the need for states to act
unanimously and warns of chaos resulting from different national standards.
The procedure is slow. Safety standards for new roll-on roll-off ships, of
the same type of the Herald of Free Enterprise, came into force three years
years after the 1987 disaster which claimed almost 200 lives.
Mr William O'Neil, secretary-general of the organisation, said: 'Despite the
efforts of some states, the number of sub-standard ships sailing the ocean
is too high and the loss of life is unacceptable.' Mr O'Neil said world
shipping was facing enormous challenges in ageing fleets, higher replacement
costs, poor safety standards and a shortage of manpower.
All sections of the industry had to work to ensure that high safety
standards were achieved, he said.
Any compromise 'must provide a level of safety that is acceptable to the
entire shipping world.'
Earlier in the week he said: 'Unilateral action on the part of any
government gives us all cause for concern. However, it would be wrong for
this organisation to express such concern if it does not at the same time
make a concerted effort to adopt standards which are both realistic and
highly regarded.'
He said human error was the principal cause of shipping casualties. Action
on training and certification standards for seafarers were a high priority.

FT  09 APR 92 / Recovery hint as executive vacancies rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLL of business sentiment and a rise in demand for top executives in
private industry reported yesterday signalled an improvement in UK company
performance and added to evidence of a possible end to the recession.
A survey of business leaders by the Institute of Directors shows that sales
volumes, profits and employment expectations have recovered to levels last
seen in June 1990. Separately, MSL International, a recruitment consultancy,
reported the first quarter-on-quarter increase in demand for senior
executives for two years, as measured by newspaper advertising.
The IoD polled 170 of its members from all sectors of industry and all parts
of the UK in the first week of this month. It said 43 per cent reported
increased order books compared with 28 per cent in February, while those
saying order books were down had fallen to 31 per cent from 45 per cent.
Those reporting increased business volumes increased to 47 per cent from 31
per cent previously while those complaining of lower turnover fell to 29 per
cent from 43 per cent. The number of directors reporting lower profits, at
39 per cent, was still higher than the 37 per cent disclosing increased
profits. But the gap between the two had narrowed to 2 percentage points
from 16 points in February.
The IoD said 52 per cent of businessmen surveyed reported that their company
was investing, compared with 45 per cent in February. Three out of 10
businessmen polled now expect to increase employment, against one in four in
February.
According to MSL, demand for senior executives as measured by newspaper
advertising rose by 27 per cent between January and March compared with the
fourth quarter of last year. The rise came after two years in which the
recruitment advertising market has been severely depressed due to the
recession.
MSL bases its figures on a seasonally adjusted index which has been used to
track the advertising market for top jobs since 1956. The index is widely
followed among recruitment companies as a barometer of the economy that
gives advance warning of changes in demand.
Mr Garry Long, MSL's chairman, said the increase appeared to be a sign that
large companies were stepping up their recruitment efforts in readiness for
an improvement in the economy. Advertising for jobs in retailing and in R&amp;D
showed a particularly big increase between the two quarters.

FT  09 APR 92 / Retraining palates on the Continent:  A traditional British
Rail breakfast served on the Paris to Brussels express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERCITY, the British Rail flagship, contributed to entente cordiale this
week by serving up bacon and black pudding on the Paris to Brussels
early-morning express.
Bemused Continental travellers have had their croissants and coffee
supplemented by BR's 'Great British Breakfast' as part of an InterCity
campaign to dispel its reputation for not-so-haute cuisine.
In a week-long experiment, eight InterCity executives, chefs and
stewardesses are serving a choice of full British breakfasts on the 7.05am
express from Paris, and an evening meal on the return.
The initial signs are good. Out of 150 customers in three crowded dining
cars yesterday, 70 per cent opted for the Great British Breakfast rather
than the meagre local alternative. A big majority chose the full works of
bacon, sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, fried potatoes and black pudding, with
a few opting for smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. One opted for kippers,
but he turned out to be English.
Reactions were favourable, although some customers were more intrigued by
the activities of the BBC television crew and the half-dozen journalists
flown by InterCity from London to witness the historic event, than by the
food. One Parisian lawyer said he thoroughly approved of the Great British
Breakfast, but wasn't sure he could cope with it every day.
On the evening journey there is pheasant pate with Cumberland sauce and a
choice of grilled salmon with a lobster butter sauce or noisettes of Welsh
lamb with a redcurrant sauce, a dish created and prepared by Mr Brian
Challis, InterCity's chef of the year. There is a selection of British
cheeses, including ripe Stilton, summer pudding, and an aperitif of
sparkling wine from Kent.
UK travellers will have the opportunity to enjoy some Continental catering
when a team from Wagons Lits offers its menus on BR later this year. There
could be further habit-changing swaps if the experiment is successful.
Mr Terry Coyle, InterCity's director of on-board services, said: 'InterCity
catering is the envy of most European train operators . . . we would not be
doing this if we thought it would not be totally successful. French trains
have nothing like the Great British Breakfast.'

FT  09 APR 92 / Drug sector demonstrates its vitality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S remarkable figures showing a 66 per cent increase in the trade
surplus generated by the UK pharmaceuticals industry during January,
compared with January last year, demonstrate the continuing vitality of the
British drugs industry.
Last year the industry produced a trade surplus for the UK economy of Pounds
1.18bn, a figure second only to that created by power-generating machinery.
The scale of the trade surplus increase during January can be partly
attributed to the slower growth of pharmaceutical imports rather than
exports. Imports grew by only 10 per cent to Pounds 114.8m while exports
increased by 33 per cent to Pounds 231.4m.
The limited import figure is partly because UK is a small drugs market with
low consumption of pharmaceuticals compared with other countries. The UK
spends only 6.7 per cent of its GNP on healthcare, and drugs represent only
11.6 per cent of that spending. By comparison, Germany spends 13.1 per cent
of its GNP, with pharmaceuticals expenditure representing 15.9 per cent of
that sum.
The UK pharmaceutical industry's export achievement can partly be explained
by the spectacular success of certain UK-based pharmaceutical companies in
recent years.
They include:
Glaxo, which markets the world's best-selling drug, Zantac.
Wellcome, the group that sells Zovirax, the anti-viral drug, and Retrovir,
used in the treatment of HIV-positive patients.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, which sells antibiotics such
as Augmentin, and Tagamet, the ulcer drug.
'The fundamental reason behind last month's increase is that British
companies are researching and then manufacturing world-beating products in
the UK and then selling them worldwide,' explains Mr Geoff Potter of Glaxo.
The export success can also be attributed to growing sales of 'blockbuster'
medicines. Sales of new Glaxo products have been impressive in recent
months, for example.
For the last six months to December sales of Zofran, which helps cancer
patients on chemotherapy, increased to Pounds 120m, while those for
Serevent, the asthma treatment, rose to Pounds 9m. Revenues generated by
Imigran, the controversial migraine drug, increased to Pounds 13m.
These products are so new they are only being manufactured in the UK, even
though they are exported worldwide.
Similarly, sales of Wellcome's Zovirax and Retrovir were up 34 per cent and
31 per cent respectively for the six months to February. In the German
market, a co-marketing agreement with Hoechst helped Zovirax sales increase
22 per cent in local currency terms last year.
Admittedly, some of the increase in exports can be put down to favourable
currency movements. Wellcome, for example, reckons the weak dollar accounted
for a 6 per cent increase in sales for the six months to February.

PROSPECTIVE MPs can often count on the support of their employers,
irrespective of political affiliation, according to Industrial Relations
Services, the independent pay research group.
Employers allow staff time off to fight elections because they feel more MPs
are needed with industrial or business experience.
Employers generally offer parliamentary hopefuls four weeks paid leave, the
survey of several large public and private-sector employers found.
Many employers say they look sympathetically at re-employment should
employees lose their seats or leave parliament.

FT  09 APR 92 / Imro 'thumped' over Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMRO, WHICH regulates the fund management industry, has told members that it
will re-examine its supervisory arrangements and priorities in the wake of
the Maxwell pensions affair. In a letter to members it said it had been
'thumped' when it gave evidence before the Commons social security
committee.
'We cannot claim to have come out of this very well: to an extent Imro was
thumped, and that is not an agreeable experience,' it says.
The regulatory body said it would look at companies with complex structures
leading to tax havens in case things are 'a little too convenient'.
However, Imro believes there was no sustainable reason for refusing
membership to Maxwell companies.
In the case of the Maxwell affair, it says the whole system failed. Imro
says it does not wish to deny that part of the responsibility 'that is
properly ours'.
It concludes: 'In the Maxwell case such vigilance was notably absent: not
one of those with a professional or personal interest - or duty - made any
attempt to alert the regulator'.

THE DEPUTY chairman of Nissan UK and the company's former finance director,
who are accused of cheating the Inland Revenue of corporation tax, were
remanded on bail until May 20 by magistrates in Worthing, West Sussex,
yesterday.
Mr Michael Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director, is charged
with dishonestly arranging for falsely inflated invoices and for the
submission of accounts in which Nissan UK's net pre-tax profits were
understated by about Pounds 100m.
Mr Hunt and Mr Frank Shannon, former finance director, each face a similar
charge in which the alleged understatement of profits was about Pounds 50m
for an earlier period.
A separate case in which Mr Shannon and two of the company's financial
advisers are alleged to have conspired to cheat the Revenue over stock
relief claims was adjourned until April 23 when a date will be fixed for a
hearing for committal to crown court.

FT  09 APR 92 / Fall in sales of commercial vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NEW commercial vehicle sales were 11.5 per cent lower in March than in
the same month last year, the 30th consecutive monthly year-on-year decline.
New commercial vehicle registrations fell to 20,103 from 22,706 in the same
month a year ago, according to figures from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
In the first three months of the year, new commercial vehicle sales, at
53,087, were 11.6 per cent lower than a year ago. Sales have fallen by 47.4
per cent in the past three years.
Commercial vehicle makers have suffered the steepest decline into recession
of the post-1945 period in the past 2 1/2 years and truck sales have fallen
to the lowest level since the mid 1950s.
The first tentative signs are finally emerging that the recession may have
started to bottom out, however, at least in the heavy truck segment of the
market, which was first to dip into decline more than 2 1/2 years ago.
While new registrations at the light end of the commercial vehicle market,
led by sales of small vans, continued to fall heavily in March - matching
the continuing decline in the car market - registrations of heavy trucks
(above 15 tonnes) in March were 18 per cent higher than a year ago.
As a result of the rise last month, heavy truck sales for the first three
months, at 4,250, also showed a small year-on-year increase of 2.7 per cent.
In March, sales of small vans were 22.3 per cent lower than a year ago,
while medium van sales fell by 5.0 per cent year-on-year, and overall truck
sales (above 3.5 tonnes) fell by 3.6 per cent.
In the truck market, the Iveco group, which includes Iveco Ford and Seddon
Atkinson and is a subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, narrowly regained its market
leadership, having been ousted by Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of DAF of
the Netherlands, last year.
Iveco captured 24.2 per cent of UK new truck sales in the first three months
of the year, while Leyland DAF's share declined to 23.6 per cent.
Renault is emerging as the biggest loser in the truck market, with a further
decline of 44.3 per cent in its sales in the first three months of the year,
compared with an overall fall in the truck market of 11.4 per cent.
In the medium van segment (excluding pick-up trucks), Leyland DAF gained a
record market share in the first three months at 16.8 per cent compared with
14.4 per cent a year earlier. Its sales volume rose by 2.9 per cent compared
with a fall in the market of 11.8 per cent.
Volkswagen is showing the strongest performance in the segment, however,
with sales 15.4 per cent higher than a year ago, thanks to the launch last
year of a new product range.
Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, is suffering a rapid decline in
sales in the small van segment with a fall of 40.5 per cent in sales volume
in the first three months.
The company is expected eventually to withdraw from the car-derived van
market as part of its move into more exclusive segments of the car market.

FT  09 APR 92 / Capital expenditure by chemical industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL expenditure by the chemical industry fell 13 per cent in 1991 and
will fall a further 10 per cent this year.
The 1992 fall, predicted today by the Chemical Industry Association, is in
spite of record sums being spent by the chemicals sector on environmental
protection, and substantial amounts invested by the pharmaceuticals groups
on research and development.
The association warned that 1992 was going to be another tough year for the
UK's chemical industry. Since January, little had happened to improve
prospects of an economic recovery either internationally or domestically, it
said.
Moreover, high levels of debt, shortage of capital and the likelihood of
continuing high levels of interest rates would mean that the projected
recovery would be much slower than that after the recession between 1980 and
1981.

FT  09 APR 92 / BCCI creditors win more time on claim agreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have
been given another four weeks in which to make up their minds about draft
agreements to settle their claims.
The High Court yesterday overrode objections from the BCCI liquidators, who
had sought immediate court approval of the agreements, and adjourned the
matter until May 11.
Touche Ross, the BCCI liquidators, told the court that the agreements,
involving the injection of nearly Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 972m) by the
government of Abu Dhabi, were the best options available for the tens of
thousands of BCCI creditors worldwide. The liquidators had negotiated the
package with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi.
Sheikh Zayed with the Abu Dhabi government and other institutions has a
majority shareholding in the bank.
The liquidators said it would increase the estimated return to creditors
from the range of up to 10 per cent to between 30 per cent and 40 per cent,
with a first payment of 10 per cent early next year.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the senior Chancery Division judge, said the creditors'
committee had had insufficient time and insufficient material to reach
conclusions on many points. The committee was not in a position to assess
the likely prospects in any litigation of claims which under the proposed
agreement would be surrendered.
The committee was concerned that creditors were being asked to abandon
claims without adequate information about the prospects of those claims, the
judge said.
Before the principal provisions in the draft agreements would take effect,
creditors with admitted claims totalling Dollars 7bn had to accept the offer
and release claims against the Abu Dhabi government and others by September
30.
Also the liquidators stipulated that court approval should have been
obtained, and the time for appeals have expired, by June 30.
Sir Donald said he was 'impressed by the need for the creditors throughout
the world to have the benefit of informed recommendations from the
creditors' committee as far as that can reasonably be achieved.' He added
that the committee's recommendations were particularly important because
many creditors were undoubtedly unhappy with the proposed terms.
The judge had been told that hearings seeking court approval were due in
Luxembourg on April 28 and the Cayman Islands on April 30. He said he did
not think an adjournment to May 11 would cause insuperable difficulties for
the other courts.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Fizz goes out of poll night parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN goes to the polls today, but three weeks of campaigning have left
voters in anything but a party mood.
Recession, a lacklustre campaign, and the prospect of a hung parliament have
taken some of the fizz out of the traditional euphoria.
Indications are that around 20m voters will slump in front of their TV
screens heaving a sigh of relief that the whole thing is finally over.
'There isn't much to celebrate really,' sighed one senior City of London
banker. 'The Tories have done a lousy campaign and the country is about to
vote in Mr Kinnock as prime minister.' But if 13 years of Conservative rule
comes to an end tonight at least some groups will be marking the event in
style.
Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, at London's Savoy Hotel,
and Lord Wolfson, chairman of Great Universal Stores, at Claridges, are both
hosting parties for the great and the good (provided they vote
Conservative).
At the Savoy, customers can enjoy an Pounds 18-a-head election buffet while
the Dorchester has a special Pounds 35 menu which includes a mystery dessert
entitled Surprise D'Election. Party cocktails will accompany the TV-gazing:
Major's Blues - Blue Curacao and Cointreau, Kinnock's Revival, a
potent-sounding concoction of Frambroise and Cachaca, a Brazilian rum, or
Paddy's Promise, with Galliano and passion fruit.
But not everyone is in the party mood. Party Planners, the party organisers
run by Lady Elizabeth Anson, the Queen's cousin, said it was arranging only
two events, including a Blue and White party in Chelsea. In 1987, it
organised 11.
'It isn't done to be so showy any more,' a spokeswoman confided. 'Actually,
a lot of our clients have been hit by the Lloyd's affair.'
The three main parties will toast their success or drown their sorrows,
although by tonight some of them may be wishing they were at the Golden Lion
Hotel in Ashburton, Devon.
Here, 250 devotees of the Monster Raving Loony Party will commence three
days of revelry, due to last until Monday morning. 'We'll be questioning why
everything went so right for us,' a spokesman explained. 'We're not used to
things going so well.'
For those who favour a more academic approach, the London School of
Economics is hosting a party for 250 with its own experts, including Lord
Desai and Professor Kenneth Minogue, and their very own swingometer
preparing to compete with the TV pundits and their computer graphics.
Around the world, expatriate Britons will be gathering in venues as diverse
as the British Embassy in Paris and the American Club in Rio de Janeiro.
'There is a British club,' admitted one Rio-based ex-pat, 'but the American
one has a happy hour and CNN.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM SHADOW Budgets to soapboxes, the leading parties have tried everything,
David Owen writes. But opinion polls, for the most part, have been
stubbornly unmoved.
Prior to yesterday's polls, Labour had consolidated and arguably widened the
narrow lead it held when Mr John Major named the day. But neither of the
leading parties has sustained anything resembling a decisive breakthrough.
If there has been a pronounced trend, it has favoured the Liberal Democrats,
whose support has climbed to a 19-20 per cent plateau.
Though the Tories have not regained the 39 per cent support level around
which they oscillated for the first two weeks of the campaign, Labour
support has appeared to seep away to the Liberal Democrats in almost equal
measure, leaving the gap between the two leading parties little changed
prior to yesterday's abrupt narrowing.

This is the countdown, with the expected times of declaration - but if
results in marginals are close, there may be delays for recounts.
10pm
The polls close. ITN and the BBC reveal their exit polls. In 1987 both
underestimated Margaret Thatcher's majority.
11pm
The real results. Torbay was first in 1983 and 1987.
Torbay: A Liberal Democrat long-shot. If Adrian Sanders is even close to
removing Tory Rupert Allason, Paddy Ashdown is in for a good night.
Guildford: is a safe Conservative seat, but watch for any large swing to
Labour.
Basildon: Will Labour overturn David Amess's 2,649 majority? The
Conservatives can lose the seat and still have an outright majority.
11.30pm
Cheltenham: Liberal Democrat Nigel Jones seeks to overturn the 4,896
Conservative majority, defended by black barrister John Taylor.
Hyndburn: In 1987, Conservative Kenneth Hargreaves, against the national
trend, increased a majority of 21 to over 2,000.
Dudley West: A comfortable Labour win suggests an outright Labour majority.
Pendle: It will fall to Labour on a small swing.
MIDNIGHT
Blyth Valley: The Labour seat most marginal to the Liberal Democrats.
Hartlepool: Expect a smooth passage to the Commons in this safe seat for
Labour's former communications director, Peter Mandelson.
Northampton North: If Labour's Janet Thomas topples Tony Marlow, Neil
Kinnock is on course for a comfortable majority.
Richmond &amp; Barnes: The Liberals have come close before. With a majority of
only 1,766 junior Northern Ireland minister Jeremy Hanley is under pressure.
Western Isles: The SNP needs a swing of 7.1 per cent to unseat Labour's
Calum MacDonald.
Nuneaton: If Labour's Bill Olner achieves the 5.2 per cent swing needed to
win, John Major will probably have lost his majority.
Gloucester: If Labour wins, Conservatives can go to bed now: Neil Kinnock
will have a very comfortable majority.
Putney: The polls have suggested that Treasury Minister David Mellor may be
in trouble. Also in the London borough of Wandsworth is Battersea where
fellow-Tory John Bowis defends an 857 majority.
Erewash: A Labour gain in this east Midlands seat probably means Neil
Kinnock will (just) win an overall majority. If Labour fails here, but has
won Nuneaton, we are in hung parliament territory.
Don't be surprised if health minister Virginia Bottomley holds South West
Surrey (majority 14,343).
Both Plymouth Drake and Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth are three-way marginals
where anything can happen.
Paddy Ashdown will be the first party leader to know the result in his
constituency: Yeovil is expected at 12.15.
12.30am
By 12.30 the TV pundits should be predicting the final result with more
confidence, unless it is very close.
Amber Valley: Another crucial east Midlands seat. The defeat of Phillip
Oppenheim should confirm an overall Labour majority.
Mitcham &amp; Morden: Labour's Siobhain McDonagh needs a 6.5 per cent swing to
unseat home office minister Angela Rumbold in this south London seat.
Hazel Grove: The Lib Dems are very confident of removing Tory vice-Chairman
Sir Tom Arnold in this suburban seat near Manchester.
Bury North: A good indication of how well the parties are doing in the
north-west, where polls have suggested Conservative support holding up
better than elsewhere.
Ribble Valley: It will be a remarkable achievement if Lib Dem Mike Carr
holds the previously rock-solid Tory seat he snatched in a 1991 by-election.
Bath: Tory Chairman Chris Patten defends a 1,412 majority against Lib Dem
Don Foster.
Birmingham Hall Green: Another weathervane seat, socially typical of the
west Midlands. Its capture means an overall Labour majority.
Labour will win Gravesham with a 7.7 per cent swing. Roy Hattersley should
be re-elected for Birmingham Sparkbrook just before 1.00.
1am
By 1.30 around 300 results, nearly half, will be in.
Hampstead &amp; Highgate: The bookies were quoting Glenda Jackson 1-9 on to make
the Westminster stage.
Erith &amp; Crayford: Labour needs a 7.9 per cent swing. A good indication of
how well Mr Kinnock is doing in London.
Eastbourne: Lib Dem David Bellotti won the seat in an October 1990
by-election.
Oxford West &amp; Abingdon: If Paddy's army remove home officer minister John
Patten, they may win around 35 seats.
Brentford &amp; Isleworth: A close result beckons in this London seat. If Labour
fails here, they will probably be short of an outright majority.
A close result is on the cards in Southwark &amp; Bermondsey where Lib Dem
environment spokesman Simon Hughes defends a majority of only 2,779 against
Labour.
Around 1.30 we should hear if Neil Kinnock has retained Islwyn (maj 22,947)
and if Michael Heseltine has hung on in Henley (maj 17,082).
Gaining St Ives at the tip of Cornwall would be an excellent result for the
Lib Dems.
1.30am
Wallasey: Overseas development minister Lynda Chalker defends a tiny 279
majority.
Derbyshire South: Edwina Currie's personal standing may save her even if
Labour achieve an 8 per cent swing.
Westminster North: Held with a 3,310 majority by Sir John Wheeler.
Conservatives have been strong in local government and electoral register
has shrunk in recent years.
Edinburgh Pentlands: If the polls are right transport secretary Malcolm
Rifkind should just hold on, barring an anti-Tory tactical surge north of
the border.
If Ian Lang loses Galloway, he would be the first cabinet minister defeated
since Shirley Williams in 1979.
Don't expect Labour to lose Doncaster Central, Holborn &amp; St Pancras or
Glasgow Pollak, or the Conservatives to lose Wansdyke, Wellingborough or mid
Worcestershire.
2am
Falmouth &amp; Camborne: Seb Coe attempts to take over the baton from retiring
Cornishman David Mudd. If the Lib Dems are to gain extra seats, Terrye Jones
needs to win here.
Davyhulme: Labour needs an 8.1 per cent swing to remove Winston Churchill.
If Barry Brotherton wins, Neil Kinnock will almost certainly have an
outright majority.
Colne Valley: A three-way marginal.
Barrow &amp; Furness: The reliance of the town on defence (nuclear submarines)
may save Tory Cecil Franks.
The result from John Major's seat, Huntingdon, is expected around 2.30. By
now around 550 results will be in.
2.30am
Perth and Kinross: An SNP target, needing an 6 per cent swing. Labour should
pick up Ayr and Dulwich. Denzil Davies should hold Llanelli where he has a
majority of over 20,000.
3am
Former cabinet minister John Biffen will hold Shropshire North. The results
from Northern Ireland start to appear: West Belfast may be close between
Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and the SDLP.
The last results 'tonight' should be about 4.15. The next result will be
around 11.00 am on Friday.
There are only two possible Labour gains left - Kensington and Brecon and
Radnor.
Neil Kinnock needs to have won at least 321 seats before dawn if he is to
have won an outright victory. If John Major has won around 300 he can expect
an outright majority. If both have won less, we have a hung parliament. Time
for bed.
Thanks to the BBC political research unit for the declaration times, which
are estimates and subject to recounts.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Broadcasters field old with new
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROADCASTERS are applying wise old heads and new technology to the most
comprehensive coverage of the results of a general election.
ITN's coverage through the night will feature Sir Robin Day. Back with the
ITN election team for the first time in more than 30 years, he will
interview senior politicians and pundits in the studio.
ITN has also found a use for the vast atrium in its new London headquarters.
It will be transformed into a life-size electronically generated House of
Commons. John Suchet will walk among political mirages. As the results come
in, ghostly figures in red, blue or yellow will change sides.
At the BBC Peter Snow, handling his eighth election, supported by political
editor John Cole who covered his first election in 1945, will preside over
the return of the Swingometer.
This 16 ft neon-lit pendulum is a long way from the 5 ft wooden version last
seen during the 1979 campaign.
As Peter Snow moves the pendulum across the scale, percentage point by
percentage point, computers will change target seats from blue to red or
vice versa to give what the BBC describes as 'an instant and
clearer-than-ever understanding of the election night battle for power'.
A separate battleground graphic will tell the Liberal Democrat story.
Peter Sissons, who succeeded Sir Robin as presenter of Question Time, will
take over Sir Robin's election night mantle, interviewing politicians and
guests in the studio.
Behind main BBC presenter David Dimbleby, in a refurbished 10,800 sq ft
studio, will be a 20 ft by 16 ft projector screen able to carry simultaneous
pictures from four outside broadcasts - BBC cameras will be at 85 locations.
After a three-and-a-half-hour break for Breakfast News, David Dimbleby will
be back on air until 5.30pm.
As befits devolutionary times, Scottish viewers will be able to choose the
full UK story on BBC1 or their own programme on BBC2.
The BBC's main Election 92 programme is being transmitted live throughout
the night on BBC World Service Television's Asian and European satellite
services and will be available to millions of viewers from China to
Czechoslovakia.
BBC World Service radio will run an election special for five hours
beginning at 2200 GMT.
ITN, which is spending Pounds 2m on its programme, will use 1,000 staff and
freelance journalists to try to be first with the results. It claims it was
first in 450 of the 651 seats in 1987.
Election 92, which will have Jon Snow in the anchor chair following the
retirement of Sir Alastair Burnet, is believed to be the longest programme
ever broadcast on ITV without commercial breaks - it will run for more than
eight hours until TV-am begins at 6am.
Both ITN and the BBC will aim to reduce the uncertainty and excitement by
broadcasting exit poll results, which tend to give a good forecast, early in
the evening.
Sky News, for its first election, will offer a 24-hour results programme
spearheaded by David Frost and Selina Scott.
A 1,000 sq ft screen in the studio will show the interior of the House of
Commons and an eight-screen video wall will display graphic interpretations
of how the voting has gone.
Channel 4 lives up to its reputation for providing an alternative. At 10pm
it shows Scandal, the film about the Profumo affair. Later it will move to
the real Marxists - the Marx brothers and Duck Soup.

FT  09 APR 92 / FT Election Share Index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE campaign ended yesterday, those shares that might benefit from a
Conservative victory moved upwards, against the trend.
This last-minute recovery of confidence in Tory prospects was only a slight
one, however: less than a tenth of a point. Shares that might benefit from a
Labour win dropped, by two tenths of a point. Both parts of the FT Election
Share Index did better than than the FT-SE index.
During the campaign, 'Labour gainers' dropped by just under 4 per cent;
'Tory gainers' dropped 12 per cent; and the FT-SE index dropped 5 per cent.
The biggest changes during the campaign came on the Conservative side of the
index, where five shares dropped by 10 per cent or more. The biggest loser
was BET, which lost 30.1 per cent of its value - for reasons which mostly
revolved around the company itself.
On the Labour side, only two shares dropped by 10 per cent or more. One,
Land Securities, the UK's biggest property company, fell 11.4 per cent,
affected mainly by the shadows cast by the problems of Olympia &amp; York and
Heron. The only two gainers came on the Labour side: Rolls-Royce and BAT, up
3.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.
In the money markets, sterling has steadied this week as investors reasoned
that a Labour government would be unlikely to devalue the pound from its
central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95.
Last night in London, sterling closed at DM2.8425, unchanged on the day and
up from DM2.835 on Friday night.
Unless Labour chose to devalue, the Bank of England and other European
central banks would be forced, under the system's rules, to support the
pound. As a result, at a point close to the lower limit, the pound would
look undervalued, and would be bought by investors.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Long-distance bussing to reach personal ends
 -Campaign trail comes full circle for party leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, RALPH ATKINS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It began in Grantham, Mrs Margaret Thatcher's home town, and ended in
Dulwich in south London, where she bought her post-Downing Street home. In
almost every other respect Mr John Major's campaign has been a contrast to
that of his predecessor, Alison Smith writes. The three and a half weeks on
the road have been a process of Mr Major's finding his own voice on the
campaign trail.
His inexperience at this level of campaigning and his inability to rouse the
faithful to the heights of ecstasy they reached under Mrs Thatcher told
against him.
In his favour were the fact that people liked him, his mastery of his brief
 -albeit in slightly bureaucratic language - and his enjoyment of going out
on tour.
His interest in what he was shown, whether it was a coldstore in Sheerness
Docks, or machine tools in Tamworth, amazed the travelling press.
He said early in the campaign: 'I don't believe you can find out what is
happening in the schools or indeed anywhere else simply by sitting behind a
desk in Whitehall.'
The belief that if everyone in the country could just talk to him for a few
minutes the Tories would win by a landslide lay behind the barstool 'Meet
John Major' sessions. He handled them competently, but they lacked bite and
were too low-key to give the campaign momentum.
The real innovation was the speech-on-a-soapbox, a reprise of his early
political days in Brixton. The soapbox first appeared at the end of March
when there was disorder on a walkabout in Luton, and appeared three times
afterwards. It has not been used since Mr Major said he would take it
everywhere with him, but the sharper style and apparently greater confidence
have remained.
His tour has been the despair of press photographers. The number of
factories and businesses visited was more than all the schools, hospitals,
sporting venues and farms - which would be expected to yield better pictures
 -put together.
His speeches at the seven setpiece rallies have benefited dramatically from
his working on them more himself, though this led to some longuers during
the campaign day which often lacked focus.
Nearly 10,000 miles and 26 days later, Mr Major is a better campaigner. But
an election in a recession was not the best time for a learning curve.
The banana-yellow battle bus of Mr Paddy Ashdown ended its tour in the party
leader's Yeovil constituency last night, Ralph Atkins writes.
Its success will be measured in the extra votes Liberal Democrats are
expected to win today. The failures? It is still not clear what the party's
'My Vote' slogan actually means.
The effectiveness of the leader's tour has surprised even party officials.
One admitted yesterday that strategy meetings had descended into witty
repartee, in the absence of decisions to be made.
It could have gone horribly wrong. The punishing schedule - literally from
dawn to after midnight from the Scottish Highlands to the tip of Cornwall -
could have led to physical exhaustion and disgruntled journalists. One
Ashdown aide said: 'If we were five points down, not up, in the opinion
polls, we'd be very different.'
To impartial observers the fireworks, dry-ice and streamers at the evening
rallies looked out of place at the slightly dilapidated school halls often
chosen as venues. But in fleeting TV pictures, they were on a par with
Labour or the Tories.
Mr Ashdown's message has been broad-brush and populist. Only in the last few
days has his party's manifesto been subject to precise questioning in
set-piece television interviews, and even then discussion on hung parliament
scenarios has predominated.
Introducing Mr Neil Kinnock as the next prime minister is commonplace at
Labour rallies. With campaigning virtually over, this no longer carries the
empty ring of impending failure, Michael Cassell writes.
Mr Kinnock and his team, hopelessly exhausted yet spurred on by the sweet
smell of victory, believe the ultimate prize is but hours away. The leader's
voice is wrecked, but his temper has not frayed. The entourage appears
deeply drained but highly relieved that the slog is over.
But there is also controlled exhilaration. When an aide said: 'This has been
the easy bit, from Friday we start the real job,' she meant it.
Talk of how Gerald will perform, whether Gordon will strike up a healthy
relationship with business, who will be the first cabinet member to get the
chop, is all discussed with an impressive air of certainty. The language of
speculation has drifted away.
But throughout the last few hectic hours of plane-hopping, photo-calls and
soundbites Mr Kinnock's men and women have been anxious that no one should
go over the top in public and risk offending those who remain undecided by
displaying a touch too much triumphalism.
The campaign tactics surrounding the leader remained unchanged until the
final hours. Mr Kinnock was enveloped in the trappings of a senior
statesman, hopping from aircraft to Daimler to selected audience, his every
handshake orchestrated.
As the Kinnock campaign drew to a close late last night, emotions on the
Labour bus fell and then rose again as the message from the final opinion
polls came through.
By the time Mr Kinnock had told supporters in his own constituency that
Labour was set to win, spirits were as high as at any time during the
campaign.
Today Mr Kinnock and his team can only rest and await the nation's verdict.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: City Watch - A hard day's night for the
brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seemed that it might be one of the last opportunities for a traditional
City lunch before a Labour victory. The Economics Editor was determinedly
contrarian. 'I have been bearish about the British economy for 10 years, but
now I am going to be optimistic,' he proclaimed before forecasting that the
Footsie would tumble further to the 2,200 level. 'With bulls like him, who
needs bears?' complained a fellow guest.
Impending damage to Square Mile lifestyles was viewed with curiosity rather
than anxiety by the Young Stockbroker. 'I was 13 when Labour was last in
power so I can't really recall what it was like,' he confessed. 'And
remember that the foreign-exchange dealers are even younger than I am.'
An entire generation of City practitioners has indeed grown up since the
Conservatives came to power in 1979. Yuppie dealers were unknown in the
1970s, and the Porsches and mobile telephones only ap-peared in the Thatcher
years.
The new aggressive trading style will be strongly in evidence tonight, when
many big broking firms are planning to stay open most of the night.
In gilt-edged, for instance, unofficial trading will start at about 10pm,
when the official polls close and the exit polls are published, and will
continue as the results are declared through the night.
Early dealing for UK and Continental clients could be replaced by US
trading, and eventually the Far East may come on-line, depending on how
unpredictable the election turns out to be. The official markets are only
making modest gestures to the big occasion, however. The Stock Exchange Seaq
equity trading system will open just half an hour early on Friday morning.
If Labour wins and introduces its threatened high-tax regime, will it be
possible to motivate people to work the kind of hours and accept the kind of
stresses which have become normal in the City of London's financial markets?
Already there are stories of many City firms rushing out bonuses by last
week so that their employees could benefit from the relatively benign tax
rules of the last financial year. In some cases, apparently, companies have
paid the whole of the coming tax year's salaries in advance as a precaution
against a threatened 19 per cent jump in the marginal tax rate.
Veterans remember the days when tax on earnings was anything up to 95 per
cent. But only a few partners in City firms were liable to such rates, and
then only in theory. They could hire the best tax experts to reduce tax
liabilities.
Today the partnerships have nearly all been bought by big banks which may
make it harder to remunerate people in a tax-efficient way. On the other
hand, in the absence of exchange controls a whole new category of avoidance
schemes has become possible. A recent colourful example was the device of
avoiding National Insurance contributions by paying people in gold bars
lodged temporarily in offshore havens.
At the lunch the genial atmosphere failed to overcome entirely the
underlying gloom. But it would take more than the approach of a
fierce-taxing socialist regime to knock the Technical Analyst off his
stride. He knew that sheer uncertainty was the greatest threat to the stock
market.
'I take it, gentlemen, that we will all be short-term buyers of the market
whatever the result on Thursday,' he said.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: A campaign where the bland led the bland /
Review of the highs and lows of a performance that has thrilled but failed
to enlighten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS NOT the best of times, nor the worst of times. Often, it was almost
the blandest of times. Now, at the eleventh hour, it is a cliffhanger.
Elections, it seems, are now such delicate democratic organisms that they
must be swaddled in verbal cotton wool, coated in a flannel of
photo-opportunities and as slickly packaged as a weekend in Disneyworld.
Seldom can so much effort, film, tape and newsprint have been expended by so
many to enlighten so little.
Yet, as the broadcasting audience figures prove, the making and breaking of
prime ministers and parties is still a process that captures the public's
imagination.
This morning, as millions of voters wake to the buzzes and beeps of digital
clock-radios, the few thousand political activists who have actually
participated in the gruelling campaign will have to resist the temptation to
thump their snooze buttons and instead drag themselves to the breach.
For the 3,000-odd candidates - hopefuls and hopeless alike - every last
loud-hailer rallying call, every OAP chauffeured to the polling station
could tip the balance.
In the campaign itself, the parties fought themselves to a draw. The economy
and the National Health Service dominated the agenda. Education and Europe
fell off it. And so did the much-promised Dirty Tricks '92 election - a
figment of the press's wishful thinking. In spite of widespread billing as
the vilest election in history, the contest ended up with little more than
the occasional egg on its face.
Much of this can be blamed on Mr John Smith. His decision to come clean  -
well, cleanish - on his tax and spending plans with his shadow Budget at the
start of the campaign was the equivalent of bricking up a veritable Klondyke
of gaffe opportunities.
Mr John Major's efforts to conjure up a Nightmare on Kinnock Street was just
no substitute. What is more, the red menace charge carried no more
conviction than Tory sightings of the first economic upturns of spring or
Labour's pledge to reverse NHS underfunding at the toss of a billion-pound
coin.
Indeed, just to prove the Labour leader harmless, his minders took him
repeatedly to school-playgrounds where he showed the cameras that he could
sing nursery rhymes with the kids without swallowing so much as a baby.
As Mr Neil Kinnock went soft, Mr Major got tough on a barstool and Mr Paddy
Ashdown turned combatively moderate.
It was not until the now-celebrated War of Jennifer's Ear that anybody
actually lost their tempers. The great-grommet dispute is now best
remembered for its sound and fury rather than for its root causes. As a
diversion, nonetheless, it allowed righteous indignation a shortlived
opportunity to muscle the politicians' more run-of-the-mill hyperbole off
the stage.
For a while, too, the human story of one girl's wait for NHS treatment
seemed to inject a little everyday reality into the otherwise other-worldly
melange of borrowing requirements and pay differentials. But the true guts
of the health debate - how a government rations care with limited resources
 -was too complex an issue for anyone to unravel. The polls hiccoughed, then
returned to par.
For the most part, it was a battle between the Big-endians and the
Little-endians with the overstated cases of both parties, requiring - like
any other theatrical performance - the willing suspension of disbelief.
Mr Michael Ignatieff, the academic and broadcaster, was not alone in
remarking on the surrealism. 'My worst moment,' he recalled yesterday, 'was
finding myself kneeling on a motorway bridge in Carshalton with Paddy,
talking to a four-year-old about newts.'
There were plenty of other embarrassments. Mr Kinnock's spine-chilling
exhortation - 'Werrralllrighttt]]]' - at his Sheffield rally was one;
another was Mr Major's camp love affair with his soap box: 'Wherever I go
for the rest of this campaign, my soap box will go with me.'
Two other memorable moments of truth: when Mr Kinnock frankly explained that
the economy would be safe in his hands because he did not want to ruin his
chances of winning a a second term; the second, Mr Major's poignant plea to
voters not to have his home repossessed.
But in these blandest of times, it would be ungenerous to carp.
Middle-income, medium-powers like Britain should, perhaps, be grateful for
middling politicians nurtured, like the rest of us, on the National Health
Service and free school milk.

SOUTH-EA
In this region the sand of recession has clogged up the electoral machinery,
David Marsh writes. And the many who feel they have lost out under the
Tories are in a mood to exact vengeance.
Even if the Tories confound the pollsters and scrape home, the policies of
any future Major government would be much less geared to promoting
red-blooded capitalism.
In southern England, much has not changed. The division into 'them and us'
is still ever-present, emphasised by the separate appeal of the two main
parties to different thicknesses of wallet.
For all the recent modernisation of the Labour party, its candidates - who
are on the whole more human, more humble and more humorous than the dozen
Tory incumbents I have interviewed - still see that old devil 'market
forces' as their chief enemy.
As for the signs of change that appeared during the 1980s, some are
pleasant, but many are disagreeable. The preponderance of expensive fashion
shops in town centres seems proportional to the number of shabbily dressed
people outside - some, with vague looks on their faces, on their way to
scour rubbish bins.
The Conservatives stand accused of neglecting the nation and feather-bedding
themselves. They point to what they say will happen if Labour wins: not only
will the dead go unburied again, but their mortgage bills will go up too.
The south of England has long regarded itself as a secure province in the
heart of a victorious country. If the tide turns, and the opposing armies
advance, the province could wake tomorrow to find itself on the front line.
LONDON: Labour's London campaign team thought it would be tilting at giants,
but they turned out to be only windmills, David Owen writes.
Tory tacticians have not come up with anything remotely comparable to
Labour's Big London Idea: a strategic government for the capital.
Also, this time Labour's outspoken figures - from Mr Ken Livingstone in
Brent East to Mr Bernie Grant in Tottenham - have been models of obedience.
'It is sheer discipline that has been doing it,' says Mr Tony Banks, the
candidate for Newham North West, slipping into his best hair shirt.
Bar the odd fulmination from Mr Michael Heseltine, Central Office has made
little attempt to communicate the message to voters in the capital's
marginals. Candidates and constituents have been left to work it out for
themselves. This inertia has bred resentment at grassroots level. One
Conservative candidate in a key London seat describes those running the
party's campaign as 'absolute nincompoops'.
Winning the campaign will not necessarily win Labour the 21 London seats it
needs to secure an overall majority. For once, though, Labour has made every
effort to smooth its own path.
Polls suggest that 16 or 17 gains may be within its grasp.
MIDLANDS: Three weeks ago, Mr Neil Kinnock walked into Birmingham's
International Convention Centre in a rally to launch the Labour campaign,
Richard Donkin writes. But all the subsequent rallies and tours by the party
leaders, played out for the media have borne little resemblance to the
campaign on the ground in the west Midlands.
The candidates have at times felt remote from their leaderships and have
seen a different Britain from that which comes across from the invited
audiences and radio phone-ins.
Arguments about tax did not count for much in the west Midlands, where most
wage earners are below the levels needed to trigger Labour's higher rates.
One in six manufacturing employees in the region rely on the motor industry
for their jobs, and news that car sales fell in March did nothing to lift
morale in Conservative party offices in the marginal seats. While they were
solidly behind Mr Major, one could not escape a feeling that they were
suffering withdrawal symptoms from the euphoria of the Thatcher years.
The fact that opinion has apparently moved little during the campaign in the
Midlands has not surprised veteran party agents, who rarely worry about the
issues. They wear a heavy cloak of cynicism woven from past experience.
Sir Richard Knowles, Labour's agent for Birmingham Sparkbrook, said: 'The
best a candidate could do would be to fall ill for the duration of the
campaign, in which case he might earn about 500 extra sympathy votes. If his
wife had a baby just before the poll, it would be even better.'
NORTH-WE
In this part of England the country is perceived as being run from the
south-east, for the south-east, Roger Matthews writes. Party leaders have
reinforced that impression as they have increasingly relied on the
electronic media to get their message across.
Local candidates make great play where they can of their affinity with the
region - people in Lancashire have been heard to say 'the lad's not from
round here so he can't understand cotton' as a definitive reason for voters
opposing a candidate.
In the north-west, where people remain refreshingly direct and do not mind
discussing how they vote, there has been all too little debate at
constituency level. If it were not for the churches and other religious
organisations, there would be almost no set-piece public meetings involving
all the candidates.
Public exposure, which goes beyond shaking hands in shopping malls and
knocking on doors, might also contribute to an improvement in the selection
and preparedness of candidates.
Emotions have been strongly stirred among two sections of voters: those who
feel betrayed by the Conservative party and those who suffer an almost
allergic reaction to Mr Neil Kinnock. Labour, whatever its debt to Mr
Kinnock for bringing the party back to the electorate, has benefited far
more from the performance of Mr John Smith.
SCOTLAND: The final pre-election polls in Scotland have not been encouraging
for the Scottish National party, James Buxton and Bethan Hutton write. Three
polls yesterday showed the party's support declining by about 2 points, to
between 24 and 25 per cent.
While Labour and the Conservatives publicly took comfort from the apparent
decline in the nationalists' fortunes and from a decline in support for
independence, opinion polls have in the past understated the SNP's support.
In any case, the nationalists' position in the polls is still nearly double
what it was in 1987.
In addition, the outcome in many key Scottish constituencies, where four
parties are contesting marginal seats under the first-past-the-post system,
is virtually impossible to forecast.
A poll for The Scotsman newspaper, while showing Labour and the
Conservatives unchanged on 41 per cent and 22 per cent respectively, showed
a 2-point rise in backing for the Liberal Democrats, to 11 per cent.
Although that is well below their average of 18 per cent in national
surveys, much of their support is entrenched in rural constituencies where
individual MPs have strong personal votes.

STATE FUNDING for political parties, promised in Labour's manifesto, would
loosen but not sever the ties between the party and the unions that finance
it, according to Labour and union officials.
Both sides agree that a more distant relationship is preferable. State
funding would be a financial relief for the Labour-affiliated unions, which
at present finance about half Labour's running costs between elections and
nearly all election spending.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, believes his proposal for
reducing the union block vote at Labour conference from 90 per cent to 50
per cent is likely to be accepted more quickly as a result of the prospect
of state funding.
Labour officials argue that the unions' 'political ballast' at party
conference and in the electoral college will still be required to balance
the unreliable constituency parties.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown claims the high ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats have stopped UK elections descending into US-style
negative attacks and tax-based attempts to bribe voters, Mr Paddy Ashdown
claimed last night at his final rally of the campaign.
Labour and the Conservatives had been forced to change tactics and move to a
more positive agenda in response to the Liberal Democrat campaign, Mr
Ashdown told an enthusiastic audience of party supporters in Taunton.
In a speech embracing his party's themes - particularly education - Mr
Ashdown again pitched for a coalition government if today's poll results in
a hung parliament.
Touring his Yeovil constituency, the Liberal Democrat leader warned that
either an early second general election or a minority government would be
damaging to Britain.
Liberal Democrats believe that Mr John Major's hint on the BBC's Election
Call programme that he might not vote down a minority Labour government's
Queen's Speech will play to their advantage.
'If they (the Tories) are going, to quote Mr Major, to act as the
doorkeepers to a Labour government, that's up to them,' Mr Ashdown said,
echoing an attack on him by the prime minister earlier in the campaign.
Party strategists will slow events if today's poll results in a a hung
parliament. Mr Ashdown told journalists: 'There will be no rushing around.
It is a business that must be taken carefully, the formation of a
government.'
He intended to have a quiet Friday 'and a couple of beers or three.'
At the Taunton rally, he said: 'Both of the other two parties were
determined in this election to concentrate on their negative attacks.
Britain was in great danger of descending into a form of politics in which
the party which bribed you the most was always going to win. It was the
Liberal Democrats who had the courage to stand up and be counted.'
He told supporters: 'The more votes Liberal Democrats win, the more seats we
win, and the more power we will have to ensure good government for our
country.' He predicted Liberal Democrat gains across south-west England:
'There are beacons being lit all across the west country - Liberal Democrat
breakthroughs every one.'
He told his audience that the election, 'is about your children, your
community, your country.'

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: PM's brave fight against party's past /
Weighing up the campaign performance of Thatcher's heir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr John Major loses today's general election it will be because he has
failed to disentangle himself from his party's past.
The judgment of history might well be that after a brief 16 months in
Downing Street, the prime minister was faced with an impossible task. No
party since the Napoleonic wars has won four successive terms in office. He
is seeking to match that record in the midst of the worst recession in
living memory.
But if Mr Neil Kinnock stands on the threshold of 10 Downing Street tomorrow
morning, the judgment of the present may prove a great deal harsher. An
election defeat could well be followed by a leadership challenge.
In personal terms Mr Major has fought a brave election. He has been as
energetic and determined as could be expected of any leader. Predictions
that he would crack under the pressure of a month-long campaign were proved
wrong. There have been gaffes, but fewer than were made by his predecessor
in 1987.
His personal rating in the opinion polls has dropped. As a candidate for
office rather than a prime minister, he has sometimes looked ill-at-ease and
vulnerable. Neither trend surprised those who have followed previous
elections; and Labour as well as Conservative candidates testify that on the
doorstep he has remained an asset to his party.
But to win elections it is not enough to be brave. Nor is it enough to be
nice.
Mr Major's appearances on an old-fashioned soapbox jarred with those who
view election campaigns through the establishment prism of Westminster. The
prejudices of the chattering classes may not matter. But it was a style that
diminished the image of the international statesman which had been so
carefully constructed in Downing Street.
If the opinion polls are right, his you-get-what-see honesty and decency
have not persuaded enough voters to forgive his party the poll tax and the
recession.
Mr Major's promise of a different future has not been projected with great
enough clarity to wipe out painful memories of the past.
From the outset he has relied on the contrast between his leadership and
that of Mr Kinnock to boost the Conservative share of the vote. The polls
say that share has fallen fractionally during the campaign.
His advisers always overestimated the part that personal popularity plays in
politics. The electorate, after all, voted for that nasty Mrs Margaret
Thatcher in 1979 when the avuncular Mr James Callaghan had a strong lead in
the ratings.
It is the message that counts. The prime minister's best hope was that his
prospectus for the 1990s - wealth creation and welfare side by side - would
persuade the electorate to look to the future rather than the past.
The Conservatives always knew that after three terms in office the most
resonant chord Mr Kinnock could strike would be time for change. Mr Major,
they said, would offer that change, depriving Labour of its most powerful
message. That was why Mrs Thatcher had been toppled.
But instead it has been an election campaign in which the new prime minister
never quite explained to the voters just who he was. The electorate was told
he could be trusted; but to do what?
Mr Major is not a Thatcherite. As he explained again yesterday morning
during some bruising encounters on the BBC's Election Call programme, nor is
he a politician driven by ideological certainties.
He works from a set of principles - belief in individual choice,
responsibility and ownership - which are as true to the tradition of
one-nation Toryism as they are to the theology of his predecessor.
His election manifesto replaces the radical zeal and simple truths of the
Thatcher years with page after page of dispassionate pragmatism. She was
determined to change the world from the top down, her successor promises to
work from the bottom up.
Mrs Thatcher herself offers private testimony to the break with the past. In
spite of her public loyalty during the campaign, her disdain for the
policies of her successor is an open secret. She believes that he has been
too lax over public spending and borrowing; she is dismissive of the
Citizen's Charter; she is convinced that he gave too much ground to
Britain's European partners at the Maastricht summit.
Mr Major, though, has not been prepared to admit - let alone proclaim - a
distinctively different agenda. Nor has he shown the sheer force of
political personality which allowed Mr Michael Heseltine to pretend that
there is no contradiction between conviction and consensual politics.
At times the prime minister tried to fight the election on his own record:
victory in the Gulf, a return to consensual government, abolition of the
poll tax, better funding for the welfare state and the European deal at
Maastricht.
But the cautious politician who climbed the ladder to Downing Street by
making friends rather than enemies was not willing to disown the errors made
in the triumphalist aftermath of the 1987 election victory. I am not Mrs
Thatcher, he would say, but I greatly admire her.
There was a record to defend - the replacement of statist with market
economics, the taming of the trades unions, privatisation, the spread of
ownership. But Mr Major found himself dogged during the campaign by the two
most damaging mistakes of Mrs Thatcher's government: the economic boom which
brought the recession in its wake, and the poll tax.
Time and again the prime minister was asked to apologise for those mistakes.
Time and again he demurred. On each occasion the credibility of his promise
of a different future was diminished.
The identity crisis brought a series of swerves in his party's campaign. Mr
Major began with the proclamation of his caring Conservatism, lurched into a
defence of the incomes of the affluent, and then retreated into a
less-than-convincing defence of the Thatcher revolution.
For a week the campaigning became entirely negative - until the party
discovered that a bruised and disgruntled electorate wanted to be told why
they should vote Conservative as well as why they should not vote Labour.
The most powerful message of the campaign - that Mr Kinnock's tax and
spending plans would abort the economic recovery promised by a Conservative
victory - was persistently obscured.
It may well be that the opinion polls will be proved wrong. That in the
privacy of the ballot box the voters will decide to forgive the prime
minister his party's sins for fear of Labour's tax plans.
If Mr Major wins an overall majority he will be free of the baggage of his
past, with a mandate to build his own political identity. If Mr Kinnock
wins, Mr Major's party may prove as unforgiving as the electorate.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock urges rejection of Tory 'failure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Mr Neil Kinnock last night made an eve-of-poll appeal to
voters to reject a 'Tory future of insecurity, rundown and division' and to
allow a Labour government to build a Britain capable of becoming a
'pacemaker in Europe'.
Mr Kinnock rounded off the campaign in his Islwyn constituency by pledging
to his supporters that Labour would not only win today's election but would
be re-elected at the next general election.
He promised an end to the 'switch-back of boom and bust' and offered a
future of steady advance.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Kinnock told a rally in Barry, south Wales, that
Britain wanted a government that pulled the country together and pushed it
to greater achievements.
He said the election would not be won as a result of three weeks'
campaigning but because of the government's long record of 'failure and
fracture'.
The Labour leader said: 'The Tories cannot escape their own record. Tomorrow
they will not escape the verdict of the people. People want rid of them.'
Mr Kinnock said his government would immediately begin the task of getting
Britain out of recession. The need to reconstruct its industries, sciences
and skills was urgent, only eight months before Britain was forced to
compete in the world's biggest single market.
He highlighted Labour's programme for increased investment in education and
in the National Health Service, and said a priority for Labour would be the
building and repairing of homes so that families did not have to suffer 'the
misery and insecurity of bad housing, overcrowding and homelessness'.
Mr Kinnock accused the government of concentrating power in its hands and of
becoming 'frenzied with deregulation in standards of safety and probity'.
They had been hyperactive in cutting top tax rates and slicing bottom-rate
benefits. Their failure to build up the economy and invest in the nation's
future had been a matter of conviction and doctrine.
Mr Kinnock said he wanted Britain to celebrate the coming millennium with
something better than a big New Year's Eve party.

Severn River Crossing has waited until the election is out of the way before
calling a press conference next Monday to confirm that tolls on the Severn
Bridge into Wales will go up from the present Pounds 1 each way to Pounds
2.80.
Severn River is a subsidiary of the Anglo-French consortium that has been
awarded the contract to build the second crossing of the estuary, due to
open by 1996.
Tolls are such a contentious issue in Wales that an announcement of an
increase before the election could have had all sorts of consequences.
The Welsh Nationalists would like them abolished altogether, Labour would
like them to go, but can't afford to promise. Only the Tories are in favour,
with Welsh secretary David Hunt saying that higher tolls are a price worth
paying for the second bridge.

Graham Bright, John Major's portly parliamentary private secretary, has been
having at least as difficult a campaign as his political master.
As MP for Luton South since 1979, Bright is defending a 5,115 majority
against Labour's Bill McKenzie, a former Price Waterhouse partner who gave
up his accountancy job to fight the seat in 1987.
Bright has already accused McKenzie's wife of organising a 'mob' of 'thugs'
who barracked the prime minister when he visited the town. Under pressure
from McKenzie's solicitors, he was forced to issue an embarrassing apology.
Next Bright alleged that, if Labour wins today, councils would have
'compulsory powers' to repurchase homes bought by former tenants. Even
Bright's agent has admitted in response to protests that the claim is
overstated.
A Conservative leaflet also charges that Labour would 'lower educational
standards'. The section is headed 'Labour's disastrous programme'.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Murdoch solid - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No election-eve nerves on the part of Rupert Murdoch. Some thought his
British newspaper empire might at least hedge its bets in the face of a
possible Labour victory, but yesterday demonstrated otherwise.
Although Today, Murdoch's faltering middle-market paper, has conducted a
fair-minded election campaign in terms of its reporting, its final editorial
came down squarely behind John Major, as the man to trust with Britain's
future.
Predictably, The Times, having visited briefly the arguments for Labour,
also argued for the 'likeable, competent and honest' Major.
The Sun took a promiscuous two pages, including the front, to make the same
point.
Murdoch's Sunday papers have already assembled in the blue square.
Labour has thus been given no reason to draw back on its manifesto threat to
bring the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the media industry, a move
inextricably linked with the party's desire to roll back Murdoch.
Some think that faced with a choice, Murdoch might go for TV rather than
print. Given his sensitive relationship with his banks, however, it's hard
to see him selling cash cows like The Sun, the News of the World and The
Sunday Times. Today, however, could be gone tomorrow and, who knows, perhaps
The Times would be vulnerable too.

FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lamont right at the end - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the campaign drew to a close, it was difficult not to feel sorry for
Norman Lamont.
The chancellor shot his credibility last year by prematurely predicting an
economic upturn 'round the corner' and espying too soon the 'green shoots'
of recovery, and so has been in no position to exploit several recent signs
of the economic revival.
If it takes at least three pieces of evidence to make a trend, there is
reason to hope for better times ahead.
One survey this week has found a majority of UK businessmen expecting higher
orders and sales.
Another report says that Britain's purchasing managers are buying more.
Retail sales have edged higher for two months and consumer confidence has
risen.
Such evidence may not be enough to declare an end to the recession.
But should we be surprised, if, at some point in the future, statistics show
that the British economy was moving upwards in April 1992?

SENIOR officials of shareholder governments are to begin talks in September
on a replenishment of the Inter-American Development Bank's capital
Mr Enrique Iglesias, bank president, said he expected a meeting of its
governors would be convened then to discuss the issue.
The previous capital increase, of Dollars 26.5bn, was agreed three years ago
to cover the four years until end-1993. Ministers from Latin American
governments told the bank's annual meeting, which ended in Santo Domingo
yesterday, that the increase should be Dollars 40bn or more.
However, some shareholders, such as Germany, have said they believe less
would suffice.
Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
said that the US, the largest shareholder, was favourably disposed both to
an increase in the IADB's capital and to a boost of the bank's concessional
lending operations.
But he said a clear view of the bank's role in the 1990s was needed before
figures could be discussed. For example, as the role of the bank changed,
more of its lending should be directed to the smaller, poorer countries in
Latin America.
Answering a question about whether the US would give up any of its share in
the bank to accommodate European and Japanese demands for a greater
shareholding, Mr Mulford said that would have to await the capital
replenishment discussions.
However, he said that the US would 'have to think long and hard before we
would wish to convey a message that we were losing interest in the region.'

He is the only current presidential contender in elective office and

As head of the ruling PRI, Mr Colosio was deemed ineligible for the

months.
Mr Augusto Blacker Miller, foreign minister, told a news conference late on
Tuesday that President Alberto Fujimori would resign if the plebiscite
rejected the reforms.
On Sunday, the president dissolved Congress, arrested opposition politicians
and suspended constitutional rights, in what he called temporary measures to
cleanse the judiciary and the political system of corruption.
The length of time the government is proposing before the return of some
semblance of democracy was a surprise. Diplomats had expected a shorter
interval, in view of the suspension since Sunday of much-needed
international economic aid.
Mr Blacker Miller said it would take at least six months for a special
commission to draft reforms to the constitution, the judiciary and the
constitutional tribunal.
The minister added that a dozen opposition Congressmen under house arrest
would be freed within two weeks and press curbs would be lifted.

FT  09 APR 92 / New York victory puts Clinton within reach of nomination as
Brown falters

MR BILL Clinton left New York yesterday, after two gruelling weeks of
campaigning, with the Democratic party's presidential nomination firmly in
his reach, reports George Graham in Washington.
By winning the New York primary on Tuesday with 41 per cent of the vote, the
Arkansas governor vaulted the biggest hurdle of his campaign for the
nomination.
Victories in Wisconsin and Kansas on the same day added to his commanding
lead over both Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California and the only
major candidate still in the Democratic race, and Mr Paul Tsongas, former
senator from Massachusetts, who continues to win votes although he has
formally withdrawn from the race.
President George Bush, meanwhile, continued to record comfortable victories
in Republican party primaries.
Mr Clinton acknowledged yesterday that many voters still felt uncomfortable
with him because of the series of allegations about adultery, marijuana
smoking and draft dodging that have beset his campaign. 'I'm not interested
in whether they love me or not. I want them to respect me and want me to be
their president,' he said.
Although Mr Tsongas caused a surprise by winning 29 per cent of the New York
vote, he said he would take several days to decide whether to re-enter the
race.
Most politicians in Washington believe that, even if Mr Tsongas decides to
relaunch his candidacy, he will do so with a severely limited campaigning
schedule, more in the hope of influencing his party's policies than of
winning the nomination.
Mr Brown, however, vowed to soldier on, despite having been largely
repudiated by voters in New York, where he won only 25 per cent of the vote.
He fared better in Wisconsin, with 35 per cent.
Clinton supporters were working intensely yesterday to win over the 772
Democratic party committee members and Congress members who will take part
in the nominating convention in July as unelected super-delegates.
Mr Clinton is estimated to have the backing of 213 of them already, as well
as that of 50 per cent of the 2,197 delegates so far committed by primaries
and caucuses.
Although Mr Clinton is unlikely to be able to clinch the nomination
mathematically until the last round of state primaries on June 2, his
supporters believe Congressional leaders will now quickly fall in behind his
candidacy.
'We just got through the biggest obstacle which was New York. From here on,
Jerry Brown is a mathematical impossibility and Paul Tsongas is
mathematically improbable,' said Mr Charles Dolan, co-ordinator for the
Clinton campaign in Virginia, which is the next state to vote.

FT  09 APR 92 / Mathematical reality concentrates the minds of party
leaders: US Democrats beginning to accept the battered presidential
front-runner from Arkansas, drawbacks and all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER Mr Bill Clinton's victories in the New York, Wisconsin and Kansas
primaries on Tuesday, the Democratic Party establishment in Washington is
bracing itself at last to acknowledge that the Arkansas governor is
virtually certain to be the party's presidential candidate in November.
'There are some rudimentary mathematical realities of the present
situation,' said Mr Ron Brown, party chairman, who has tried to have members
coalesce quickly behind one candidate so as to begin the battle against
President Bush.
Those realities are that Mr Clinton has won about 1,264 of the 4,288
delegates who will select the Democratic candidate at the party's convention
in New York in July.
If he wins half of the delegates still to be allotted in primaries and
caucuses - and he should do considerably better in some states, especially
Arkansas - and half of the officials and committee members who will attend
the convention as super-delegates, he will have assured himself of the 2,145
delegates needed to secure the nomination.
If Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California and the only other
Democratic candidate still campaigning, were to win every delegate still
uncommitted - a most unlikely proposition - he would fall short of the
required total.
There remains a remote chance that no clear nominee will emerge, leaving
room for party leaders to pick another candidate at the convention, but this
is largely a fantasy of Washington pundits and of nostalgic power-brokers
who forget that they rewrote the party's rules to make such an outcome
near-impossible.
Besides, the other possible candidates usually mentioned, such as Senator
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, epitomise the Washington power structures that
voters have resoundingly repudiated in state after state.
Many Democrats, especially those Congress members whose fortunes in their
re-election contests in November will be closely tied to those of their
party's presidential candidate, remain uncomfortable.
The steady drip of stories about Mr Clinton's problems with marriage,
marijuana and the Vietnam war draft has not proved fatal, but has compounded
the voting public's discomfort with a candidate who often appears evasive
and too clever by half.
But the governor has proved himself a tough and resilient campaigner, Also,
in the more substantive realm of policy debate, he has scored telling points
over Mr Bush.
Among the Republicans, the president's road as candidate now appears free of
danger, for the rebellion of Mr Patrick Buchanan, the right-wing television
commentator who challenged him in the early primaries, has largely subsided.
Even so, the administration still appears in disarray. It has struggled to
produce statements of policy on the economy and health care, and has
appeared unable to follow through on them.
While senior Republicans say publicly that they hope Mr Clinton will win the
Democratic nomination, because he would be easy to beat, White House
officials acknowledge that they have begun to shift their policy stance in
recognition of Mr Clinton's emergence as a candidate who could represent the
option of change.
Yet Mr Bush retains great advantages as an incumbent whose image is already
well-formed for voters, most of whom still know little of his probable
opponent, Mr Clinton, except that he may or may not have committed adultery
and that he may or may not have dodged the Vietnam draft.
For both candidates, however, the very low turnout in every primary except
that of New Hampshire, the first state to hold one, is the most ominous
sign. Both have a lot left to do in order to reach voters.

FT  09 APR 92 / Relieved PLO celebrates Arafat's survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Yassir Arafat, the great survivor of Arab politics, it was almost
certainly his closest brush with death. His miraculous escape on Tuesday,
when he walked away from an aircraft crash in which three crew members were
reported killed, will have done nothing to diminish his Houdini-like
reputation.
Mr Arafat, who has somehow escaped numerous attempts by his enemies to
eliminate him, including at least two attempted assassinations by the
Israelis, was reported by immensely relieved Palestine Liberation
Organisation officials to be in good spirits, although suffering slight
bruises after his aircraft came down in the Libyan desert.
The 62-year-old PLO leader, who was en route from Sudan to an air base in
south-eastern Libya when his aircraft ran into a blinding sandstorm, was out
of contact for 15 hours, and hopes were fading that he would be found alive.
But as so often in the past, just when his personal and political obituaries
were being written, Mr Arafat re-emerged, confounding the worst fears of his
colleagues and supporters. He was taken first to Sarra, location of a large
Palestinian guerrilla base 30 km (18 miles) from the crash site and then on
to Tripoli.
In the occupied territories yesterday, at least 15 Palestinians were shot
and wounded in clashes with Israeli troops during demonstrations celebrating
the news that he had survived.
Shops throughout East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were
closed as Palestinians reacted with shock to initial reports that Mr Arafat
was missing. But thousands took to the streets, honking car horns, chanting
'Arafat is alive' and handing out sweets when confirmation came of his
survival. The demonstrations led to violent clashes in Gaza and the Israeli
army clamped curfews on several West Bank communities.
The long hours of Mr Arafat's disappearance also focused attention on the
lack of an obvious alternative. Always extremely wary of the possible
emergence of a rival, the PLO leader has not groomed a successor, and this
omission was brought even more glaringly into focus in the past 24 hours.
Mr Arafat seems certain to come under renewed pressures from inside the PLO
to help prepare the way for an orderly succession, but he has resisted these
pressures in the past. His disappearance also raised fears participation in
the US-sponsored Middle East peace process. Mr Arafat's support is regarded
as a key factor.
While the PLO itself is excluded from the peace talks by an Israeli veto, Mr
Arafat's blessing is regarded as a vital cover for Palestinian participants
from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In Stockholm, the chief Palestinian spokeswoman at the talks, Mrs Hanan
Ashrawi, said she was overjoyed that Mr Arafat had been found safe.
'He is the father of Palestinian unity. He is the symbol of national
identity. He has been the driving force,' she said. 'His maturity, courage,
foresight and experience show through in the sort of leadership he has.'
PLO officials met in crisis session through the night in Tunis, anxiously
awaiting news of Mr Arafat who became PLO chairman in 1969. When dawn broke
the PLO asked regional and western governments to assist in the search for
the missing aircraft.
Mr Arafat's somewhat beleaguered position - he has scarcely ever been more
isolated in Arab councils following his support of Iraq in the Gulf crisis -
may be eased by his escape from death: his disappearance underscored his
importance in maintaining a degree of stability among the fractious
Palestinians.
The PLO leader, who has a keen sense of the theatrical, is likely to milk
his lucky escape for all its dramatic possibilities. He seems certain to
chide those who have written him off in the past, and were inclined to do so
again on this occasion.
Apart from Israeli assassination attempts, Mr Arafat has walked away from at
least one serious car accident, a Syrian-inspired bid to blow up a motorcade
in which he was thought to be travelling, and attempts in 1983 by enemies in
his own Fatah faction to get rid of him in a bloody siege of the Lebanese
town of Tripoli.

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA yesterday renewed its offer to hand over to a neutral country two of
its nationals suspected of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner, but
there was no indication it was prepared to yield the men to the US or
Britain.
Western officials were describing the latest Libyan proposal, which appears
similar to one last month, as a 'non-starter.' Britain and the US are
insisting they try the men under British or US criminal jurisdictions.
The latest Libyan offer was forwarded to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, a day after a special seven-member committee of Arab
foreign ministers met in Cairo to seek fresh avenues for compromise before
UN sanctions, including an arms and air embargo, come into effect on April
15.
The UN is also pressing Libya to allow France access to four men, including
Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's brother-in-law, wanted for questioning in
connection with the 1989 downing of a French UTA aircraft over Niger in
which all 171 passengers and crew died.
Arab League officials held out little hope of a breakthrough in efforts to
prevent implementation of UN sanctions resolution 748, passed after Libya's
persistent refusal to comply with an earlier demand that it hand over the
two men for trial in connection with the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the UN undersecretary-general for political affairs,
left Tripoli yesterday for Geneva where he was due to report to Mr Boutros
Ghali.
Mr Petrovsky, sent to Libya to explain the UN stand, appears to have made
little progress in his discussions with the Libyan authorities.
Arab officials said they would continue their efforts to defuse the Libyan
crisis, but admit that prospects of a breakthrough are slim.
The seven member Arab League committee, grouping Egypt, Syria, Algeria,
Libya, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania is due to meet again on Sunday, three
days before the sanctions are due to go into effect.

BBC World Service Television is about to expand into Africa in a joint
venture with M-Net, the South African pay television service.
The 24-hours-a-day BBC television service now available by atellite to more
than 30 countries in Asia will begin broadcasting next week for 11 hours a
day to Africa and will be carried on an Intelsat satellite covering the
entire continent.
The encoded service will be aimed mainly at embassies, hotels, universities
and schools because a satellite dish of at least one metre diameter will be
needed to pick it up.
The BBC is also negotiating with a number of African broadcasting
organisations for the service to be re-broadcast over traditional
transmitters.
The move into Africa is part of the BBC's strategy to turn World Service
Television into a global service within the next two years to compete
head-on with Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network.
M-Net is owned by Compagnie Financier Richemont, the corporate vehicle of
the Rupert family, which also owns Filmnet the European pay television
service. It will make available the satellite transponder that will carry
the BBC programmes and be responsible for marketing the service.

US TRADE representative Carla Hills said yesterday that a North American
free trade agreement was still within reach this year, but that its
implementation may depend on the US Congress.
Speaking after three days of talks with her Canadian and Mexican
counterparts in Montreal, Ms Hills said she did not expect the campaign for
the US elections in November to have 'any slowing effect' on the Nafta
talks.
'There is still time to negotiate and sign an agreement, and to notify
Congress before the election. It would be up to Congress whether it would
put this first on the agenda and approve the agreement.'
Mr Michael Wilson, the Canadian finance minister, described the meeting as
'quite candid and quite constructive,' with good progress in some areas,
including standards, temporary entry, rules of origin and customs
procedures.
But he cautioned that, even in these areas, disagreements remain. He
instanced motor vehicles and textiles as sensitive industries where
negotiations were not complete. In both these areas, the US and Canada are
concerned that low-cost Mexican producers will draw a disproportionate share
of investment.
Although Ms Hills said that an agreement was still possible this year, the
three representatives refused to commit themselves to a timetable.
Chief negotiators and the heads of working groups have been instructed, and
they will report back in the next few weeks.

deal

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and EC have returned to bargaining over the terms of direct and
indirect government support to civil aircraft manufacturers in the wake of a
deal reached on April 1.
The agreement was due to be referred back to the US and EC governments for
ratification before final agreement.
In Washington, the US Trade Representative's office played down the talks as
a meeting 'to tidy up loose ends in the agreement.'  McDonnell Douglas said
at issue was a need to develop a formula to identify indirect benefits
gained by commercial manufacturers from military contracts.
Sen John Danforth, a senior Republican on trade matters, yesterday strongly
criticised the Airbus deal as 'a travesty' because it gave the EC 'an
all-clear' for Dollars 26bn in government subsidies.  He introduced a
resolution demanding the US not approve agreements ratifying foreign
subsidies.
Both McDonnell Douglas, based in Mr Danforth's home state of Missouri, and
Boeing are supporting the tenetative agreemtn as 'a first step in the right
direction.
In Brussels, a senior EC trade official said objections from US government
departments to last week's EC-US deal on subsidies for civil aircraft
manufacturers were putting the whole agreement in danger.
The official said the US had not attempted to reopen bilateral negotiations
 -which ended last week after six years of intermittent discussion - but
that Nasa, and the US defence and commerce departments had reacted strongly
against limits on indirect government support to the civil aircraft
industry.
The agreement, if ratified, would set a 33 per cent limit on direct
subsidies, as a proportion of total aircraft development costs, and a
double-limit on indirect support.  As a whole, Airbus or the US
manufacturers would be unable to receive indirect grants worth more than 3
per cent of total civil aircraft turnover, while indirect subsidies for
individual manufacturers would be restricted to 4 per cent of civil aircraft
turnover.

<TEXT>
LEADING Russian politicians in Moscow yesterday played down the danger of
conflict with Ukraine over control of the Black Sea fleet, but action at the
fleet headquarters of Sevastopol underlined the tension between the two
sides.
President Boris Yeltsin sent Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, commander of the
Commonwealth of Independent States naval forces, to Sevastopol to oversee
transfer of the fleet to Russian control.
This followed Mr Yeltsin's decree on Tuesday taking the fleet under Russian
jurisdiction - a direct counter to a similar decree issued by Mr Leonid
Kravchuk, Ukraine president, on Monday.
The Ukraine parliament met in emergency session yesterday to discuss the
crisis and Mr Ivan Pliushch, the parliamentary chairman, reported that
Admiral Chernavin had told Ukrainian representatives they could have a fleet
but would have to find new headquarters for it.
According to Ukrainian TV, the talks between the Ukrainian and Russian
representatives came to a stalemate.
'Your approach is not acceptable to us,' Mr Vasyl Durdynets, head of the
Ukrainian delegation, told the Russians.
Meanwhile, thousands of pro-Russian demonstrators were reported to have
surrounded the fleet headquarters, brandishing banners saying 'We won't give
up the Black Sea fleet' and 'Sevastopol is a city of Russian glory'.
A Black Sea fleet spokesman said demonstrators had come to the defence of
Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the pro-Russian commander of the fleet. 'The whole
town has risen up in support of the admiral,' a spokesman said.
General Dmitri Volkogonov, military adviser to Mr Yeltsin, said: 'It is
inconceivable that there would be war between the two great Slav states on
this issue.
'We must now set up a commission between the two states to discuss these
questions and we must find a compromise between us. A compromise is
certainly possible.'

FT  09 APR 92 / European electorates conclude PR is less than perfect

BRITAIN goes to the polls today alone among European Community partners in
operating a first-past-the-post system in all its elections, Our Foreign
Staff writes.
Both the Conservatives and Labour have been put on the spot in the election
campaign by demands by their smaller rival, the Liberal Democrats, for the
introduction of proportional representation. Those in favour say it is more
democratic, while opponents say it produces unstable coalitions and allows
parliamentary seats to minority groups with little electoral support.
Yet the results of regional and national polls in Italy, France and Germany
within the past month are increasing pressure for reform of their varying PR
systems.
In Italy, a general election has produced political fragmentation to the
point that its governability is in doubt. In Germany and France, extreme
right-wing parties have squeezed into regional parliaments, some with just a
small proportion of votes.
Italy's general election on Sunday produced a lower house in which 16
parties won seats, 12 of them with less than 6 per cent of the vote each.
Politicians from all the main parties in Italy have long sought to change
the system, but a lack of consensus has prevented reform.
A cross-party group of MPs is backing a hybrid form of PR for the Senate, or
upper house: 268 of the 315 seats would be first-past-the-post with the
remainder elected on a proportional basis. Proposals for the more important
630-seat chamber of deputies seek to strengthen the vote for large parties
or alliances, to provide a stable majority.
The Christian Democrats want to retain proportional representation for 88
per cent of the seats and to introduce a form of premium in the distribution
of the remaining seats to the parties or alliances with the largest share of
votes.
In France, huge losses by the ruling socialists in regional and local
elections have fuelled the debate for reform to the National Assembly. Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, the new prime minister, said yesterday he would appoint a
committee to come up with proposals for change by October 15. However,
reform would not take place until after general elections due next year. The
debate on electoral reform in France has been tainted by accusations of
political manipulation and by the effects of PR on recent regional
elections. President Francois Mitterrand implied last November a modest dose
of PR was desirable.
The aim of this was to secure a fairer representation in the National
Assembly of the different currents of opinions in the country.
The present system for the assembly is based on majority voting in
single-member constituencies, but with two rounds of voting.
In the first round an absolute majority is required for election; in the
second it is first-past-the post.
The regional elections showed an enormous push by protest groups not
represented in parliament. A further problem is that the wide dispersal of
voting has made it difficult to put together stable-looking regional
government coalitions.
In Germany, lack of leadership rather than a failure of Germany's bespoke
electoral system brought about the events of last weekend when 21 far-right
members entered the state parliaments in Schleswig-Holstein and
Baden-Wurttemberg. The validity of the system, known as 'personalised
proportional representation', has been questioned in similar circumstances
in the past, but has been found to serve its basic purpose: protecting and
stabilising parliamentary democracy.
It comprises a 50:50 blend of first-past-the post constituency voting and
national representation according to party lists. Every voter has two votes:
one for the local candidate, the other for a party.
Half the members of parliament are elected with a simple majority emerging
in each constituency.
The others come from lists of nominees drawn up by local or regional party
organisations. The key factor in distribution of the 'list seats' is that,
before a party will be considered in the allotment process, it must have won
at least 5 per cent of the total number of second votes cast. The purpose is
to prevent the extreme fragmentation of the party system, which
characterised the dying days of the Weimar Republic.
The 5 per cent clause has worked effectively to reduce the number of parties
in the Bundestag. From 1949, when there were 12, the figure has shrunk to
six, including the remnants of the GDR Communist party. Between 1961 and
1983, however, before the 'alternative' Greens emerged, there were only
four.
At the weekend, the system kept the Greens - only about 400 votes short of
the 5 per cent limit - out of the Schleswig-Holstein assembly, which just
allowed the Social Democrats to maintain absolute power. It also allowed in
another 'alternative' - the extremist DVU.
Few can doubt the possibility of electoral reform in Europe. But as Mr
Beregovoy said yesterday: 'No system is perfect.'

FT  09 APR 92 / Russia 'risking aid cuts by slowing reform'

THE RUSSIAN government's moves to slacken economic reform and credit policy
are threatening aid promised from the west, officials of international
economic institutions warned yesterday.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are concerned that
concessions the Russian government has had to make, in the face of a
conservative onslaught on its reform programme, will render useless the
proposed Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) aid announced last week by US President
George Bush and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor.
This is seen as especially true of the Dollars 6bn fund earmarked for the
stabilisation of the rouble. One official said last night: 'It is hard to
see aid flowing in large amounts if the programme proposed to the IMF is
substantially altered. If they don't get what looks like a fixed exchange
rate for the rouble they won't get the money to stabilise it.'
In the past three days of sessions of the Russian Congress of Peoples
Deputies, the government has made clear that it intends to grant credits of
up to Rbs200bn to agriculture and industry, and to raise pensions and other
benefits.
However, even these concessions may not be enough to placate the deputies.
Last night it emerged that the commission preparing a resolution on economic
reform, due to be debated today, had narrowly voted to propose that
President Boris Yeltsin should be stripped of his emergency powers -
including his post as prime minister.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, told a meeting of the
deputies supporting the government: 'As soon as Yeltsin gives up his powers
as prime minister there is no government in Russia any longer. Everything
would be paralysed. All of the government would immediately resign.'
However, another minister revealed that the cabinet had prepared a list of
names of those with whom it would be prepared to work as replacement prime
ministers, and another list of names with whom it would not be prepared to
work.

A BATTLE is raging among Russian authorities over whether to allow an
unprecedented deal involving foreigners in Russia's previously closed gold
mining industry.
The government was yesterday said to be nearing a decision as the Russian
gold-mining monopoly, Rossalmaz-zoloto, declared that a state monopoly on
sales would be maintained to protect prices.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister responsible for economic reform,
has been trying to push through a contract elaborated by Lenzoloto, a
Siberian gold producer, covering an area of 105,000 sq metres, together with
an Australian consortium called Star Technology Systems.
Under the project, Star would obtain a minority stake in a joint stock
company - the other shareholders would be Lenzoloto, the Russian government,
and the local authorities of the Irkutsk region - in return for a badly
needed injection of capital to develop new deposits and reduce waste from
existing mining. Star says it has already secured up to Dollars 150m (Pounds
87.2m) in finance for the project. It has begun producing machinery within
Russia for alluvial mining.
The project, covering all Lenzoloto's mines, provides for all gold produced
to be sold to the state, preserving its monopoly on foreign sales.
But the plan has run into strong resistance from Mr Valery Rudakov, the
powerful Rossalmazzoloto chairman, who said yesterday he wanted to organise
a tender for the development of Lenzoloto's prime Sukhoi Log mine - in which
his own organisation would be able to compete as 'an equal partner'.
Mr Valery Avlov, the general director of Lenzoloto, said he saw no need for
a tender, since this would cause delay.

FT  09 APR 92 / Shares fall worldwide on fears for Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

ZAGOR
SHARE PRICES fell sharply in Japan, Europe and the US yesterday amid fears
about the international repercussions of the faltering Japanese economy.
Investors showed concern that financially troubled Japanese banks could
reduce their lending to other parts of the developed world, adding to the
risks of a global economic slowdown.
Worries on this score were particularly marked in Europe, which has
benefited in recent years from large inward investments from Japan. A
reduction in lending could particularly affect growth prospects in countries
such as Britain and France which are in economic difficulties.
There is also nervousness that the mounting problems in Japan could hold
back faltering signs of a revival in the still-fragile US economy.
In Tokyo, domestic investors showed increasing concern about the gloomy
outlook for the Japanese economy. According to a survey by the Keidanren,
the employers' federation, 90 per cent of business leaders expect the
economy to remain sluggish at least until October.
On the Tokyo stock market, such sentiments helped to push the Nikkei average
down 616.02, to close at 17,175.53, its lowest level in 5 1/2 years. During
trading the Nikkei fell through the 17,000 level and touched 16,892, but
recovered amid sporadic bargain-hunting. Early today, the market opened on a
steadier note, with the Nikkei barely changed in initial trading.
The Nikkei has fallen by 25 per cent since the beginning of the year and by
56 per cent from its peak in December 1989.
In Europe, reactions to the falls in Tokyo were particularly pronounced in
France, where prices on the Paris bourse were shaved by 3.4 per cent. Shares
quoted in Frankfurt and Amsterdam dropped by 1 per cent.
But in London, where investors are preoccupied with today's general
election, stock prices were less affected. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading
shares, which has steadied in the past few days after a 65-point fall last
week, lost 11.0, closing at 2,393.2.
On Wall Street, Tokyo's fall unnerved traders and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped 50.31 to 3,163.24 in morning trading, its lowest level of
the year, before rallying somewhat to close 32.20 lower at 3,181.35.
Mr James Williams, a fund manager at Barings merchant bank in London, said:
'Japanese banks will be no position to expand their loan books and Japanese
lending overseas will be very few and far between over the next few months.'
In Tokyo, brokers said investors were largely sitting on the sidelines,
waiting for prices to settle.
