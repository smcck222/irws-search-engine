FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Toshiba and Apple join forces

TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, and Apple Computer, the US
personal computer maker, yesterday joined forces to develop a
next-generation portable consumer electronics product capable of reproducing
video images and sound from a small laser disc.
The agreement is an important item in Apple's strategy of developing a range
of hand-held, digital electronic devices as an adjunct to its basic
business. Apple calls the devices 'personal digital assistants'.
For Toshiba, the agreement opens the possibility of reviving growth in the
company's flagging consumer electronics business. Over the past year,
Toshiba has quietly withdrawn all its audio products, such as tape recorders
and stereo systems, although it remains a large manufacturer of televisions
and white goods.
The companies yesterday had little specific information about the planned
product, except that it would be marketed by the middle of next year and be
based on CD-ROM, compact discs with read-only memory. The companies were
also talking to Time Warner, the media conglomerate in which Toshiba has a
6.25 per cent stake, about providing titles to play on the machines.
Very likely, the machine will have a small display, be capable of
reproducing moving video images, and allow for interaction with the user.
The companies hoped to sell 5m of the devices annually by 1995.
The market for the type of product that Apple and Toshiba have in mind,
however, has yet to be established, and is already becoming crowded with
potentially competing devices. Indeed, Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman, said
Apple would launch a consumer CD-ROM device before Christmas, and it was
unclear yesterday how, or whether, the two products would be related.
Philips has already launched a CD-I (CD interactive) format that has failed
to stimulate much interest in the market. Yesterday, Philips and JVC said
they would further develop the format for use as a motion picture singalong
karaoke system. Sony has also successfully launched its Data Discman, an
electronic book device that allows for simple interactive functions.
A basic problem facing all makers of such machines is the lack of appealing
software, or titles to play. Both Nintendo and Sega Enterprises have
launched CD-ROM machines for games. CDs have attracted attention because
they can store a huge amount of textual, video or audio data while allowing
almost instant access.
Apple is trying to generate excitement among consumers about the devices and
is hoping to use its expertise in software development and user interaction
to produce a machine that stimulates demand and establishes a de facto
industry standard.
Apple said it selected Toshiba as a partner because of Toshiba's expertise
in semiconductors and miniaturisation, and because of its links with Time
Warner. Toshiba also has experience in the consumer electronics field, which
Apple lacks.
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, is teaming up with JVC, the Japanese
audio equipment manufacturer, to produce a karaoke version of the Dutch
company's new 'interactive' compact disc, writes Ronald van de Krol in
Amsterdam.
The two companies said yesterday that they expected to be able to make a
large number of 'karaoke CDs' available by the end of the year, enabling
consumers to enjoy karaoke at home.
Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I), which Philips is launching this week in
continental Europe after earlier launches in the UK and the US, combines
images, sound, graphics, and texts on a single CD. When hooked up to a
television, the new CD-I player will be able to play karaoke CDs that flash
the words to songs on to the television screen.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: French public-sector chiefs face
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French cabinet is today expected to decide the fate of the chairmen of a
number of leading state-owned companies as their three-year mandates come up
for review.
Very few of them are expected to lose their jobs, with the notable exception
of the chairman of Bull, the loss-making computer group. The government
yesterday announced that Mr Bernard Pache, the chairman of Charbonnages de
France, would succeed Mr Francis Lorentz as Bull's chief.
The government wants to ensure management continuity where possible. It
needs to avoid worrying other shareholders while it is selling minority
stakes in state companies to fund its employment policies. It also needs to
be cautious because many state-controlled groups are forging alliances with
foreign partners.
Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, the civil and defence electronics group
since 1982, was yesterday proposed for re-selection by his board, putting an
end to recent speculation over his future.
During his tenure, Mr Gomez has trimmed Thomson's activities from 23
disparate businesses to three core businesses - defence systems, home
audio-visual products and semiconductors. He also launched a series of
ambitious international acquisitions. Thomson is currently attempting to
take over the missiles division of LTV, the US steel and industrial group,
against intense political resistance in the US.
Confirmation of Mr Gomez's reappointment by the cabinet should be automatic,
making him one of the longest-serving state industry chiefs and one of the
few to keep his job since the round of nationalisations 10 years ago.
The government is also expected to reappoint Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent,
chairman of Elf-Aquitaine; Mr Jean Gandois, chairman of Pechiney, the
aluminium and packaging group; and Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air
France, who has already been proposed by his own board. Other nominations
expected include the top jobs at the banks Credit Lyonnais, Banque Hervet,
Compagnie Financiere du CIC, Union Europeene and Societe Marseillaise de
Credit.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nestle in talks with Brussels on
brand sales

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, is believed to be negotiating with the
European Commission about selling some of its mineral water brands, in an
attempt to persuade Brussels to clear its FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.9bn) bid for
Perrier, the French mineral water.
The Commission's concerns about the bid centre on the prospective shares of
the French mineral water market owned by Nestle and BSN, the French food
group which sided with its Swiss competitor during the Perrier bid in return
for an agreement that it could buy Volvic mineral water if the bid
succeeded.
It appears that the Volvic deal may not be enough to convince Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, that there will be no distortion
of the French market. The bid was technically suspended in February,
although the public offer for Perrier shares was allowed to go ahead.
The Commission has to make a decision by the end of July, and Sir Leon is
likely to pass his recommendations for action to a consultative committee of
national experts at the beginning of the month.
Three weeks ago, Nestle revealed that the Commission's merger task force
still had 'serious doubts' about the potential duopoly between BSN and
Nestle. Unlike previous competition cases involving French companies,
however, the Nestle merger has not stirred up any political storms in Paris
or Brussels.
Nestle has claimed that, if it was allowed to take control of Perrier, which
owns a number of other waters as well as Volvic and the flagship brand, its
share of the French market would rise from 15.6 to 36.8 per cent. Meanwhile,
BSN would see its share increase from 20.2 to 30.9 per cent after the
addition of Volvic.
The other Perrier-owned waters in the French market include Contrex, Vichy,
Saint Lambert and Plancoet.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pache set to be confirmed as
Bull chairman
</HEADLINE>

   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Pache, head of Charbonnages de France, the French coal board, is
today due to be confirmed as chairman of Bull, the state-owned computer
maker, writes William Dawkins. He will succeed Mr Francis Lorentz
Mr Pache, 57, has no computer industry qualifications, in contrast with Mr
Lorentz, who had been managing director of Bull for seven years before
becoming chairman in 1989. But officials argue that the appointment is no
more unusual than the choice of Mr John Sculley, the former Pepsi-Cola
president, who took the top job at Apple Computer nine years ago.
The new Bull chairman has spent most of his life in state industry. He
trained at the Ecole Polytechnique, the elite public-service college, and
started his career as an adviser to the industry minister. He joined
Pechiney, the aluminium group, in 1966 and became chairman of the
state-owned company in 1985. He was removed a year later by the incoming
Gaullist government to make way for Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's current
chairman.
Since then, Mr Pache has performed a low profile but demanding job in
managing the run-down of the French coal industry, which has been unable to
compete against cheap imports from North America, Australia and Germany.
He has reduced the coal workforce by more than half from 48,000 to 20,000
over the past six years, setting up job-creation and retraining schemes to
compensate. His ability to wield the axe without creating strife appears to
have won the government's admiration and could be useful at Bull, which is
in the middle of its own three-year restructuring programme.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Spain refuses further Ercros aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office (KIO) and the Spanish government were heading
for a confrontation last night after the state refused to come to the aid of
Ercros, KIO's troubled industrial flagship in Spain.
Ercros, the country's biggest chemicals company, is facing a severe
financial crisis. Mr Jose Recio, Ercros's chairman of just three weeks,
resigned on Monday, triggering a suspension of trading in the group's stock.
The resignation came after a failure to secure agreement from KIO or the
government on bailing the group out of its Dollars 990m consolidated debt.
KIO's new London-based management is understood to have told the Spanish
Finance Ministry last week that it was prepared to allow Ercros to go
bankrupt if Madrid did not help it out with new funding. At that meeting the
government replied it would not make any more money available to Ercros
unless KIO responded in kind.
'Ercros is a private company and it is not our business to bail it out,'
said the Industry Ministry, which in the past three years has channeled up
to Pta18bn (Dollars 182.7m) of subsidies to Ercros - mainly to shore up its
loss-making fertiliser operations.
At the state-controlled Banco Exterior, Ercros's biggest creditor, an
official said the bank had Pta20bn in outstanding loans to Ercros and would
not initiate any negotiations if KIO or the government did not move first.
Ercros would be the biggest corporate collapse in Spain for nearly a decade.
Group turnover last year totalled Dollars 2.2bn, and it reported losses of
Pta16.4bn.
The group employs 10,500 people in the chemicals, fertiliser, mining and
explosives sectors.
Its predicament - caused largely by weak fertiliser prices - is an
embarrasing setback for KIO in Spain. In the last few weeks it has tried to
reassure Madrid that it intends to stay in Spain as a long-term industrial
investor.
KIO's industrial assets in Spain, built up over the last 10 years, are worth
an estimated Dollars 7bn.
Mr Jose Recio, who took over as Ercros chairman at the beginning of the
month, resigned after failing to secure a Pta25bn capital injection by KIO,
which owns some 40 per cent of Ercros through Torras, its Spanish investment
arm.
Mr Recio, a senior banker, was hired to smooth out differences between KIO
and Madrid over funding Ercros, which is also negotiating a joint fertiliser
venture with Freeport MacMaRon of the US. He appears to have decided to
leave Ercros before being drawn into a messy collapse.
A Freeport joint venture, dependent on new money being pumped into Ercros by
KIO or Madrid, looks increasingly unlikely.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Birkdale in the black and dividends
restored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIRKDALE Group, holding company of a range of marketing, advertising and
public relations agencies, turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 202,000 for
the year ended March 31 1992, following the previous year's loss of Pounds
1.53m.
Group turnover was Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 25.8m), with operating profits of
Pounds 221,000, against a 1991 operating loss of Pounds 645,000.
Mr Neil McClure, chief executive, announced that the group would resume
dividend payments, at a nominal 0.2p, after three years of no dividends.
Earnings per share were 1.5p (losses of 15.6p).
Birkdale, under its former name of Brunning, first went public in 1961. Mr
Simeon Galpert, finance director, said that in its 30 years the group had
never made pre-tax profits greater than Pounds 1m, but that there were
strong chances of soon reversing that record.
Mr McClure took over as chief executive in October 1989, when Birkdale was
burdened with bank debts of Pounds 7m. While Birkdale now has a Pounds
500,000 overdraft facility with National Westminster bank, the group ended
its financial year with net cash reserves of Pounds 354,000, he said.
Since taking over Mr McClure has reduced staff numbers from 700 to 300. All
Birkdale employees are now on one-year contracts and managers have profit
share incentives.
Operating margins are currently about 10 per cent at group level. Revenues
per employee stand at about Pounds 30,000, far beneath comparable sector
figures, but Mr McClure anticipates that the current year will see
considerable improvements to those figures. Reductions in the cost base 'are
a never-ending process as far as we are concerned,' he added.
A key executive role will be provided for Mr Richard Humphreys, who joined
Birkdale in May after being forced from his post as chief executive of
Saatchi and Saatchi Worldwide in February.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Airtours reduces losses as winter sales
improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the UK's third largest package holiday company, yesterday reported
a reduced first-half loss after a sharp rise in sales last winter.
In the six months to the end of March, Airtours increased the number of
passengers carried by 77 per cent and its sales by a larger 83 per cent to
Pounds 101.55m as margins increased.
UK holiday companies traditionally incur losses in the first half as they
pre-pay certain of their summer season costs. But as a result of the jump in
sales, Airtours cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 6.21m to Pounds 5.59m.
The deficit included for the first time a seasonal loss on its leased
aircraft fleet and Pounds 1.1m in start-up costs on the introduction of
three additional aircraft.
Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the summer holiday market as a whole had
increased by 20 per cent, the first growth in two years, while the winter
market had grown by 8.3 per cent, the first increase since the 1988-89
season.
Airtours' summer bookings are 31 per cent ahead of last year following a 30
per cent increase in the number of holidays on offer.
Bookings in April and May were higher than in the same period last year, but
the first two weeks of June had been weak with volumes maintained but at the
expense of lower margins.
Mr Crossland said Airtours had taken a large slice of the market left when
Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group collapsed last year.
The company had benefited more than competitors such as Thomson and Owners
Abroad but remained as dependent as ever on margins that could be attainable
in the late booking market between July and September, he said.
The results suggested that, in spite of the recession, holidays were among
the last non-essential costs to be cut. 'People are using holidays as a form
of escapism,' Mr Crossland said.
Airtours ended the half year with cash balances of Pounds 90m which will
rise substantially by the year-end. Mr Crossland said the company was
actively looking for acquisitions.
The interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 0.55p. Losses per share
fell from 6.33p to 4.29p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH United Provident Association (BUPA) has reached agreement to
acquire the 71.4 per cent of Murrayfield, a hospital in Edinburgh, which it
does not already own.
The offer, 394p in cash for each Murrayfield share, values the 79-bed
purpose-built hospital at Pounds 13.8m and the balance of the shares at
Pounds 11m.
The shares are being acquired by BUPA Investments, an offshoot of BUPA.
Irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer have been received in respect
of 56.2 per cent of Murrayfield's equity taking BUPA's interest to 84.7 per
cent in aggregate.
The board of Murrayfield and its financial advisers, Noble Grossart,
consider the terms to be 'fair and reasonable.' BUPA said the offer was
final and would not be increased.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML HOLDINGS, the aerospace and electronic components group, yesterday parted
company with its chief executive just a day before publication of the
group's preliminary results.
Today's figures will show that the company fell into loss for the year to
March 1992.
ML's directors decided unanimously at yesterday's board meeting that Mr
Peter Pollock would cease to be chief executive. He was not available for
comment.
Mr Timothy Sallitt, chairman, became acting chief executive and said that a
replacement for Mr Pollock had been found from an engineering company. He
would take up his post 'within weeks rather than months'.
Mr Sallitt said that although the timing of the announcement of Mr Pollock's
departure could have been better, the decision was not directly related to
the results.
The change in chief executive was prompted more by 'a question of management
style than bottom line performance', he said.
ML Holdings shares fell 7p to 31p.
The change comes after a particularly difficult period for the company. One
of its biggest contracts, for the JP233 airfield denial bomb which was used
in the Gulf war, came to an end last year.
The JP233 accounted for Pounds 34m of the group's Pounds 64.8m turnover in
1987, but only Pounds 1m last year.
It was one of the factors that a year ago led to a 41 per cent decline in
profits to Pounds 6.3m. Mr Pollock's salary was cut by 38 per cent to Pounds
149,000.
Mr Sallitt became chairman in March with the remit to turn the company round
by strengthening its non-military businesses. He decided that a new chief
executive was needed. His chosen candidate accepted the offer of the post
yesterday.
Mr Sallitt became a non-executive director of ML last year, having left the
board of Hawker Siddeley in 1990.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based group which last week announced a sharp cut
in dividend to dampen expectations ahead of its results, yesterday reported
a 27 per cent drop in pre-tax profits before exceptional items to Pounds
4.49m for the year to end-March, with operating profits halved.
The group is undergoing a painful reconstruction. It is still disengaging
from property but has largely completed reorganisation of its lighting,
building products, medical cotton fibre and textiles businesses, with cost
savings now likely.
The final dividend wascut to 0.7p, making 4p for the year compared with 10p
in 1990-91. Earnings were 5.65p (4.26p)
Turnover was down 10 per cent at Pounds 129.19m (Pounds 143.13m). Operating
profit was Pounds 4.72m. After interest of Pounds 228,000, pre-tax profits
were Pounds 4.49m. Accounts for the previous year were restated to reflect
different treatment of reorganisation costs. Operating profits in fiscal
1991 were Pounds 9.45m, the exceptional charge Pounds 3.3m and interest
Pounds 3.33m giving pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.81m.
Whitecroft took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 6.27m (Pounds 5.05m) in
the latest period, relating mainly to its withdrawal from property
development. The retained loss for the year was Pounds 5.69m (loss of Pounds
6.98m a year earlier).
The group sold its housebuilding division in January, reducing borrowings by
Pounds 6m but year-end gearing was still 78 per cent on shareholders' funds
of Pounds 45m.
Ongoing sales of houses it retained is expected to bring in Pounds 4m, with
another Pounds 800,000 of deferred consideration to come.
Mr Peter Goold chairman, said all construction was completed and several
lettings had now been achieved.
The biggest single development is a complex of shops and offices in
Sheffield.

CMW Group, the USM-quoted architect and planning consultant, has warned that
profits for the first half of the current year would be lower than expected.
Delays on contracts and reduced fees at Covell Matthews Wheatley Architects
have affected both revenue and profit in the second quarter, the company

Action has been taken to reduce overheads, the costs of which will be
provided for in the interim results to be announced shortly.
These measures and new commissions will restore margins in the second half,
but year-end profits will still be below expectations, the directors added.

Net revenue for the year fell marginally from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.1m.
Earnings slipped from 7.54p to 7.25p per share as the trust's increased

Amber Industrial Holdings, the speciality chemicals company 75 per cent
owned by Caledonia Investments, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.61m to
Pounds 2.55m in the year to March 31.
However the result last time was after a Pounds 785,000 exceptional debit.
Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said the year reflected the first full period of
its Ambersil subsidiary's occupation of the new factory at Bridgwater.
Higher overheads at the premises, difficult trading conditions in the UK and
the failure to find a buyer for the vacated Basingstoke premises had all
held back profitability, he said. However, he was confident that in time the
benefits of the move would show through.
Turnover improved to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 14.9m). Although cash balances had
continued to grow lower interest rates had held back net interest received
to Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 619,000).
Mr Buckley added that the company continued to seek opportunities to expand
the business.
An increased final dividend of 12.5p (12p) is recommended for a 17p (16.5p)
total, payable from earnings of 34p (23p) per share.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Shoprite advances strongly to Pounds 1.04m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong advance in half-year pre-tax profits, from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds
1.04m, was reported by Shoprite Group, the Isle of Man-based grocery and
vehicle retailer which has interests in property. The group is also
proposing to pay a maiden interim dividend of 2p.
The result for the six months to May 3 was achieved on turnover more than
doubled from Pounds 18m to Pounds 37.7m. The profits figure is only slightly
short of the outcome for the 1990-1991 year.
Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman and managing director, said the Scottish
expansion had been the main contributor to the improved results - Shoprite
opened seven new stores there bringing the total to 18 at the period end.
This growth was expected to continue as sufficient fur-ther sites had been
identi-fied to meet the company's store opening plan for the next 18 months,
Mr Nicholson added.
Within this programme up to 17 stores could be opened in the second half.
The interest charge fell slightly to Pounds 742,000 (Pounds 759,000). Net
gearing stood at 51 per cent at the period end. Earnings surged to 6.3p a
share against 1p last time.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Sterling Industries falls to Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN LINE with comments issued in last year's statement, pre-tax profits at
Sterling Industries, the engineering group, fell from Pounds 4.07m to Pounds
3.5m in the year to March 31.
The downturn was blamed on the general economic climate, with the hydraulics
division suffering the brunt of the slow-down and incurring an operating
loss of Pounds 29,000 against a Pounds 755,000 profit last time. Combustion
engineering was less affected, with a Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 2.43m) operating
figure.
Group turnover was down at Pounds 34.5m (Pounds 39.5m). Earnings came out at
7.45p (9.02p) and an unchanged final of 4.1p maintains the total at 5.6p.

FT  24 JUN 92 / O&amp;Y plans to sell some US office property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK plans to sell about a dozen of its US office buildings and
concentrate in future on high-quality properties in a limited number of
cities.
The disposals, as well as restructuring of some debt and new loans, are
required to keep the developer's US operations outside the court protection
granted last month to its businesses in Canada and the UK.
The extent of new borrowings is likely to depend on O&amp;Y's success in
attracting tenants to its buildings. The extra money is required for
refurbishing to meet new tenants' needs, and for brokers' commissions. The
advances would be secured by the leases.
Mr John Zuccotti, who heads O&amp;Y's US operations, is understood to have told
lenders that the company intends to retain its flagship buildings, notably
the World Financial Centre in lower Manhattan, as well as properties in
Boston and Los Angeles.
Properties to be disposed of represent about a third of O&amp;Y's 29m sq ft of
office space in the US. They include 55 Water Street in Manhattan, the
world's biggest office building.
Meanwhile, O&amp;Y and its lenders in Canada have postponed court hearings due
to start today on applications by several groups of lenders to 'carve-out'
individual buildings from last month's order freezing O&amp;Y's debt
obligations. The lenders, which include some European institutions, contend
that they lent to single-purpose companies without recourse to O&amp;Y. The
company says it needs to keep all creditors at bay if it is to succeed in
restructuring its CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 6bn) debt.
Fears have been expressed that a court order confirming O&amp;Y's actions might
undermine what has become one of the most popular forms of property
financing in North America.
Mr Justice Robert Blair of the Ontario court of justice will, however, hear
numerous other motions today from creditors seeking to protect their
interests.
At a meeting in Toronto today, one of the Canary Wharf administrators is due
to outline initial proposals for the future of the project in London's
Docklands.
Mr Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, has flown to
Canada to meet representatives of the 11 banks which lent Pounds 500m for
the construction of Canary Wharf.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Ferranti shares gain 17% as losses are cut to Pounds 39.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI International, the electronics and defence group which came close
to collapse following the 1989 discovery of huge fraud in its US subsidiary,
International Signal and Control, yesterday appeared to be back on course
for recovery.
The company announced less severe losses than expected and said three 'life
threatening' litigation claims against a problem US subsidiary, FICC, have
been settled. Ferranti's shares jumped 17 per cent in response, from 8.75p
to 10.25p.
Ferranti reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 39.6m in the year to March 31,
compared with losses of Pounds 98.1m in the previous period. The losses
included Pounds 6.6m from discontinued businesses and exceptional costs of
Pounds 13.9m from rationalisations and fixed asset write-offs.
Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman since 1990, said Ferranti's markets remained
tough, especially given the downturn in defence spending.
'We're getting close to (profits) but the key is winning more business,' he
said.
A disposal programme, which included the sale of its missile business to
GEC, is continuing. Employee numbers fell to just over 5,000 at the start of
this month, compared with about 27,000 in 1989.
Disposals raised Pounds 69.8m and net borrowings fell from Pounds 94.8m to
Pounds 66.5m. But gearing remains close to 100 per cent, and further
disposals are due this year.
Turnover fell nearly a quarter to Pounds 362.6m while turnover on continuing
business was down about 17 per cent. However, the company won Pounds 249.4m
of new business in the defence and civil sectors and the order book at
year-end was Pounds 272.1m.
Litigation stemming from the fraud, which Ferranti estimates cost the
company more than Pounds 600m, is continuing. Mr James Guerin, former
chairman of ISC, was jailed for 15 years earlier this month. Ferranti has
recovered Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 640,000) from proceedings involving another
ISC employee.
About Pounds 41.1m of losses related to the fraud have so far been
recovered. Some Pounds 40m was paid by Peat Marwick, auditor to ISC.
There was a loss per share of 4p, compared with a 11.5p loss a year ago. No
dividend is recommended. Extraordinary losses of Pounds 6.6m on the closure
of businesses took losses for the year to Pounds 44.1m.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Electrolux and AEG set for joint deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTROLUX of Sweden, one of the world's leading white goods manufacturers,
is poised to enter an agreement with AEG Hausgerate, a subsidiary of AEG of
Germany, for joint production and development of household appliances.
The deal would initially cover washing machines, tumble dryers and
dishwashers which both companies make. They will continue to compete in the
domestic appliance market under their respective brand names but in the
long-term, they aim to have integrated plants to enable both companies to
lower costs and increase efficiency.
AEG Hausgerate had global sales of DM2.6bn (Pounds 892m) last year and
around 10,300 workers in 16 countries. AEG group itself is 80 per cent owned
by Daimler-Benz with sales last year of DM14bn and 76,000 employees. As well
as household appliances it also produces rail and electrotechnical systems
and components, automation technology and microelectronics.
Under yesterday's proposed agreement, Electrolux will acquire 10 per cent of
the shares in AEG Hausgerate with the option of increasing its holding to 20
per cent.
In return, AEG will subscribe to debentures issued by Electrolux which will
be convertible into ordinary B shares.
Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux president, said further financial details
would be announced by the end of the year when the deal was completed.
In a joint statement, Mr Anders Scharp, chairman and chief executive of
Electrolux, and Mr Ernst Stockl, chairman of AEG' s board of management,
said: 'To both AEG and Electrolux this arrangement will be strategic as a
means to enable each party to meet the increasing competition from the US
and Japan in the European domestic appliance market.'
For the past two years, Electrolux has been supplying AEG with cold storage
equipment and the experience of the two companies working together hastened
closer co-operation.
Together the two companies account for around 18 per cent of the German
market in the household appliances they both manufacture. The deal has to be
approved by the relevant anti-trust authorities and Electrolux shareholders.
This is expected to happen in the early autumn.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Warning on Lasmo US share offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank handling the flotation of Ultramar
Corporation, the North American oil refining business owned by Lasmo of the
UK, said last night the price range at which the shares were likely to be
sold had been cut to Dollars 15-Dollars 17.
However, both Goldman and Ultramar, which confirmed the reduction in price
from its Tarrytown, New York State, headquarters, said they still expected
the offering to take place 'one day this week'.
In its original filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, dated
May 1, Ultramar Corporation suggested a maximum offering price of Dollars 21
a share. It said it was planning to sell 33m shares, excluding up to 4.95m
shares which might also be sold if over-allotment options granted to
underwriters were exercised.
At the Dollars 21-a-share offering price, the equity offering would have
generated just under Dollars 700m for the British oil and gas company, with
a concurrent offering of debt securities raising a further Dollars 400m. At
the latest Dollars 15-Dollars 17 price, the sum raised from the share
flotation would range between Dollars 495m and Dollars 561m.
Goldman Sachs added yesterday that, aside from the reduced sale price range
for the shares, all other aspects of the offer remained unchanged.
Earlier in the day in London, nervousness about the fate of the
International Public Offer sent Lasmo shares tumbling, making the stock the
worst performer in the FT-SE 100 index. The price fell 15p to 172p - the
lowest level since December 1987 - on heavy trading volume.
In the wake of the aborted GPA flotation, dealers were worried that the
offering might be pulled altogether, or that the price could be cut.
However, dealers seemed to expect the reduced price range would still be
around Dollars 17-Dollars 19.
Lasmo's disposal of the North American downstream assets, earmarked since it
took over Ultramar last year, has been shrouded in uncertainty for some
months.
Analysts have suggested that Lasmo originally hoped a single buyer for the
business would emerge, and only opted for a flotation when a suitable
purchaser failed to materialise.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Race is on to win 'national institution': At least nine
runners line up for the spoils as MGN rides out Maxwell legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The race is on, Mr Charles Wilson, editor-in-chief of The Sporting Life and
editorial director of Mirror Group Newspapers, declared yesterday.
The race, which could turn out to be long and tortuous, is for the ownership
of the UK's leading left-of-centre newspaper group now essentially
controlled by a group of banks following the collapse of Mr Robert Maxwell's
publishing empire.
The riders are likely to include Sir Peter Parker, former chairman of
British Rail (representing a management buy-out team), Mr Tony O'Reilly,
chairman of US food group J Heinz and of Independent Newspapers in Dublin,
and Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph.
At least nine groups are believed to have lodged an interest in MGN with
Arthur Andersen, administrator to the Maxwell private interests.
The start of the race was marked yesterday by the directors of MGN making a
resolute public display of sweeping up the mess left behind by Mr Robert
Maxwell, the man who once loved appearing in the pages of the Daily Mirror
and fine-tuning its editorials.
As Sir Robert Clark, the new chairman of the newspaper group, said with a
touch of understatement: 'Recent months have been extremely difficult and
unsettling for the MGN group and without precedent.'
The publication of a circular to shareholders and pro forma accounts for
1991 set out in 96-pages the enormous contrast between the Maxwell 'unusual
transactions that almost brought the company to its knees and a newspaper
group that is trading strongly and increasing its market share'.
After months of headlines, the 'unprecedented' difficulties yesterday turned
into precise numbers. The extraordinary provisions totalled no less than
Pounds 491.7m - Pounds 421.5m after deferred tax is deducted.
They cover everything from an estimated pension fund deficit of Pounds 193m
to a Pounds 122.4m provision for losses on transactions with other Maxwell
companies and the repaying of a Pounds 50m MGN loan from Bankers Trust which
never reached the Mirror headquarters but, by a circuitous route, was
apparently used to pay off another Maxwell debt - with Bankers Trust.
The extraordinary items include refinancing and advisory costs of Pounds
20.5m, including payments of some Pounds 3m to accountants. In contrast to
the extraordinary items, Sir Robert said trading level profits of MGN in
1991 had risen 11.9 per cent to Pounds 91m and margins were approaching 20
per cent.
'Despite the terrible blows which were inflicted on the group and despite
the major disruptions we have had a very encouraging trading performance,'
he said.
The main MGN titles include the Daily and Sunday Mirror, The People, the
Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail apart from The Sporting Life.
Pre-tax profits fell by 39 per cent to Pounds 51m because of the costs
associated with closing The Racing Times in the US, lower income from
Donohue, a Canadian associate in the paper and pulp business, and the
non-recurrance of the previous year's Pounds 15.5m pension surplus.
Publication of the accounts came a day after the announcement that a
consortium of seven banks led by National Westminster and Midland had agreed
a Pounds 260m financial package and the continuation of Pounds 180m in
existing leasing finance. The two-year deal includes Pounds 70m for the
installation of colour presses at the Scottish Daily Record.
The next step is to seek the relisting of the MGN shares - suspended at 125p
in December - after the company's annual meeting on July 16.
Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator, will not commit himself
about when the 54 per cent MGN stake under his control will be sold. It is
unlikely to happen quickly because the administrators say they believe 'it
would be beneficial if some of the residual uncertainty surrounding the
company was removed prior to a disposal taking place'.
Shareholders' funds at the start of the year on a pro forma basis were
Pounds 841.9m and had dropped to Pounds 436.3m by the year-end. Balance
sheet gearing increased from 91.3 per cent at the year-end to 96.2 per cent
on May 15.
The fixed assets - the value of the newspaper titles - have not been changed
from the Pounds 625m figure set by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the consultancy firm,
in 1990 and a figure used in the flotation.
The board has endorsed the existing strategy that MGN's five main titles
form the core of the business and are interdependent.
After the announcements of the profit and the extraordinary losses Sir
Robert said MGN was not just a product but a national institution with a
belief in editorial integrity. 'We also intend that the group will maintain
its traditional political stance. On this basis we have a successful
newspaper group,' he said.
The survival of MGN's traditional political stance will depend on who wins
the race and why they decide to join it.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Demise of clocking-on winds up Rover staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WAS when British workers viewed the machine which monitored their
latenesses and absences as a symbol of managerial oppression. But at Rover,
the prospect of an end to clocking-on is winding some workers up.
As part of a 'new deal' on working practices and bargaining procedures, the
company and unions agreed this spring to the phased abolition of
clocking-on. Timekeeping would in future be monitored by production managers
and team leaders.
Now the company has agreed to keep the mechanisms in place in some parts of
its Longbridge plant after protests from workers. 'We are committed to
phasing out clocking-on, but we have said that if workers want to clock on,
they can do,' the company said.
In the areas where the machines remain in place, they will not be used for
calculating pay, as they were before. Rover said the clocking-on machines
would merely be a registration process which team leaders could use if they
wanted.
It is more than just attachment to a decades-old tradition that has endeared
Rover workers to clocking-on. Mr John Allen, an executive councillor of the
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said the system provided
'security for an employee and gives proof of attendance'.
Mr Allen said he knew of three recent cases where workers questioned by
police proved their innocence by producing their clocking-on cards. Other
union officials say that workers are concerned about the increased powers
the replacement system would give to team leaders.
Rover is one of a growing number of companies which wants to end clocking-on
for manual workers as part of a move to single-status employment, which also
includes communal canteens and harmonised sick pay for all workers.
However, some companies have harmonised clocking-on systems for all staff.
At the Mars food manufacturing company everyone, including the managing
director, clocks on each morning. A good-timekeeping allowance of 10 per
cent of daily pay is given to employees.

FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the 8 per cent fall in Lasmo shares yesterday, the market has no
great faith in the viability of its planned flotation of Ultramar's US
assets. The GPA debacle aside, it would be understandable if US institutions
were reluctant to invest in assets already spurned by the oil industry. As
things stand, Lasmo intends to go ahead at a price which could be as much as
a quarter below that originally indicated. That will do less to ease its
stretched finances. Shareholders might be better served in the long run if
the flotation were pulled altogether. Either way, short term their dividend
is more vulnerable than ever.

FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wessex Water is in a happy position among water companies. Like its larger
peers, it is striving to generate profits which cannot be touched by the
regulator. Unlike Thames and Severn Trent, Wessex is small enough that if
its unregulated businesses oblige, it has scope to increase dividends
without offending its water customers.
Judging by yesterday's annual results, Wessex is well on course. The
five-month contribution from its joint venture with Waste Management was
ahead of expectations. It might make Pounds 4m this year, equivalent to 5
per cent of group pre-tax profits. By mid-decade, it could be making 10
times as much. In expanding, Wessex will struggle to replicate the
favourable terms of the venture with Waste Management. There are plenty of
small acquisitions available, but that approach will take longer than
another large deal. Shareholders are doubtless happy to stay on board
regardless.

FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: EC airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the failure of earlier EC efforts to break up Europe's airline cartel,
it is scarcely surprising that the latest liberalisation package has earned
a sceptical response. With open skies now postponed until 1997 to
accommodate more fearful member states, it is fair to assume that this
week's agreement will have little immediate impact.
It would be silly, though, to belittle its long-term significance. For
reasons that are hard to fathom, airlines arouse much the same sensitivity
as national currencies; so much so that the prospect of full cabotage rights
ever being accepted seemed inconceivable until quite recently. The pressure
for rationalisation, mergers and cost savings in Europe's fragmented air
transport industry will now greatly intensify. Politicians will doubtless
continue to drag their heels, but will ultimately have to accept a measure
of global branding.
For the moment, of course, the new freedoms will mean little, not least
because the EC's infrastructure is in a mess. The problem of airport slots
for newcomers has not been addressed in this week's package, though it
remains the subject of separate negotiation. The decentralised air traffic
control system - a further block to extra capacity - is not likely to be
improved much before 1995. These constraints, quite apart from their
generally parlous financial condition, explain why airlines are unlikely to
launch instant price wars. They will presumably only do so when able to
offset lower fares with bigger volumes.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is beginning to look as though the German money supply will never shift
in the right direction. The one glimmer of hope in May's annualised increase
of 9 per cent was a small slowdown in the growth rate of bank credit to the
private sector. Even so, it now looks inconceivable that money growth can
slip back sufficiently over the next few months to justify easier rates. The
latest money supply data thus tend to confirm earlier impressions that there
will be no room for an official German rate cut this year.
One consequence may be that the recovery in the dollar which many foreign
exchange dealers expected for 1992 may simply not occur. A weak US recovery
and the presidential election will prevent short-term interest rates rising
on that side of the Atlantic. So the interest differential between the two
countries will remain wide. As for Germany, there may be some lag in the
impact of high interest rates, but for the time being the economy appears
able to stand the strain. It is thus unlikely the Bundesbank will cut rates
aggressively when it does start to relax.

Two points stand out from the Mirror Group Newspapers' figures. First, the
basic business is in relatively good shape, having posted a 12 per cent
increase in operating profit before exceptional items last year. Second, the
company appears to have made a comprehensive effort to establish the extent
of the damage incurred during the late Robert Maxwell's stewardship. That
raises the question of what it is now worth, especially in the light of the
expected relisting next month.
By some yardsticks, the answer might be: not very much, if anything at all.
The extraordinary losses of Pounds 422m are not far short of the company's
entire market value of Pounds 501m at the time it was suspended. Remaining
shareholders' funds of Pounds 436m are less than the Pounds 625m at which
the newspaper titles are still carried in the balance sheet. But MGN's
strength remains its cash generative capacity which is likely eventually to
make it a bid target.
One way of assessing its value is thus to look at what MGN might be worth to
a potential buyer. The starting point is twice turnover, or some Pounds
920m. From that must be deducted debt of Pounds 420m, as well as the net
future additional pension fund commitment, or some Pounds 135m. Allowing for
some further deductions, mostly related to extraordinary contingencies, that
gives a rough market worth of Pounds 300m or 75p a share.
Whether the price will settle at this level when trading resumes is another
matter. There is no dividend; there is some residual uncertainty over
possible claims from Maxwell companies and financial institutions; and there
is likely to be some distress selling by small investors when trading
resumes. Last but not least, the calculation assumes a hefty bid premium in
the short term. That may be premature as the administrator does not give
much sign of being in a hurry to sell.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Post prices frozen to year-end: Record pre-tax profit of
Pounds 247m will not save PO from more competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTAGE PRICES for first and second class mail will be frozen until at least
the end of the year as the Post Office announced a record pre-tax profit of
Pounds 247m for the year to March 29.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman, said the Post Office's increased productivity
and cost reductions could make it harder for the government to deregulate
the market - although he made it clear he was not afraid of more
competition.
Sir Bryan said people had put it to him that increasing the Post Office's
profitability had made it harder for potential new competitors to enter a
deregulated market.
Last year the government announced plans to end the Post Office's monopoly
on sending letters priced under Pounds 1.
A government official yesterday said: 'We are still committed to introducing
more competition and will do so in the next parliament, notwithstanding the
Post Office's good results.'
For the first time since the government announced its decision to establish
a national lottery, Sir Bryan revealed that the corporation had made a
formal bid to run the lottery with another company, through its network of
20,000 Post Office counter shops.
This year's Pounds 247m profit compares with a 1990-91 figure of Pounds 153m
before Pounds 106m of exceptional items relating to reorganisation of Royal
Mail, the letters division, and of Parcelforce, the parcels division. Group
turnover for the group increased from Pounds 4.7bn to Pounds 5.1bn.
Royal Mail's profits before tax and exceptional items increased from Pounds
171m to Pounds 266m. Post Office Counters' pre-tax profits fell by Pounds 2m
to Pounds 26m.
Parcelforce continues to lose money. It made a loss of Pounds 24m, before
tax and exceptional items, compared with a Pounds 75m loss in 1990-91. It
shed 550 administrative jobs and closed more of the division's operational
centres in a move designed to make the parcels division break even. Sir
Bryan said he continued to hope that it would make a profit by next year.
Mr Tom Corrigan, chairman of the Post Office Users' National Council, said:
'Parcelforce has lost Pounds 131m in the past two years and had it not been
for the efforts of Royal Mail, the Post Office would clearly have failed to
meet the mandatory financial targets imposed on it by government.'
Sir Bryan's pay increased by 14 per cent from Pounds 149,195 to Pounds
170,471, reflecting performance-related bonuses. The annual accounts also
disclosed that four other Post Office board members were paid between Pounds
135,000 and Pounds 150,000.
The Post Office was again able to waive its contribution to the main
employee pension fund because it was in surplus for the second year running.

FT  24 JUN 92 / US to tighten sanctions on Belgrade government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday issued its toughest condemnation of the 'barbaric' killing
of civilians in Bosnia by Serbian militias and announced that it was
tightening sanctions against the Belgrade government.
United Nations officials in Sarajevo said they had given up hope of quickly
securing a 48-hour ceasefire to airlift supplies after the Bosnian capital
had been bombarded for most of the day.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, did not discount US support for a
multilateral operation. 'The US has not ruled out participating in some
multilateral operation if that should become necessary, particularly with
respect to the provisioning of humanitarian assistance.'
He said the US would:
Immediately withdraw recognition from Belgrade's ambassador to the US;
Order the former Yugoslav consulate in Chicago to be closed;
Consult its allies on additional steps, including action to end the
obstruction of UN relief operations in Sarajevo;
Broaden its efforts to have Serbia and its ally Montenegro suspended from
participating in international institutions;
Press for the two former Yugoslav republics to be required to reapply for
membership once they had complied with UN Security Council resolutions and
met criteria set for the admission of other new states.
Describing the latest mortar attacks by Serb militia forces on the centre of
Sarajevo as 'barbaric' and 'inhuman', Mr Baker said the time had come for
the international community to go beyond economic sanctions, which the UN
imposed on Serbia and Montenegro at the beginning of this month.
'It's hard to believe, really, in this day and age, that armed forces will
fire artillery and mortars indiscriminately into the heart of a city,
flushing defenceless men, women and children out into the streets and then
shooting them,' Mr Baker told a hearing of the US Senate committee on
foreign relations.
In Sarajevo, General Lewis Mackenzie, head of the UN mission, said: 'Any
immediate hope of establishing a two-day truce to reopen the city airport is
over.'
Continued shelling, sniper attacks and anti-aircraft fire by Serb irregulars
could prevent Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic from travelling to
Strasbourg where Lord Carrington, chairman of the European-Community
sponsored peace conference, intends to reconvene the conference tomorrow.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, is expected to attend the
conference as is Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, and Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic.
In Prishtina, capital of Kosovo, Serbian authorities yesterday prevented the
independent parliament from meeting by surrounding the building with tanks
and troops, and arresting several of its supporters and deputies.
Heavily armed Serb troops set up roadblocks around the premises, and
occupied the building.
The parliament was due to hold its first inaugural session following
underground elections last month organised by the Democratic League of
Kosovo (DLK), the ethnic-Albanian party.
Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, who forcibly integrated the
southern province of Kosovo into the republic, said the elections were
illegal.
Mr Ibrahim Rugova, who was elected president of Kosovo last month, said the
DLK was determined to set up its own parliament and structures independent
of Serbia.

To go into receivership once during a recession might be regarded as a
misfortune; to do so twice begins to look like carelessness.
But such has been the fate of Knobs and Knockers, the bizarrely-named
retailer of brassy household accessories, which yesterday called in
receivers for the second time in as many years.
The company first collapsed in May 1991 but was resuscitated a month later
through a management buy-out led by Geoffrey Davy, former chief executive of
BhS. Although the receiver has immediately closed 19 of the 52 shops, he is
hopeful of selling the business as a going concern.
The company's 50 remaining employees are no doubt hoping for third time
lucky.

The ultimate Whitehall nightmare of having to implement a policy you thought

Horror of horrors. A new programme of secondments between central and local
government could mean that those in the department of the environment
responsible for devising the transitional relief for the council tax, for
example, could find themselves trying to administer it.
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was adamant that the planned move
to Docklands of his department was not a ploy to ensure sufficient
volunteers for his new pet project. Even so, there will be some sympathy
among his underlings for a suggestion by the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities that Howard's job swap idea should be extended to include

The Research Institute of Human Engineering for Quality Life is not doing
things by halves. Over the next two years it will take 180 measurements from

toe or the length of a woman's nose. Volunteers - 'We have already lined up
enough schools, businesses and old people's homes,' says the institute -
will have to wear special underwear for the process; the resulting laser
measurements will be fed into computers to create 3-D images.
The data will be used to set government standards and could help businesses
determine the best sizes for everything from toilet seats to rings that
commuters hold in crowded trains. Observer hopes the researchers will take
other measurements for those gadgets bound for Europe and America.

When Conrad Black bought the Telegraph in 1986 its readers were so old they
were dying at the rate of 1,000 a week. Helped by the introduction of a
children's supplement, Black has managed to reverse this unhappy trend and
now a quarter of his readers are under 34.
However, older readers are still well represented on the group's board. Of
the 16 non-executives, two are in their 80s and four are in their 70s.
Yesterday's prospectus says that no one is disqualified from being a
director just because he is 70, nor will the age of a proposed board member
need to be stated when the appointment comes up for discussion at a general
meeting.
Given the growing age gap between the Telegraph's board and its readers,
perhaps the 47-year-old Black should consider making a bid for The Oldie
magazine. After all, it seems to be doing better in terms of circulation
than the Spectator, the Telegraph's loss-making magazine for young fogeys.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Observer: France's new bull-fighter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Will Francis Lorentz, deposed chairman of France's state-owned Groupe Bull,
be remembered for presiding over one of the biggest losses in computer
industry history, or turning round a showcase of French technology?
A year after he took over the helm, Bull lost FFr6.7bn. To be fair, most
computer companies were caught by the speed of the recession which forced a
sudden downturn in capital spending. But critics argue that his strategy to
revive Bull's flagging fortunes - including staff cuts, a move to 'open' or
industry standard systems, and the purchase of the US computer manufacturer
Zenith Data Systems - came too little and too late.
Lorentz was constrained by the need to present a public face acceptable to
his major shareholder, the government, which continues to promote Bull as
the national computer champion. Clearly, disagreements with Madame Cresson,
the former French prime minister, did not help.
On balance, Lorentz has done a good job although it's a shame he wasn't
given longer to prove himself. But even he would admit that he was luckier
than his successor - Bernard Pache. At least Lorentz learned the computer
trade from the doyen of the European industry, Jacques Stern. Pache has no
such tutor and his main claim to fame so far is that he has wielded the axe
to France's coal mining industry without causing a revolution.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Clouds over open skies: Air transport liberalisation in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes were high yesterday that the European Community's agreement on 'open
skies' would lead to a sharp reduction in the cost of European air travel.
But such expectations are likely to remain grounded for some time to come.
'I'm not pretending everything will be fine from January 1993,' Mr Karel Van
Miert, the EC transport commissioner, said yesterday, mindful of the
euphoria which greeted two previous airline deregulation packages, in 1987
and 1990.
Both failed to drive down fares more than marginally. And even though the
latest package will introduce greater competition and create some new
opportunities to increase consumer choice and services, the financial
problems of airlines combined with the high cost of operating air services
in Europe are expected to keep the pressure on fares.
In theory, at least, European airlines will be free to set their own fares
from the beginning of next year. They will also be free to fly between any
EC country. They will operate under a single EC air licence and from April
1997 they will be free to run domestic services in other member state.
The package - the most far-reaching in the EC's gradual process of air
liberalisation - is designed to encourage greater competition and bring down
European air fares. On average, these are still at least a third higher than
in the US.
In practice, the notion that deregulation will send fares crashing in Europe
could not be more misleading. European airlines are operating under the most
difficult financial conditions since the second world war. 'You only have to
look at the financial results of airlines to see they cannot afford to cut
fares,' commented Mr John Parr, director-general of the Air Transport Users
Committee, the UK consumer pressure group.
The combined losses of European airlines last year of Dollars 1.3bn were
greater than their combined profits over the past 10 years. Airline traffic
has yet to show a sustained recovery following the slump caused by the Gulf
crisis and the recession.
Established carriers and potential entrants alike are unlikely to rush to
open new routes in a European market burdened by increasingly heavy
navigational and airport take-off and landing charges. European airlines
estimate the start-up costs of a new route in Europe at between Pounds 10m
and Pounds 12m.
While trying to generate more competition with its latest package, the
Commission risks putting further pressure on European air fares by its
separate proposal to introduce value-added tax on European airline tickets.
The European airline industry claims that the proposed 9 per cent VAT on
tickets would add about Dollars 1bn on airline costs alone. The eventual
abolition of intra-European duty-free sales and the proposed introduction of
a 3 per cent carbon tax will all eventually add expenses, thus reducing the
possibility of large fare reductions.
A bigger and more immediate problem is Europe's inadequate airport and air
traffic control infrastructure. Although European countries are finally
attempting to harmonise and co-ordinate the modernisation of their different
air traffic control systems, this is likely to take several years, with the
risk of increasing congestion in the air preventing airlines from exercising
their new freedoms.
Despite last year's air travel slump, delays to European airline services
because of infrastructure problems increased by 13 per cent, according to
the Association of European Airlines.
Congestion at such busy airports as Heathrow or Frankfurt could also squeeze
out new entrants because of the lack of available take-off and landing
slots. At the same time, airlines with a dominant position will have an
important competitive advantage.
The EC has so far left out of its liberalisation package new regulations to
allocate slots at congested airports to ensure fair competition and access
to all airlines. The Commission had wanted to pool underused or vacant
landing and take-off slots at main airports so that at least they would be
redistributed to entrants. This provoked fierce opposition from established
airlines. But Mr Van Miert said he was encouraged by UK assurances that it
would address this issue as a priority during its presidency of the EC.
Apart from these structural problems, the success of liberalisation and its
eventual impact on air fares will ultimately rest on the goodwill of EC
member states. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, the UK
carrier, warned yesterday that in the next few weeks, 'we are likely to see
further attempts by some countries to slow down the liberalisation process'.
Sir Michael said the experience of US deregulation suggested that
competition came from the ability of new airlines to secure access to routes
and airport facilities, and not simply by the removal of existing
restrictions. He argued that many routes in Europe continued to be dominated
by state-owned airlines with little incentive to compete.
He also claimed that the only routes in Europe which had so far benefited
from liberalisation were those such as Heathrow to Paris, Amsterdam and
Brussels, where a third carrier has been able to compete against the
respective national carriers. 'On routes where there is now only limited, or
'organised', competition - like Brussels to Rome - there can now be greater
competition,' Mr Van Miert said, adding that carriers such as British
Midland now 'have real additional opportunities to expand their business in
Europe'. Sir Michael has claimed that business travellers pay up to 25 per
cent too much for their air fares on many European routes because of
insufficient choice.
The EC package itself was the result of a compromise between ardent
supporters of liberalisation such as the UK and the Netherlands and other
less enthusiastic countries like France, Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain.
While removing price controls and creating opportunities to fly in other
member countries, the package also contains what the EC describes as
'safeguards' which could ultimately undermine liberalisation.
These apply both to air fares and to European domestic air services.
Although, under the package, airlines will be able to set fares on intra-EC
flights, governments will still be able to intervene if they consider fares
either unreasonably high or low. It will then be up to the other government
to appeal to the Commission to overrule the decision.
In some respects, the system could turn out to be more restrictive than the
current 'double disapproval system', whereby an air fare can only be refused
if both countries at either end of a route object to it. Under the new
scheme, much will depend on the speed of the EC arbitration process in the
event of one country deciding to veto a fare. 'At least under the 'double
disapproval' system a member state was not able to disapprove a fare
unilaterally as will now be the case,' a UK airline executive remarked.
The package has also introduced certain so-called safeguards on the issue of
open market access. Individual governments will continue to control aviation
within their own territories and much will thus depend on their attitude to
entrants in their markets.
Some countries are clearly expected to adopt a more restrictive attitude to
competition in their domestic market than others. As Lord King, British
Airways chairman, said with heavy irony yesterday: 'I think the other
European airlines will seek to protect their own patch. I think Great
Britain, oddly enough, will probably try to play by the rules, and I admire
the way the French play by theirs.'
EC transport ministers also agreed on a transition period of four years and
three months before allowing airlines to operate domestic services in
another member state.
Although airlines will be able next year to fly to a second destination in
another country (a British carrier could fly from London to Paris and then
on to Nice), they will only be allowed to fill a maximum of half their seats
in a foreign stopover until 1997. This is expected to make it more costly
for airlines to open such stopover routes especially since most travellers
prefer direct flights. However, as of next year airlines will be able to fly
between two other countries without starting or ending in their home state.
The transition period is also expected to give national carriers more time
to consolidate their own domestic and international market position before
full liberalisation. All the big airlines have been scrambling to forge
partnerships and have sought equity investments in other carriers to
strengthen their base before deregulation.
Air France has acquired a stake in Sabena of Belgium as well as absorbing
the French carriers Air Inter and UTA: Lufthansa is looking at investing in
smaller European carriers like, among others, Lauda Air of Austria. BA and
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines are expected to resume merger negotiations later
this year.
The big carriers have argued that consolidation of the airline industry was
necessary if Europe was to compete against large US and Far Eastern carriers
in an increasingly global airline market. But this trend could also
undermine competition in a liberalised European market by squeezing out
entrants or forcing them to ally themselves with one or other of the large
airline groups.
The fact that most large European carriers are state-owned is expected to
complicate further the liberalisation process. Scandinavian Airlines System
(SAS) said yesterday it hoped clear rules would be established on the
permitted extent of state support for EC airlines to prevent them from
cutting fares artificially to drive out competitors and subsequently raising
them.
But the package has at least provided the legislative framework to encourage
the development of a multi-airline industry in Europe with greater
competition and eventually lower fares. However, as Sir Michael Bishop
warned: 'There is still a long way to go before European consumers can enjoy
the practical benefits of highly competitive, low cost air travel, and we
should not underestimate the difficulties of implementing the package.'

FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: The Hamburg 'Tannhauser' - Music in Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liceu, Barcelona's big and beautiful opera house, has been playing host
to the Hamburg State Opera as part of the warming-up process for the
Olympics. The invasion was generously planned: four performances of Harry
Kupfer's 1990 production of Tannhauser and two concerts with Schoenberg's
Gurrelieder, given jointly with the Liceu's chorus and orchestra, even the
full Tannhauser company being insufficient for Schoenberg's
late-Romantically exorbitant demands.
Kupfer, with his questing, sometimes perverse theatrical mastery, sees the
Venusberg in Tannhauser as a regime equally oppressive in its diametrically
opposite way as the stuffy Wartburg with its traditional song contests.
Modern attempts at staging Wagner's underground bacchanal are usually doomed
to freakishness if not outright failure. Kupfer's tenable view leaves a
producer free to make the Abode of Love more repellent than erotically
exciting. In Hans Schavernoch's violently angular, black and white set -
revellers milling restlessly around in the darkness - strange rites are
enacted. At one moment a female head is raised aloft from an unseen,
presumably dismembered, corpse. Venus and Tannhauser lie on a large property
bed outlined in neon strips.
The Wartburg valley is grey and grim. The pilgrims are transported to Rome
in a ghostly Intercity train dimly perceived through mist. They return on
foot, with picture hats. After their return the master-idea runs into
trouble. At the moment of Tannhauser's supposed redemption the Pope is borne
on to the stage and a vast throng is seen behind him. But while Wagner
jubilates in E flat major strange lights flicker, segments of grey walls
open and close like giant lobster-claws, threatening to engulf the
frantic-looking Tannhauser, apparently rebelling even, perhaps most of all,
against Grace. Irony could be rammed no further home.
In between the not wholly convincing outer acts there comes a brilliantly
conceived and executed staging of the Hall of Song - not even the most loyal
admirer of this opera normally expects to enjoy this act from beginning to
end. Tiers of metal seating are covered in white dust-sheets, whisked away
at a touch just before the guest arrive. There follows a highly enjoyable
parody of a typical, ghastly North European civic function of the kind where
white ties and tails (Reinhard Heinrich's costumes are modern) are worn at
eleven o'clock in the morning while trays of glasses containing drinks that
no-one wants are solemnly handed round. The women have long black dresses
with enough spangles to look festive.
The function is carried through with choreographic precision. Even the
actual contest did not have the usual dampening effect, so sharply were the
competitors portrayed. Part of the success was due to the buoyant playing of
the Hamburg orchestra under Gerd Albrecht. For once the march did not go
flaccid. The normally thick-soup ensembles sounded almost transparent.
Rene Kollo's fraught, probing, Tannhauser remains gripping in the narration
and in the subsequent hysterical outburst, but in loud, high phrases the
tone is worryingly unsteady. The Venus of Gabriele Schnaut, strong to the
point of occasional aggressiveness, was warmly phrased. Linda Plech's
Elisabeth was appealing except when, in the prayer, the voice pinched.
Harald Stamm made a real person of the Landgrave, Kristin Sigmundsson's
Biterolf was uncommonly forceful. Andreas Schmidt's Wolfram - restrained,
moving, nobly sung, must surely be one of the finest since Herbert Janssen -
a long time ago.
Meanwhile the Palau de la Musica Catalana welcomed the Montreal Symphony
Orchestra under Charles Dutoit. Since their complete Daphnis and Chloe has
been heard in London, I will only say that in Barcelona a famous local
choir, the Orfeo Catala, now celebrating its centenary, with a larger
contingent than usual for this work, made a powerful contribution. The sonic
effect was tremendous.
Instead of the Beethoven concerto deemed necessary to tempt a London
audience to brave the rigours of Ravel, the Montreallers played the Fourth
Symphony of one of this year's centenarians - Honegger. The Fourth was
written for Paul Sacher and the Basel Chamber Orchestra. Swiss-born Dutoit
gave an admirably clear and sensitive reading of this sober but muscular
score in which Honegger, who had dual French-Swiss nationality, gives thanks
for the return of peace and for Sacher's support.
The Hamburg visit was sponsored by Iberia airlines and the German Federal
Government, the Montreal tour by Northern Telecom, the Canadian Government
and the Quebec Ministry of Cultural Affairs

FT  24 JUN 92 / Management: Measured approach to radical reform - Britain's
big hospitals are becoming out-dated. A look at pressure to break them up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE

<TEXT>
Delegates to today's National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts
conference in Harrogate have all received an unusual gift - a pedometer.
The intention is to highlight the fact that people working in hospitals
spend a remarkable amount of time walking around. A study of junior doctors
published by Andersen Consulting this week showed that each walks an average
of six or seven miles during a shift - consuming up to three hours of what
is supposed to be productive time.
Porters in one large teaching hospital were found to be walking up to 20
miles a day. Less remarkable perhaps, because walking is one of a porter's
main duties but - since the hospital spends Pounds 1.25m a year on portering
services - powerful evidence that a reduction in their movements could save
money.
Could it be achieved? Yes, conference delegates will be told. It will
require a complete restructuring of the way hospitals are organised, but
that is not as impossible as it seems.
Many British hospitals have developed in a haphazard way. Often housed in
Victorian buildings extended during the present century, new departments and
large items of equipment tend to be located on the basis of available space
rather than efficiency.
Health planners in Britain, the US and elsewhere are now trying to bring
more order into this haphazard structure. Schemes known as patient-focused
or patient-centred hospitals aim to provide teams of care staff to meet most
of a patient's needs in a single unit, so that patients do not have to go on
long journeys around the hospital for treatment. A few commonly repeated
blood tests, for example, account for 80 per cent of all hospital blood
testing - suggesting that nurses could be trained to carry out such
procedures on the ward.
Andersen Consulting, which is involved in helping hospital managements
develop patient-focused schemes - alongside Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton and other
management consultants - sent the pedometers to conference delegates to
emphasise the point. But the time wasted walking around was only one of the
inefficiencies found by Andersen in a survey of 10 NHS hospitals during the
past three months.
Other findings showed that:
A common pathology test took, on average, 10 people and 18 hours.
A typical patient came into contact with 47 different care providers during
a five-day stay in hospital.
Hospitals in the survey typically had 201 job classifications.
The patient-focused approach involves moving away from the concept of the
hospital as a single institution and dividing its buildings into a series of
centres.
At Lee Memorial Hospital in Florida, where Andersen is helping local
management introduce 'focused-care', a mini-orthopedic hospital has been
established within the building with its own beds, pharmacy, laboratory,
radiology centre and offices.
Patients receive all except the most specialised and complex treatment
within units like these from teams of multi-skilled staff.
Kurt Miller, an Andersen consultant, believes the patient-focused approach
raises the quality of care and improves industrial relations and staff
retention rates. He predicts it could eventually reduce overall operating
costs by about 10 per cent.
London's Central Middlesex Hospital, which became one of the first
self-governing trusts last year, is managing its own move to a
patient-focused structure with an in-house team. Starting next year, the
hospital will be divided into 14 ambulatory care centres reflecting the main
medical needs of patients and catering for both day and in-patients. There
are plans to replace old buildings with purpose-built blocks to house the
centres.
According to Andy Black, the hospital's chief executive: 'An increasing
number of other managers are asking about what we are doing. This may become
one of the next big issues for change in the service.' A move to
patient-focused care would undoubtedly cause a reduction in those 201 job
classifications. Supporters of the system say multi-skilled teams are good
for both the quality of patient care and staff morale.
Miller says his US experience suggests that once initial staff fears about
de-skilling have been addressed, job-satisfaction rises. 'When a
multi-skilled team is given complete responsibility for a group of patients,
they feel they are playing more of a part in the task of curing people.'
Nick Edwards, Andersen's UK consultant who supervised the survey of NHS
hospitals, says current hospital organisation encourages staff to give
primary loyalty to their profession. 'The solution is to design the system
around the needs of the patient, rather than giving priority to the
requirements of the institution and the professional and other groups
working in it.'
Some NHS managers believe hospitals are likely to reduce their workforces by
up to 20 per cent during the 1990s. This is likely to affect both skilled
and unskilled staff. A move to a patient-focused organisation would provide
personnel managers with a rational basis for launching a drive for
productivity improvements in the NHS.
By the next century, even more dramatic things may be happening to
hospitals. According to a report published by the King's Fund health
research organisation yesterday, they will be playing a much smaller part in
the overall delivery of health services by the year 2010. The King's Fund
report casts doubt over the future of famous London teaching hospitals like
University College and the Middlesex hospitals, with their joint medical
school and elderly buildings on valuable sites in central London.
The district general hospital of the 1960s and 1970s is becoming outdated,
suggests the report. It predicts that a large proportion of hospital work -
perhaps including areas like psychiatry, dermatology and the clinical care
of elderly people - is likely to shift to GPs surgeries, health centres and
the community. The bulk of planned, non-urgent surgery will be performed on
a day-case basis. Hospitals will become smaller and more specialised,
concentrating on people who are undergoing complex treatments.
Compared with achieving this level of change, the introduction of
patient-focused care looks a relatively straightforward management task.
But the view that hospitals are about to undergo some of the biggest
structural changes in their long history is widely shared by health planners
and, as the King's Fund report points out, the year 2010 is not very far
away.

managers' hankering to have faithful retainers could be a useful lever for
candidates

board director interviewing you for the key job in his domain looks at his
watch. Although you feel you have put yourself across adequately, you
clearly haven't scored a triumph. Moreover the big-company post is so
attractive that, being a touch surprised to have got on the short-list, you
are sure there'll be other contenders whose qualifications are stronger.
Now, with the director about to close the proceedings, it is make-or-break.
You have time to speak only one more sentence. What is it to be?
Well, the strict truth is that if the Jobs column really knew the answer, it
would be too rich to bother raising the question. But there is one formula
which I suspect might well turn the trick in the circumstances outlined. It
is to say matter-of-factly during the parting handshake: 'By the way, I'd
like you to know that if I'm appointed, my first loyalty will always be to
you personally.'
The suggested ploy originates with Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer, of Stanford
Business School in the US, whose book Managing with Power* was discussed in
this *Harvard Business School Press, (ISBN 0-87584-314-X) Dollars 24.95.
corner of the FT nine weeks ago. As I said then, it is the best guide to
organisational politicking that luck has yet brought me.
Among the many aspects of the craft the author covers is the politics of
recruiting. And one of the things he says about same is: 'Although we often
like to think of the hiring and promotion process as based primarily on
merit, ambitious managers understand quite well the necessity of en-suring
that the organization is liberally salted with people who are obliged to
them.'
Indeed, recognition of that necessity was apparently a key principle behind
the post-war rise of the finance division of General Motors to rule over the
whole organisation. Called the principle of promotion of the unobvious
choice, it entailed 'promoting someone not yet regarded as a contender for
the post. Doing so not only puts 'your man' in position, but it earns for
you his undying loyalty because he owes his corporate life to you.'
True, as the professor says, such blatantly political devices are rarely
acknowledged openly. Nevertheless the advantage of being surrounded by
personally loyal satellites is no doubt prized by many if not most
high-ranked managers, in big outfits at least.
So despite having not myself tested the interview-ending formula (I've
stumbled across it too late in life to do so), my guess is that it might
come in handy for job-seekers in the sort of make-or-break position
described. If any of them cares to try it, I'll be eager to learn of the
result.
NOW, while we're discussing the ambitions of high-flying managers, to the
table below which sheds light on which of the so-called functions of
business carries most kudos in different countries. The figures are drawn
from the latest cross-Europe survey by the Wyatt management consultancy's
branch in Brussels.
For each of the 10 countries covered, the table ranks the directors in
charge of the various functional departments by the money value that
companies evidently put on them. The basis of the ranking is the gross pay
received in cash - salary plus bonuses and so on - of a typical chief
executive, which is indicated at the top in italics. The gross cash pay of
the different directors is then shown as a percentage of the relevant chief
executive's figure.
As may be seen, there seem to be considerable variances from land to land in
the differential chiefs enjoy over the generality of the managers one notch
below. Switzerland apparently puts the highest value on departmental
directors as a whole, and France the lowest - in line with other evidence
that, despite its famous revolution, the democratic spirit is less potent
there than in most other western countries.
Where the separate functions are concerned, the French are like the British
and Irish in giving pride of place to the heads of finance. But the
production director comes top in four cases - Switzerland, Germany, the
Netherlands and Belgium. Italy prefers the director of research and
development, Spain the data-processing chief, and Sweden the director of
materials.
FINALLY, to the job of spearheading an international spirits-distiller's
business growth in the former Soviet Union. The post is offered through
headhunter Alan Rundle (Rundle Brownsword, 17 London End, Beaconsfield,
Buckinghamshire HP9 2HN; tel 0494 676264, fax 0494 670283) who may not name
the employer. He therefore promises to abide by applicant's requests not to
be named to his client at this stage.
While already exporting brands to the Commonwealth of Independent States,
the company wants a country manager to run its business there and greatly
increase market share.
Candidates need success in managing overseas consumer-brands marketing
operations for well known companies. Russian speakers preferred. Base
probably Moscow.
Salary negotiable around the UK equivalent of Pounds 45,000, plus full
expatriate-type perks.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Extra N-station planned for Sizewell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW nuclear power station, twice the size of any built in Britain, could
be the key to cheap nuclear power, according to Nuclear Electric.
The state-owned company, which operates England and Wales' nuclear stations,
believes it could build twin reactors next to Sizewell B in Suffolk,
Britain's latest nuclear station under construction. The cost would be less
than Pounds 3bn in today's money, and some cash might be raised privately.
The cost compares with around Pounds 3.5bn for the single Sizewell B
reactor, due to start operating in 1994. 'We've already paid for Sizewell
B,' Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, told a conference in
London yesterday: 'Now we need to think how to capitalise on it. It's our
duty to the consumer and the taxpayer.' Nuclear Electric cannot build any
stations until it passes a government review in 1994. His proposal surprised
some analysts, who said Mr Collier's hopes of private-sector financing,
especially at the 8 per cent rate of return he quoted, was unrealistic.
Mr Steve Thomas, nuclear specialist at Sussex University's Science Policy
Research Unit, said: 'They are saying this because they can't claim to be a
nuclear company and not have investment plans.'
The new station, which would start up around 2002, would have two 1300MW
reactors. It would be second in size only to Britain's coal-fired power
station at Drax, North Yorkshire, which generates power for six cities the
size of Liverpool.
Nuclear Electric believes it would produce electricity at less than 3p per
unit compared with between 6p and 8p for the oldest nuclear stations, and
just over 4p for Sizewell B.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said Nuclear
Electric lived in 'never-never land'. It said: 'Never accept the economic
realities of nuclear, and never deal with the formidable radioactive legacy
of nuclear waste.'
Thirty-six organisations and individuals have sent the Department of Trade
and Industry their views on the privatisation of British Coal. The 36
included companies interested in bidding.
Bodies which contacted the DTI before its deadline on Monday included
electricity generators, mining unions and mining groups.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCA-COLA yesterday launched in Europe its first plastic bottle partly made
from recycled material, but quickly ran into criticism from environmental
groups.
Mr Ralph Cooper, president of the company's European Community Group, said
recycling of plastic into new containers would eventually become as common
as recycling in the glass, aluminium and steel industries.
The bottle, of which 25 per cent is recycled plastic, has been launched into
a limited market covering Shoreham-by-Sea, Brighton and Worthing on the
south coast of England. Consumers will be able to return bottles via
kerbside collection boxes to an experimental materials recovery facility in
West Sussex. The bottles will then be sent to a reprocessing plant in the
US.
The regenerated pure plastic resin will be sent back to existing Coca-Cola
bottling plants in Europe to be included in the normal manufacturing
process.
The two-litre PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles are indistinguishable
from other Coca-Cola bottles, apart from a special logo.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said it would have
preferred Coca-Cola to have introduced returnable PET bottles as it had in
the Netherlands. These bottles, which carry a Fl 1 (30p) deposit, are
heavier than the non-refillable PET bottles (110 grammes as opposed to 50
grammes) but can be returned, cleaned and re-used.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW PROCEDURES to ensure that MPs elected to the chairmanships of Commons
committees do not have business interests likely to conflict with their
parliamentary duties were backed from both sides of the House last night.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, hinted that the government is likely to
favour arrangements which make it unnecessary to adopt a proposal requiring
committee chairmen to divest themselves of any pecuniary interest which may
be thought to influence their judgment.
He promised to consider the views expressed by MPs in a short debate on a
report by the select committee on Members' interests before reaching any
final decision on how the House should be asked to implement its
recommendations.
Mr Terence Higgins, chairman of the Treasury committee in the last
parliament, agreed that MPs elected to such positions were in a different
position from their colleagues.
While committee chairmen should be subject to more stringent rules on the
disclosure of their outside interests he believed it would be wrong to
insist that they should have none.
To take such a step, it was argued, would be to impose a penalty which was
not imposed on other MPs.
Mr Higgins, who has also served as chairman of the liaison committee which
co-ordinates the work of the Commons committees, maintained that the best
people to judge whether the outside interests of the chairman were likely to
conflict with the work of the select committee were the other members of
that particular committee.
He argued that there was no need for specific requirements to be imposed by
a special resolution of the House.

FT  24 JUN 92 / GPs end 24-hour cover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMILY doctors yesterday voted in favour of ending their current commitment
to providing 24-hour cover for patients.
A British Medical Association conference in London supported the replacement
of the general practitioners' existing legal responsibility to provide
full-time cover with more flexible arrangements. The move follows a survey
of GPs earlier this year which showed strong support for the change.
Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the BMA's general medical services committee, said
the issue concerned how out-of-hours cover should be provided rather than
whether it should continue. Any alternative arrangements introduced would
ensure continuation of home visits when necessary.
The BMA leaders will now have to approach health department ministers for
talks on the introduction of more flexible contracts for GPs.
The government last night pressed ahead with plans for a 7 per cent cut in
dental charges and dentists' fees.
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley announced that the cut would take effect
from July 8.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Closure of up to 15 London hospitals urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 15 big London hospitals should close with resources shifted to
improvements in family doctor and community services, a report on the
capital's healthcare recommended yesterday.
The report did not nominate hospitals for closure, but implementation of its
recommendations would certainly mean the loss of famous teaching hospitals.
Medical staffing levels in the city's hospital service would be cut by 30
per cent.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, described the report from the
King's Fund health policy centre as a radical vision of healthcare which
would be 'extremely valuable in pointing the way ahead'.
She has asked Sir Bernard Tomlinson, who is advising the government on
future health provision in the capital, to take full account of the King's
Fund proposals. Sir Bernard is due to report in the autumn, and the
government will then face sensitive decisions on closures.
London is relatively over-provided with hospital beds, particularly in
high-cost inner-city teaching hospitals. The problem has been brought to a
head by the new funding system of the government's health reforms -
inner-London districts with falling populations are losing money and health
authorities in the home counties have greater incentives to treat patients
locally.
'In many important respects London's health services appear stuck in a time
warp, having been shaped a century ago,' said the report. 'To date, forces
for change have been largely negative and budgetary.'
There had been a decline in hospital beds since 1980, but almost no
redistribution of medical manpower from central London and little
concentration of specialist resources in fewer, stronger centres, the report
added. The capital's hospitals had faced unrelenting financial pressures
during the 1980s. If a drop in patients from outer areas led to further
across-the-board service reductions the position would 'quickly become
unsustainable'. In 1989-90 hospital and community health services in London
cost Pounds 2.9bn - 20 per cent of English expenditure even though the
capital contains only 15 per cent of the population. Healthcare costs in
London were 20 per cent above the English average, with those in inner
London 45 per cent higher.
London nonetheless received a 'poor deal' from health services, the report
stated. Compared with the rest of England it had many more general
practitioners with list sizes above 2,500 and more GPs running surgeries
single-handedly, while the proportion of GPs aged over 65 was 130 per cent
above the English average.
The report calls for a strategic task force, accountable to the government,
to develop services in conjunction with health authorities. It envisages a
25 per cent reduction in London hospital beds over the next 18 years, and
predicts the closure of about 15 major acute (general) and specialist
post-graduate hospitals by 2010. London has 41 acute hospitals each with
more than 250 beds.
The report said Pounds 1.2bn would be needed to achieve proposed service
changes, plus Pounds 220m to develop community healthcare premises. An
estimated Pounds 1.5bn would be available under the NHS's capital programme
for London hospital developments during the next 20 years. If that was added
to projected savings arising from the proposed restructuring, said the
report, the proposals were realistically based.
London trains a third of Britain's doctors, and the report envisaged a
reduction in the annual number of medical students in the capital from 1,350
to 960.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major seeks rapid action to widen
EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR signalled last night that Britain will press its European
partners to finalise by the end of this year a detailed mandate for
enlargement negotiations with at least four Efta countries.
At a working dinner in Downing Street with Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president, the prime minister also called for the Brussels
executive to speed up the work to define the role of 'subsidiarity' in the
Community's decision-making.
Mr Major, whose talks with Mr Delors focused on this week's Lisbon summit
and the subsequent British presidency of the EC, said he was determined to
put enlargement at the centre of his agenda.
Senior colleagues said he wanted the Commission to draw up over the next few
months the EC's basic negotiating stance with Sweden, Switzerland, Finland,
Austria and, possibly, Norway. The aim would be to translate that into a
firm mandate at December's Edinburgh summit.
Mr Major acknowledges that several other EC governments have been unwilling
to contemplate enlargement until the Maastricht treaty is ratified. But he
appears determined that their objections should not delay preparations.
His government's view is that a commitment to enlargement will be a central
element in a package of measures to allow the Danish government to hold a
second referendum on the treaty.
A second element is a much tighter definition of subsidiarity - ensuring the
Community only has authority in areas where national governments cannot
operate effectively.
Officials said Mr Major welcomed the work that Mr Delors had already
instituted but stressed the need to translate the theory into practical
decisions. That would involve both a review of areas where the Commission
had taken 'unnecessary' powers, and a mechanism to ensure that it did not do
so in the future.
The prime minister sees tangible progress on both fronts as one of his most
potent weapons in efforts to isolate Tory critics of Maastricht, as well as
in the Community's attempts to reassure the Danes.
As ministers brushed off another attack by Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday, Mr
Major underlined his determination not to renege on Maastricht during a
meeting with officers of the influential 1922 committee of backbench MPs.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will convey the same message in a
much larger gathering of Conservative MPs later today.
The government will delay the renomination of a second British EC
commissioner until after next month's Labour leadership election. Re-opening
speculation about a possible move to Brussels by Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Major
agreed to Labour requests that any decision over Mr Bruce Millan's future
should not be taken until after the contest. Sir Leon Brittan will be
reappointed as senior British Commissioner.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Stitch-up' alleged in review of
union links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY was brewing last night over the composition of a special Labour
committee to examine the party's union links, amid claims that grassroots
opinion has been deliberately excluded from the review process.
The Labour Co-ordinating Committee, the constituency activists' pressure
group, said proposals to be debated at today's national executive meeting
were 'wholly unacceptable' and little more than a 'stitch-up' of the
much-heralded review by the unions.
Mr Mike Craven, the LCC chairman, said the commission would be dominated by
unions, which have seven of the proposed 15-strong commission members. He
also attacked plans to hold monthly meetings of the union section of the NEC
to monitor the review committee.
Calling on the NEC to amend the plan, submitted by Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's
general secretary, he said representatives of constituency Labour parties,
local government, and more women should be included.
The criticisms will be taken up by Mr Bryan Gould, an NEC member
representing the constituency parties, when they are debated today. Last
night, Mr Gould said that while strong union representation on the committee
was welcome, the lack of 'grassroots input' was a clear weakness in the
proposals.
Under Mr Whitty's plan, a copy of which has been received by the FT, the NEC
will reaffirm the party's union links but then go on to acknowledge that the
unions' are 'over-represented in the counsels of the party'.
The committee will include Mr Bill Morris and Mr John Edmonds, respectively
leaders of the TGWU and GMB general unions, five MPs, Mr Whitty, Ms Joyce
Gould, a Labour national official, and Professor Lewis Minkin, an academic
authority on Labour's union connections.
The NEC is expected to include in its remit examination of reforms to
exclude the unions from selection of MPs in favour of a one-member;one-vote
system.
Last night Mr Nigel Harris, an NEC member from the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, joined the LCC in warning against tinkering with changes
to the selection process agreed by the NEC organisation committee last week.
Welcoming the review committee of which he will be a member, he said the
AEEU would resist any attempt to 'sabotage' the change. 'It would be a snub
to our constituency members who overwhelmingly support one member, one
vote.'

<TEXT>
THE anguished debate about Labour's union links, which sputtered into life
after the party's election defeat, looks set to run and run.
The party's national executive is today expected to endorse a review of
those links which will reach a climax at the party conference next year.
Unfortunately for Labour, the possibility of the debate remaining objective
and good-tempered is almost nil. The union link is an emotional issue going
to the heart of what people think the party is for. Further, both wings of
the debate - those who want a complete split and those who want little
change - have powerful arguments on their side.
Supporters of the link argue that without the block vote and the common
sense of union leaders the party would merely reflect the passions of
middle-class constituency activists and be even less electable than it now
is.
The unions give the party roots and cash and are therefore entitled to some
say in its policy forums. If general affiliation was ended, it is argued, it
would produce US-style 'pork-barrel' politics with unions picking and
choosing between parties and politicians.
Supporters of the status quo include influential union leaders such as Mr
Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, the biggest union affiliated to
Labour. Those in favour of a complete break, including at least one Labour
frontbench spokesman, do not deny that the unions have been a stabilising
influence on the party in the past few decades.
Unions, they say, may not be unpopular, but Labour's link with a declining
lobby group for producer interests is unpopular with voters assessing a
potential government.
Supporters of a complete institutional break say Labour and the unions would
continue to share broad policy objectives and values and see no reason why
unions should not go on funding the party.
Union leaders have expressed bitterness at the fact that they are being
blamed for Labour's defeat.
But equally the 'no say, no pay' rhetoric of some union leaders should not
hide the fact that most recognise that a re-ordering of the link is
required.
The GMB general union, like several senior Labour politicians, is attracted
by the idea of 'associate' Labour membership for the 4.5m union members who
pay the political levy - many of them unwittingly.
Such people would become local party members but would have only one third
of the voting power of a full member.
At national level the electoral college, on which the unions now have a 40
per cent vote, would be de-unionised. The block vote at conference would
come down to 50 per cent from the current 90 per cent and would not be cast
as a block. The 12 union seats on the 24-strong national executive - and
reserved union seats on the national policy forum - might also be reduced.
Unlike Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing party leader, Mr John Smith - the
favourite to succeed him - does not like doing deals in smoke-filled rooms.
He instinctively supports the widest possible move to one member, one vote
at local level, but he is unlikely to want a complete split. Diluting the
union role by raising the number of interest groups which have a say in
party forums - such as those on local government or consumers - is being
considered. That, however, will hardly improve Labour's chances of speaking
for the general interest.

THE parliamentary Boundary Commission was accused of being 'corrupt' by Mr

There were protests from the government benches when he claimed that its

SENIOR MINISTERS met at Downing Street yesterday to try to resolve the
difficulties over the planned transfer of responsibility for community care
from the government to local authorities.
At a discussion chaired by Mr John Major, ministers from the health, social
security and environment departments agreed to press ahead with the aim of
making the transfer as intended in April next year.
Funding problems had led to suggestions from some ministers that the
transfer should be delayed again, or even postponed to allow an alternative
policy to be developed.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Secret services face new scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has indicated that it will consider increasing the scrutiny
of Britain's overseas and domestic intelligence services, Ralph Atkins
writes.
Legislation is already planned to put the Secret Intelligence Service, or
MI6, on a legal basis. But extra clauses to increase the service's
accountability to the Commons were not ruled out by Downing Street
yesterday.
An official at the Foreign Office, which is responsible for MI6, said that
consideration of the bill's contents was at an early stage but, 'it is all
up for grabs'.
Last month, the prime minister confirmed, for the first time, the existence
of MI6 and named its chief, Sir Colin McColl.
The domestic intelligence service, MI5, was put on a statutory basis in 1989
and, theoretically, is accountable to MPs via ministers. It is probable that
any extra scrutiny applied to MI6 would extend to MI5.
Some MPs however are demanding that the intelligence services should be
accountable to a Commons committee, or a committee of privy councillors.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Depositor protection plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMERS of British banks may soon enjoy protection on 90 per cent of their
bank deposits - instead of the present 75 per cent - under proposed
legislation from Brussels.
The British Bankers' Association said the protection would apply to up to
Pounds 11,900 (Ecu16,000) of savings compared with Pounds 20,000 offered by
the existing UK depositor protection scheme, which will continue to operate
alongside the EC scheme. The association said this would mean a depositor
getting back a maximum of Pounds 10,714 (Ecu15,000) if their bank failed.
Customers of building societies in the UK already enjoy protection on 90 per
cent of their deposits up to Pounds 20,000.
Banks within the European Community are close to agreement on the main
points of a deposit guarantee schemes directive which would impose minimum
standards of depositor protection.
The talks ran into temporary difficulties when banks in Germany and Italy
tried to hold out for 100 per cent depositor protection. British banks
oppose total protection as they believe it would encourage imprudent
behaviour among both investors and banks and make much stricter government
regulation of the banking system necessary.
Though no text of the proposed directive has yet been drawn up, the BBA
expects that it will be completed in the second half of this year during the
British presidency of the EC.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Capping eased for Tory authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the three Tory-controlled councils to have their spending for next
year 'capped', or limited by the government, have had the limits relaxed
slightly, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, announced yesterday.
The budget limit for Basildon has been raised by Pounds 1.95m, and that for
Warwickshire has been increased by Pounds 4m. The third council whose
representations proved at least partly effective was Gloucestershire (which
no one party controls), and whose spending limit has been increased by
Pounds 2.59m.
The cuts now represent a poll tax reduction of Pounds 41 off the Pounds 361
per head in Basildon. In Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, where the tax had
been at levels of between Pounds 290 and Pounds 350, the cuts are Pounds 18
and Pounds 8 per head respectively.
Mr Howard described the caps, or limits, now imposed as 'reasonable,
appropriate and achievable in all the circumstances of the authorities
concerned'. Five of the other seven councils whose budgets were capped had
appeals against the original limits rejected. They will have three weeks to
set new budgets.
The capping limits will be debated by MPs today. Some MPs will welcome the
relaxation of the limits announced yesterday, but the government will still
be pressed about the other areas. These include Hillingdon in London, which
argues that its work with child refugees at Heathrow is not properly
reflected in its grant.
The Local Government Commission, which is to advise on council
restructuring, will begin work on the Isle of Wight on July 1, Mr John
Redwood, the local government minister, told an Association of County
Councils conference yesterday.
He emphasised the need for attention to be paid to the views of local
communities.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES pledged Pounds 3.21bn in new mortgage lending last month,
16 per cent up on April. However the Building Societies Association warned
yesterday that the increase in loan agreements did not show that a revival
in the housing market was necessarily on the way.
It said the figure was still below the Pounds 4.07bn in May last year. Net
mortgage lending completed fell from Pounds 1.3bn in April to Pounds 1.24bn
last month.
Building societies provided mortgage loans for 50,000 house purchases last
month compared with 63,000 in May last year.
Last month was also poor for savings, with net receipts at Pounds 179m, down
from Pounds 212m in April. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the
association, said societies remained under strong pressure from other forms
of saving.
Because the housing market is so slack, building societies are reducing
their level of borrowing on commercial money markets. Last month they repaid
Pounds 273m of wholesale funding, up from Pounds 223m in April. The
societies have made net payments to the money markets for three of the first
five months of this year.
House prices are likely to fall by 3.5 per cent this year before steady
growth returns to the market over five years, according a study published
yesterday by Charterhouse, the merchant bank.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Lloyd's chiefs face fury of Names today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S annual general meeting of the Lloyd's insurance market promises to
be full of fire and fury as its ruling council faces the anger of many of
the hundreds of Names who face financial ruin as a result of the latest
losses.
The atmosphere will be tense, and it is likely that Mr David Coleridge, the
chairman, will experience just as rough a ride as last year, when he fielded
questions from Names for four hours.
But in spite of the threats, leaders of groups of Names - the individuals
who stake their wealth on the insurance market's fortunes - are expecting
little of substance to emerge. Names facing losses are placing their hopes
on legal action.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the leader of the Gooda Walker Names Action group
 -the biggest group of loss-making Names - is expecting 'more heat than
light'. He said: 'It will not be a calm environment. There will be too many
people asking outrageous questions.'
About 4,000 Names on seven syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, which went
into liquidation last year, must pay Pounds 491m. The syndicates' losses are
so great that officials only completed their accounting work yesterday.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working
Party, which draws together representatives of all action groups, said he
expected the meeting to be 'chaos'.
Mr Clive Francis, a leader of two action groups, was scathing in his
criticism of Mr Coleridge. He said: 'The council has now declared that
Lloyd's is a matter of us and them. They have invited civil war and they are
going to get it. Nothing much will be decided at the annual general meeting,
except to see how much noise the glasshouse will take.'
Some Names may raise questions about the Lloyd's Corporation's report and
accounts, which is formally presented to the meeting. Detailed figures of
the market's global results for 1989, its most recent underwriting year,
will not be available until next week. But many Names leaders are placing
more importance on the extraordinary general meeting next month, where the
governing council will face votes of no confidence. In many ways this is
just a scene-setter.
Mr Valentine Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Names,
said that the AGM was a curious process, as little actually happened apart
from the vote on the report. He added: 'I would see tomorrow as a day of
heat and light, and very gruelling for all concerned. I don't think it
requires anything to be voted on.'
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, which represents
Names on two badly hit syndicates, said he did not intend to ask questions
because he ex-pected 'an anodyne response'.
Ms Jenifer Grossman of the Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action group, said:
'We would like a bail-out but so many people have had their cash calls drawn
and they've practically given up hope now.'
Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Society of Names, said: 'There will be
rudeness and acrimony and bitterness, and that is totally unsatisfactory.'
He added: 'I don't believe any good comes of that sort of attitude.'
Warning of protracted legal conflict, Mr Benyon added: 'Busted Names will
get their reward in the end because they will win their litigation, I
expect. Settlement will have to come through the courts. That's a very sad
thing but I can't see any alternative to it.' A Labour MP yesterday named
four senior Lloyd's figures, including Mr Coleridge, in a parliamentary
early day motion alleging 'corrupt insider dealing' on the market.
The motion, tabled by Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, south Wales, noted that
'at least four past and present members of Lloyd's Council are running
syndicates that have benefited massively from the LMX reinsurance system'
and suggested 'this conflict of interest explains why Lloyd's Council took
no action to curtail the reinsurance spiral'.
Those named - who were 'estimated to have made re-insurance gains for their
own syndicates worth Pounds 550m from the LMX spiral in the 1989 year of
account' - included Mr Coleridge, Mr Murray Lawrence, Mr Brian Kellett and
Mr Richard Hazell.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BUNDLE of 21 rare wooden tally sticks used in the mid 13th century as
royal receipts sold for Pounds 17,600 at Sotheby's yesterday to the London
dealer Quaritch.
In 1834 millions of obsolete tally sticks were placed on a bonfire which
went out of control and burned down the Palace of Westminster. The sticks
sold yesterday - which were used as counterfoils - were presumably saved
from the flames.
The sticks provided the Exchequer with proof of such payments as Pounds 6
13s 4d from the Abbot of Abingdon 'for making the king's son (the future
Edward I) a knight' and Pounds 3 6s 8d 'from John de Turbervill for
contempt'.
The price reached yesterday was at the top of the estimate.
In the same auction of manuscripts and miniatures an Italian Renaissance
manuscript by Basinio da Parma on astronomy and astrology, written in Rimini
around 1455, sold for Pounds 115,500, way ahead of forecast. It was bought
by Bank of Rimini for the town museum.
The auction totalled Pounds 853,402 with 11.8 per cent unsold. This unsold
percentage was largely accounted for by a Book of Hours, produced in Bruges
around 1510, which was unusual in being signed by its scribe, 'Johnnykins of
Bomal'. The manuscript was unsold at Pounds 72,000 but found a buyer
immediately after the auction.
The collection of German faience (tin-glazed earthenware) assembled by Dr
Ragnar Borsum brought in more than Pounds 500,000 with a top price of Pounds
52,800 paid twice - for a Nuremberg tankard of around 1760, painted with
scenes of children playing, and for a Bayreuth tankard dated 1771, which
carried a top estimate of Pounds 9,000.
Christie's had disappointments at its tribal art sale. It totalled Pounds
363,170 but was more than 40 per cent unsold. An Ubangi slit drum made
Pounds 82,500, but the biggest surprise was a pair of Indian moccasins, from
the Cree-Seminole tribe, which were estimated at up to Pounds 1,500, but
which sold for Pounds 22,000.
Phillips was selling in situ the contents of 13 St Thomas Street,
Winchester.
The top price, and double the estimate, was the Pounds 59,540 paid by an
overseas dealer for a pair of George II carved console tables in the manner
of William Kent.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Insurers crack down on 'dodgy claims'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE industry yesterday promised a 'blitz' on fraud as it launched
a campaign to combat bogus and inflated claims, which cost it an estimated
Pounds 400m last year.
Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers, which
is co-ordinating the effort, said: 'We aim to identify, spotlight and
prosecute the fraudsters. They must not be allowed to get away with dodgy
claims.'
Fraud by policyholders has added to the problems of the industry, which
announced record trading losses of Pounds 3.3bn last year.
Mr Ian Rushton, chairman of the association, said: 'In the UK, for every
Pounds 1 of premium collected, insurance companies suffered Pounds 1.30 in
claims and expenses.'
The association will tackle fraud with an advertising campaign featuring
case studies of successful prosecutions, which will 'remind the public that
cheating is a crime'.
Cases include 'Arthur', who claimed for a new TV set after pretending that
his old one was damaged, and 'Sally', who added a few things to her
insurance claim after a video was stolen from her house.
'Arthur' was reported by his neighbours after boasting about his plans,
while 'Sally's' plans to cheat came unstuck when the thieves came clean
about the robbery after they were caught.
The campaign, which will cost Pounds 250,000, was launched after a Gallup
poll, commissioned by the association, revealed a widespread public belief
that insurance fraud was extensive.
Of a sample of 1,000 adults interviewed 21 per cent knew of someone who had
put forward a false or inflated claim and 80 per cent thought insurance
fraud was a 'serious or very serious problem'.
Reflecting on the industry's results, Mr Rushton said that the current level
of claims costs was 'unacceptable'. He warned that the 'average family' must
expect to pay Pounds 10 per month more for home and motor insurance this
year.
Motor insurers reported underwriting losses of Pounds 1.2bn. Fire and
accident losses rose to Pounds 3.3bn, compared with Pounds 1.9bn in 1990,
while mortgage indemnity losses amounted to Pounds 1.2bn. The cost of motor
theft claims was up 36 per cent. Subsidence cost Pounds 540m, more than four
times as much as usual.
The one bright spot is continued strong growth in life assurance. Total
premium income increased by 17.8 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Building society complaints soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS to the building societies ombudsman more than doubled over the
past year, according to the scheme's annual report.
There were 9,525 complaints and inquiries to the ombudsman in the year to
March 31 - six times the figure for 1987-88, the first year of the ombudsman
scheme.
Mr Stephen Edell, the first ombudsman, said a third ombudsman, Mr Brian
Murphy, was appointed last month to help with the 'flood of complaints'.
Mr Edell said he did not know why numbers had risen so quickly, but he said
increased publicity as well as the recession might help account for part of
the rise.
The sharpest rise in complaints related to interest rates on investments,
but the main factor in the rise was failure by building societies to alert
customers to changes and replacements to accounts.
Mr Edell said the onus was on individuals to look after their investments,
and that there would be no pressure to force societies to inform
account-holders in writing of changes to their accounts.
Complaints relating to mortgage repossessions increased by 171 per cent over
the year. However, Mr Edell said there were few cases in which action could
be taken because the ombudsman lacks the power to stop repossessions and
cannot deal with cases being handled by the courts.
The most common complaint on repossessions was that properties had been sold
too cheaply by building societies.
Complaints about insurance more than doubled, mainly as a result of the fees
customers are charged to take out insurance other than as a package.
Mr Edell said most awards made were of hundreds of pounds or in the low
thousands. He made formal decisions in 392 cases, of which 19 were resolved
wholly in the complainant's favour.

LEADERS of British Tel-ecommunications unions were yesterday being tutored

The new tactic has been developed by US union officials in dispute with
American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), principally over job security.
The officials, who are visiting European unions as part of their campaign
against AT&amp;T, have worked out a plan based on diverting long-distance
business away from AT&amp;T into the hands of its competitors.
Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the NCU communications union, the main
BT engineers union, said BT exhibited many of AT&amp;T's features in its labour
relations.
The NCU has rejected a pay offer of 4.1 per cent from July for BT engineers.

THERE IS widespread support among politicians and housing experts for
reviving the private landlord system, a report commissioned by the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, said yesterday.
It called for incentives to encourage private landlords and to secure
funding for rented housing from financial institutions.
The report said reversing the decline in private rented housing was the only
way to meet the demand that councils and housing associations could not
meet. Revival would require government subsidies to bridge the gap between
landlords' likely income from rents and the returns available from
comparable investments.

THE government intends to link some state funding of further education
colleges directly to an expansion of student numbers when it takes over
funding of the sector next year, a CBI conference on education was told
yesterday, Andrew Adonis writes.
Sir John Caines, permanent secretary at the education department, told
delegates that governing councils of the colleges would assume control of
their management - but core funding would come via an quango. He drew a
parallel with polytechnics, whose rapid expansion in the past two years was
stimulated by funding incentives.
The 418 further education colleges and 115 sixth-form colleges in England
and Wales are to be transferred from local authority administration next
spring.
'As independent institutions they (colleges) should be able to respond more
quickly and flexibly than before,' said Sir John. 'Colleges will have a
direct financial incentive to expand participation. Funding will include an
element directly related to student numbers.'

THE NEED to prevent legal proceedings over the Maxwell affair being put at
risk by publication of a report into the supervision of Maxwell companies
was emphasised by Mr John Major yesterday as he came under renewed pressure
to make the full findings public soon.
The Securities and Investments Board has received the report by Imro, the
investment management regulatory organisation, details of which have been
leaked over the past few days.
Challenged in the Commons by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, the prime

that 'the House will understand it will be essential to ensure that
publication does not in any way jeopardise either civil or criminal
proceedings in the Maxwell affair, including those currently underway
against Kevin and Ian Maxwell'.
Mr Kinnock argued that government involvement made publication a 'pressing
necessity'. He highlighted the decision by the Department of Trade and
Industry in 1988 to grant an investment licence to London and Bishopsgate
Investments after the Bank of England had blocked an attempt by Robert
Maxwell to take over a merchant bank.
'Is it not clear in these circumstances both the government and the system
it established have got a clear and serious charge of negligence to answer?'
he said.
MPs believe the role of the DTI in granting the original licence in 1988 is
critical to the extent of the responsibility government will have to take
for the plight of the Maxwell pensioners.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Pounds 460m needed to pay pension fund deficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MGN WILL have to pay Pounds 460m before tax into its pension fund over the
next 14 years in order to meet the deficiency left by the theft of assets
from the scheme, according to the company's annual report.
The accounts include a Pounds 193m provision for the cost of so-called
past-service liabilities of those who work or had worked for MGN before
Robert Maxwell's death.
The report details for the first time the cost of MGN's commitment to meet
all pension obligations after the theft of more than Pounds 200m from the
fund.
The report notes that contributions to the scheme will be 'at a
significantly reduced rate' for the first three years, but concludes that
contributions over a 14-year period represent a rate of payment
demonstrating 'a fair balance between the competing interests of the
company's shareholders, creditors, employees and pensioners'.
The cost of meeting pensions liabilities in respect of past service may take
longer than 14 years, the report says, largely because of new laws requiring
companies to increase pensions in line with inflation.
MGN had earlier announced revisions to its pensions schemes intended to
allow it to meet all obligations to present and former employees.
The first Pounds 20m of any of the missing money recovered will be used to
meet past-service liabilities. The government has confirmed its legal
obligation to meet guaranteed minimum payments to current pensioners.
An MGN executive said yesterday that the next Pounds 50m of assets recovered
by receivers are required to be refunded to the US in exchange for its
promise to meet guaranteed minimum payments for current employees and former
employees now working elsewhere. So far, the government has pledged Pounds
2.5m above its legal obligations to aid Maxwell pensioners who have lost all
or part of their pensions.
The chairman's report says MGN's duty to 'ensure the future viability of the
company' has forced it to remove some 4,000 members of its pension scheme
from a safety net for scheme members.
Those affected are mostly employees and pensioners of up to 80 companies
acquired by Robert Maxwell's British Printing &amp; Communication Corporation
who never worked for MGN but were transferred into the MGN scheme.
The accounts record a payment of Pounds 3.4m to cover the cost of providing
payments in full for those individuals until June 30, 1992. From July 1,
those people will have their pensions cut by 70 per cent.
Separately it has emerged that MGN has been asked to relinquish its control
of the pensions covering those individuals because of its refusal to
guarantee their pensions. Half the trustees including the chairman of the
Maxwell Communications Works Pension Scheme, whose members were transferred
to the MGN scheme, are executives of Mirror Group Newspapers, while half are
scheme members.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Anger over County Hall sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the prime minister, is set to intervene in the growing
controversy over the future of London's County Hall, amid expressions of
deep resentment by the Japanese purchaser of the site at the government's
continued failure to confirm the sale.
The cabinet is known to be divided on the sale. Several senior ministers -
including Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, and Mr John
Patten, education secretary - are believed to support consideration of the
bid by the London School of Economics (LSE) to take over the site.
A clause in the sale contract allows the government to withdraw at any time
until the end of this year. A cabinet committee last week reportedly decided
to allow the LSE to submit a full proposal to move to County Hall, the
former headquarters of the defunct Greater London Council, from its present
site in central London.
Mr Makoto Toyota, London representative of Shirayama, the Japanese property
developer, denied reports that the company had indicated its desire to
withdraw because of the controversy. But he added: 'The present situation is
totally exhausting. We are begging the British government to make clear its
intentions soon if we are to carry on.'
The LSE said last night it was pursuing its bid 'very seriously', and was
'confident' it could match Shirayama's bid for the building - believed to be
in the region of Pounds 60m.
Shirayama plans to turn County Hall into a hotel, retail and sports complex.
The LSE wishes to use it to combine a university campus with a social
science park with office space for applied research units.
The disposal of County Hall is formally the responsibility of the London
Residuary Body, which acts on behalf of the London boroughs. It is legally
obliged to accept the best price for its assets, but the government has the
power to override any deal.
More than 140 MPs have signed a cross-party Commons motion calling on the
government to delay the sale for there to be full consideration of the
suggestion that the LSE should move there. A Commons debate is planned later
this week. Support for the LSE was unanimous in a Lords debate earlier this
month.

FT  24 JUN 92 / MGN threatens legal action over transfers: Maxwell chief
named over Pounds 180m 'unusual' transactions; Annual report reveals
extraordinary losses of Pounds 421.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is
named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m
of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the
last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN
accounts yesterday.
Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell,
are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions. Mr
Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information, the
statement says.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, lists a series of transactions - some of
which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in
the past few months.
He says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations,
including Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, over more than Pounds 40m
in transfers from MGN if the bank was aware that they were 'effected for
improper purposes'.
Notes to the accounts show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of Pounds
421.5m in the year to December 29 1991, including Pounds 208.6m in pension
deficiencies and Pounds 122.4m in transactions with Maxwell-controlled
companies.
Sir Robert says that during the year there were at least 28 'unusual'
payments for more than Pounds 1m from the group's bank accounts, making a
total of more than Pounds 180m. 'Some may well ultimately be established to
have arisen under legitimate transactions.'
Nine of the payments were authorised solely by Robert Maxwell. The others
were authorised mainly by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Michael
Stoney, he says.
One transfer to Goldman Sachs was countersigned by Mr Ernest Burrington,
former managing director, at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the reported
instruction of Robert Maxwell. Two authorisations were countersigned by Mr
Lawrence Guest, former MGN finance director.
Sir Robert says the MGN directors do not believe that either Mr Burrington
or Mr Guest knew there was anything improper about these payments.
With these exceptions, 'the independent directors . . . were not involved
in, and did not authorise or approve any of these payments,' he says.
Sir Robert says the group finance department accepted assurances from the
treasury department - which was headed by Mr Stoney - about 'the nature of
certain transactions' including payments to financial institutions which
were recorded as deposits.
'The treasury department arranged for it to appear that sums of interest had
been credited to the group in respect of those 'deposits',' he says.
In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN
board:
Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related
party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors
for approval;
Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the
movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were
also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies;
The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed
systems and mandates, but was not convened;
The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the
treasury department's activities.
The report details a Pounds 50m loan made by Bankers Trust in London last
October which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from Bankers Trust
in New York to Robert Maxwell Group, parent of the Maxwell private
interests,
Separately, the statement highlights three transfers of more than Pounds 40m
from MGN to Goldman Sachs - Pounds 11m of this was transferred on Robert
Maxwell's signature to pay for previous dealings in Maxwell Communication
Corporation stock. The balance was for foreign exchange trade exposures
incurred by Bishopsgate Investment Trust and Robert Maxwell Group, it says.
He says MGN is inquiring to see whether it can establish if Goldman Sachs
was 'aware or should have been aware' that the transfers 'had been effected
for improper purposes'. If so, he says 'it will be possible to seek orders
against them . . . for the sums paid.'
He says MGN is considering legal action against professional advisers in
relation to property leases, and hopes to recover money through claims on
insurance policies written on Robert Maxwell's life.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD STEVENS, chairman of United Newspapers, yesterday settled a libel
action against The Guardian. He accepted a statement from the newspaper that
it did not intend to suggest he had concrete evidence about Robert Maxwell's
theft of Pounds 300m from the Mirror Group pension fund and had failed to
disclose it to regulatory bodies.
Mr Geoffrey Shaw QC said in the High Court that Lord Stevens considered that
an article in December gave the impression he had contributed to the huge
losses suffered by Mirror Group's pensioners.
He said the article had stated that regulators would want to question
individuals who appeared to have known of Maxwell's misappropriation of
funds. It commented that Lord Stevens would be among them.
Miss Jane Colston, The Guardian's solicitor, said the article was published
in good faith. The newspaper did not intend to suggest that Lord Stevens had
failed to disclose concrete evidence about Maxwell's misdeeds.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association, last night accused the BBC of
being little more than Mr Rupert Murdoch's poodle in the Pounds 300m Premier
League football deal.
Mr Dyke said that Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman, and Sir Michael
Checkland, director-general, had both contacted the Football Association to
say they would only do a deal for recorded highlights with British Sky
Broadcasting, in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a stake.
'Instantly they took more than Pounds 20m out of our bid and, in effect, it
was the BBC who decided that live Premier League football would not be
universally available,' the London Weekend Television chief executive told
the Royal Television Society.
'It was the BBC who made certain that anyone wanting to watch live Premier
League football next year would have to buy a dish and pay Pounds 5 a
month,' he added.
'BSkyB so needed the BBC they should be paying the BBC to carry the
football, certainly not the other way around,' added Mr Dyke. The
corporation's behaviour would make it difficult to argue that it supported
universality when re-negotiating its Royal Charter.
Mr Dyke said it was also time to review cross media ownership in the UK. If
nothing were done by the late 1990s Mr Murdoch could have 40 per cent of
Britain's national press and possibly the most profitable broadcasting
organisation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Stoney, 42, operated close to centre of the Maxwell empire. Like
Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell, he chose to remain silent when asked to
give evidence before the Commons social security select committee.
Before Mr Stoney resigned as deputy managing director (finance) of Mirror
Group Newspapers (MGN) in December last year, he had become one of Robert
Maxwell's most trusted lieutenants.
Mr Stoney, who became a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
1971, began climbing the Maxwell ladder after Maxwell Communication
Corporation (MCC) took over a stationery company where he was finance
director. He was promoted by Maxwell to deputy managing director in October,
over the head of Mr Lawrence Guest, the finance director, and without
consulting other directors.
In recent weeks he is understood to have been working from the offices of
Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm which is administrator of the private
Maxwell companies, assisting investigations.
Last night it emerged that Mr Stoney had been retained as a salaried
employee of Headington Investments by Arthur Andersen.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, one of the administrators, said Mr Stoney had been
retained since December. 'It was considered to be the most cost-effective
way to get to the bottom of a number of issues . . . his function is to
assist us in whatever way we determine,' he added.

FT  24 JUN 92 / NatWest agrees return of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank yesterday agreed to return voluntarily to the
Maxwell pension funds Pounds 25m of shares in Teva, an Israeli
pharmaceutical group, which were pledged as security for a Dollars 27.3m
loan.
The bank has also agreed to pay legal costs - believed to be about Pounds
100,000 - incurred in its tussle over ownership with Robson Rhodes,
liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the
Maxwell pension funds. Mr Neil Cooper, head of insolvency at Robson Rhodes,
said legal action to recover other shares from three foreign banks was
likely to take many months.
Agreement for the return of the Teva shares was delayed by NatWest's
requirement for Robson Rhodes to substantiate its claim of ownership. It was
also stalled by a counter-claim from Arthur Andersen, administrator to the
private Maxwell companies. Andersen believed it might own the Teva shares
because they were transferred through the Robert Maxwell Group, part of the
private empire, but the firm agreed last week to drop this claim.
NatWest said the shares were taken in good faith after written assurances
from the directors of the private Maxwell companies that the shares were
beneficially owned by Robert Maxwell Group.
Efforts to recover other parts of the estimated Pounds 448m in assets taken
from the Maxwell pension funds is likely to be considerably slower. Up to
half of these assets have been pledged as security against loans to Robert
Maxwell's private interests from three banks - Banque Nationale de Paris,
Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers.

BRITISH RAIL Pension Trustee Company, which manages Pounds 8bn in
pension-fund assets, has pledged to monitor more closely the management of
companies in which it has a significant stake.
The move is a sign of the growing restiveness among institutional investors,
who are demanding more information about companies they invest in and the
ability to effect management changes.
The BR fund - one of the largest in the public sector - is the first scheme
to announce a policy on corporate governance since the publication last
month of the Cadbury report urging wide-ranging reforms.
The BR scheme said: 'BRPTC's corporate governance policy has two main aims:
to support and promote efficient and effective equity markets and to protect
shareholder value.'
The policy calls on the scheme to vote on all resolutions placed before
company meetings.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Accounts show 'irregular' payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1991 accounts for the Mirror Group show extraordinary losses of Pounds
421.5m from a series of transactions which took place during the few months
up to the collapse of the Maxwell business empire late last year.
The most significant losses and provisions come from deficiencies in the
pension funds and a series of 'irregular transactions'.
Pounds 208.6m for pensions deficiency and related matters. Most comes from
the deficit in the pension funds, estimated at Pounds 192.9m. Deferred tax
of Pounds 62.3m and regular pension costs of Pounds 4m for 1991 reduce the
net provision to Pounds 126.6m.
A second charge of Pounds 10.9m reflects Pounds 16.3m in pension
pre-payments written off because of the misappropriations of assets, net of
Pounds 5.4m in tax.
A third item for Pounds 3.4m - or Pounds 2.3m after tax - is MGN's
commitment to meeting pensions of members of the Maxwell Communication Works
Pension Scheme, who were never employed in the MGN Group, up to June 30
1992.
Pounds 122.4m in losses associated with transactions with Maxwell-controlled
companies including a provision of Pounds 50m against advances from a loan
facility with Bankers Trust.
There is Pounds 48.8m accounted for as interest-bearing deposits with
financial institutions, including Pounds 38.8m with a Maxwell-controlled
company.
A further Pounds 17.1m remains outstanding from a CDollars 35m promissory
note receivable from Robert Maxwell Group, and provisions of Pounds 6.5m
against other balances with Maxwell-controlled companies.
Pounds 50m for extraordinary contingencies. Only two of the contingencies
are quantified: a Dollars 6.5m claim from an individual, believed to be Mr
Mark Booth, formerly the US-based chairman of Maxwell Entertainment Group;
and a claim of Pounds 800,000 from employees of the European newspaper under
contracts they claim were in the name of MGN companies. Pounds 46.4m in
'associated undertakings', including a provision of Pounds 22.2m resulting
from sales of MGN's interest in Donohue; a loss on the disposal of QPI, the
Canadian printing group, of Pounds 17.6m; and a Pounds 6.6m adjustment to
provide additional deferred tax under a change in Canadian tax law.
Pounds 42.6m, split between Pounds 20.5m in fees payable to MGN's advisers
and bankers arising from the default of the group and its restructuring, and
Pounds 22.1m to 'crystallise' potential liability under interest rate
transactions.
Pounds 14.4m in losses arising from a Pounds 200.4m forward foreign currency
contract apparently designed to hedge against servicing a loan in dollars.
This was entered into without consultation with the board.
Pounds 7.3m including a Pounds 4.4m provision against the balance of a loan
outstanding against an employee share ownership trust, Pounds 2.4m from
closure losses and costs of The Racing Times, and Pounds 500,000 in sundry
items.
There was a deferred tax credit of Pounds 70.2m.

FT  24 JUN 92 / World Trade News: US growers add Nafta to list of foes - A
look at conflicting interests and market perceptions beneath the free trade
banner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOODS, droughts, dust storms, and pestilence were once the natural
adversaries of the farmer. Now, says Mr Bobby McKown, a 55-year-old citrus
grower in central Florida, the enemy list is longer. It includes: water
controls, pesticide and fertiliser record-keeping, occupational safety
regulations, zoning limits, the Endangered Species Act.
Even worse, in Mr McKown's view, will be the North America Free Trade
Agreement, which he says threatens the existence of the Dollars 8bn Florida
citrus industry. Despite American advantages in technology and
infrastructure, Florida fruit and vegetable producers say they cannot
compete head-on with Mexico without import duties to compensate for higher
costs.
Florida expects to be the state hardest hit by the competition because its
growing season is virtually identical with Mexico's. Average farm wages in
Florida of Dollars 9.58 an hour compare unfavourably with Mexico's 35 cents
an hour.
The US is already the largest market for Mexican horticultural products, and
Mexico is the largest single foreign supplier in the market. particularly if
its quality is upgraded through American investment.
The agriculture talks in the Nafta have been contentious - officials still
disagree on timetables for tariff phase-outs on the most sensitive products.
Most items will become tariff-free either immediately or within 10 years.
The most sensitive may have a 15-20 year phase-out period.
Last week, the Mexican farm talks were reportedly stalled. Not only are
there considerations of products and trade flows on the table, but there are
environmental, economic and social concerns.
Mr McKown, a member of the US trade representative's influential agriculture
policy advisory committee, is hoping that Florida's produce will excluded
from the Nafta. But negotiators have found that once one country asks to
remove a sector from the table, the other threatens to remove one of its.
(Canada is expected to conclude a separate agreement with Mexico and
maintain the current free trade agreement rules for agriculture with the
US.)
Although Mexican horticulture exports to the US are almost nine times more
than the reverse, the US industry sees Mexico as its fastest growing fruit
and vegetable market.
However, Ms Jodean Bens, manager of international trade for the United Fresh
Fruit and Vegetable Association, says the safeguards against import surges
must take into consideration both volume and price factors. The US industry
needs a dispute settlement which works swiftly, before produce spoils.
But none of this will satisfy the Florida industry. Mr Bob Crawford, state
agriculture commissioner, warned in May that thousands of jobs would vanish
in the sugar and vegetable region, in tomato production and the citrus
industry.

FT  24 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Mexican farmers loath to abandon land
fight - A look at conflicting interests and market perceptions beneath the
free trade banner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARGARITO Montes, leader of the Popular Farmers' and Workers' General Union,
represents the new hope of Mexican agriculture. A rabble-raising populist,
Mr Montes became famous by invoking the spirit of Emiliano Zapata, Mexico's
revolutionary peasant leader, and forcibly taking land from the government
and rich land-owners.
Now Mr Montes is the very picture of modernity. He supports free trade with
the US, the government's market-orientated agricultural reforms, and has
renounced his membership of the leftish Party of Democratic Revolution. His
union is now participating in a Dollars 100m dairy farm project with
Canadian investors.
Mr Montes has been rewarded handsomely for his conversion, with his union
receiving considerable government support to set up the dairy project in
Veracruz.
But for Mexico's agriculture ministry it is worth the effort. If Mexico is
to compete with the US and Canada under free trade, peasant leaders will
have to stop fighting for land, and start investing in it.
Without substantial investment in agriculture, Mexico cannot hope to compete
with the US and Canada. As a result of decades of land invasions, permanent
agrarian reform, and legally-enshrined communal property rights, most
Mexican farms are under-capitalised, and too small to be productive.
The agricultural sector accounts for just 3 per cent of commercial loans,
but employs 25 per cent of the work-force. The typical size of a maize plot
is 3.9 hectares, against 39.9 in the US.
Mexico is particularly vulnerable in maize, where yield per hectare is just
1.9 tonnes, compared to 7.4 in the US. Mexico has protected its roughly 2m
maize farmers by restricting imports, so that Mexican maize prices are
double those in the US.
Under a free trade agreement it is probable that protection will be removed
over 15 years, with tariffs being lowered and quotas increased over this
period.
Most of these maize farmers are already extremely poor and a fall in maize
prices will force many to leave their farms.
Enter Mr Margarito Montes. The government hopes that joint ventures such his
union's in Veracruz with Ault Food of Canada will become a model of
enterprise between peasants and the private sector, and soak up the
displaced maize farmers.
At the end of May some 140 joint ventures had been formed between the
business groups and small property owners or ejidatarios (common property
owners), in wheat, vegetable, and poultry production, among other areas.
Not everyone is convinced that Mexico's agricultural sector will enter the
first world as quickly as the government would like.
Mr Montes still ends his speeches with 'Viva Zapata', thus bowing to the
revolutionary leader. His followers respond enthusiastically, and, when
asked, expect to be handed out land soon.

FT  24 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Kohl seen as key to Gatt breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN trade negotiators were in intensive telephone contact yesterday,
seeking a compromise that will allow the long-blocked Uruguay Round of talks
on world trade liberalisation to be settled before the Group of Seven summit
in Munich, now two weeks away.
'I think there is a deal there,' one official said. 'It would be
catastrophic if it does not succeed.' Negotiators agreed that the position
of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl was crucial.
Meanwhile, international business leaders last night met Mr Kohl in Bonn to
protest that the credibility of the G7 industrial nations had been stretched
to the limit by its repeated empty commitments to settle the Uruguay Round -
and could be stretched no further.
Representatives of the International Chambers of Commerce (ICC), who met the
German leader, insisted that a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
was 'crucial and urgent'. 'Nowhere has the inadequacy of political
leadership (in the G7) been more evident in recent years than in the Uruguay
Round,' they said.
The Uruguay Round has been stalled for 18 months by a dispute between the US
and the European Community on liberalisation of farm trade. Leaders at two
previous G7 summits have called for settlement of the Round, but without
effect.
Negotiators in several European capitals said yesterday that intensive
efforts were under way to formulate proposals that could be presented to the
US, perhaps next week. Mr James Baker, the US Secretary of State, is
understood to be ready to meet Community foreign ministers.
Two issues continue to block agreement. First is an EC demand - backed
strongly by Bonn - that compensation to be paid to farmers for cutting
output and setting land aside should be accepted by the US as not distorting
to trade. The German government is being pressed to compromise here.
The second is the Uruguay Round proposal that the volume of subsidised
exports be cut by 24 per cent. The EC's preferred compromise is that the
Community should be allowed flexibility to cut the volume of subsidised
cereal exports more deeply than 24 per cent, in order that more sensitive
subsidised exports - in particular meat and dairy products - could be cut
less deeply.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Clinton sets tax sights on foreign companies: The
presidential hopeful's new economic plan selects a tempting target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN companies have always been a tempting target for US politicians
seeking to raise new revenues without taxing their voters more heavily.
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic party's presumptive presidential
candidate, has now joined the chorus of politicians who claim foreign
companies evade US taxes by distorting the transfer prices at which they
ship goods to their subsidiaries in America.
In his new economic programme, Mr Clinton says he wants to raise Dollars
45bn (Pounds 24.3bn) over the next four years by 'cracking down on foreign
companies that prosper here and manipulate tax laws to their advantage'.
His proposals on transfer pricing echo those contained in a bill submitted
jointly by Mr Dan Rostenkowski and Mr Bill Gradison, the Democratic and
Republican leaders of the House of Representatives ways and means committee.
The changes set out by Mr Rostenkowski and Mr Gradison are designed to pay
for some Dollars 11bn of tax breaks for US-based multinational companies,
but also play along with a strong current of congressional hostility to
foreign, especially Japanese, companies.
The measures have provoked fierce international opposition both because of
the additional tax burden they would create for some foreign companies, and
because in several instances they conflict with the US's bilateral tax
treaties.
Mr Rostenkowski and Mr Gradison have made it clear they do not plan to bring
their bill forward in the current session of Congress, but they intend to
gauge the degree of support or opposition to individual components to help
them put together a package next year. With Mr Clinton signing on, foreign
companies are even more concerned that these measures could be carried in
the next Congress.
Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador to the US, has complained to Mr
Nicholas Brady, Treasury secretary, about the Rostenkowski-Gradison
proposals, and warned they could, if passed, lead to pressure for
retaliation. Other European countries have also registered their objections
with Treasury tax policy officials.
The Rostenkowski-Gradison bill proposes to tax foreign-owned companies
operating in the US as if their profit margin on gross receipts were at
least three quarters of the industry average, regardless of whether or not
they in fact made a profit. This measure is prompted by congressional
suspicions that foreign companies artificially lower their US profits by
manipulating transfer prices with their subsidiaries.
The transfer pricing measure has possibly aroused the most vigorous
opposition from foreign companies and governments.
The German parliament's finance committee has already taken issue with
current US treatment of transfer pricing - which many tax professionals
complain operates under the scarcely veiled assumption that all foreign
companies are out to cheat the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and ignores
differences in profitability between a company which actually produces and
sells goods and one which merely acts as an importing conduit, without
itself adding any value. Companies would lose at both ends as most countries
would not allow them to deduct tax levied by the US on their hypothetical
profits.
The real purpose of the measure, however, is to coerce companies into
negotiating transfer pricing arrangements with the IRS.
Congressman Duncan Hunter of California has led the assault on foreign
corporations. On the intellectually dubious grounds that all companies ought
to be making a profit of at least 9 per cent on assets - or else they would
not bother to invest in the US - he claims foreign companies are cheating
the US Treasury of more than Dollars 30bn a year.
Mrs Shirley Peterson, IRS commissioner, is more circumspect; although she
says there may be some income shifting, she estimates the maximum tax loss
at Dollars 3bn.
Other measures in the Rostenkowski-Gradison package, however, are also
provoking international annoyance.
They include:
Excise taxes levied on reinsurance premiums paid to a foreign company to be
raised from 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and new compliance rules to be
imposed.
Benefits under a US tax treaty with another country to be limited to
qualified residents of that country. For example, a UK company with Dutch
ownership would not be allowed to claim zero withholding under the UK-US tax
treaty.
The US has written a similar limitation of benefits clause into some
bilateral treaties it has recently renegotiated, but this measure would
impose the limitation regardless of what the treaty said.
Foreigners who hold 10 per cent or more of the stock of a US corporation to
be taxed in the US on the capital gain, if they sell the stake. This clause,
however, would not override any bilateral treaty provisions.
The reinsurance excise tax proposal is causing particular concern to British
companies as, in current practice, they are exempt from the levy. 'I think
it's going to hit hardest at Lloyd's,' said Mr Bruce Lassman, head of US tax
affairs at accountants Ernst and Young in London.
Overseas governments, on the other hand, are more irritated by what they see
as politicians' latest attempts to milk foreign companies because they
influence fewer votes.
'Every year it's the same. Because of their domestic problems, they cannot
find revenue raisers without alienating one lobby or another, so they hit on
the foreign companies,' complained a Washington-based diplomat.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Industrial disputes could trigger US rail chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US rail system was braced yesterday for possible coast-to-coast
industrial action which could bring chaos to both freight and passenger
services. Talks between rail unions and operators were continuing up to a
midnight deadline yesterday.
Amtrak, which runs passenger services across the US, had already cancelled
about 50 overnight runs, to prevent passengers being stranded.
It was also refusing to take long-distance reservations for today and
tomorrow and negotiating stand-by arrangements with bus companies and
airlines. Greyhound, the largest long-distance bus operator, said it had
agreed to accept Amtrak tickets on all routes, while special arrangements
had also been made between Amtrak and USAir.
At issue are three separate union-management negotiations, all attempting to
establish new labour contracts. The first centres on talks between the
International Association of Machinists and the freight railroad industry
generally; the second concerns Conrail, one of the largest freight operators
and its track workers; the third involves Amtrak and half a dozen unions.
Late last night Amtrak announced it had reached agreement with two unions
but said it was still negotiating with the other four.
If strike action is called it is unclear whether it would occur in all three
disputes, or just one. A strike by the IAM against the freight operators
would be the most damaging.
However, Conrail alone serves 14 states and about half the freight moved in
the US starts or ends on Conrail track. A strike against Amtrak would badly
disrupt commuter traffic in metropolitan areas on the east coast - such as
Boston and New York.
Congress has special powers over the rail industry which allow it to enforce
labour settlements - authority it has used as recently as last year. Union
supporters allege that the railroad operators are anxious to incite strike
action in order to drag Congress into the dispute.
It is likely Congress will step in if a strike is called. President George
Bush has met Mr Andrew Card, the new transport secretary, and both signalled
that the administration was poised to pressure Congress to intervene.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Labour surgeson Israeli tide of discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Israel television announced a few minutes after 10pm last night that
its widely trusted election exit poll was predicting a big victory for the
opposition Labour party, there was an explosion of emotion among party
workers gathered at their headquarters in Tel Aviv.
'We have been waiting for this moment for 15 years,' proclaimed Mr Chaim
Ramon, a senior Labour MP, as party officials cheered, embraced and danced
around him.
Labour has indeed been struggling since 1977 to recapture its position as
the country's premier political force which it occupied, often complacently,
for the first three decades of Israel's existence as a state. Then it was
cast into opposition by the forces of Israel's ideological right wing,
united under the banner of the Likud party and led by the charismatic
Menachem Begin.
Although in 1984 and 1988, Labour managed to claw its way back into
government in coalition with the Likud, it had acquired the stigma of a
force whose time had passed. The Likud, with its commitment to hold on
forever to the occupied territories - the Land of Israel - increasingly saw
itself as the natural party of government.
The tide began to turn early this year when Labour, in a ballot of all its
members, replaced Mr Shimon Peres as leader with Mr Yitzhak Rabin. Where Mr
Peres was widely seen as a cerebral politician over-prone to intrigue and
'soft' towards the Arabs, Mr Rabin had a no-nonsense image that in Israel is
invaluable. He was chief of staff in the triumphant 1967 Six Day War and the
defence minister who in 1988 promised to 'break the bones' of Palestinians
rebelling in the intifada.
Coming from Mr Rabin, the Labour message that it was safe for Israel to
abandon Likud's ideological commitment to the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
make peace on the basis of territorial concessions suddenly sounded more
reasonable.
Labour also benefited from abject Likud incompetence. Under Mr Yitzhak
Shamir's diffident leadership, the Likud had lapsed into vicious and public
intra-party feuding. It also presided over a prolonged period of economic
stagnation the effects of which were sharpened by the flood of immigration
from the former Soviet Union which engulfed the country from 1989.
But Labour under Mr Rabin may yet prove to be a conservative force. He
accepts the need to trade 'land for peace' - the formula demanded by the
Arabs and backed by the US as the basis of a Middle East peace settlement.
But Mr Rabin is against a Palestinian state and opposes giving up large
parts of the West Bank, the Golan Heights and all of East Jerusalem.
Domestically, Labour on paper accepts that the still state-dominated economy
needs a radical dose of reform. But it remains closely allied to the
Histadrut trade union federation which is deeply resistant to many of the
liberalisation programmes, particularly in the labour market, which the vast
majority of economists say Israel must embrace in order to generate the
growth needed to absorb the burden of immigration.
The euphoria sweeping through the party last night was partly an expression
of relief that it had proved wrong the doomsayers who said its time had
passed. But it has much work to do to prove that it is truly the party of
Israel's future.
Of the 3.4m eligible voters, more than 500,000 cast ballots for the first
time.
About 394,000 eligible voters are Israeli Arabs.
The 1.75m West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians are ineligible to vote. Most
of the 150,000 Arabs of East Jerusalem who refused Israeli citizenship are
also disqualified.
Voters choose only one of 25 parties contesting the 120 Knesset seats.
Electoral rules say a party must receive 1.5 per cent of the vote to qualify
for a seat in parliament. Those that qualify split the 120 seats based on
the number of votes they receive.
Israeli MPs do not represent any geographical constituency.

LIBYA'S General People's Congress (parliament) said yesterdaythat two
Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of the Pan-Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, could be tried in a 'just and fair' court, in a decision that
could open the door for the two to be tried in the west, Reuter reports.
Britain reacted with scepticism. The Foreign Office said Libya had in the
past made several offers, but Britain wanted action not words.
'The bottom line is what the Libyans do, not what they say,' an official
said.
Britain and the US, backed by the United Nations, have demanded that the two
men be handed over for trial in Scotland or the US.

THE Hong Kong stock exchange corruption trial ended dramatically yesterday
when the seven men charged were found not guilty after nearly two days of
deliberation by the jury.
The High Court trial, which sprang from investigations into the conduct of
Mr Ronald Li, the former head of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, casts doubt
over similar charges to which Mr Li last year pleaded guilty.
It is unclear whether the verdict will affect the four-year prison sentence
he received in October 1990 for soliciting preferential allocations of
shares in companies due to be listed on the exchange.
In the trial just ended, six defendants were charged with accepting or
soliciting preferential allocations of shares.
The decision follows an Appeal Court ruling removing the offence of unlawful
possession from the colony's law.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Seeking Australia's driving seat: A look at the progress of
opposition leader John Hewson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK AN Australian what he knows about Mr John Hewson, leader of the
conservative opposition, and the answer will usually come in two parts: he
drives a Ferrari, and he thinks he can win a federal election by promising
to introduce a new tax.
It is an image which has been ruthlessly exploited by Mr Paul Keating, the
embattled Labor prime minister, who never misses an opportunity to depict Mr
Hewson as a rich dilettante who wants to raise taxes for ordinary people.
Yet Australians are becoming increasingly aware that there is more to Mr
Hewson than meets the eye. For one thing he seems a bit eccentric: he
doesn't so much drive a Ferrari as keep one in his garage, mainly because he
admires the marque's sense of style and engineering efficiency. Mr Keating,
himself a wealthy man, has a similar passion for French Second Empire
clocks.
Mr Hewson hails from the same working class suburbs in western Sydney as Mr
Keating. Unlike the prime minister, who left school at 14 and graduated to
Labor politics via a pop group, Mr Hewson gained a PhD in economics and
worked as a university teacher and merchant banker before entering
parliament. However, it is his decision to commit the opposition to the
introduction of a 15 per cent goods and services tax (GST), modelled on a
European-style value added tax, which has attracted the heaviest fire from
the government artillery.
Mr Keating's portrait of a callous opposition leader unable to grasp the
human impact of his computer-driven economics has had some effect, even
though the prime minister's credibility is reduced by his own failed attempt
to introduce such a tax in 1985.
Why, many wonder, did Mr Hewson not simply sit back and wait for Labor's
tired and dispirited government to collapse?
The answer seems to be in two parts. First, although Labor appeared to be in
deep trouble at the end of last year, there was no guarantee that the
government would continue to fade until the election, which must be held by
next June.
The conservatives lost the last election in 1990 in spite of being widely
expected to win, and a negative strategy could have allowed that to happen
again. Indeed, Labor's chances have improved since Mr Keating replaced Mr
Bob Hawke as prime minister in December.
Mr Hewson, who leads the urban-based Liberal Party, also has to bear in mind
the capacity of the National Party, his rural-based coalition partner, to
self-destruct under pressure. National Party indiscipline cost the
conservatives the 1987 election, when Sir Jo Bjelke-Petersen, the former
Queensland premier, split the vote by mounting an independent campaign.
Furthermore, Mr Hewson was convinced when he took over as opposition leader
in 1990 that voters were sick of the conservatives' opportunistic changes of
policy since the coalition lost power in 1983. In 1990, for example, voters
went to the polls unsure what opposition policy was in the important areas
of health and industrial relations. The result was 'Fightback]', a
comprehensive policy statement which deliberately commits a coalition
government to a detailed programme which leaves little room for doubt about
what the conservatives represent.
Under the coalition, protective tariffs would be virtually eliminated, the
centralised industrial relations system would be abandoned in favour of
collective bargaining, the government would close or privatise most of its
commercial activities, and tax reform would switch the emphasis from direct
to indirect taxes.
The coalition would also promote the development of Australia's mineral
assets, one of its main areas of comparative advantage, by reducing the
delaying power of environmental and Aboriginal heritage lobbies, and
removing restrictions on uranium mining. At the macro-economic level, there
would be moves towards an independent central bank in an attempt to lock in
low inflation. It adds up to a radical shift to the free market which would
speed up and extend the tentative moves away from protection and regulation.
Mr Hewson describes 'Fightback]' as an attempt to address interrelated
issues comprehensively, rather than through the piecemeal initiatives which
have characterised much of Labor policy-making.
'It is radical, but people have very widely accepted that there is a need
for a pretty comprehensive change in Australia,' he says.
'I have always believed that good economics is good politics, and that if
you advocate the right policies it is very hard to knock them over.'
Nevertheless, Mr Hewson is painfully aware that the package stands or falls
on his ability to communicate the core message that the GST element is
essential, and that voters will be compensated. He says there is widespread
understanding that direct taxes will be reduced for most taxpayers, while
the coalition will also abolish seven existing indirect taxes, including
payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and petroleum excise tax.
The opinion polls appear to bear out this interpretation. Labor has
recovered strongly since Mr Keating took over as prime minister but has been
unable to shake the coalition's lead.
Hearteningly for Mr Hewson, support for Labor has declined recently in the
face of corruption allegations and slower economic growth.
'Fightback]' has already claimed the significant scalp of Mr Hawke, who was
ousted because of his failure to respond convincingly to the coalition
challenge. Mr Keating has proved a harder nut for the opposition to crack,
but Mr Hewson affects a growing confidence that it can be done. 'People
think Hewson has a plan for Australia, and that is what they want,' he says.
'Keating is running scared because he knows that we have the policies to do
the job. All you get with Keating is a lot of colour.'

   DAGOMYS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE and Russia yesterday ended months of tension with a decision to draw
up a treaty normalising their relations and an agreement, in principle, on
the division of the contested Black Sea fleet.
The summit meeting of Mr Boris Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, held
yesterday in the Black Sea resort of Dagomys, was the first to be held by
the Russian and Ukrainian presidents since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
It follows a long-running dispute over the fleet and Ukrainian fears of
Russian domination.
However, in a notably friendly atmosphere, the presidents vowed to work
towards a broad political treaty that would entrench a new bilateral
relationship. This was in sharp contrast to the CIS meetings, which have
been characterised by friction and disagreement between the two states.
The presidents agreed, in principle, that the Black Sea fleet should be
divided between the two states, in shares to be agreed, and that ports would
be jointly used and maintained.
As Mr Kravchuk pointed out, this decision, which still leaves the prickliest
problem of the actual division unresolved, marks a change in that it cuts
the Commonwealth of Independent States' military structure out of the
negotiations.
Despite the two presidents' assertions that the CIS will not perish,
bilateral Russian-Ukrainian meetings, which are to become regular events,
seem likely to replace the CIS as the arena in which disputes between the
two largest former Soviet republics are resolved.
Headway was also made on the economic front, with agreement reached on a
mechanism for the introduction of a separate Ukrainian currency and a quid
pro quo shift to world trade prices.
However, the two Slavic giants skirted around other more contentious
political disputes, such as the Crimea.

   BENDERY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN their armoured personnel carrier was disabled in the bloody fighting in
Bendery, eastern Moldova, which claimed hundreds of lives over the weekend,
Sergei, Slava and Sasha replaced it more casually than American teenagers
getting a new set of wheels after a car accident.
'We just went to the 59th Division of the 14th Army, spoke with the local
commander and he gave us this baby,' said 21-year-old Sergei Zubkov, a
fighter with the Trans Dnestr forces who are attempting to break away from
Moldova and have won the help of the Russian army.
'The commander and the boys of the 59th Division all know us, so they gave
us a new APC,' he said, proudly banging the coffee-coloured metal sides of
the vehicle he now drives.
Like many young men driving powerful new machines, Mr Zubkov is only too
happy to offer admirers a lift.
Racing with him across the bridge over the Dnestr river - the most important
strategic point in the region - is an oddly cheerful experience.
The boys generously offer a nibble of their food or a drag of the cigarettes
they smoke in complete disregard for the brand new ammunition stacked high
inside their carrier and present a few bullets as souvenirs.
The scene appeared to turn ugly when the APC pulled up to the bullet-ridden
city council building in Bendery, which is at the heart of the bloody battle
between the Slavic separatists and the forces of Moldova, whose population
is of predominantly ethnic Romanian origin.
A square-jawed man toting a machine-gun emerged to provide cover against
Moldovan snipers.
He turned out to be Mr Viacheslav Kogut, the mayor, and offered to talk for
10 minutes 'because then the next attack is due to start'.
Huddled in a crowded basement room where stockpiles of increasingly scarce
bread vied for space with bandages, Mr Kogut's answers were peppered with
grim questions from his assistants.
What to do with the hundreds of corpses rotting in the streets?
Bury them, was the no-nonsense answer.
A desperate woman called wondering how to flee the city. 'Walk across the
bridge like everyone else,' snapped the mayor, then slammed down the
receiver and launched into a diatribe on the ways in which the Soviet regime
had deprived its citizens of individual initiative.
The interview came to an abrupt halt when a fresh attack forced the building
to be evacuated.
Sergei, Slava and Sasha were gone. But, more readily than a taxi in downtown
London, two young drivers of another APC volunteered to drive back across
the river.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Refreshing parts of Europe that are out of reach: Dutch
brewery chief campaigns for a federal 'Eurotopia' divided into 75 states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Freddie Heineken, the eponymous chairman of the Dutch brewery group, has
come up with a plan to refresh parts of Europe many politicians can't reach,
writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
He is trying to persuade Europe to convert itself into a federation of 75
states, each with a population of no more than 10m people. 'Eurotopia', as
Mr Heineken calls his plan, would be modelled loosely on the US and involve
the break-up of most big countries into more manageable parts.
France would be split up into seven states, including a state of
'Ile-de-France' for the Paris region.
The British Isles would be dissolved into 10 states. The new state of
'Mercia', with Birmingham as its capital, would take its name from an early
medieval kingdom. Greater London would form the nucleus of the state of
'Essex'. More controversially, the UK province of Northern Ireland would
join the Irish Republic.
Mr Heineken, the flamboyant industrialist for whom a ransom of Pounds 7.2m
was paid after he was kidnapped in 1983, has a flair for marketing and
advertising. He concedes that his ideas, contained in a 17-page report
published yesterday, are bound to be met with amazement. But the time has
come to rethink Europe.
'The present set-up of nations is in many ways just as arbitrary as my ideas
may seem,' he writes. 'Not only in Yugoslavia do we see movements for
independence, but also in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Catalonian regions, the
Basque country, Middle Europe and so on.'
The Heineken group, which Mr Heineken ran until he retired to the
supervisory board in 1989, is used to thinking of Europe in terms other than
that of the nation state. The company has traditionally differentiated
between the beer-drinking culture of the north and the wine-drinking belt of
the Mediterranean south, where it invested heavily in the 1980s.
The only areas to emerge whole from Mr Heineken's reshaping of Europe are
Portugal and the Nordic countries. Even the Netherlands, with its population
of 15m, would be split in two.
The 75 states in 'Eurotopia' should form a federation with common foreign,
defence and monetary policies, Mr Heineken says. Tiny Monaco and
Liechtenstein would 'be non-voting member-states of the new Europe, not
unlike the District of Columbia in the United States.'
He acknowledges that details - such as the future of royalty - need to be
worked out: 'There is even scope to reassign some royal families presently
without a formal role to be heads of newly formed regions,' he says, citing
the states of 'Hannover,' 'Burgundy' and Navarre-Aragon

FT  24 JUN 92 / Bonn interest rate cut hopes dashed

MONEY supply growth in Germany continued to be higher than hoped again last
month suggesting a further delay in any moves to relax the Bundesbank's high
interest rate policy.
A provisional figure of 9 per cent for the M3 broad measure for May was
announced yesterday, causing consternation among economists and market
analysts. This compares with April's corrected 8.9 per cent.
The central bank blamed unusually strong growth in cash in circulation, in
fixed-term deposits and continued strong growth in bank credit.
The figure leaves the main money supply measure, used as the key indicator
of monetary stability in the German economy, well outside the 'target
corridor' of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent growth fixed by the Bundesbank for 1992.
David Waller adds from Frankfurt: Yesterday's money supply figures led to a
sharp drop in German government bond and bond future prices, with yields on
the benchmark 10-year Bund climbing 4 basis points to 8.08 per cent.
Expectations had been for a further slowdown in monetary growth from the
high point of 9.4 per cent in March.

FT  24 JUN 92 / French clear Maastricht treaty hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday scored an important victory when
parliament voted overwhelmingly to change the French constitution as the
first step towards ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union.
The vote passed off without disruption after farmers called off an attempt
to blockade roads around Paris in protest at EC agricultural reforms which
will lead to sharp cuts in farm prices. The radical farmers' group
Co-ordination Rurale accused riot police of using 'brutal' tactics to remove
the roadblocks.
The decisive 592-73 vote by a joint parliamentary session at Versailles will
be an important morale booster for Mr Mitterrand at the European Community
summit in Lisbon at the end of this week. It may help offset the
psychological effect of Danish rejection of the treaty earlier this month.
Ratification itself will be subject to a popular referendum in the autumn,
but the size of yesterday's parliamentary majority suggests that most of the
mainstream parties on the left and the centre-right will campaign for a Yes
vote.
Only two political groups expressed systematic opposition to the
constitutional revision: almost all the Communists voted against the
revision; almost all the Gaullists refused to take part.
The Gaullists, deeply divided between those who are sceptical about the EC
and those who are totally hostile to the Maastricht treaty, saved the
appearance of party unity by walking out of the parliamentary session. They
declared there was no case for a constitutional revision, since the Danish
No vote had made the treaty null and void.
In practice, the Gaullist walk-out only magnified the scale of the
government majority, which far exceeded the minimum three-fifths majority
required. 'We must not miss our rendezvous,' said Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime
minister, when he opened the special session of the two houses of parliament
in Versailles. 'Europe is union, and union is strength.'
The most significant symbolic innovation introduced by the vote is that the
EC is now part of the French constitution, in a chapter entitled: 'Of the
European communities and of European union.'
The most important substantive changes are provisions allowing France to
take part in economic and monetary union, admitting that French visa policy
may be subject to majority voting in the Community, and permitting EC
citizens resident in France to take part in French local elections.
The government has had to make two significant concessions to the
conservative opposition parties. Voting in local elections will be a
possibility, but not a right; and the French parliament will have increased
rights to scrutinise Community legislation before the French government
agrees to it.

FT  24 JUN 92 / ANC sets terms to restart talks
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress last night broke off constitutional talks with
the South African government, accusing it of bringing the country to 'the
brink of disaster'.
The ANC made clear, however, that it wished to keep the negotiating process
alive. Many of the conditions set for the resumption of talks can readily be
fulfilled by the government and seemed calculated to strike a balance
between responding to black anger while not closing the door on a negotiated
settlement.
A statement issued after a day-long meeting of the ANC executive said there
was 'no option but to break off negotiations'.
The main demands attached to a resumption of talks include an international
inquiry into the massacre of 42 people in Boipatong, an end to security
forces' 'covert operations', prosecution of security personnel involved in
violence, phasing out of township hostels, and a ban on carrrying dangerous
weapons in public.
The ANC declared next Monday a day of mourning to mark the Boipatong
killings. 'The response and practical steps taken by the de Klerk regime
will play a critical role in determining the direction and speed with which
negotiations can take place', said Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of
the ANC, reading out the statement at a Johannesburg press conference.
ANC officials said they would continue to prepare the ground for 'mass
action', such as strikes and demonstrations.
The ANC renewed its demand for the creation of a constituent assembly to
draft a new constitution and for the establishment of an interim government.
The ANC decision brings to a halt, constitutional negotiations under the
auspices of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), a
multi-party forum whose second round of discussions ended in deadlock last
month.
A government response is not expected until after today's cabinet meeting in
Pretoria. President F W de Klerk was due back in South Africa last night
after cutting short his visit to Spain.
At a press conference in Madrid before the ANC statement, Mr de Klerk
criticised the organisation's irresponsible attitude in recent township
violence.
He said: 'To stage mass action and protest under such volatile
circumstances. . . adds fuel to the fire and can easily erupt into
violence.'
'While there is every hope progress can be made with negotiations, it is
extremely unwise and borders on the irresponsible to create an atmosphere of
greater tension and volatility.'

FT  24 JUN 92 / MGN was hit by fraudulent collusion says chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR Group Newspapers and its pension funds were hit by 'fraudulent
collusion' by a group of senior individuals, Sir Robert Clark, chairman of
the newspaper group, said yesterday.
The blunt statement came as Sir Robert was explaining to shareholders for
the first time what had happened since the flotation of the company in May
1991, the death of Robert Maxwell in November and the rapid collapse of the
Maxwell empire. MGN, whose main titles are the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror
and the People, made an attributable loss of Pounds 388.2m in 1991. Its
pre-tax profit was Pounds 50.1m, but there were extraordinary losses of
Pounds 421.5m net of tax.
The MGN chairman detailed at least 28 'unusual' payments of more than Pounds
1m each last year from the group's bank accounts. The effect appeared to
have been to benefit Maxwell controlled companies at the expense of MGN and
its pension funds.
The board accepts, Sir Robert said, that there were weaknesses in MGN's
internal controls. 'However, no system of internal control can protect a
company against fraudulent collusion.'
'Ultimately the losses sustained by MGN can be attributed to collusion by a
group of senior individuals, directors and officers who acted fraudulently
and in secrecy. At the time, the directors did not have firm evidence to
doubt the honesty of those individuals.'
Asked to whom he was referring, Sir Robert said he could not go further for
legal reasons.
The chairman's 96-page review and accounts for the year to December 29 last
year goes into detail about some 'unusual transactions' - not necessarily
illegal - and the provisions made for extraordinary losses.
It says that nine of the 28 unusual payments, which together totalled Pounds
180m, were authorised by Maxwell alone with the others being authorised by
more than one person. 'The persons involved were primarily Kevin Maxwell,
who was not then a director of the company (MGN), Ian Maxwell and Michael
Stoney,' Sir Robert said in his review. Mr Michael Stoney was deputy
managing director (finance) of MGN until December last year.
The unusual transactions included a Pounds 50m loan from Bankers Trust for
MGN which did not come to the company but appears to have paid another
Maxwell group debt to the US bank.
Sir Robert said the extraordinary loss of Pounds 421.5m was principally
caused by the misappropriation of assets from MGN and its pension funds and
the insolvency of companies controlled by Maxwell.
The largest single item is an estimated Pounds 193m pension fund deficit
which the company has agreed to put right over the next 14 years - with
specially low payments for the first three years.
In contrast with the enormous losses, Sir Robert said MGN was trading
strongly and increasing its share of circulation in the popular newspaper
market.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Labour party set for victory in Israeli elections: Clear win
for Rabin would provide shot in arm for sluggish peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S Labour party was set for a stunning general election victory over
the hardline Likud early today, paving the way for Mr Yitzhak Rabin to take
over as prime minister and implement his promise to accelerate Middle East
peace negotiations.
With 25 per cent of the votes counted, Israeli television projected that
Labour would emerge as the biggest single party by a wide margin, winning 45
of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or parliament. Likud, led by Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, was set to win 32 seats.
The projections, broadly in line with an earlier TV exit poll, signalled the
biggest swing in Israeli politics since Likud came to power in 1977
proclaiming its rightwing ideology. The outcome represented a personal
triumph for Mr Rabin, prime minister in the mid-1970s, and a disaster for Mr
Shamir. Labour supporters took to the streets, cheering and dancing in
celebration.
The main question remaining was which parties Mr Rabin would turn to in an
attempt to form a majority coalition government.
Early projections suggested he would have the option of joining forces with
Meretz, an alliance of leftwing and pro-peace parties, with backing outside
the government from two small Arab parties. Meretz was forecast to win 12
seats and the Arab parties five.
But Mr Rabin signalled that he would prefer a broader-based government,
possibly even including Likud. He said: 'We'll aspire to a coalition which
will express the mainstream of the people . . . we will want to include all
the forces which identify with our way - the advancement of peace while
maintaining security.'
Mr Shamir, 76, is now likely to come under strong pressure to step down as
party leader. But he was defiant, saying: 'Tonight, all over the world and
in the Middle East, people are rejoicing (that the Likud has fallen). I say
to them your happiness is premature, the Likud is not going down. It is
alive and well and will continue its just struggle.'
A victory of the scale forecast would be a resounding endorsement of Mr
Rabin, who took over as Labour leader from Mr Shimon Peres earlier this
year.
The main consequence of a clear Labour victory may be a boost for the peace
process. Mr Shamir had refused to yield any of the occupied territories in
return for peace and appeared lukewarm on conceding the initial stage of
Palestinian autonomy. Mr Rabin and Labour are committed to giving up at
least some of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. They are willing to
move quickly to an autonomy agreement.
The forecast of a Labour victory was welcomed by Jordan and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.

FT  24 JUN 92 / IMF will advance Moscow Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund, softening its demands on the Russian
government, is expected to announce shortly that it will advance Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 540m) to Moscow to assist reform.
The sum, agreed last week in talks between Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian
prime minister, and Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's director general,
represents a highly qualified support for the government of President Boris
Yeltsin.
It also a sign that the IMF has softened its approach markedly in recent
days after an internal review of its policy towards the former Soviet Union.
The Fund has come under concerted attack in Moscow where Mr Yeltsin, the
Russian government and its advisers - especially Professor Jeffrey Sachs,
the Harvard economist - have publicly accused it of an over-rigid and
unresponsive attitude.
In recent weeks it has abandoned a number of conditions it had set down for
the Russian government.
The IMF has:
accepted that oil prices will rise slowly over the next two years to world
market levels; prepared to soften its insistence that the Russian budget be
in balance this year without recourse to the Dollars 24bn aid package; and
stopped trying to force all former Soviet states to remain within the rouble
zone.
The move was prompted by Ukraine's decision to expand credit by more than
Rs300bn to bail out struggling enterprises. Much of this will come back to
Russia in the form of inflation.
However, the Dollars 1bn advance is not an endorsement of Russia's economic
programme and talks will continue on the crucial areas - the budget deficit,
foreign debt repayments and stability in the rouble zone.
The granting of Dollars 6bn out of the Dollars 24bn for use as a
stabilisation fund remains contentious. The Russian government wants access
to it soon, and would use it to support the rouble at a level of Rs85 to the
dollar.
The IMF believes that the Dollars 6bn can only be 'granted' when the
conditions are such that it does not need to be used.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Brussels may cede some central powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is for the first time seriously considering the
return to EC states of some powers that have been taken over by Brussels.
The Commission is seeking to deflect criticism that its bureaucratic red
tape has snared governments and citizens in an over-centralised Community.
Its new stress on 'subsidiarity' - making laws and rules at the lowest
appropriate level - comes too late to influence Danish voters who earlier
this month rejected the Maastricht union treaty. However, its change of
emphasis is in time for this week's EC summit in Lisbon, where a lively
debate on subsidiarity is expected.
The Commission will today prepare its view on subsidiarity on the basis of a
paper which seeks to ward off 'the accusations of bureaucracy and
technocracy'.
Real centralisation is beyond the means of EC administrators whose money and
staff 'will not in any manner be comparable to those of a federal state', it
says.
The paper, prepared for the Commission by the office of its president, Mr
Jacques Delors, makes no precise proposals about which powers might be
returned to governments.
Officials predicted yesterday that today's discussion in the 17-member
Commission board would result in an instruction to the Commission's 23
directorates to search for examples of subsidiarity in their areas.
The Commission's preliminary paper suggests that EC legislation can be
justified in dealing with clear cross-frontier problems, such as the
depletion of the ozone layer, or where there is an obvious need to mobilise
maximum financial and technical resources, as in EC research programmes.
But it also suggests that Brussels should weigh 'the cost of (EC) inaction'.
In the sensitive area of trade infringement, it raises the questions: 'Is it
necessary to remove every distortion (to competition)? If not, at what point
should the Community intervene to prevent a distortion, and in what
sectors?'
EC officials rule out any idea that Brussels is about to let member
countries control state aid, such as the case of the French government's
injection of capital into its computer company, Bull, which the Commission
is due to discuss next week.
However, they suggest that, in cases where one company complains that
another is abusing a dominant position within a single national market,
there should be more recourse to national courts, rather than directly to
Brussels.
As an alternative to EC legislation, the paper says the Commission should
consider encouraging private parties - such as employers and trades unions -
or public authorities to regulate themselves. Brussels might even provide
financial incentives for private action.
Where self-regulation is not appropriate, the Commission - under the Treaty
of Rome the sole proposer of EC laws - should wherever possible confine
itself to setting minimum EC-wide standards. This practice, which Brussels
is already increasingly using, allows member states to make further
refinements in technical norms, provided these are 'mutually recognised'.
Mr Delors said to EC foreign ministers he saw a paradox between the way the
Twelve were developing the single market on the basis of 'mutual trust', and
how EC structural aid controls

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (7): No gold from the
Maastricht rainbow - The Madrid stock market is in the doldrums as
foreigners withdraw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE YEARS ago, Madrid's bolsa, after a long period as flavour of the
month, posted an historic high of 325 general index points. Since the summer
of 1989, a rotten smell of sorts has emanated from the dominant domestic
stock market, as well as from Madrid's puny sister bolsas in Barcelona,
Bilbao and Valencia.
Madrid hovered close to 290 in the second quarter of last year, but it has
still not recovered its pre-Kuwait invasion index of close to 300. Currently
it appears to be holding firm on a 245-250 support level after reaching a
266.5 points high this year on February 28.
Statistics of bolsa bearishness abound. It is news now if daily trading
volume rises above Pta10bn (Pounds 54.3m), whereas in January Pta20bn was
the norm. Last year's annual trading volume of Pta3.693bn was similar to the
1987 figure, and the Madrid market's capitalisation of Pta13.457bn narrowed
last year to an estimated Pta13.000bn.
One revealing statistic illustrates how the foreigners have beaten a
retreat. During the bolsa's heyday in 1988-89, a period when it was
regularly written up as one of the best global performers, non-Spanish
transactions accounted for some 28 per cent of the Madrid market's
transactions. Currently, such funds are reckoned to represent between 15 and
20 per cent of the total.
When it was the repeated flavour of the month, Madrid's weighting was around
8 per cent in the European stock market ranking, standing fourth behind
London, Frankfurt and Paris. Now, some fund managers have trimmed the
weighting down by as many as four points.
The diminishing foreign presence is a key factor behind the doldrums. It
was, after all, the non-Spanish funds that pushed the bolsa towards giddy
heights in the late 1980s.
The foreigners invested in the Madrid market at a time when Spain's GDP
showed annual increases of 5 per cent and more. It began to shy away when
growth peaked at the end of that decade, and it stayed away when the 2.4 per
cent GDP growth posted in 1991 indicated that something just short of
recession could be round the corner.
In 1990, corporate profits in Spain were still rising annually by more than
14 per cent. Last year, profits across the board fell by at least half, to 7
per cent at best. Just as high growth brought the foreigners in, so did the
absence of it frighten them away.
The result is that, with the Madrid market currently languishing at nine
times earnings, Spanish stocks are, by most international standards, at
bargain prices, for their price-to-cash-ratio is 4.4 times - despite which
there are no takers.
That is the bleak reality of the situation. What are the chances of change?
The question is an embarrassing one, for the much-heralded catalyst for
change towards a bullish bolsa was the EC's Maastricht treaty. Following
Denmark's 'no' referendum, that beckoning beacon on which all eyes were
trained has proved, as far as the markets are concerned, to be as chimerical
as the crock of gold at the end of a rainbow.
Maastricht had become an obsessive buzz-word for bolsa players. Mr Ignacio
Gomez Montejo, the chief strategist at FG Inversiones Bursatiles, one of
Madrid's major broking houses, opened a recent presentation in typical
fashion: 'A previously obscure Dutch town jumped a few months ago to the
status of most-mentioned place by capital market professionals -
Maastricht.'
Mr Gomez Montejo painstakingly explained how, before the end of the present
decade, Spain's spiralling budget deficit would shrink, and with it
inflation and interest rates, because of the government's commitment to be a
founder member of Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) within the EC, according
to the convergence criteria agreed at Maastricht.
The bottom line, delivered by the respected Madrid analyst was: 'The bolsa
will be revalued by around 30 per cent, thanks to the impact of Economic and
Monetary Union.'
If Maastricht is now in doubt, then so is Spain's convergence commitment,
and so is a sustained Emu-linked market rally. Bolsa players certainly
understood it that way, and the Madrid stock exchange dropped by some 5 per
cent in the week following Denmark's referendum.
In the absence of a clear Emu framework - analysts are now furious with
themselves for ever having coined the so-called Maastricht factor - it is
now up to the Spanish government to give a clear signal of its continued
willingness to converge with northern European economies.
The first real opportunity for displaying such a sentiment will occur after
the summer parliamentary recess, when the government unveils its 1993
budget. The markets will be looking for substantially reduced government
spending, despite tha fact that general elections are due next year.
If the government does deliver the goods with a restrictive budget, then
some of the havoc by the Maastricht question mark may be repaired.
Additionally, the profile of those playing the Spanish markets might change
and this, at the end of the day, should be far more important.
A government bent upon correcting economic imbalances - with or without
Maastricht - will not ensure the sharp growth that attracted the speculative
funds of the late 1980's. But it will, in time, bring in long-term investors
who see eventual profit in Spain's spare capacity, in its underemployment
and in its determination to catch up.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (8): Weaker firms
under pressure - Brokers have reduced commissions as business wanes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S BROKING houses have received a double punch. The bolsa is decidedly
bearish, and as the cake gets smaller they are going to make earn even less
than before from whatever business comes their way, writes Tom Burns.
At the begining of this year, fixed commissions that stood at 0.25 per cent
of all market transactions were abolished. The price liberalisation was one
of the final moves in the overhaul of the Spanish markets that commenced in
the late 1980s, and it could not have come at a worse time for the brokers.
In the battle to obtain the diminishing business, the broking houses have
reduced commissions by half to 0.12 per cent on major orders, and to even
less for the really big ones. BBV Interactivos, the largest of the broking
houses and owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, estimates that the commissions war
could lower earnings on arbitrage for the sector this year by up to 40 per
cent.
This is good news for firms such as Carnegie Espana, which are not members
of the stockmarket. 'The market is overbroked and we have a lot of
bargaining power to barter down the prices,' says Mr Diego Prado, one of
Carnegie's partners in Spain.
But for bolsa members the prospect is ironic. Reduced takings have come at a
time when the remaining main planks that make for a successful stockmarket
platform have been eased into place. In April, for example, a new body
called the Servicio de Compensacion y Liquidacion (SCVL), was unveiled by
the Stock Market Commission, to serve as a securities settlement and
clearing service.
When the service becomes fully operational in the autumn, it is expected to
reduce settlement from up to two weeks to five working days. The aim of the
SCVL system is to have the purchaser receive securities on the day of
payment.
In the meantime, ratings agencies have arrived in Spain, and the snowball
success of mutual funds points to the possibility of increased trading
volume should there be a market rally.
None of this, however, cheers the broking houses as they reel from the
double punch. For the first time since the Sociedades de Valores y Bolsa
(SVB), as the broking houses are known in Spain, came into being more than
three years ago, in the wake of the bolsa reform, the sector's weaker
members are under real pressure.
Officials at the Madrid stockmarket believe that the present 54-strong SVB
community will be reduced to no more than 30. With few exceptions the main
bolsa houses are linked to the big banks, and some 20, which have remained
independent, have market shares of less than 1 per cent.
Such a reduction had been forecast back in 1989, when the SVBs replaced the
individual brokers or agentes de cambio y bolsa, who, in the old
pre-computerisation and pre-continuous trading days, used to operate on the
floor of the market. Against the odds, the small fish survived, but with the
commissions war now raging in earnest the crunch time cannot be delayed for
long.
An SVB shake-out will be looked upon with interest by foreign institutions,
which have been eyeing the bolsa for some time with a view to starting up
operations. The crunch coincides with the lifting of all restrictions on
foreign institutions trading actively on the bolsa.
Warburgs is one of the major brokers that is usually cited as a prospective
Madrid market player, and there are believed to be five applications for
membership pending at the stock market commission. Under the previous
rulings, such prospective members, whether domestic or foreign, would have
been obliged to buy into partnerships with the existing agentes de cambio y
bolsa.
Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale were two institutions that chose the
partnership course. It is an open question whether the advantages these
French firms gained by arriving early and acquiring a market share have
outweighed the cost involved.
A problem they face, in common with virtually all the established broking
houses, is an excess of personnel, some of which remains rooted in the
traditional public notary role of the former agentes system.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (9): Companies get to
grips with risk - Rating agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF INTERNATIONAL rating agencies had not recently opened up for business in
Spain, conglomerates such as the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI) would
have had to invent them.
At the begining of this month, INI, the owner of most of Spain's public
sector companies, was awarded an AA long-term rating and an A1+ for
commercial paper by IBCA, the London-based institution.
The awards anticipated the forthcoming dissection of INI into two units: one
for the group's loss-making companies in sectors such as coal mining and
intergrated steel, and a second for those that make money.
IBCA's judgment on INI also coincided with the conglomerate's need to go to
the markets, because the government has issued stern warnings about the
unavailability of capital injections from the state budget.
The ratings, which indicated a very reduced investor risk, were thus a shot
in the arm for INI's financial strategists as they began to plan
presentations for institutional investors.
Mr Salvador Garcia-Atance, the chairman of Madrid brokers Asesores
Bursatiles and a senior figure in Spain's financial sector, had long
identified the need for ratings agencies. 'It was quite clear that we had to
have them,' he says. Specialist institutions to evaluate risk were the
logical consequence of the deregulation of the domestic stock exchanges.
Rating agencies are, in particular, fundamental to the growth of the
underdeveloped domestic secondary market.
The volume of commercial paper and bonds in Spain amounted to Pta2,000bn in
1991, but only 26 companies availed themselves of these instruments, with
just 11 of them accounting for 74 per cent of the total sum.
In the event, Mr Garcia-Atance negotiated the entry into Spain of the US
agency Standard and Poor's. The Spanish subsidiary of the US firm was
formally constituted in March, as a joint venture with Spanish partners that
included the Madrid, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges, and it will be
fully operational in September.
IBCA, which is in the process of expanding in Europe, opened its Spanish
subsiduary in January with the Barcelona stock exchange as a junior partner.
Mr Charles Prescott, chairman of IBCA Espana, sees a profitable future for
the venture: 'The people we are speaking to say that, in a few years,
everybody is going to need a rating.'
Initial business (IBCA has awarded a rating to Repsol, the state-controled
energy, gas and chemical holding in addition to INI) is nevertheless slow,
and Mr Prescott says he would be delighted if a total of 10 corporate
ratings were awarded in the course of the year.
Persistent persuasion is going to be required to help medium and smaller
Spanish companies overcome the reluctance with which they receive risk
evaluators. 'Everyone wants to have a Triple-A, and we have to convince them
there is nothing wrong with being an A. Our first job is to help companies
understand what a rating is,' says Mr Prescott.
In its bid to develop this new market, IBCA Espana has created a promotional
board that brings together institutions such as Inverco, an association
grouping domestic funds, which represent the end-users of a rating. It is
these funds - and they are growing strongly - which will in time determine
the consolidation of the ratings business in Spain.
What is likely to occur is that the Spanish funds will introduce internal
rules requiring a rating for investment in long-term paper. This practice,
which already operates outside Spain, effectively regulates the risk. Mr
Garcia-Atance believes that the National Stock Exchange Commission will
eventually impose some form of risk regulation on the funds if they do not
themselves voluntarily introduce them.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (5): The big five
quietly do their own thing - Mergers and the rush to create new products are
changing the face of banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WAS supposed to be a bad year to be a big bank in Spain. Mr Luis Vals,
the enigmatic co-president of the world's most profitable bank, Banco
Popular, mused late last year that 1992 would be a 'sabbatical year' for
Spanish banks as the economy slows and bad debts mount up.
But, in relative terms at least, the 500th anniversary of the creation of a
unified Spain is not turning out that badly for most of the big five
private-sector banks - Banco Central Hispanoamericano, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
Banco Santander, Banco Popular and Banesto. The mood at the big new
state-owned conglomeration of public sector banks, Argentaria, which
includes Banco Exterior, is positively buoyant.
The problem with making predictions about the big Spanish banks is that they
are no longer a colourless mass. The mergers of the past four years (Bilbao
and Vizcaya, to form BBV; Central and Hispano, to form BCH), the inexorable
shrinking of margins in their traditional retail business and the rush to
create new products and services is changing the face of Spanish banking.
The big banks are going their separate ways, each quietly becoming
identifiable for what it is doing that is different, rather than, as in the
past, for how they are managing to shadow each other.
Banco Santander is reinforcing its position as the country's most aggressive
bank. In 1989, it was first to offer interest on current accounts, igniting
a fierce battle for new customers that drained the resources of most of its
large rivals.
Last year it was slower off the mark than the BBV to launch mutual funds but
quickly became the market leader. It has scorned mergers with local banks to
concentrate on buying abroad. It has 10 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland,
and has also bought 13 per cent (with an option on another 13 per cent) of
First Fidelity in the US. The bank is accumulating large cash positions.
First quarter 1992 pre-tax profits of Pta28.6bn (Pounds 155m) were up 19.2
per cent.
Bilbao Vizcaya is over the worst of its 1988 merger. Staff and branches have
been deeply cut, and a further 3,000 jobs are to be lost. The bank has
expanded its interests in profitable foods and electricity distribution
markets, and is entering communications.
GEC Capital is a new shareholder, through which BBV plans to branch out into
the private credit card business in which GEC Capital is a world leader.
It is also establishing a large presence off the US market, in Puerto Rico.
It is shedding peripheral banking units and may this year be hit by a drop
in extraordinary profits. Excluding these gains, group pre-tax profits rose
11 per cent in the first quarter to Pta25.9bn.
Central Hispano, merged last year, still faces a daunting task in trimming
duplicated branches and staff. The bank has also been born with a huge
industrial empire vulnerable to industrial business cycles but also capable
of generating occasional large profits.
Its industrial strategy remains, however, unclear while management of the
two merged banks get accustomed to each other. First quarter 1992 pre-tax
profits were up 4.5 per cent at Pta18.7bn.
Banco Popular sails along doing what it always has - making lots of money.
It is not tempted by industry nor by mergers, and concentrates on retail and
niche services. It processes, for instance, all Spanish air ticket
transactions. Pre-tax profit in the first quarter was up 9 per cent at
Pta22.5bn on a third of BCH's assets.
Banesto is being tortured by its large industrial group, where profits fell
48 per cent last year. The banking group, though, may be beginning to reap
the rewards of huge investments in computerisation, though the biggest boost
to profits last year came via its new Portuguese acquisition, Banco Totta.
Financial group first quarter pre-tax income rose just under 1 per cent to
Pta17.2bn after a 54 per cent rise in provisions and write offs.
Banco Exterior has absorbed the state's industrial credit bank BCI and,
itself, been pooled with the rest of the state's financial institutions
under a new holding company, Argentaria.
The Government is thinking of privatising more of Exterior (it now owns 69
per cent of the bank) or part of Argentaria. Exterior is still shedding some
of the deadweight it inherited with BCI, but reported first quarter pre-tax
profits of Pta11.4bn, up 13.6 per cent.
Although it is possible now to tell the big banks apart, they still suffer a
number of common complaints and enjoy some similar advantages. Despite
efforts to break into fee-earning services, retail business still accounts
for around 90 per cent of banking profits in Spain. And the banks with large
industrial holdings still tend to force these companies to do their banking
business through the owning bank, rather than allow finance directors to
seek more competitive arrangements.
The high lending margins enjoyed by Spanish banks mean, though, that they
are well cushioned as they try to diversify their banking business and, as
many analysts still insist, wait for one last big bank merger in Spain.
Banesto would probably be part of such a venture, but it is hard to see how
the other two 'single banks', Popular and Santander, could buy it or merge
with it without damaging their profitability.
One other possibility is that a major foreign bank could buy all or part of
Banesto, but foreigners are much more wary now of the Spanish market.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (6): Mr Rubio fights
on two fronts - A personal view of the central bank crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A few weeks, the Madrid government will make one of most important
economic policy decisions of the year and appoint a new governor to the Bank
of Spain.
Six months ago, it seemed a fair bet that the present governor, Mr Mariano
Rubio, would be renominated, but his chances of a third term have been
overtaken by a ferocious financial scandal.
Briefly, Mr Rubio's modest portfolio - Dollars 120,000 - was managed by his
friend and broker for 25 years, Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former chairman of
the Madrid stock exchange. The money was not to not be invested in any bank.
In the late 1980s, Mr De la Concha applied for a banking licence and, as he
met the capital requirements, was given one. He formed Ibercorp, a small
financial services boutique - a bank, a stockbroker, and a series of small
portfolio companies. It was in one of these, Sistemas Financieros, that he
invested Mr Rubio's money.
In the spring of 1990, Sistemas Financieros accumulated vast amounts of its
own stock, triggering an investigation by the stock market commission. Soon
after the repurchases, the price of Sistemas Financieros stock collapsed,
leaving a vast bulk of shareholders to take bad losses. But Mr Rubio had
been bought out in the spring, and had been spared financial ruin.
Earlier this year a Spanish newspaper reported the stock accumulations, and
accused Mr De la Concha of deliberately favouring the governor. Worse, a
list of Sistemas Financieros shareholders whose stock had been bought back
by the company was sent to the stock market commission without Mr Rubio's
name on it. The names of other well-known Spanish personalities had also
been altered.
Few of the Sistemas Financieros shareholders seemed to have been aware of
precisely what Mr De la Concha was doing with their money or their names.
But the accusations unsettled the governor, and a few weeks after the
scandal broke he appeared before parliament to report on the matter and made
his first mistake.
Bank of Spain investigators had recently completed an audit of the Ibercorp
group, and concluded that it was a highly speculative operation, dedicated
to supporting the price of its own stock, and whose net worth was rapidly
crumbling. But Mr Rubio, facing members of parliament, told them the group's
bank was 'in perfect condition'.
Mariano Rubio is a decent, honourable man. He offered his resignation soon
after the scandal broke. But he is also quite arrogant, or perhaps aloof -
traits not uncommon in central bankers. He would not have appreciated being
asked questions by a motly collection of MPs, many of whom clearly did not
really know what to ask him and were using newspapers as source material.
He did not lie to parliament. The Ibercorp bank's net worth, at the time of
his testimony, was positive. But it was falling, and he did not tell them
that. Neither, strictly speaking, did he have to.
But by then (late February) the Ibercorp scandal was out of control, and the
Bank of Spain report leaked. It also emerged that Mr Rubio's sister was a
shareholder in Sistemas Financieros. That was no crime, and he might even
have introduced her to it or to his broker. The world is full of bad
investors.
At a second parliamentary hearing in June, though, Mr Rubio appeared to
compound his initial economies with the truth by refusing to allow
parliament to inspect the Bank's audit of Ibercorp.
But the effect was that the central bank governor had told the nation that a
bank was in perfect condition when it quite clearly was not. Would he be
believed the next time? There was no getting out of the trap he was in.
Mr Rubio was fighting two battles: one personal, the other for the autonomy
of the Bank of Spain. Under the rules governing the European Community's
drive to economic and monetary union, governments are required to make their
central banks independent. That would free them from political interference,
especially the manipulation of interest rates to prop up economic policies.
In Spain, the central bank remains a prisoner of government whim. Not even a
draft statute of autonomy has been drawn up, but Mr Rubio's predicament has
highlighted the dilemma in making a central bank independent: how does a
statute accommodate both the Bank's monetary policy role and its role as
regulator of the banking industry?
Politicians may be less resigned to losing control of monetary policy, but
they will be loath now to entertain a law which puts the banking regulator
beyond public scrutiny. But it would be dangerous to allow political access
to all corners of the industry. Secrets die young in Spain.
Ibercorp may temporarily weaken the Bank of Spain's case for autonomy in
regulation, but the tragedy of the scandal is that Mr Rubio's efforts to
strengthen the Spanish banking system, to liberalise it and make it
transparent, may now be unrecognised and unappreciated. At a time of great
change, only two tiny banks, including Ibercorp, failed under his
stewardship.
Ibercorp is not a corruption scandal. It is the story of a rotten, badly run
little financial empire that let its clients down. Mr Rubio was one of them.
There is a lot of speculation now about a successor, but only one man stands
out - Mr Rubio's deputy, Mr Luis Angel Rojo. The 'professor', as he is
called by former economics students and by alumni of the Bank's impressive
research department, Mr Rojo is a no-nonsense, technically brilliant central
banker.
He would guard the Bank from politicians; and any other appointment by the
government would smack of political intrigue and an attempt to have a
'flexible' man at the top of an independent institution. Ibercorp has not
done much damage to the Bank of Spain, and certainly nothing that Mr Rojo's
appointment would not heal in an instant.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (2): Tax changes
prove to be a spur to long-term savers - A look at the spectacular growth of
mutual funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPSOL, SPAIN's state controlled oil, gas and chemical conglomerate, placed
three-year convertible bonds worth Pta80bn (Pounds 435m) with small domestic
investors last month, despite the fact that it had scarcely bothered to
advertise the issue.
Originally the issue was to have been Pta25bn, but such was the demand for
Repsol paper that the conglomerate successively raised its volume to Pta50bn
and to Pta80bn.
What Repsol did was to concentrate its energies on fund managers. The
conglomerate, using the considerable muscle that it exercises in the
domestic corporate scene, wrote into its contract with the managers of the
issue that those who actually sold the bonds were entitled to a handsome
2.75 per cent commission.
Repsol had placed a limit of a Pta8m investment, which allowed individuals
to buy a maximum 800 bonds priced at Pta10,000. Fund managers, stimulated by
the commission, accordingly bought major blocks of bonds and energetically
started spreading them around their clients. Perhaps as many as 300,000
small investors have ended up owning the conglomerate's bonds.
'Repsol issue went great guns, but it has the fondos to thank for its
success,' says Mr Francesc Guardans, chief executive of Societe Generale de
Valores, the French financial group's Spanish stockbroking arm.
Repsol had indeed successfully identified the potential of a key development
in Spain's financial markets. In its annual report the CNMV, the
Madrid-based stock market commission, noted that 1991 had marked the
'authentic launch of collective investment in Spain'.
Between 1990 and 1991, the number of mutual fund institutions increased from
550 to 662, the total number of their participants doubled from 570,000 to
1.1m, and the volume of their assets held by the institutions quadrupled
from Pta1.502bn to Pta4.244bn.
The spectacular increase was the result of a substantial change in the
fiscal treatment of mutual funds that was aimed at encouraging long-term
saving, which struck a immediate and deep chord in the public.
In a major publicity campaign, Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
BBV, artfully sold the fondos that they had created in the wake of the
legislation as virtual tax havens. Between them, Santander and BBV have
captured some 26 per cent of the total funds under management.
In 1990 the total assets of mutual funds in Spain represented 3 per cent of
GDP, whereas in France the volume of such assets is the equivalent of 22 per
cent of the GDP, and in the UK it is 8.4 per cent. By the end of 1991,
Spain's mutual funds represented 7.75 per cent of the GDP, a higher
proportion than in Germany, Italy and Belgium.
The CNMV asserted in its report that the funds will continue to increase in
both participants and assets in the future, 'although the rhythm of growth
could be a more moderate'.
Madrid brokers Maxwell and Espinosa believe the growth will be sustained,
and estimate that the total of assets by the end of this year may virtually
double to between Pta7.000 and Pta8.000.
The thinking at the CNMV, and among the Spanish broking community, is that
the equities market will in time be a clear beneficiary of the major build
up of the funds. At present, this is not the case, for less than 5 per cent
of the funds under management are invested in the stock market.
What the analysts note, however, is that the funds are continuing to grow at
a time when the government is lowering its borrowing requirements.
Government borrowing increased by Pta1.700bn in the last six months of last
year, but the net increase of total borrowing this year is unlikely to be
more than Pta1.200.
Maxwell and Espinosa report that, at the height of the government's demand
for cash last year, domestic fund managers were already left short of
fixed-income paper, and that the gilt yields in secondary markets were being
constantly bid down. This situation is likely to become more acute this
year, due to the government's reduced requirements, and fund managers are
therefore going to be forced into diversifying.
What the markets are obviously hoping for is that fund managers will begin
to look at high-yield equities. In this respect, Repsol's convertible bonds
are a timely taster for such an event, for the issue seeks, by way of an 8
per cent discount, to have almost all the new bond holders converting their
paper to shares at the first opportunity, which will be in September.
Mr Juan Vilanova, deputy director of BBV Interactivos, believes that
domestic fund managers will gain an increasing awareness of the stockmarket
and begin shifting part of their assets towards it.
In a New York or in a London, some 40 per cent of a mutual fund is invested
in equities. Nobody realistically expects such a ratio in Spain; but nor
does anyone believe that the present mere 5 per cent of domestic funds that
is invested in the bolsa will continue to be the norm.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (3): Divided Meffsa
looks both ways - Derivatives, the tale of two cities has ended in a
compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A squabble that pitted Madrid against Barcelona and which dragged on
for more than two years, Spain finally got its future and options markets
act together last December.
Both cities had tried to be all things to all men, competed against each
other and ended up delivering nothing very much to anybody.
In December's compromise, Madrid and Barcelona jointly backed an overseeing
holding company called Meffsa (the Mercado de Futuros Financieros SA), which
is based in Barcelona, and each obtained that part of the action which was
most suited to it.
The need to sort out the rivalry was made all the more pressing by the fact
that everything else was more or less in place to aid the rapid expansion of
derivatives in Spain. The domestic financial markets had been fully
liberalised, thus accelerating the already strong inflow of foreign
investment, and domestic mutual funds were growing at a spectacular pace.
Meffsa was effectively segmented into Meffsa Renta Variable (RV), which
deals with equities and is located in Madrid; and Meffsa Renta Fija (RF),
which is headquartered in Barcelona and deals with fixed-interest security
and currency contracts.
The sensible compromise recognised Madrid's dominant role in the Spanish
stockmarkets. The home of on-line trading, Madrid's Bolsa , towers over its
sister markets in Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia, and accounts for more than
80 per cent of the Spanish stockmarket business.
In locating security futures in Barcelona, the compromise was also an
appropriate nod to this city's inventiveness and to its determined ambition
to establish a niche for itself in Spain's financial sector. The purposeful
software investment undertaken by Barcelona's Meffsa RF has drawn plaudits
from clients and could earn it high additional returns.
One of the more striking aspects of the Barcelona operation is that it has a
16-strong team allocated to its systems, 12 of whose members work fulltime
to develop the software. Meffsa RF is negotiating the sale of its systems to
potential futures markets in Argentina, Malaysia, Norway and Portugal.
Barcelona's star product is its 10-year notional government bond, which was
launched in March. Meffsa RF has flopped, however, in its attempt to develop
currency contracts in pesetas/dollar and pesetas/Deutsche Mark. The varying
fortunes illustrate the start up difficulties.
The fixed-interest business, which has drawn in 14 marketmakers so far, has
a lot of room for growth, for only some 10 per cent of the existing mutual
funds have accounts open at Meffsa RF.
This low proportion reflects, in part, a current administrative limbo, as
the Barcelona market and the fund managers await full clarification from the
market regulator, the CNMV, on norms over hedging. As soon as this hurdle is
crossed, Meffsa RF rightly believes that every fund manager who wants to be
considered a professional will have to maintain open a futures account.
Liquidity has, however, demonstrably failed to materialise in the currency
futures market, which presently accounts for as little as 1 per cent of
Meffsa RF turnover. There are just three marketmakers dealing in currency
futures, and they offer no competition to the existing over the counter
(OTC) swaps favoured by the big clearing banks.
Meffsa RV, in Madrid, began offering contracts in January on Ibex 35, the
Spanish stock market index which lists the 35 biggest quoted companies. In
September, it hopes to offer contracts on individual stocks, some of which,
such as the telecommunications giant Telefonica, the energy group Repsol and
the utilities Endesa and Iberdrola, are well known to foreign investors.
The inevitable problem that Meffsa RV faces is that it is too narrow. This
is not surprising, for it mirrors the existing reality of the Spanish
equities market. It is a difficulty that is nevertheless exacerbated by a
widely shared view that Spanish managers have still a lot to learn about
hedging.
'The market is already narrow, but the lack of skills among certain
corporate treasures is making it even narrower,' says Mr Ian Triay, of
Lloyds Bank's corporate division in Madrid.
Mr Michael Hyman, investment director of GH Asset Management in London,
criticises a 'reluctance' that he perceives among Meffsa's marketmakers to
live up to their title. He faults them for failing to establish two-way
prices, to match buyers and sellers and, in the final analysis, to make
markets.
'When people come here with their presentations, I tell them: 'You don't
have convince me to invest in Spain, because that's exactly what I want to
do',' says Mr Hyman. 'I end up telling them to make things more efficient
and to create a market that will allow in people like me.'
In their defence, Meffsa executives say that these are still early days in
what remains a fledgling market. They have done the hard part, which is to
put the show on the road.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (4): An ill wind
wakes up the hedgers - The 'no' factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL FUTURES and options markets thrive on financial chaos, and the
Barcelona-based Mercado de Futuros Financieros SA (Meffsa) put on a lot of
weight when Denmark's 'no' to Maastricht, on June 2, painted the Spanish
bond market as distinctly bearish.
Until that referendum, Meffsa's record number of daily contracts on notional
three- and 10-year bonds, priced at Pta10m (Pounds 54,000), had been set on
December 19 last year and had totalled 17,000. On June 3, 43,770
fixed-income contracts were traded.
Fearing that economic and monetary union (Emu) within the European Community
was in doubt, as a result of the Danish 'no', investors had taken a
particularly jaundiced look at their Spanish bonds.
Spain became even less the flavour of the month when the subsequent French
decision also to stage a Maastricht referendum fuelled the doubts of the
Emusceptics.
The investors had, after all, entered the domestic bond market because of
the so-called Maastricht factor - a codeword for a belief that Spanish
interest rates would fall as the Spanish economy converged with those of
northern Europe, in order to meet the Emu criteria agreed at the EC's
Maastricht summit last December.
If, in the thinking of investors, Maastricht was being questioned, then
Spanish convergence was likewise in doubt and Spain was quite definitely off
the menu.
The average yield on Spanish government paper had stood at 10.89 on June 2,
and it shot up to 11.06 the following day. By June 9, it stood at 11.48. The
price of the 10-year bonds, the favourite target of foreign investors,
dropped by more than three points in just four days, falling from 96.55 per
cent to 93.25 per cent.
On June 3, Meffsa's record-breaking contract day, the marketmakers' limit of
a 200 basis points spread was already stretched to snapping point, when Wall
Street opened at 2.30 pm local Barcelona time and began to drag bond prices
down further.
At 2.45 pm, 15 minutes before the 3 pm cut-off time when the Barcelona
futures market shuts down its computer terminals, Meffsa obtained
authorisation from the Bank of Spain, the monetary regulators, to widen its
spread to 230 points.
Meffsa was thus very much in its element, doing exactly what it is supposed
to do, as it matched investors in a hurry to sell their bonds with
speculators who believed that prices had touched bottom and were willing to
gamble on a position.
The reckoning came later as the Barcelona futures market spread the 'I told
you so' word. Meffsa is still in its infancy, for it was created in March
1990 and relaunched in December last year as a holding company that based
fixed-income and currency futures and options in Barcelona and located
futures and options contracts on stock indexes in Madrid.
The word was that Meffsa's business of selling notional bonds - it trades in
the 90-day Madrid interbank offered rate (Mibor 90) and in five-year bonds,
as well as in three- and 10-year paper - was the sort of business
treasurers, and fund managers, should have built into their day-to-day
routine of corporate husbandry.
'We had spent a long time telling all these people that they had to hedge
against interest rates going up,' says Mr Pablo Larraga, Meffsa's manager.
In theory, it is all the easier to drive home the message now that the horse
has bolted because the stable door was left open.
Meffsa's moral, as it is that of every futures market in fixed income, is
that the notional bonds, thanks to the marketmakers, trade in far narrower
spreads than on the open market; at crisis times, as occured earlier this
month, it is far cheaper for buyers and sellers alike to use the services
provided by the Meffsa's of the financial world.
The moral is hard to sell when the markets, cosily ensconced in convergence
plans, are stable. But when 'no's' to Maastricht blow big holes through such
plans, and the markets, especially sensitive ones such as Spain's, become
hyper-volatile, then there should be willing listeners to the tale that
Meffsa has to tell.
The post-Danish referendum 'black week' for the Spanish bond market was a
distinctly upbeat one for Meffsa. In time, it may come to be looked upon as
the true foundation date of the domestic futures and options market, as the
week that woke up hesitant hedgers among the corporate community and jolted
them into into acquiring new treasury skills.

FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (1): At the mercy of
the markets - Predictability is important in an economy as volatile as
Spain's, and reaction to the thought that the Maastricht treaty changes
might not now be implemented was swift. As the Danish referendum clouds the
investment climate and interest rates firm up, there seems little prospect
of the peseta's entering the ERM narrow band this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE DANISH referendum of June 2 may well help the Spanish government to
bring home to the country the fact that it is not the complete master of its
own destiny.
The vote rejected the changes to the European Community's 'constitution',
the Treaty of Rome, decided last December in Maastricht, and sent Spain's
equity and bond markets into a tailspin.
Maastricht was important to Spain, not because it contained the seeds of new
sources of EC funds, but because it served - before being thrown into doubt
by the Danish 'no' vote - to lock Spain more tightly into the Community and
to increase its chances of becoming, economically, as stable as its stronger
EC partners. For Spain, the framework of economic convergence agreed at
Maastricht was a sort of guarantee to the people that buy its shares, its
currency and its industries that its economy had become predictable.
It is hard to overstate the importance of predictability in an economy still
as volatile as Spain's, and the reaction to the Danish vote, and the
prospect that the Maastricht treaty changes just might not now be
implemented was swift and horrible. While the Spanish authorities, bankers
and businessmen know that the country's fortunes are at the mercy of the
markets, ordinary Spaniards may still not appreciate it.
Spain has big public deficits - an accumulation of spending overruns on
central and regional government, as well as institutional - which last year
totalled Dollars 25bn. In the first four months of this year alone, those
deficits totalled Dollars 6.5bn, a 54 per cent increase on the same period
last year.
To finance them, the government has three main sources of funds. It raises
taxes, borrows from the central bank, and sells bonds and Treasury bills.
But tax income has fallen as the economy, responding to government efforts
to beat inflation, has cooled. And central bank borrowing is essentially a
mirage, as the state has to end each year with a zero balance at the Bank of
Spain.
efforts to secure stable financing have concentrated on trying to end its
dependence on Letras del Tesoro, one-year T-bills, which were popular with
local and foreign investors when interest rates were even higher than they
are now, but placed a heavy burden on the Treasury every 12 months when the
bills matured.
For the past two years, building on the promise of stability in the EC's
programme of economic and monetary union and the longer-term confidence of
formerly speculative investors, Madrid has been increasingly successful in
selling longer-dated paper. Its long bond is a 10-year obligation, which has
proved especially popular with the state and the markets in which it is
traded. For the state, selling longer-dated bond at the lower interest rates
that Emu implies, means cheaper financing. For the markets, the promise of
interest rates falling keeps the bond price buoyant.
In all, the Treasury has managed radically to shift the burden of financing
from short to medium and long term in the past few years. At the end of
1989, 73 per cent of outstanding debt of Pta13,722bn (Dollars 136.8bn;
Pounds 74.6bn) matured in a year. By February this year, with outstanding
debt at Pta16,606bn, one-year instruments accounted for just 55 per cent of
the total.
When the Danes said 'no' to Maastricht, yields rose nearly a full point, and
prices collapsed as the markets charged out of the long bonds, like a
matador suddenly separated from his cape, and showed no sign, at least in
the two weeks after the Danish vote, of coming back.
If market sentiment continues to depress this bond for a long time, the
consequences for Spain could be quite serious. It could force the government
to begin depending again on short-term debt, which would increase its
financing costs just at the time when it is trying to demonstrate to its EC
partners that its ambitious deficit-slashing convergence programme for Emu
is credible.
But even this might not have alarmed Spaniards until the finance minister,
Mr Carlos Solchaga, mentioned that he was thinking of raising withholding
taxes on personal incomes, in an effort to boost the state's coffers and
drain liquidity out of the system.
Mr Solchaga is a master of the political game in Spain, and it may have been
that he was merely trying to frighten his own free-spending cabinet
colleagues (and welfare enthusiasts in the Socialist party machine) into a
more realistic understanding of what, ultimately, the deficits could involve
if they are not addressed. With a general election now just over a year away
at the most, taking money out of the pockets of voters earlier than it would
normally could be a direct threat to the government's chances of being
re-elected with a majority.
Of course, a cheap equity market and cheap public debt might eventually be
seen as an investment opportunity by the markets, and there are other ways
to trim the deficits. The government, for all its orthodoxy, remains
ambivalent about privatisation, and is loath to do much more than sell off,
piecemeal, stakes in highly profitable companies with rock-solid markets. It
could also simply stop spending as much as it does; but it is hostage to a
slew of special interests, particularly in the 17 autonomous regions.
Nevertheless, Mr Solchaga had been able to draw a straight line between the
Danish vote and Spanish pockets. Anything that threatens the slow fall of
Spanish interest rates will have an impact on ordinary people. One of the
things that does so is the prospect of EC economic union not happening.
Theoretically, one way out of that dilemma may be to opt out of the
commitment to try to be a founding member of Emu in 1997 or 1999, to take
some of the deflationary pressure off the economy and, without renouncing
the drive to lower inflation and interest rates, try to arrive at
convergence at a pace the country - its unhappy unions and its nervous
businessmen - can deal with without having it imposed on them.
But it would take another government to do that. Any turning back by the
Socialists would be regarded, inside and outside the present administration,
as a failure.
The aftermath of the Danish referendum, then, is clouding the investment
climate in Spain. As interest rates firm up in secondary markets, there
seems little prospect of the peseta entering the narrow band of the European
Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism - where it could fluctuate only
2.25 per cent against the other member currencies - this year.
That, in turn, raises some doubts about whether it could be done by the end
of next year, by which time Madrid is committed to narrow band membership.
Many economists believe that, with existing currency parities in the ERM,
Spanish interest rates would need to fall from an official 12.4 per cent to
around 10.65 per cent in order to be able to remain, without support, within
a 2.25 per cent band.
The problem Madrid faces is time. None of its difficulties is
insurmountable. The government and the Bank of Spain will no doubt do their
utmost to prevent rates rising as a result of the current uncertainty, and
may well succeed in holding the ring. But market nervousness could delay
progress in lowering interest rates.
If this situation continues, the prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez, may
begin to think about calling an election before his deadline in October next
year. Any very tough action to cool inflation further and to force interest
rates down may, of necessity, be extremely unpopular and difficult to
implement before an election.
But this year's political schedule is already very full, and Mr Gonzalez's
instincts would be to play out his full third term. A budget has to be
presented by October, when the trade unions are also threatening to hold
their second general strike of the year, in protest at cuts in unemployment
pay.
Moving soon after October would mean a winter election, when the country's
mood is traditionally grey. Spring 1993 is possible, but by then much will
depend on whether the unions have been able to mobilise support against the
government's benefit cuts.
If Mr Solchaga does, in fact, raise retained taxes, winning that public
support might not be so difficult, and Mr Gonzalez will then be facing an
extremely tight schedule for entry into the narrow band of the ERM as the
second phase of economic and monetary union is triggered on January 1, 1994.

FT  24 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE deal in traded options not only boosted turnover but also led to
falls in stock index futures in a busy session for the derivatives markets,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Following Monday's dull session in which only 24,842 contracts were traded,
Tuesday's volume soared to 44,286 contracts. Activity in the FT-SE option
accounted for a large part of the day's total, with James Capel reported to
have done a 'call spread' deal in the December series. The FT-SE option had
traded a total of 16,105 lots by the close, while turnover in the Euro-FTSE
reached 8,604.
Stock options were also busy ahead of today's expiry of the June stock
options. Asda was the top traded option with a day's total of 3,011
contracts.
The big trade in the options was said to have had an effect on the day's
activities in stock index futures. The September contract on the FT-SE
opened at 2,561 and was briefly squeezed up to 2,601, which proved to be the
high of the day.
It was the James Capel trade that sent September into retreat, although Wall
Street helped it recover to 2,591, up 13 on the previous session but around
three points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 35.
Turnover reached 7,410. Dealers however expect a poor opening today.

FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): M3 data take Frankfurt off
day's high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN equities came off the day's highs after disappointing money supply
data for May, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT gave up early gains to end unchanged; worse-than-expected M3 money
supply figures for May, showing an annualised increase of 9.0 per cent, cast
a shadow over trade, but dealers said that their impact was muted.
The DAX index ended just 0.50 higher at 1,771.14 after a pre-bourse high of
about 1,782, and the FAZ gained 0.75 to 704.87. Turnover rose from DM4.4bn
to DM4.7bn.
There was some action in second-line stocks, where AEG ended DM4.40 up at
DM191.50 after forecasting that 1992 sales will rise by more than 10 per
cent, and agreeing a white goods pact with Sweden's Electrolux. The fashion
group Escada, under heavy pressure recently, recovered DM19.50 to DM292.
In steels, Hoesch went ex dividend and fell a net DM5.50 to DM277.50;
Interest moved to Klockner-Werke, DM2.40 higher at DM121.50, and Thyssen,
DM3.20 better at DM239.20.
PARIS was quietly firmer on the final day of the trading account, as the CAC
40 index added 10.03 to 1,895.80 in turnover of FFr2.4bn.
Among blue chips, Total slipped FFr3.90 to FFr232.10 while Alacatel added
FFr7 to FFr629 and Michelin put on FFr5.20 to FFr196.70. Lyonnaise-Dumez,
which denied a report that it was in talks with Fiat about the possible
purchase of Fiat's Cogefar Impresit construction subsidiary, slipped FFr8 to
FFr514.
MILAN drifted as yet another fault in the screen-based trading system put it
out of operation for the first 1 1/2 hours of trading, causing some
confusion among dealers regarding opening prices.
Continued upward pressure on interest rates and the wait for the new
government to be announced also kept investors on the sidelines. The Comit
index fell 1.88 to 472.69 in turnover estimated at L80bn after L72.7bn.
Fiat was about the only big stock to attract interest but it failed to break
above L5,500. The stock added L28 to L5,480.
ZURICH was mostly flat but Sandoz, the pharmaceuticals, chemicals and niche
nutrition stock, rose SFr80 to SFr2,950 as the SMI index gained a mere 0.2
to 1,847.1.
On Monday, Sandoz's arguments for its DHE-45 headache pain injection left
Glaxo, with an expensive competing product, at a new 1992 low in the London
market. Mr Jonathan Spink of Williams de Broe said that the Swiss company
was still benefitting from a meeting with UK fund managers and analysts
earlier this month, at which it said it would review its accounting
procedures and cut its depreciation charges.
OSLO finally broke a run of 15 lower closes in a row, the all-share index
rising 7.49, or 1.8 per cent to 416.85.
Shipping and industrial stocks recorded the biggest gains, Norsk Hydro and
Bergesen A each ending NKr1.5 higher, at NKr160.5 and NKr95 respectively.
Oslo has been gloomy about weak corporate earnings, doubts about Norway's
future ties to the European Community and high domestic interest rates.
STOCKHOLM saw late buying lift prices off midday lows, the Affarsvarlden
general index rising 1.7 to 926.4 in turnover of SKr436m after SKr836m.
Astra A and B shares both dropped SKr7 to SKr536 and SKr516 respectively
while the banking and financial sector index surged 3.1 per cent.
Handelsbanken jumped SKr2 to SKr54 while SE Banken eased SKr0.5 to SKr33.0.
COPENHAGEN featured Baltica, writes Hilary Barnes, up DKr15 to DKr473 on a
forecast staff reduction of 10 per cent over the next two years.
Danisco, which fell DKr25 on Tuesday, jumped DKr31 to DKr764 when it was
announced that the group is negotiating to take over the sugar production
facilities of Sweden's Procordia. The All Share Index closed 0.34 down at
316.58.
HELSINKI bounced off Monday's low for the year, helped by gains in Repola
which reported better-than-expected results for the first four months of
1992. The Hex index closed 10.3, or 1.4 per cent higher at 768.9.
Repola's restricted shares rose FM2 to FM42 after a return to profit, and
the bank and finance house index, which fell sharply last week, rose by 3.4
per cent.
BRUSSELS gained slightly on the first day of the new account. The Bel-20

FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rebounds by 1.2
per cent in thin trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-COVERING of positions and small-lot bargain hunting took the Nikkei
average back above the 16,000 level yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 185.77, or 1.2 per cent, to 16,106.99 in a thin market
after a day's low of 15,860.90 and high of 16,215.38, share prices
fluctuating on movements in the futures markets.
Volume declined from 244m shares to 220m. In spite of the rise in the
Nikkei, falls led advances by 469 to 448, with 177 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks picked up 7.03 to 1,247.21, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 0.59 to 976.18.
Reports that the government was considering the allocation of Y5,000bn to a
supplementary budget prompted dealers to cover short positions in the
futures market.
The government is expected to announce a fiscal or monetary stimulus to
support the sluggish economy ahead of the G7 summit meeting next month.
However, market participants also seem to be worried that politicians might
be paying lip service to the idea, or that the figures involved could be
speculative.
Daiwa Securities said that as long as domestic institutions did not come
back into the market, a rise in share prices would be unlikely. 'The problem
is that nobody feels the urgency to buy now,' added a Daiwa analyst.
High-technology blue chips, however, were sought by trust banks and foreign
investors. NEC put on Y6 to Y820 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 to
Y1,290, although Toshiba shed Y8 to Y592 as some institutional investors
liquidated holdings.
Real estate issues rebounded, some investors believing that the sector was
oversold. Daikyo gained Y5 to Y675, rising for the first time in eight
trading days, and Mitsubishi Estate firmed Y4 to Y745.
Steels, previously sold on earnings worries, gained ground. Nippon Steel
rallied Y6 to Y269 and NKK Y8 to Y249.
Short-term trading moved up some speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk, the
most active issue of the day, advanced Y19 to Y1,010 and Snow Brand Milk Y15
to Y806.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 45.39 to 19,045.91 in volume of 12.4m
shares.
Roundup
THE BOUNCE in Tokyo failed to have much effect on other markets in the
Pacific Basin.
HONG KONG moved forward for a second consecutive day, as a wave of afternoon
buying buried earlier losses. The Hang Seng index shot up 77.92, the biggest
gain in more than three weeks, to 5,897.86 as turnover grew to HKDollars
2.99bn from HKDollars 2.73bn.
NEW ZEALAND finished broadly lower as the recent jitters on the Tokyo stock
market again kept buyers on the sidelines. The approaching July 2
announcement of the government's annual budget is also having its
traditional dampening effect on the market. The NZSE-40 index closed 14.17
down at 1,516.36 and turnover eased to NZDollars 21.3m (NZDollars 23.9m).
Brierley Investments lost 3 cents to 96 cents in volume of 4.2m, the most
active issue in the market. There have been rumours that it is planning to
sell some or all of its 16 per cent stake in Carter Holt Harvey to
International Paper, of the US, which already owns an equal stake in CHH.
TAIWAN declined in active trading as strong early gains were eroded by
steady selling pressure. The weighted index dipped 7.18 to 4,690.48 in
turnover of TDollars 61.5bn (TDollars 49.2bn).
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index added 7.6 at 1,643.9 in turnover of
ADollars 266m, after ADollars 175m, as some large lines of shares were dealt
on the market. Gold mining issues rose in line with an increase in the
bullion price.
MANILA tumbled on profit-taking after news that the Philippine Congress late
on Monday had proclaimed Mr Fidel Ramos, the former defence secretary, as
the next president. The composite index dropped 65.68 to 1,453.86 in
turnover of 190m pesos, after 245m.
The Dollars 2 3/4 fall to Dollars 35 3/8 in PLDT in overnight US trading
caused other commercial and industrial issues to decline.
KUALA LUMPUR ended mixed after light trading. The composite index was off
0.53 at 593.52. In SINGAPORE, shares closed little changed as cautious
sentiment kept most investors away. The Straits Times Industrial index
firmed 1.86 to 1,490.64. Turnover rose to SDollars 144.6m from SDollars
78.6m.
Activity centred on the re-listed Goldtron, formerly Gold Coin, which was
taken over by Acma Holdings. Some 98.2m shares were traded, the majority of
which were said to be placed by Acma. Blocks were traded at between 59.4 and
68 cents a share.
DHAKA extended its upward trend in heavy trading, encouraged by the
Bangladesh government's decision to waive gains tax on shares and securities
from July 1. The all-share index climbed 5.2 to 347.7.

FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Seoul's revival hindered by economic
problems - A look at the ailing equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government's efforts to revive the ailing Seoul stock
market are a study in frustration. The index has tumbled by more than 40 per
cent in the past three years and on Monday sank to its lowest closing level
in almost five years. Since the beginning of the year it has declined by 8.6
per cent, ending yesterday at 559.
Indeed, the recent plunge would have been even steeper if the government's
stock market stabilisation fund had not intervened. But the fund may prove
less effective in breaking future falls since its reserves have dwindled to
less than Won300bn (Dollars 380m) out of its original Won5,000bn budget.
Some analysts are now forecasting that the index will decline a further 10
per cent in coming weeks to around the 500 mark.
The chief economic adviser to President Roh Tae Woo is now recommending that
the government abandons further efforts to boost the market, although the
Ministry of Finance favours continued intervention.
The issue is a sensitive one in an election year since the government
worries about decreased support among middle-class voters if the market does
not recover.
The government had hoped that its Dollars 4.1bn rescue in late May of three
troubled investment trust companies used by 1m small investors would
encourage them to return to the market. Declining interest among
individuals, who account for more than 50 per cent of share ownership, has
caused trading volume to be halved in June.
Moreover, foreign interest is on the wane. The opening of the market at the
beginning of the year to direct foreign investment briefly led to an equity
rally in January and February. After reaching a peak of 691 the index
gradually receded and foreign buying now stands at only 30 per cent of the
January level.
One of the reasons has been the 10 per cent limit placed on foreign
ownership of shares. The authorities have respon-ded by lifting the ceiling
to 25 per cent from next week.
In a further attempt to attract more foreign money, the government has also
announced that foreigners will be able to acquire an 8 per cent holding in
either Pohang Iron &amp; Steel or Korea Electric Power Corporation. Together the
two companies account for almost 13 per cent of total market capitalisation.
These actions, however, do not go to the heart of the problems: a declining
confidence in the economy and the uncertain political situation.
Economic growth is slowing, causing a spate of bankruptcies, including 15
listed concerns so far this year. Corporate earnings have fallen to a
10-year low, while inflation remains high.
The political outlook is clouded with the possibility that as many as five
candidates will stand in December's presidential election. The front-runner,
Mr Kim Young Sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, could face an
unco-operative parliament if he is elected, further weakening the
government's ability to solve the economic problems.
With interest rates at 17 per cent, domestic investors prefer the better
yields offered by the corporate bond market. Liquidity has also been
squeezed by the fall in land prices.
Most analysts believe that the market will not stage a recovery for another
three to six months.
Optimists argue, however, that the general share index, which is weighted
towards large capitalised companies, does not tell the whole story of the
market's performance this year. Equity prices for small and medium-sized
companies have risen about 30 per cent, led by the foreigners' hunt for
bargains. But there are signs that interest in these shares is also tapering
off as their price/earnings ratios climb.
Mr Duke Shin, an analyst with Baring Securities, says: 'The market could
turn around with a perceived improvement in economic fundamentals.'
There are signs that this is happening, with the likelihood that the
economic slowdown and a tight monetary policy will lead to reduced interest
rates by the year-end.
Analysts, however, still worry that a rally could be cut short around the
800 level as institutional investors, including the stabilisation fund and
the investment trusts, unload extensive share portfolios in an attempt to
improve their financial position.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Equity Issues: Grasim delays issue launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRASIM, the Indian cement, textiles and fibre group which was hoping to
raise Dollars 90m through an international equity offering this week, has
had to delay pricing and launching the issue following the recent halt in
trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange in connection with the Indian financial
scandal.
Grasim is the second Indian company to plan an international equity
offering, following Reliance, the petrochemicals group which raised Dollars
150m in an equity offering last month.
Mr Ralph Fox, head of the equity syndicate at Citicorp, the lead manager to
the Grasim offering, said the offering 'would be placed on hold until the
Bombay stock market reopens and trading stabilises'.
Grasim has already said it will not increase the size of the equity offering
above Dollars 100m following complaints about Reliance's decision to
increase its issue from Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m.
The decision to increase the size of the Reliance issue annoyed some
investors who had hoped to be rewarded with a premium on the global
depositary shares once trading started. Reliance saw a sharp fall in its
share price after the international offering - from its pricing of Dollars
16.35 on May 26 to as low as Dollars 10.50 on June 18.

as growth slows

<TEXT>
SWIFT, the interbank financial telecommunications organisation, is worried
it is losing customers among the banks to new internal bank networks and
other telecommunications companies.
Growth in the core business of Swift, which transmits fixed format
electronic messages on payments to banks within its network, slowed in 1991
in spite of the introduction of an expensive new network with increased
message capacity.
Mr Eric Chiltern, group payments director of Barclays Bank who has just been
appointed chairman of Swift, said the company needed a clearer idea of its
future direction.
He is setting up an 11-member policy committee to decide on a new market
strategy.
'We are at a watershed in the banking industry. Everyone is moving over into
other branches and saying 'I can do things' like telecommunications,' Mr
Chiltern added.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Hitachi appoints foreign
pension fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment advisory companies have scored a significant victory in
their long-standing battle to break into Japanese corporate pension fund
management.
Hitachi, the electronics combine and controller of Japan's largest corporate
pension fund, has awarded pension fund management contracts to the Tokyo
subsidiaries of two British companies - Invesco MIM and Mercury Asset
Management, an affiliate of the S G Warburg financial group.
Hitachi is the third company to hire foreign investment advisers.
The first was Nagasakiya, a medium-sized retail group, which awarded funds
to Invesco MIM earlier this year. This was followed by Toyota Motor which
gave a contract to Merrill Lynch International Capital Management.
However, since Toyota holds a 40 per cent stake in Merrill Lynch Capital
Management, Hitachi has become the first top-rank blue-chip Japanese company
to award pension fund management contracts to independent foreign advisers.
Invesco MIM and Mercury will each be awarded around Y1bn (Dollars 7.8m). Ten
other fund management groups, all Japanese, will also receive management
contracts.
However, foreign investment managers believe that, despite Hitachi's
decision, winning pension fund management contracts will still be difficult
for foreign companies.
Under government regulations, companies can award to newly-appointed fund
managers only a proportion of the new money flowing in - they cannot
reapportion assets already parcelled out to their long-established fund
managers. Hitachi's Y1bn contracts with Invesco MIM and Mercury are a small
fraction of its total pension fund of about Y400bn.
Also, foreign fund managers complain that Japanese companies continue to
award fund management contracts to financial groups with which they already
have other kinds of dealings, such as banking or securities business.
Foreign fund managers believe that attitudes are changing, but only slowly.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Burton paper backed by deal to sell
property portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTON Group, the UK retailer, yesterday raised Pounds 60m (Dollars 108m)
from a bond issue backed by an agreement to sell its remaining property
portfolio to institutional investors.
The deal provides Burton with cash to repay bank borrowings and a guaranteed
exit from the UK property market after five years.
The five-year zero-coupon bonds, issued by Redcastle, a group subsidiary,
have a redemption value of Pounds 100m but were sold to investors at 60.98
per cent of face value. The funds to redeem the paper will come from the
sale of Burton's property portfolio, comprising six retail and office
developments.
Scottish Amicable and CIN Properties, the property arm of the British Coal
pension funds, have agreed to buy the properties for Pounds 100m in 1997 if
there is no sale before this date. The institutions received a fee for
'underwriting' the sale of the properties at this level.
After legal and underwriting expenses and the fees paid to the two
institutions, the issue provides Burton with fixed-rate sterling funding at
a cost of around 10.8 per cent. Mr Richard North, Burton finance director,
said the proceeds of the issue would be used to repay bank debt. Burton did
not replace a Pounds 250m multi-option syndicated loan facility which
matured last month, relying instead on bi-lateral bank facilities.
In August, the group must pay Pounds 150m to holders of convertible bonds,
which carry an investor put option at a premium to face value. The proceeds
of yesterday's issue will free bank credit lines to meet the repayment.
'The deal improves our funding mix and extends the maturity of our debt. The
zero coupon structure also offers us a considerable cash-flow advantage,'
said Mr North.
The credit quality of the issue hangs on the strength of the agreement with
Scottish Amicable and CIN Properties to buy the six properties. Mr North
said the company had spent months structuring the deal with lawyers to
ensure the undertaking was unconditional.
Warburg Securities, which placed most of the bonds with UK institutional
investors, priced the paper to yield around 90 basis points more than UK
government bonds of similar maturity. There are no comparable issues
outstanding. However, the yield spread is close to the level at which
building society bonds trade in the secondary market.
The properties were valued in Burton's last accounts at Pounds 100m. Mr
North said the company would make no accounting adjustment until properties
were actually sold.
Elsewhere, the mainstream international bond market remained subdued.
Depressed conditions in most European bond markets and an auction of
Treasury stock in the US kept potential borrowers on the sidelines.
Council of Europe issued Dollars 80m floating-rate paper under its
medium-term note programme. Following the recent trend, the issue was fully
underwritten by the dealers to the programme, lead-managed by Lehman
Brothers.
The two-year paper pays the three-month London interbank offered rate,
subject to an upper limit of 5 1/4 per cent for the first year and 6 1/2 per
cent in the second year.
North of England Building Society yesterday became the smallest UK mutual
savings institution to raise core capital with an issue of permanent
interest bearing shares (Pibs).
The 21st-largest building society by assets, it placed Pounds 20m undated
shares with UK institutional investors at a yield spread of 350 basis points
over long-dated gilt-edged securities. The placing was arranged and
underwritten by Charterhouse.

<TEXT>
SAMSUNG, South Korea's largest conglomerate, yesterday applied for
government permission to become the country's sixth vehicle manufacturer.
Samsung Heavy Industries, the group's shipbuilding unit, plans to produce
construction vehicles, such as concrete mixers and dump trucks, in technical
co-operation with Nissan Diesel of Japan.
Samsung's entry into the vehicle sector is being opposed by the nation's
five automotive companies, Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia, Asia and Ssangyong.
They suspect that Samsung wants to move eventually into the nation's already
crowded passenger car industry, although Samsung denies it has any such
intention.
The government has 20 days to rule on Samsung's application to import truck
technology from Nissan. Two previous attempts by Samsung to enter the
vehicle industry were blocked by the government. But officials indicated
yesterday that Samsung will be allowed to proceed this time.
Samsung will spend Won72bn (Dollars 90m) on the project, which will include
the construction of a factory near its shipbuilding yards in Changwon.
Production will begin in 1994 with 1,200 trucks, rising to 3,360 vehicles by
1997.
Samsung will export more than 40 per cent of its trucks. It said the
manufacture of construction vehicles was an extension of its production of
other construction equipment.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, and Apple Computer, the US
personal computer maker, yesterday joined forces to develop a
next-generation portable consumer electronics product capable of reproducing
video images and sound from a small laser disc.
The agreement is an important plank in Apple's strategy of developing a
range of hand-held, digital electronic devices as an adjunct to its basic
business. Apple calls the devices 'personal digital assistants'.
For Toshiba, the agreement opens the possibility of reviving growth in the
company's flagging consumer electronics business. Over the past year,
Toshiba has quietly withdrawn all its audio products, such as tape recorders
and stereo systems, although it remains a large manufacturer of televisions
and white goods.
The companies yesterday had little specific information about the planned
product, except that it would be marketed by the middle of next year and be
based on CD-ROM, compact discs with read-only memory. The companies were
also talking to Time Warner, the media conglomerate in which Toshiba has a
6.25 per cent stake, about providing titles to play on the machines.
Very likely, the machine will have a small display, be capable of
reproducing moving video images, and allow for interaction with the user.
The companies hoped to sell 5m of the devices annually by 1995.
The market for the type of product that Apple and Toshiba have in mind,
however, has yet to be established, and is already becoming crowded with
potentially competing devices. Indeed, Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman, said
Apple would launch a consumer CD-ROM device before Christmas, and it was
unclear yesterday how, or whether, the two products would be related.
Philips has already launched a CD-I (CD interactive) format that has failed
to stimulate much interest in the market. Yesterday, Philips and JVC, said
they would further develop the format for use as a motion picture singalong
karaoke system. Sony has also successfully launched its Data Discman, an
electronic book device that allows for simple interactive functions.
A basic problem facing all makers of such machines is the lack of appealing
software, or titles to play. Both Nintendo and Sega Enterprises have
successfully launched CD-ROM machines for games. CDs have attracted
attention because they can store a huge amount of textual, video, or audio
data while allowing almost instant access.
Apple is trying to generate excitement about the devices among consumers,
and is hoping to use its expertise in software development and user
interaction to produce a machine that stimulates demand and establishes a de
facto industry standard.
Apple said it selected Toshiba as a partner because of Toshiba's expertise
in semiconductors and miniaturisation, and because of its links with Time
Warner. Toshiba also has experience in the consumer electronics field, which
Apple lacks.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hewlett buys TI minicomputer
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-PACKARD is to acquire Texas Instruments' minicomputer business in a
bid to expand its customer base in the commercial Unix minicomputer market.
The companies said that they have signed a letter of intent and expect to
complete the transaction this autumn.
Terms of the deal were not revealed. However, the annual revenues of the TI
business unit are said to be about Dollars 200m, according to industry
estimates. TI said that the unit had operated profitably for the past two
quarters.
'This is the latest step in our strategy to aggressively expand our position
in the commercial Unix market,' said Mr Lewis Platt, H-P executive
vice-president.
H-P is the leader in the Unix minicomputer market. The acquisition will
enable H-P to accelerate sales in a slow growth market by tapping into TI's
base of 125,000 customers worldwide and gaining access to market segments
such as retail and wholesales distribution in which it has not previously
participated.
Also attractive to H-P is TI's network of value added resellers (VARs). TI
has traditionally sold its computer systems almost exclusively through VARs
that include leaders in vertical markets such as automotive dealerships,
services, and health care.
H-P said that there is very little overlap between its own customer base and
that of TI, so it expects the acquisition to provide incremental business.
The planned sale give Texas Instruments an opportunity to focus more sharply
on its key businesses.
The electronics and semiconductor manufacturer will, however, retain other
parts of its information technology group including notebook computers and
printers.
H-P said that it will continue to support TI's minicomputer products and
will offer the products for as long as there is market demand. The company's
goal, however, is to gradually migrate TI's customers to H-P minicomputers.
The acquisition will lead to layoffs. H-P plans to employ approximately 450
of the 1,600 employees currently working for the TI computer systems and
services business unit.
Mr John White, TI vice-president and president of TI's information
technology group, said: 'The planned sales is consistent with TI's strategy
in information technology to concentrate our investment and emphasis on
software productivity tools, as well as on hardware where we have a
sustainable competitive advantage.'

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: LTV challenges labour deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LTV, the large US steelmaker which has been operating under the protection
of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code for the past six years, said that its
steel unit had asked the bankruptcy court for authority to reject its labour
agreement with the United Steelworkers of America (USW).
The union speedily retaliated, however, threatening industrial action if the
current collective bargaining agreement is thrown out. 'We have repeatedly
told the company that if its petition results in the rejection of our labour
contract, a work stoppage would follow,' said Mr Anthony Rainaldi, chairman
of the union's negotiating committee.
'There is no question that the company risks committing suicide with this
step, and the negotiating differences between us do not warrant that risk,'
he said.
The increased tension comes in the wake of an LTV reorganisation plan, which
was hammered out earlier this year and appeared likely to win the backing of
the group's leading creditors. If implemented, this would finally allow the
company to emerge from bankruptcy. However, the plan pegged creditors'
recoveries to union concessions, and management at LTV's steel division has
subsequently held a series of talks with the USW.
Under US bankruptcy law, a debtor can, with court approval, reject a labour
agreement if negotiations fail to produce an acceptable new accord. It can
then effectively impose its own terms.
LTV said 'deep fundamental differences' still separated the union and the
management positions, even after the latest round of bargaining which
started on May 18. It added, however, that it was committed to 'good faith
bargaining' and did not intend to implement 'unilateral modifications to the
labour agreement' until the outcome of the sale of its aerospace and defence
division was certain.
By contrast, the union claimed that LTV had walked out of negotiations, and
accused the company of 'stubbornly sticking to all of its concession
demands, both for active and retired workers'. It said it was making
'preparations for the upcoming fight'.
When LTV first raised the possibility of revoking the labour contract in
April, the union said that it would not permit the wages and benefits of its
members and pensioners 'to be held hostage'.
'If the company persists in its misguided strategy, there will be serious
repercussions in the plants and the marketplace,' it warned in April.

THE STRENGTH of demand for an exposure to the Chinese economy was underlined
yesterday when investors stumped up nearly HKDollars 30bn (USDollars 3.8bn)
in their rush to buy a slice of Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, a
Taiwanese-controlled manufacturer of sports shoes in southern China.
The Yue Yuen new issue was for 550m shares of HKDollars 1.18 to raise
HKDollars 649m. Last night, the company's advisers, Standard Chartered Asia,
said the issue, for 25 per cent of the company, was 45.39 times
oversubscribed.
The company, which is controlled by Mr Tsai Chi Jen and his brother Mr Tsai
Chi Neng, manufactures Adidas, Nike, and Reebok sports shoes, among others,
at its Dongguan factory, south of Guangzhou (Canton).
It plans to open another factory in the city of Zhongshan, also in Guangdong
province.
The brothers will retain 70 per cent of the company. A further 5 per cent
has been placed privately by Jardine Fleming.
Mr Ambrose Lam, director of corporate finance at Standard Chartered Asia,
said the market was attracted to Yue Yuen because it was a pure China stock.
It was well-managed and achieved high margins.

ABN Amro, the Netherlands' biggest bank, is close to reaching an agreement
to sell its domestic travel agency business to Holland International, the
country's biggest travel group. Holland International is 80 per cent owned
by Kaufhof, the German retailer, writes Ronald van de Krol.
The bank's travel business generates annual turnover of more than Fl 100m
(Dollars 56.5m) and comprises five travel agencies in Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
Utrecht, Nijmegen and Groningen, as well as a business travel bureau.
ABN Amro had said in March that it planned to sell the travel business but
it did not identify the likely buyer.
In addition, its German majority shareholder, Holland International is
partly-owned by the Dutch railway, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the Nedlloyd
transport group.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Giat turns in FFr400m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIAT Industries, the French state-owned armaments maker, yesterday revealed
a 1991 loss of FFr400m (Dollars 75.9m) and said it would have to shed 2,000
of its 17,000 jobs to adjust to reduced defence spending.
The loss compares with a FFr600m deficit in 1990 and is the first time the
formerly secretive Giat has published its results. It was transformed two
years ago from a defence ministry agency into a semi-autonomous state-owned
company.
The defence industry faced 'severe rationalisation' and job losses would
accelerate, said Mr Pierre Chiquet, chairman. He warned that the outlook for
the group this year was more difficult than in 1991, but maintained that
Giat would still hit its target of breaking even in 1993.
The group, which manufactures the Leclerc battle tank, has been attempting
to boost exports to soften the impact of the downturn. The French army is
expected to buy 800 tanks.
Giat's reduced losses were made on turnover up from FFr6.2bn to FFr11.3bn
over the same period. However, the sales increase mostly reflects the
first-time inclusion of FN Herstahl, the Belgian arms maker bought at the
end of 1990, and Manurhin and Luchaire, two French ammunitions groups.

REPOLA, Finland's largest industrial group, yesterday reported a loss (after
financial items) of FM118m (Dollars 27.7m) for the first four months of the
year, compared with a FM206m loss in the same period of 1991.
Operating profit rose to FM478m from FM311, with the group's three
industrial groups - pulp and paper, plastic packaging and metal and
engineering products - showing improvement. Operating profit for the United
Paper Mills forestry arm rose to FM421m from FM230m a year earlier, while
the group made a strong recovery in metals and engineering, posting a FM48m
profit against a FM55m loss.
The improvement was due to a number of factors, including cost-cutting, the
elimination of unprofitable operations and the devaluation of the Finnish
markka last November.
Consolidated sales rose by 22 per cent to FM8.46bn from FM6.92bn a year
earlier. The group's equity-to-assets ratio at the end of April was 27.5 per
cent, against 28 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Renault, Volvo ventures
strengthen cars alliance
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-owned carmaker, and Volvo, its Swedish partner,
are to strengthen their alliance by pooling most of their car component
purchasing and all their quality control activities.
The companies have agreed to set up two joint ventures in component-buying
and quality control to 'put together the respective resources of Renault and
Volvo Car Corporation so as to act as if the two groups were one company,'
the French company said.
This is one of the biggest steps in the Renault-Volvo alliance since the
pair agreed to take cross-shareholdings in each others' parents and
subsidiaries two years ago. But it was not a prelude to a full merger of the
groups' car and truckmaking businesses, added Renault. Shortly before
retiring last month, Mr Raymond Levy, the former chairman, said a merger was
possible, but such a course was not the only way to increase co-operation
with Volvo.
The components move will boost the economies of scale already achieved by
helping the partners to secure bigger discounts from suppliers. They now
jointly buy 15 per cent of their components from common makers through a
committee set up in October 1990. The companies hoped to lift that figure to
80 per cent very shortly, said Renault.
Renault spends FFr50bn (Dollars 9.46bn) a year on buying components,
representing 60 per cent of its manufacturing costs. Volvo's components bill
stands at FFr14bn. If the two reached their 80 per cent target, they would
pool FFr51.2bn of annual spending.
Before yesterday's announcement, Volvo estimated that in two to five years
it would save SKr800m (Dollars 141.6m) annually from joint component buying
alone. Renault has not put a figure to its savings in this area, but
estimates it has saved FFr1bn on development costs by using some Volvo
engines.
The joint venture on quality control aims to ensure the partners use common
methods and standards. It applies to the manufacturing process as well as to
finished cars. Along with the components venture, it builds on existing
co-operation - a joint quality management board set up last September.
Both operations will be based in Paris under management to be chosen on
merit from either partner. They will be set up as European economic interest
groupings, a streamlined structure set up under EC law to encourage
cross-frontier alliances.
Neither of the joint activities would apply to the partners' truckmaking
divisions, which have fewer suppliers in common, said Renault.
To date, the partners have created a joint research centre in France;
partially merged their sales divisions for French cars and light commercial
vehicles; and co-operated in the production of two buses.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft falls 27% and restructuring
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based group which last week announced a severe
dividend curtailment to dampen expectations ahead of its results, yesterday
reported a 27 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.49m for the year
to end-March.
The figure for the previous year amounted to Pounds 6.11m before taking into
account an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.3m.
Whitecroft is undergoing a reconstruction to get through the recession. It
is still disengaging from property but has largely completed reorganisation
of its lighting, building products, medical cotton fibre and textiles
businesses, with cost savings now likely.
The final dividend curtailment to 0.7p making a 4p (10p) total, resulted
from an extraordinary item, an extra Pounds 8m gross provision for
withdrawal from property development. The figure worked out at Pounds 6.43m
net and was on top of a Pounds 5m net provision made last year.
The commercial property portfolio has now been revalued at Pounds 20m.
Whitecroft sold its housebuilding division in January, reducing borrowings
by Pounds 6m. The ongoing sales of houses retained are expected to bring in
Pounds 4m, with another Pounds 800,000 of deferred consideration to come.
Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said all construction was completed and several
lettings had now been achieved.
The biggest single development was a complex of shops and offices in
Sheffield. Smaller ones were mainly scattered in the Thames Valley. Likely
prices would be balanced against financing costs to optimise future
disposals.
On the pre-tax line the pre-tax comparison of Pounds 6.11m has been restated
as Pounds 2.81m following the Accounting Standards Board's new consensus on
restructuring costs. This required Whitecroft to charge restructuring of its
textiles division to the 1990-91 current account, although one gain was to
reduce last year's tax bill by Pounds 1m.
Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 129.19m and operating profits 48 per
cent to Pounds 4.6m. However, sustained investment in computer aided design
and flexible manufacturing systems enabled the lighting division to make a
profit of Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 6.68m) in spite of recession.
It used technology to process larger numbers of smaller orders efficiently
as big orders for office blocks withered. The niche market, medical cotton
fibres business, fell slightly to Pounds 1.79m, while textiles - a dyeing,
finishing and coatings business - held at Pounds 700,000.
Building products lost Pounds 1.02m after breaking even last year. Demand
fell for textured wallcoatings, but Mr Goold was expecting good progress
from high performance, fire-resistant doors as safety regulations push up
standards in offices and public buildings.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Costain seeks cash in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the troubled British construction, mining and property group, is
seeking to raise more cash by selling a stake in its profitable Australian
coal mining subsidiary.
The group failed to pay a final dividend after making a pre-tax loss last
year of Pounds 69.2m. It sold its British investment property portfolio in
December for Pounds 101.3m in a move to reduce its large borrowings.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, yesterday confirmed that the group
planned to seek a listing for its Australian coal mining business and sell
part of its shareholding in it later this year.
Bain Capital Markets, the Australian investment bank, has agreed to
underwrite the issue on the Australian Stock Exchange.
The group said yesterday that it was seeking to take advantage of the growth
in the value of its Australian business and the current strength of local
share prices.
Last year Costain reduced its net debt by Pounds 143m to Pounds 168m cutting
gearing from more than 100 per cent to 53 per cent. The figures, however,
excluded Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet debt on the proposed Spitalfields
office development in east London and Pounds 38m of convertible preference
shares.
Its Australian coal mining subsidiary has been estimated to be worth Pounds
130m based on current reserves and coal prices.
Costain's US coal mining operations, where it is also thought to have
considered selling a stake, are twice as large in terms of annual output but
were less profitable than the Australian business last year.
Lower profits in the US were due to a combination of recession, a mild
winter and uncertainty over the US Clean Air Act.
The Australian coal mining subsidiary has the contract to extract coal from
Ravensworth open cast mine in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and has a
28.4 per cent stake in a consortium which owns the nearby Warkworth mine.
The two mines last year produced about 7m tonnes of coal, 9 per cent more
than in 1990, generating an operating profit thought to be between Pounds
15m and Pounds 20m.
Overall, group coal mining profits - after taking into account the
reductions in the US - declined by 24 per cent from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds
33.6m.
Costain, in addition to its Ravensworth and Warkworth interests, has a 50
per cent stake in a joint venture which has won contracts at nearby Narama
to extract coal and supply 2m tonnes a year for 20 years to the New South
Wales Electricity Commission.
Costain also owns a 25 per cent stake in a consortium prospect coal reserves
at Bengalla, also in New South Wales, which the group estimates could
produce 6m tonnes a year by the late 1990s.

<TEXT>
VAUX GROUP, the Sunderland-based brewer which has interests in hotels and
nursing homes, has acquired 124 pubs from Inntrepreneur Estates, for Pounds
15m.
In early April Vaux bought 85 pubs from Inntrepreneur and 28 from Whitbread
in a Pounds 13.5m deal. At that time Vaux said it intended to increase its
pub estate to 1,000 properties.
The current acquisition brings the number of pubs now owned by Vaux to 988
and strengthens its position in the north west of England and Yorkshire.
Some 84 of the pubs will be operated from Vaux Breweries in Sunderland, the
brewing subsidiary of the group, and 40 from SH Ward in Sheffield.
The vendor, Inntrepreneur, is a joint venture between Grand Metropolitan and
Foster's Brewing.

Sir, I would like to answer the question posed by Mr Bryan Cassidy (Letters,
June 11), namely, 'isn't a referendum a denial of the sovereignty of
parliament?'
My answer is no. It cannot be a denial of sovereignty as only parliament can
instigate its use. It is presumably intended for use, at parliament's
discretion, to decide an issue of importance which requires a black and
white decision and for which public opinion is unclear to parliament.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: Alternatives to violence - CSCE commitments
to protect national minorities must be linked to economic benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news from central and eastern Europe gets more depressing every week:
The long agony of Bosnia-Hercegovina continues, while it is anyone's guess
whether the next Yugoslav war will erupt in Kosovo or in Macedonia, or both
at once. In either case the chances of containing it within the frontiers of
the old Yugoslavia seem slim.
Czechs and Slovaks agree to break up a state which had seemed one of the
most hopeful and civilised in the region. At least there is no bloodshed
between them, so far; but the dissolution of the state, combined with the
problem of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, the bitter Slovak-Hungarian
dispute over the Danube dam, and lurking Hungarian aspirations to recover
territory lost after the first world war, provides all the ingredients for a
pre-1939-style border conflict. And Hungary could at any moment find itself
in a similar conflict with Serbia or Romania.
In Georgia and Moldova separatist groups look to remnants of the Soviet army
for support, and President Boris Yeltsin threatens Russian intervention if
fighting continues. The Baltic states and Ukraine, still hosts to unwanted
Russian troops as well as large Russian-speaking minorities, look nervously
on. Fighting continues between Armenians and Azeris in and around
Nagorno-Karabakh. Within the Russian federation Chechen-Ingushetia and other
ethnic enclaves are defying the central government.
Throughout the region, high unemployment is eroding support for economic
reform, while politicians are locked in Byzantine power struggles
incomprehensible to ordinary people, but often envenomed by selective
leaking of 'evidence' from secret police files.
It all seems a far cry from the euphoric autumn of 1989, even if few really
imagined at that time that history had ended and we should all live happily
ever after. In fact just about every one of these problems was foreseen
then, which makes it all the more frustrating that so little seems to have
been done to solve them.
Of course many east and central European politicians are behaving very
foolishly, and they should not be allowed to escape responsibility for the
tragic consequences of their actions. Nor is it true that the west has done
nothing. Significant sums of money have been and are being provided. Not
adequate sums, perhaps, but what would have been adequate? Even the
extraordinary transfers from west to east Germany seem barely to suffice,
and assistance on that scale to the whole of eastern Europe, including the
former Soviet Union, would imply trillions of dollars annually.
One area where the west, and especially the European Community, has clearly
fallen short is market access. Even the three central European states which
have signed association agreements find the west European market all but
impenetrable to goods they can produce at competitive prices, such as steel
and food; and that in turn discourages private investment.
A more generous policy in that respect might not yet have had a direct
impact on living standards; but it would have contributed to a more hopeful
atmosphere in the region, in which the inevitable ethnic conflicts might
have been easier to defuse. Above all, I believe that a greater effort
should have been made to link western assistance to intraregional
co-operation, building on the example of the Marshall Plan.
That applies to co-operation between states, but could also apply to
inter-communal relations within states. In the case of Croatia the EC
tragically missed its opportunity: for a long time it refused to contemplate
recognition and then, when war had been raging for months, it rushed to
recognise, brushing aside its own arbitration committee's report that
conditions on minority rights and civil liberties, formally set by the EC
itself, were not yet adequately fulfilled. Had those conditions been posed
at the outset they might have given the EC some real leverage over the Croat
leadership, and hence also some credibility in the eyes of the Serbs. But
then a similar error was perpetrated in the Bosnian case, recognition being
made conditional not on agreement between the communities but on a
referendum which only dramatised and polarised the difference between them.
Since similar conflicts are now erupting or about to erupt in many other
parts of central and eastern Europe, it is not too late to learn some
lessons from the Croat and Bosnian tragedies. Slovakia resembles Croatia in
many respects. It will need recognition and help from the EC, and that fact
must be used to ensure that the Hungarian minority is adequately represented
and protected, and that disputes between Slovakia and Hungary are settled
peacefully.
In the former Soviet Union, it is becoming very urgent to dissuade Mr
Yeltsin, who is clearly under intense pressure from Russian nationalists,
from behaving like the Serbian leader, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. If he imagines
that his new love affair with Washington would survive a Russian military
intervention in Moldova or Georgia he should be disabused without delay.
The problem of the Russian minorities in other ex-Soviet republics is a real
one, but the worst possible solution would be a series of Russian military
expeditions to support them. The Russian foreign ministry is aware of this,
and has been seeking alternative solutions, notably by supporting measures
to give stronger international protection to minority rights at the Helsinki
follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE), which is now nearing its climax.
The Dutch proposal to appoint a CSCE high commissioner on national
minorities, whose job would be to give early warning and where appropriate
take 'early action' to defuse minority issues that threaten to develop into
conflict, is now the subject of detailed negotiations and has a good chance
of being adopted. So has a British proposal to expand the range of available
procedures for resolving disputes, including disputes within states, 'which
have the potential to develop into armed conflict'. (Since most such
disputes in Europe involve national minorities, the two proposals are
closely related.)
A further step, which might be considered at a future meeting, would be to
establish a prototype agreement between a national minority, the state where
it resides, and the state (if any) with which it has an ethnic or linguistic
affinity. Such an agreement could spell out the obligations as well as the
rights of the minority, and enable the 'protecting' state to contribute to a
solution of the problem without questioning the sovereignty or borders of
the state in which the minority lives. No state could be obliged to sign it,
and in each case the parties could agree to vary its precise terms to suit
their particular circumstances; but having a standard prototype available
might give both sides greater confidence that they had something to gain
from a negotiated solution.
But all such devices depend ultimately on the willingness of parties in
dispute to make use of them, and to avoid resorting to violence. Too often
the slide to war outpaces the diplomats, whose good intentions are nullified
by political pressures at home. In such situations CSCE commitments will
only be taken seriously if states that have something to offer - the US,
Japan, above all the EC - make a clear connection between observance of
those commitments and tangible economic benefit.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: Air fare competition impossible if airlines remain
subsidised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS MCDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Great expectations and hopes were kindled in the minds of the
travelling public by talks on liberalisation of air transport in Europe,
particularly in regard to cheaper fares.
Most thought that what had happened in the US would also happen in Europe
with competition being keener and with fares accordingly being reduced.
However, what has happened in Europe has been very much a damp squib from
the consumer's point of view for the simple reason that air transport in
Europe is organised very differently from that in the US, in that it is
dominated by national airlines, most of which are technically bankrupt and
losing vast sums of taxpayers' money because of overstaffing and
inefficiency.
There is little or no comp-etition on most routes, and certainly if the
fares were to reflect the operating costs of these airlines, they would be
much higher than they are at present. However, this does not prevent new
entrants being deterred by unfair competition, predatory pricing, capacity
saturation and denial of prime-time slots at major airports. Most new
entrants to the aviation business, attracted by liberalisation, are private
airlines. But private airlines whose motive is profit can-not compete in a
field where profit is a secondary consideration.
The European Commission, unfortunately, is understaffed and powerless to
enforce regulations which would ensure fair competition, and thus a fair
deal for consumers. In Europe at present there are roughly seven airlines
technically bankrupt, and these are Air France, Alitalia, Iberia, Olympic,
Aer Lingus, TAP and Sabena.
There will be no real competition and liberalisation as long as these
national airlines receive massive support from the various governments, a
support which is denied to the private sector.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: ERM debate in need of a proper airing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL OLIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf's timely rejoinder on the poor performance of nominal
domestic demand over the past five years ('Destabilising effects of exchange
rate stabilisation', June 22) is a welcome contribution on the ERM debate.
As Mr Wolf notes, not only did Mr Nigel Lawson's misplaced enthusiasm for
quasi-international monetarism impair the excellent inflation performance of
the early 1980s, but it again highlighted the potential Dies Irae for pegged
exchange rate systems.
Although the debate has supposedly moved on from the late-1980s and we are
now 'irrevocably' committed to the ERM, it would be foolish not to question
this pledge while the recovery remains sluggish. What is the point of a
policy framework which offers the promised elixir of low inflation, while
exacting the price of rising unemployment and poor growth?
Perhaps it is not so much the monetarists who are crying out for a return to
the past, but disgruntled economists from the 'golden age' haggling after
some form of parity fixing in a system which is fundamentally flawed.
Until the government gives a proper airing to this stultified debate
(preferably via a Treasury select committee), the reluctance to consider any
alternative exchange regimes will condemn the UK economy to an anaemic
monetary policy with persistent low rates of growth.

<TEXT>
Sir, We should not shed too many crocodile tears over the demise of the
National Economic Development Office. It was established in circumstances
and an environment quite different from that faced today.
The challenge to the Department of Trade and Industry in its new role will
come from strong and intensifying competition as European and global markets
become increasingly integrated. To promote the future competitiveness of the
UK economy will require radical thinking and original policy developments by
the Department of Trade and Industry. These will depend for their success on
unbiased, well-researched empirical facts and analysis.
I hope such independent research will play an increasing role in the
development of policies appropriate to the national and international
environment of the 1990s.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: Stress must be seen in the social context
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms DAWN LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Jenny Cozens' 'How stress can make you tick at work' (Management, June
19) is an informative account of developments of psychologists' work on
stress. However, as in much work on stress, she neglects contributions from
other disciplines such as sociology.
The renewed emphasis on the individual as a source of stress is not only
symbolic of 1980s individualism but, more important, consistent with
psychological analysis which considers individual psychology without an
understanding of social context. There is no recognition of the relationship
between the subjective experience of stress and the social conditions which
may give rise to it. Instead we are offered so-called 'objective'
measurements such as heart-rate or a discussion of personality variables.
Dealing with stress at work through the use of workplace counselling
services and stress management courses is commonplace in North America.
Increasingly, such facilities are being introduced in British work
organisations. Although employees may derive some genuine benefit from these
facilities, it is important to recognise their implications. By focusing on
the individual, questions of the structure and organisation of work are made
into personal problems. Psychologists would help employees more if they were
to counter rather than reinforce the prevalent but dangerous belief that
some people 'naturally' cope better than others.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: Too much re-packaging of education initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANSEL HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Training and Enterprise Council initiative - launched in March 1989
 -seemed to many to be essentially the re-packaging of earlier government
initiatives in the field of employment training and enterprise encouragement
that proliferated in the 1980s. They included the Manpower Services
Commission, Training Agencies, Enterprise Agencies, Local Employer Network
Service. It was expected, or hoped, that the Tecs might rationalise and
streamline many of them.
TECs have not enjoyed the most enthusiastic of comments from the various
constituencies they set out to serve. But for those of us who participated
in some of these earlier initiatives and the discussions leading up to the
establishment of Tecs, the news of a further initiative - Investors in
People (Iip) - leaves them, as it does the Tecs and as you said your article
'Setting standards for the working classes' (Management, June 17), 'confused
about how and to whom Iip should be marketed'.
British society has in place a recently much improved and up-dated
modernised educational medium, its colleges of further education. They are
beginning to make good the deficiency noted as long ago as 1868 by a Royal
Commission which commented on Britain's deficiency in technical education.
This once 'neglected sector' is today serving an increased population of
young people, of those returning to employment and those who have recognised
the need for continuing education.
I urge that, rather than further re-packaging of old initiatives, colleges
of further education be given the necessary support to deliver their
offerings even more effectively.
As a footnote I would add that while these initiatives continue to
proliferate, with the concomitant expenses and learning curves, this
college, funded by the London Borough of Brent, has a current budget
shortfall of Pounds 1m, the equivalent of 40 full-time staff.

FENNER, the industrial group, yesterday disclosed that Wassall, the
mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, had acquired a 1.6 per
cent stake. Fenner's shares yesterday rose 4p to close at 83p.
Mr Christopher Miller, chairman of Wassall, said: 'The stake has been taken
for investment purposes.' He declined to comment further.
Fenner is to close some of its power transmission division manufacturing
units in Hull with the loss of about 200 jobs.
The company said the move was in line with its strategy of reducing its cost
base to enhance its competitive position in the UK power transmission
market. Some 680 people are currently employed at Fenner's Hull power
transmission division.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ferranti loss reduced to Pounds 40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI International's disposals and cost cutting helped generate a small
cash inflow of Pounds 20.2m in the year to March 31, compared with an
outflow of Pounds 161.6m in the previous period.
Interest charges for the electronics group, which supplies advanced systems
for business, defence and the community, fell from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds
13.5m and exceptional charges, due to restructuring, were also lower at
Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 65.4m).
The pre-tax loss was therefore contained at Pounds 39.6m (Pounds 98.1m)
although turnover fell to Pounds 362.6m (Pounds 458m). This followed an
interim loss of Pounds 28.8m on sales of Pounds 212.4m. There was a loss per
share of 4p (11.5p) and no dividend is proposed.
Mr Eugene Anderson, the chairman and chief executive, said the
rationalisation programme had progressed satisfactorily, and by the year end
the workforce had been reduced by 41 per cent to 5,374.
The Pounds 41.1m recovered in relation to the International Signal and
Control fraud, which can be paid to special shareholders, will not be
distributed until Ferranti restores distributable reserves.
The year's losses required a Pounds 44.1m transfer from reserves, and
shareholders' funds fell to Pounds 71.9m (Pounds 112.5m).
COMMENT
Judging by yesterday's 17 per cent rise in the share price to 10 1/4 p,
Ferranti has just been promoted from write-off to recovery play. Although
Pounds 44.1m of attributable losses are hardly inspiring, the City seemed
prepared to breathe a sigh of relief at what might have been. But while the
company's survival now seems more secure, it remains reliant on an
unfashionable defence sector for more than half its earnings. And the main
problem for investors is how to value a company which has been forced to
sell its family silver. Nevertheless, the company is forecast to break even
this year, perhaps rising to Pounds 10m profits in 1994. On the basis of
turnover and longer-term earnings, the shares can go higher. But on the
basis of assets, they look about right.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Capital restructure for NSM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NSM, the heavily-indebted international coal mining group, yesterday
announced plans for a capital reorganisation.
It also reported a Pounds 5.7m loss before tax for the year to end March
compared with previous profits of Pounds 3.7m.
The loss was inflated by a Pounds 3.4m exceptional item relating to the
rescission of a land sale contract.
Preference and ordinary dividends are being passed - in the previous
financial year ordinary dividends totalled 0.5p. Losses per share of 0.44p
compared with earnings of 0.84p.
A proposed equity restructuring, which will give preference shareholders 80
per cent of the new share capital, will be put to an extraordinary general
meeting.
Group borrowings fell from Pounds 95m to Pounds 87m against shareholders'
funds of Pounds 50m.
The group said it was planning to dispose of further non-core businesses
worth between Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m. Last year it sold Bison, its
building materials arm, for Pounds 30.7m.
Extraordinary items of Pounds 89.2m related mainly to goodwill that arose on
the purchase of Bison and its subsidiaries. The loss does not affect net
assets because the goodwill was originally written-off at the time of
purchase.
The group's annual interest charge increased to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 9m)
since the Bison sale was only completed in December.
Mr John Jermine, chief executive, said: 'We are now a coal mining business
in the UK and the US. There will not be any more diversification into other
areas.'
The group is hoping to benefit from the government's planned privatisation
of British Coal. Mr Jermine said he would be asking ministers to end the
Pounds 5 a ton royalty payment to BC.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds
147.3m (Pounds 185.9m).
The UK mining division, which is one of the country's largest opencast coal
contractors, generated revenues of Pounds 63.5m (Pounds 54.5m). The US coal
division sold 3m tons of coal compared to 2.8m tons.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Halma moves ahead to Pounds 15.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER LAST year's blip in its almost unblemished 19-year growth record,
Halma, the safety and environmental control group, returned to its upward
path in the year to March 28 with pre-tax profits 17 per cent ahead at
Pounds 15.5m.
The rise from Pounds 13.3m was struck on turnover up 15 per cent from Pounds
81.9m to Pounds 94.5m. Furthermore the company was proud to point out that a
survey on the size and consistency of dividend increases put Halma at the
top of the list with 13 years of annual increases of at least 20 per cent.
This 14th time the total dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 2.195p (1.755p)
with a recommended final dividend of 1.332p (1.065p).
Mr David Barber, chairman and managing director, explained that the previous
year's 6 per cent slip in profits from Pounds 14.1m - due mainly to
recession in the UK and the US - had in fact helped Halma this time.
He said that when profits fell at a 'self-propelled' company like Halma,
this ensured and encouraged management action which in turn led to growth in
the following period.
The spread of businesses helped protect the company which could target
acquisi-tion possibilities within its area of management expertise and then
move into those markets.
Expansion by acquisition was the other factor behind the resumption of
Halma's growth.
All had gone well, said Mr Barber. It bought: Tradinco, the Dutch pressure
calibration company, in April 1991; Palmer Environmental Services and
Surveys, which detects water leaks in underground pipes, in November;
Detection Instruments, the gas detection instruments company now integrated
into Crowcon Detection Instruments, in December; and Perma Pure, which
removes water vapour from gases, this January.
The total cash expenditure on these was Pounds 2.96m, down from last time's
acquisition cash bill of Pounds 4.5m.
Halma was now more focused on Europe and would be looking to expand further
there, Mr Barber said. The European operations were making almost as much
profit as the well-established US side.
Group sales in the UK, he said, were only 5 per cent up, against a 42 per
cent increase on the Continent. Overall, direct exports grew 32 per cent to
Pounds 23.7m and overseas sales accounted for 47 per cent of total group
sales, against 42 per cent a year ago.
On top of that, Halma's 'relatively green' areas of business - the water and
air monitoring and treatment, and safety interlocking sides which accounted
for about 40 per cent of group turnover - had been Halma's 'most buoyant'
areas.
Earnings worked through at 7.71p (6.81p) per share.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Telegraph flotation at 325p - Conrad
Black's Hollinger group will retain majority holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE for the flotation of the Telegraph was set yesterday at 325p,
giving the group a market value of Pounds 435.5m. Mr Conrad Black's
Hollinger group is reducing its stake in the newspaper publisher from 87 per
cent to 68 per cent through the sale of 26m shares, raising Pounds 84.5m
before expenses.
The company is not raising any new money. Hollinger, the Canadian-based
group, plans to retain a majority holding in the Telegraph.
The price is lower than earlier hopes suggested, reflecting some weakness in
the stock market in recent weeks.
Mr Russell Edey, of NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising on the
flotation, said, 'in the jolly days after the election we would have got a
few pennies more.' He said he did not think either the cancellation of the
GPA flotation or concern about Mirror Group Newspapers had directly affected
the issue.
The price puts the group on an historic fully taxed p/e of 16, and a
prospective gross yield of 4.1 per cent on the 10p net dividend the
Telegraph is forecasting for the 1992 financial year.
Of the 26m shares being sold, 13m are available to the public with up to 10
per cent of those earmarked for Telegraph employees. The other 13m shares
have been placed, 12m in the UK and 1m in Canada.
Applications close on July 1 and the basis of allocation is expected to be
announced by July 2. Dealings are due to start on July 8.
COMMENT
The great imponderable in the Telegraph flotation is how many of its readers
will apply for shares. The assumption is that their social class and
propensity to own shares will combine with a loyalty to the brand to
persuade them to apply in droves. On that basis the issue should go well,
and there should be a premium in the after-market. But whether the Telegraph
constitutes a sound long-term investment at this price is quite another
matter. There are no directly comparablestocks, but a prospective p/e of
around 15 1/2 on forecasts of Pounds 42m pre-tax (Pounds 40.5m in 1991) is a
sizeable premium to the market, while the forecast yield is at a discount.
That looks a bit steep for a mature business with a still declining customer
base. Add the likelihood that the company will be the vehicle for the
personal ambitions of its majority owner and an even more cautious approach
is justified.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 13.5m purchase for Plysu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLYSU, the plastic bottle and houseware manufacturer based in Milton Keynes,
has announced a European expansion through the Pounds 13.5m purchase of a
Benelux-based blow moulded plastics container company.
The company is paying for SEP Group through a vendor placing of 3.12m shares
at 276.5p, which raised Pounds 8.6m, and about Pounds 2.5m in cash. The
vendors will also keep about Pounds 2.3m of Plysu shares for at least one
year.
Mr Richard Gordon, chief executive, said the acquisition would provide a
platform for further growth in Europe, in particular in France where the
company has been seeking to expand.
The deal will be earnings enhancing in the year to March 1993 and leaves the
group with a pro-forma balance sheet that is virtually ungeared.
The acquisition follows two years in which Plysu has grown rapidly after
capturing a large slice of a relatively new UK market for resealable plastic
milk bottles for the supermarket and dairy trade.
SEP had sales of Pounds 23.6m in the year to December 31, and made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.3m, down from Pounds 2.1m after being hit by
fluctuations in raw material prices as a result of the Gulf war. It had net
assets of Pounds 9.1m at the last balance sheet date.
Plysu believes its existing smaller blow moulding operation in the
Netherlands will fit well with SEP's operations and markets.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, underwrote the share placing with
institutions yesterday at a 3 per cent discount to the market price of 285p
at which the shares closed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPA MINERALS, the UK mining and finance house, has received acceptances
for only 15.9 per cent of the 85.1m new ordinary shares on offer in its
9-for-4 rights issue.
The 71.5m shares not subscribed for will be taken up by the sub-underwriters
at the issue price of 5p each. Existing Europa shareholders acting as
sub-underwriters will take up some 30 per cent of the offer.
The Pounds 3.97m rights issue was launched at the end of May after a
boardroom upheaval which led to Europa's three non-executive directors being
replaced by two executive directors of Austmin, a small Australian mining
company which is Europa's biggest shareholder. On taking up its rights
Austmin's stake in Europa was expected to increase from 14.5 per cent to
between 18 and 20 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Price rises boost Wessex Water 16% to
Pounds 76.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESSEX Water, the supplier of water and sewerage services from Bristol to
Bournemouth, yesterday continued the flow of recent strong results from the
privatised water industry.
For the 12 months to end-March profits at the pre-tax level rose to Pounds
76.9m, a 16 per cent improvement over the previous year's Pounds 66m. The
increase mainly refelected average price increases of 14.5 per cent.
Wessex Waste Management, the 49.9 per cent-owned joint venture set up last
year with Waste Management of the US, made a first contribution of Pounds
900,000. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman of Wessex Water, said the venture's
profits were 'on track and it's going well.'
Group turnover increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 190.8m. However, operating
costs rose by 16.8 per cent due to inflation and one-off charges.
These included Pounds 1.8m of extra severance provisions and Pounds 1.3m of
bad debt provisions - a 50 per cent increase. Wessex has one of the lowest
disconnection rates for non-payment of bills.
Interest receivable, earned on money raised through the sale of a 14.99 per
cent stake to Waste Management of the US, was unchanged at Pounds 8.5m.
Capital investment on improving water and sewerage quality increased to
Pounds 138m (Pounds 97m), although the depreciation and infrastructure
renewal charge was stable at Pounds 29.4m (Pounds 29m).
By the year-end the company's net cash position had declined from Pounds 94m
to Pounds 15m. Although it was likely to become slightly geared in the
current year it would return to net cash by the year end.
Fully diluted earnings rose to 57.9p (50.3p) and a recommended final
dividend of 12.9p (11.6p) makes a 19.5p (17.7p) total, an increase of 10.2
per cent. Dividend cover increased slightly to 3.4 (3.3) times.
Mr Hood said Wessex was 'fully supportive' of recent moves by the National
Rivers Authority to reduce abstraction from low flowing rivers.
Wessex had cut in half its abstraction programme for the River Piddle in
Dorset, he said.

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cupid to raise Pounds 2.7m in rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CUPID, the USM-quoted wedding gown designer, is planning to raise a net
Pounds 2.68m via a 1-for-2 rights issue at 82p.
The money will be used to expand the company's nursery care division, fund
working capital requirements and repay borrowings.
Largely as a result of the acquisition of the Youngs formal wear business
for Pounds 2.2m in cash, the group's borrowings have risen to Pounds 4.2m
with gearing at 93 per cent.
The issue will help reduce borrowings to a more 'prudent' level and enable
the company to expand.
The combination of the Pronuptia bridal wear business and Youngs retail
chain has already given Cupid a network of 92 shops focusing on the wedding

FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Contractors consider action over Canary
Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of about a dozen contractors is considering pursuing legal action
against Olympia &amp; York in a bid to free money owed for building work on the
failed Pounds 1.5bn Canary Wharf development in London's docklands.
The project was placed into administration at the end of last month after
Olympia &amp; York, the developers, ran into financial trouble.
Administration is designed to prevent creditors, such as contractors, from
pursuing claims while attempts are made to reorganise the business.
Partners of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, who were appointed
administrators to Canary Wharf at the end of May are today due to reveal to
bankers in Toronto their initial findings and outline a strategy for dealing
with the troubled project.
About Pounds 60m is estimated to be owed to construction companies which
have worked on the project.
The group of contractors, in a bid to recoup some of this money, is
considering starting a class action against Olympia &amp; York. This would allow
them to sue the developers direct and avoid becoming ensnared by the
administration procedure.
The companies - which are thought be owed more than Pounds 10m - have been
taking legal advice from Davies Arnold Cooper, a large firm of City
solicitors.
The solicitors said last night that a decision on whether to proceed with
legal action could depend upon what Canary Wharf administrators might
announce today.
Mr Nigel Montgomery, partner in the firm's construction insolvency unit,
said: 'An administration places a ring fence around a business which keeps
creditors out.
'This action would enable contractors to claim that assets on the other side
of this fence belong to them and therefore should be handed over and not
used to the benefit of other creditors. A class action enables companies
which might not be able afford it on their own to group together and share
costs.'
The action concerns contractors' plant and equipment which remains on site
as well as money owed to them which has been retained by the developers
against the possibility of defects arising after completion of the building.
Developers can retain up to 2 1/2 per cent of the cost of the works for up
to 12 months after legal completion of construction.
Contractors will argue that retention money and plant legally belongs to
them and therefore cannot be held back by Olympia &amp; York or the
administrators.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Personal View: The spectre at the fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LIPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pollution and depletion were part of the green 'new consciousness' of the
1960s. In the oil-shocked 1970s and the individualist 1980s, they
increasingly lost their political salience. Yet in the interim, resource
degradation had speeded up so that in the 1990s there are renewed concerns,
this time including ozone destruction and global warming. Why?
The answer was not even on the agenda of the UN Environment Conference in
Rio de Janeiro. It is quite simple. Since 1978, several leading governments
in rich countries have increasingly moved (a) to squeeze out inflation, (b)
to abandon fiscal policy as a means to that end, and therefore - especially
because direct control of the money supply has proved unfeasible - (c) to
rely increasingly on forcing up real interest rates. Dramatically rising
rates in 1977-79, sustained ever since, have increased the incentives - to
families, businesses and governments - to use up natural resources now, and
to ignore the consequences later. These same high interest rates, too, have
drained the cash with which governments might otherwise have protected
resources for the future.
Long-term interest rates in real terms, that is, net of expected inflation,
are a classic market signal. They tell every householder and every business
the market value of resources now, compared to several years hence. The
arithmetic of the signalling is fierce. Suppose an Indian farmer has two
ways to farm. The extractive path gets a high return for 15 years, but then
the land is exhausted and useless. The sustainable path gets a lower return,
for ever. If the farmer faces a high real rate of long-term interest, say 5
per cent, extractive farming looks attractive. Even if it is only twice as
profitable each year - for 15 years - as sustainable farming for ever, the
incentive is to extract now. If the real long-term rate of interest is
lower, say 2 per cent, extractive farming for just 15 years has far less
appeal. It has to be almost four times as profitable each year - while it
lasts - to be preferred. Farmers facing low interest rates usually choose
sustainable paths.
Poor countries are tiny players in international capital markets. They must
accept interest rates as they are made in New York, Frankfurt and Tokyo.
Prime, real long-term rates in the 1950s and the 1960s stood at some 1 per
cent to 1.5 per cent. Since 1978 they have hovered between 4 per cent and 5
per cent, and the World Bank predicts they will climb even higher. Its
prophecy, made in May 1991, looks like being fulfilled. Even though nominal
rates have fallen in the US, Japan, and parts of western Europe, this has
been more than matched by the fall in inflation, actual and expected.
These rises in real interest rates have been amplified for developing
countries. Western banks pushed most of their Third World loans from fixed
to variable rates in the late 1970s; later, the dwind-ling creditworthiness
of many borrowing governments meant they had to pay steadily widening
premiums. Final borrowers - smallholders and urban businesses in India and
Kenya - faced even wider margins via conditions on aid which forced down
domestic interest rate subsidies.
The exploding interest rate told the borrower that - whatever the rich
world's lobbies and leaders may say - the markets value the long-term
survival of rainforest or ozone, and even of poor rural people's water and
fuel, at almost zero. Even for Third World governments that wanted to
provide resources or subsidies for conservation, rising interest rates
drained their ability to do so. In 1972, interest payments - at home as well
as abroad - comprised 5.6 per cent of spending, including net lending, by
central governments in non-oil developing countries; by 1988, they had
reached 18.7 per cent.
Malthusian pessimists warn that extra people will eventually degrade the
world's resources and thus destroy themselves. The market case against such
pessimism, however, is powerful. It states that, as resources threaten to
run out, their price increases, so that families, businesses and governments
are stimulated to conserve, replace, or even discover new deposits of them.
But the developed world, by forcing up real interest rates to unprecedented
peacetime levels for 14 years, has broken the transmission, from demographic
challenge to conservationist response. Participants at Rio warned of
impending famine, dearth, and depletion. The rate of interest is our spectre
at their fast.
If OECD countries choose to squeeze out inflation, they can do so. But if
they persist in doing so by means of sky-high real rates of interest, they
will increasingly encourage production techniques which deplete resources
and cause pollution. The grandchildren of those who live by the market, as
well as their new converts in the developing world, may then die by the
market.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Russia and the IMF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA's economic reform strategy is showing alarming signs of drift. But if
Russia's reform collapses, the west will bear a large part of the blame.
Further reforms will remain on hold until the International Monetary Fund
finally reaches an agreement with the Russian government and unlocks the
promised western aid. The longer the IMF prevaricates, the less likely it is
that these reforms will occur.
At first sight, the IMF's caution appears justified. The promotion of Mr
Gaidar to prime minister cannot disguise the fact that in recent weeks the
grip of the reformers has slipped and the influence of the
military-industrial lobby within the cabinet has risen along with the
inflation rate.
Yet western advisers do not have to travel many miles from the sheltered
grandeur of Moscow's Metropol hotel to understand the source of the
political and economic tensions with which Mr Yeltsin and his government are
struggling. While the government's macroeconomic policy failures are easily
visible to Moscow-based statisticians, it is Russia's distorted and backward
industrial structure that is the root of the budgetary and monetary mess.
The disintegration of the old command system has left many enterprises
without markets for their products or money to pay their workers. They are
currently being kept afloat by unpaid debts and subsidies from the
government budget deficit financed by the central bank. To withdraw these
subsidies would mean the collapse of enterprises and the disintegration of
the economic and social stability of whole cities and regions. Such an
implosion would be economically wasteful. For Mr Yeltsin it would also be
politically inconceivable.
Convertible rouble
If reform continues, privatisation and the growth of the service sector will
soon begin to provide alternative sources of employment, while a convertible
rouble will open up new export markets and provide the viable enterprises
with imports at reasonable prices. A more gradual withdrawal of government
subsidies would then inevitably lead to the closure of many enterprises.
Yet the government will need both time and western aid if these structural
reforms are to work; and the reformers are unlikely to receive either unless
the government can sign an agreement with an IMF which apparently wants it
to close its budget deficit now.
Hyperinflationary threat
The IMF is, of course, correct to argue that hyperinflation will quickly
de-rail these necessary structural reforms. Only when the government stops
printing money will the hyperinflationary threat recede and currency
convertibility have any chance of success. Moreover, commitments from the
Russian government mean little or nothing if the rouble printing presses in
the other republics are working overtime. The sooner that Ukraine - the
worst culprit - follows Estonia's example and leaves the rouble area, the
better.
Harder to understand is the IMF's apparent desire that the Russians should
not only stop financing the budget deficit by printing money, but should
also balance the budget before aid is made available. Economic logic does
not require such a commitment; and political logic makes meeting it
impossible. The motivation for the west's Dollars 24bn aid package was
surely to allow the government to bridge the gap between its commitments and
outgoings.
What the Russian government needs is creative ideas on how to finance its
budget deficit in a non-inflationary way. For the moment, the gap will have
to be partly closed by foreign aid, conditional on structural reform as well
as macroeconomic stability. But western aid should be a short-term crutch,
not an artificial limb. A resource rich country should have little trouble
in raising finance from abroad: by selling oil futures, land or even
index-linked debt.
The west is running out of time. The interminably slow pace of the IMF
negotiations must be accelerated - and the current ream of petty disputes
solved - before the chance of reform is lost. Even if an agreement were to
be reached in the next fortnight, the economic and political pressures would
make the risks of failure high. But for the IMF to delay for so long that
the opportunity to sign an agreement with a reformist minded government
disappeared would be a greater failure.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Health care in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEM of London's hospitals has taxed health administrators for the
better part of a century. Great monuments to a long-faded imperial glory,
hospitals such as Guy's and Bart's swallow a disproportionate share of
health service resources. Successive governments have backed away from
closing any of these well-loved and skilfully defended institutions.
Now Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health minister, is determined to cut the
Gordian knot. She has commissioned an inquiry on future health provision in
the capital from Sir Bernard Tomlinson who is due to report in the autumn.
Yesterday's report on London's health care from the King's Fund - commended
by Mrs Bottomley - appears to be a stalking horse for Sir Bernard's
recommendations.
The most urgent cause of Mrs Bottomley's welcome initiative has been the
consequences of the government's health service reforms. Hospital treatment
is now commissioned by health authorities and family doctors spending
limited budgets. They find that treatment in London's specialist and
teaching hospitals is often more expensive than in general hospitals
elsewhere. Some family doctors have set up mini-cottage hospitals in their
health centres, carrying out minor surgical procedures previously provided
by hospitals. As the internal market begins to bite, London's hospitals are
losing contracts to their competitors.
Higher overheads
The reasons for this lack of competitiveness are several. London's overheads
are higher, especially the cost of hospital sites. The training
responsibilities of the teaching hospitals require additional staff and
resources. The specialist hospitals argue with some justification that, as
national institutions, they attract the most complex cases from across the
country. Whatever the reasons, the development of competition between
providers means that such cost disadvantages will grow.
At the same time, inner London is losing population, as the people these
hospitals grew up to service move out to the leafy suburbs. The process of
reallocating health service resources away from the capital began in the
1970s. But it has been given added impetus by the allocation of funds to
regions and districts more closely in line with population.
In most other markets, losing market share in this way leads to closure (in
the absence of scope to increase competitiveness). For large and complex
organisations such as hospitals, the question of 'exit' is less simple:
apart from the loyalties which many command in local hearts, there are
life-saving resources and skills which cannot be squandered like surplus
plant and machinery. If the demand for health care in London's hospitals is
to contract, a planned decline is preferable.
Plausible strategy
Yesterday's report from the King's Fund sets out a plausible strategy by
which this could be achieved. A task force should be set up to carry out a
fundamental review of the capital's needs - in consultation with the people
of London and their doctors. This review would inevitably lead to two
further steps: a reshaping of hospital-based acute services in London; and
the reorganisation of medical education and research.
The report also makes out a powerful case for diverting the resources
consumed by the prestigious inner London hospitals to improving the quality
of the capital's health care overall. Family doctor and community health
services have been neglected, the report argues: too many Londoners are
served by over-stretched single-handed family doctors working from decrepit
lock-up premises. And the provision of hospital services in much of the
capital has suffered; the quality of accident and emergency services, for
example, often leaves much to be desired.
Inevitably the headlines will concentrate on the recommendation that 15
hospitals be closed. Campaigns of greater or lesser speciousness will
agitate to save particular favourites. But the task of sorting out London's
hospitals is too important to fall victim to such pressure group tactics. It
is time for a fundamental review followed by determined political action to
implement its recommendations.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: The Montreal Symphony Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This fine orchestra returned to London for two concerts, one on South Bank
and one at the Barbican. The Saturday-evening Festival Hall programme had to
be changed and its piano concerto (the Beethoven First) removed, when Martha
Argerich fought shy of a London appearance yet again. The replacements -
Ibert's Escales and the Shostakovich Ninth Symphony - consoled any
disappointment; indeed, in showing off the strength of the orchestra's
15-year-old partnership with Charles Dutoit, the new first-half bill of fare
may even be accounted preferable to the old.
Not often does one encounter such balanced orchestral playing, not often
such a natural-seeming interchange of ideas between conductor and orchestra.
I guessed that the substitute works had been well routined earlier on the
Montreal's current European tour, for both works came across with effortless
clarity and a feeling of disciplined spontaneity impossible to counterfeit.
In particular, the Shostakovich symphony, a Haydn-like work that conceals
its seriousness beneath a disconcertingly impudent surface, was delivered
with an ideal knack of knowing where to put on the pressure, where to relax
it. Hints of deeper things were just that: hints, not nudges.
This is not an orchestra of instantly identifiable stamp, not a Czech or
Berlin Philharmonic. In Daphnis and Chloe after the interval, the playing of
the Montreal Symphony was, again, excellently clear and purposeful (and
well-blended with the voices of the London Symphony Chorus). Here, however,
I felt a want of thrill in the music, of lyrical inspiration in the timbres
and phrasing. In Ravel, as indeed in so much of the French music he
conducts, Dutoit keeps a cool head. His scrupulously unsensational approach
is admirable as far as it goes - which, in the heady exhilaration of the
finale, was just not far enough.
The marvel was that when the players made the transition to the Barbican
Hall on Monday, they still sounded a great orchestra. This is not often the
case and it is a tribute to the beautiful tone quality and the orchestra's
unfailing sense of balance that its class shines through in difficult
acoustics.
Above all, they were never tempted into playing too loudly, a regular
misjudgement in this hall. Charles Dutoit likes to keep the orchestra's
sound neat and trim, preferring quality to quantity of decibels. In their
performance of Falla's El sombrero de tres picos given in its complete form
as the full ballet, the very precision of the ensemble brought its own
sparkle to the score. Jill Gomez was the expert vocal soloist.
The other work in the programme was Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony and here
excellence in matters technical just managed to outweigh some lack of dark,
tragic, Russian passion. Dutoit gave us a very civilised view of
Tchaikovsky, presenting as it were his public face with French elegance and
immaculate etiquette, rather than the tormented soul of the private man. The
last movement, however, had plenty of dash. Dutoit and the Montreal make a
truly first-class team.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: Local government drama - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What did our grandparents know about local government? And how did they come
by the knowledge? The questions are prompted by two series now running on
television: the eight-part documentary Town Hall, which reached its second
episode on BBC2 last night, and the repeat of Alan Bleasdale's seven-part
drama GBH which began on Channel 4 on Saturday. Between them they have drawn
a lot of attention to local government, and provided information of a sort
which would not have been available to previous generations of the general
public.
The original idea of this column was to compare these two major series, each
taking up a lot of screen time, both - as I assumed - chiefly concerned with
the minutiae of local government, and providing a valuable example of the
comparative strengths of drama and documentary. There are people, Roger
Graef springs to mind and Leslie Woodhead, who have started out working in
one discipline and switched to the other. Woodhead, a Granada journalist,
began making 'faction', or drama documentaries, in the late 1960s when it
proved impossible for the current affairs series World In Action to show the
audience what was going on behind the iron curtain in any other way.
Graef started out in drama in North America but after coming to Britain
began making fly-on-the-wall documentaries such as The Space Between Words a
series which contrived to show how people in various groups such as a family
and a factory workforce communicated, or failed to do so. With this sort of
programme the key technician is the cameraman who, to get in close and
remain inconspicuous, frequently has to work for long spells with a
hand-held camera. Graef's cameraman for those programmes and on the later
series Police, shot in the Thames Valley, was Charles Stewart who, while
continuing to operate his camera, has gone on to be his own co-producer and
is now responsible with Malcolm Hirst for Town Hall.
After the Police documentaries Graef returned to drama, still taking the
police as his subject, because he knew there were some aspects of police
behaviour, certain attitudes he had observed among policemen, which the fly
on the wall seemed unable to record. Does this mean that 'art is a lie which
tells us the truth', that drama is the superior form even for a journalist's
purposes, and that the documentary is inherently inferior? I doubt whether
Graef or Woodhead (who returned to documentaries) would say that. I suspect
that both would say what almost anyone would say who has spent a lot of time
observing the success rates of different sorts of programme: that what
matters most is the ability and integrity of the individual programme maker,
regardless of the form in which he is working.
Nevertheless, given that the teams making Town Hall (Stewart and Hirst) and
GBH (Bleasdale, with Verity Lambert as executive producer and Robert Young
directing) were among the most highly regarded in their respective sections
of the industry, and that I had been abroad for all but the last part of GBH
on its first transmission, this coincidence of subject matter seemed too
good an opportunity to miss. Who would reveal most to us about the workings
of local government, the dramatists with their fiction or the documentary
makers with their fact? In the event the question proves almost irrelevant
because local government is merely one of the frames within which Bleasdale
presents his pictures. The details of council structures and activities are
no more important to GBH than the details of shoe making are to Hobson's
Choice.
What Bleasdale gives us is an account of two men's lives: Michael Murray
(played by Robert Lindsay, giving the best and most subtle performance of
his life, on television anyway), who happens to be the Labour leader of a
big city council, and who, in some ways, reminds us unavoidably of
Liverpool's Derek Hatton; and headmaster Jim Nelson (Michael Palin giving
the best performance of his life) who is a more complex and peculiar
character, suffering from fear of death and worry about anxiety.
When the series first appeared what claimed all the attention was the way
that Bleasdale depicted the organisation of the inner city riots. Some
watched the opening episodes and lamented Bleasdale's desertion to the right
since he appeared to be blaming left wingers for cynically organising mayhem
to gain political advantage. Others watched longer and ridiculed Bleasdale
for the plot twist in which it emerged that secret government agents had
infiltrated the left to produce chaos and discredit Labour councils.
Yet that is a relatively trivial sub-plot. The important purpose of GBH is
to use television serial drama as a means to explore that landscape of the
mind which has long been the subject of the novel but which has so rarely
been approached on television. The master of the form is Dennis Potter whose
Singing Detective is, so far, the best thing ever attempted in this area,
but GBH - and this only becomes clear when you pay close attention to the
whole piece, which is asking a lot since it lasts ten and a half hours -
runs it a close second. Though every episode is slightly too long, it is a
most impressive piece of work, and it seems absurd that BAFTA should
continue to deny it the drama prize which a majority of the jurors say they
voted for. The 'winner', Prime Suspect was good but GBH is outstanding.
However, if knowledge about the workings of local government is your aim
then Town Hall is your programme. Thirty years ago this series would have
astounded us; today, having seen umpteen fly-on-the-wall series revealing
the working methods of detectives, customs men, and even politicians, we
have become blase, yet this is a remarkable series. True, it has all the
bugbears of its genre: in the name of purity (presumably) we are denied a
voice-over and are consequently obliged to read captions, giving financial
statistics for instance, when we ought to be watching the pictures; and
sometimes the refusal to use television lights, as in the library sit-in
next week, leaves us with a screen full of dark silhouettes.
But those are niggling complaints when judged against the achievement as a
whole. Stewart and Hirst have recorded the activities of the elected
councillors, the Labour group, the council's paid executives, and public
groups such as those who, this week - in a scene strikingly similar to one
in GBH - stormed the town hall doors. The revelations are both impressive
and infuriating: impressive in the quantity of time that unpaid councillors
are willing to contribute, and infuriating in the way that they endlessly
prevaricate over the balancing of the council's budget.
It was brave or foolhardy or both of Lewisham Council to give television
this sort of access because the programmes reveal an alarmingly unimpressive
standard of management, considering these people are handling hundreds of
millions of pounds of public money; and the relationship between volunteer
councillors and the professional staff who must do their bidding looks just
as tense and touchy as you might expect. Of course 'stars' are emerging:
Leisha Fullick, Director of Education, who seems worryingly unworried about
taking the blame for an Pounds 8.2m over-spend and whose brother-in-law the
priest has lit four candles for her; Cllr Jim Mallory, the man with a mild
American (?) accent, chairman of the education committee, who reminds you of
a 1917 Bolshevik and never smiles, and so on.
Previously my knowledge of local government was slightly greater than that
of most people I knew because I had covered council matters as a reporter.
This series greatly increases my knowledge and puts every other viewer on a
par with me. It is inconceivable that our grandparents could have had such
knowledge unless they actually worked in local government. Thus does
television change our lives.

Yet more new series start tonight. In Fighting Back Lynn Redgrave, who seems
to have made something of a profession of fighting her own flab, interviews
'a celebrity' (the BBC's word) about a serious illness they have suffered.
She begins (7.30 BBC1) with Mike Nolan, singer with Bucks Fizz, whose head
injury in an accident resulted in epilepsy. Esmonde and Larbey, authors of
'The Good Life', have written a second series of Hope It Rains (8.00 ITV) in
which Tom Bell plays the manager of a waxworks museum in a seaside town
whose life has been turned upside down by the arrival of his god-daughter.
Immediately following is another new half-hour sitcom: Land Of Hope And
Gloria (8.30 ITV). Gerald, 16th Viscount Debleigh, a widower, lives in the
family stately home under the thumb of his old nanny. Along comes Gloria
Hepburn, a thrusting American Ms, as business manager. Culture clash.
It is a good night for secret agent freaks. Timewatch is devoted again to a

Thirty-two years after its Broadway opening, followed by a long-running
London production at the Palace Theatre, a Julie Andrews movie, now
inexpensively available on video, innumerable David Jacobs-hosted Radio 2
re-playings of the hit numbers, 'Do-Re-Mi' etc. that are continually being
re-issued on cassette and CD - what on earth is there left to revive? Hasn't
this particular onion been peeled so often that our tear-ducts have
completely atrophied to it?
Ronald Lee and Shochiku Ltd., the producers of the show, think not, and
audiences in the regions have for some weeks been endorsing that view. Now
it occupies the venerable boards at Sadler's Wells until September 5 to
suffer there an exposure to the more blase theatregoers of the capital and
its wicked coven of dramatic critics. The evidence of the rapturously
appreciative first night suggests that Londoners are likely to raise the
white handkerchief as readily as their provincial and country cousins and
like them surrender to the piece with loud, lachrymose howls of approval.
The truth is that even a merely competent production - and this one is a
good deal more than that - is well-nigh irresistible. With Richard Rodgers
to ladle out the music like great dollops of molasses on a cake confected
from the memoirs of Maria von Trapp - to whom all this really happened - and
lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein, from a book by Lindsay and Crouse, the mixture
cannot fail to slide down a treat.
It is cynically made out of a series of cleverly manipulated stock responses
from the spectacle on stage of such surefire winners as nuns, children,
Nazis and Alps. Liz Robertson plays the pretty postulant who drops out of
the convent. She is sent by the kindly abbess to become governess to the
seven children of a recently widowed naval captain whose schloss, her
spacious new place of work, is overshadowed by the mountains on the
Austrian-Swiss border. With a bobbed hair-cut and simply cut dresses, and
looking indeed like a latter-day Julie Andrews, Robertson strikes the right
note of simplicity and determination, as she gives her renderings of such
numbers as 'I have confidence in me . . .' She is partnered by the rather
wooden, heel-clicking Christopher Cazenove, as her all too rapidly besotted
employer. The pair certainly look good as they go through the formal
Laendler dance. This first sign of things to come is observed by Jan Waters
who gives her own stylish elegance to the other woman in the captain's life.
The basic story is that of The Turn of the Screw in reverse. The governess
marries her boss in the end having aroused the latent goodness in the
children rather than corrupting them. Less interesting in human terms, it is
much safer box-office. The forces of good are represented by the nuns, led
here by Linda Hibberd who raises high the nunnery's roof-beams with a
spirited version of 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain'. Evil arrives only with the
Austrian Nazis who emerge after the anschluss in the last act. In an affable
performance as the Austrian culture-organiser, Robin Nedwell revealed how
easy it was in that situation to compromise with them. Musical direction is
in the capable hands of Nick Davies; and Wendy Toye, the supremo of the
entire production, makes sure that no one puts a foot wrong, especially the
excellent child performers.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Waterproof in Venice - The
risks and rewards of special techniques to save the crypt of St Mark's
basilica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors entering St Mark's basilica in Venice usually cast their eyes
upwards as their attention is caught by the stunning golden mosaics of
Christ and the Apostles towering above them.
Few spare a thought for matters below ground. However, until recently, the
crypt beneath the High Altar, which houses the remains of the Serenissima's
patron saint, offered a scene to dampen the spirits of even the keenest
tourist.
For decades the crypt, one of the basilica's holiest places, has played host
to thousands of gallons of dirty, fetid water. Its level has been rising
steadily as Venice itself has sunk. At high tides, the water has even lapped
the tips of the ancient vaulted brickwork forming the crypt's ceiling,
leaving a disfiguring and potentially dangerous legacy of salt within the
stone.
The water has not come from Venice's famed tides, but from seepage through
the crypt's walls. The level of water outside the crypt has risen, allowing
ever more water to penetrate its walls. Today, the crypt floor is 36cm below
sea level.
Church records show that attempts to tackle the problem are as old as the
Basilica itself. In the mid-sixteenth century, administrators thought they
had overcome their troubles by raising the floor.
That worked for a few decades. By the mid-1580s, the crypt was becoming
unusable again, and it was eventually walled off. Three hundred years later,
with the discovery of concrete, another serious attempt was made to resolve
matters. The lower half of the walls and the floor, raised again, were
covered with concrete to keep the water out.
The treatment worked, but did nothing to stop the problem of summertime
condensation, which became evident as soon as the crypt came back into use.
By the mid-1950s, water penetration was increasingly acute as the concrete
lining aged and the whole city sank further. The crypt was closed.
At a press conference last week, Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals group
which has sponsored several stonework restoration projects in Italy,
announced that the crypt's problems may be over. After a six-year project,
involving study of materials and the injection into the walls of a special
waterproof resin, the sea may be out for good.
When the next phase of the restoration, concentrating on the ceiling
brickwork, is over, it should be possible to hold services in the crypt
again. The hope is to complete by 1994, the Basilica's 1,000th anniversary.
The crypt would be reserved for worship.
Rhone Poulenc's contribution has come in the form of speciality chemicals -
in this case Rocagil, a silicone-based resin - and the technique to apply
them. The company is reluctant to say how much it has spent. Apart from
donating the materials, its commitment has involved devoting senior
specialists to the project, with two technicians on site.
Using resins for waterproofing is not new. According to Carlo Molteni, a
former R&amp;D chief of Rhone Poulenc in Italy, the first application dates back
to a dam project in Algeria in 1968.
The age and the cultural and religious significance of St Mark's crypt
turned the restoration process into an unusually lengthy task. Preliminary
work in 1972 involved the use of epoxy resins. They failed to permeate the
finest cracks and pores.
Rocagil had a viscosity level similar to that of water, which made it ideal
for the task, explains Molteni, who holds a 1967 patent on the use of
silicone-based resins. Even when the right product had been identified,
application could only take place slowly. Only after two high tides could
the project leaders be sure that the chemical, and the technique, were
working. The need to observe the Basilica's primary function as a place of
worship meant heavy work, such as drilling, could not take place
uninterrupted.
The project has been a object lesson in public relations and marketing for
Rhone Poulenc. It also spotlights the risks of misunderstandings and
cultural clashes that can emerge when big business and bodies like St Mark's
mix.
Sponsorship of the arts is not new in Italy. Many companies, notably banks,
are generous givers for prestige-winning restoration projects.
Rhone Poulenc, which counts Italy as its fourth biggest foreign market, with
sales of about L1,300bn, is no exception. It has been involved with projects
to restore the stonework on buildings and monuments as famous - and
disparate - as Milan's town hall and the Duomo in Parma, as well as making a
perfect copy of Donatello's statue of St Mark in Florence. Concentrating on
restoration and copying allowed the company to associate its name with some
of Italy's best-known monuments.
The idea also makes sense in terms of the group's overall image and
communications strategy. Rhone Poulenc is only the world's seventh biggest
chemicals group. It claims however to be a leader in advanced chemicals for
stone restoration. Executives say it is one of a handful which have the
specialist skills to apply the materials most effectively.
However, the Venice restoration shows how delicately a company must tread.
It was no coincidence that one of the Basilica's representatives pointedly
refused to use the word 'sponsorship' at last week's press conference.
'Sometimes their attitude is pure hypocrisy', says one person not linked to
Rhone Poulenc. 'They want our money and our products but balk at the idea
that we may be doing them a favour. Rather, it's the other way around.
Sometimes, you'd think they'd prefer it their buildings were just left to
fall down rather than having anyone interfere'.
That approach may seem surprising for cultural administrators in countries
like the UK, where government funding cuts have obliged curators and
churchmen to look to industry for assistance.
With more than a decade of experience in Italy, Rhone Poulenc has probably
learned the right arts of diplomacy. Despite the obvious differences, its
presence at St Marks is clearly appreciated, especially now that work is due
to start on the crypt's ceiling.
That process may take as long as dealing with the floor and walls, as the
ancient bricks, now completely impregnated with salt, are visibly crumbling.
'I don't think there is a structure as compromised as this one', says Mr
Molteni.
How the salt will be expelled, and what will replace it so that the bricks
do not fall to pieces, will require months of study before final decisions
are made. Whatever technique is chosen, the church and the company will be
working, as far as possible, in harmony.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Package of market ideas to
tackle tide of waste - Pioneering concepts are agitating the international
packaging industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rising tide of packaging waste poses an increasingly acute problem for
the modern consumer economies. Few issues challenge more urgently the
ingenuity of environmentalists, industrialists, and bureaucrats the world
over.
Until recently, the proposed solutions have tended to favour a regulatory
approach relying on governmental intervention. Legislation has been
introduced to force industry to recover and to recycle increasing
proportions of packaging waste. Strict targets for recycling rates have been
set; sometimes, it seems, almost arbitrarily. Certain forms of waste
disposal, such as incineration, have been banned.
These solutions have certainly forced the packaging industry to address the
issues as never before. They have however led to results which, in many
cases, only harm the environment further.
For example, German companies have dumped zero-cost plastics packaging waste
on foreign markets as far away as South Africa after being forced by their
draconian recycling regime to collect it but unable to reprocess it
commercially within their own borders.
In a discussion paper* to be published this week, the Centre for Social and
Economic Research on the Global Environment, an environmental think-tank,
forcefully argues that market-based solutions can be a more effective way of
tackling the root problems: how to ensure that the minimal amount of
packaging is used in the first place and how to create economic incentives
to recover and recycle the waste that is inevitably produced.
The neat solution they came up with - which the authors claim was conceived
while waiting for a delayed flight at Brussels airport - is a graduated tax,
imposed on packaging products to reflect their full environmental costs. The
tax could either be imposed directly by government or by industry itself in
the form of a levy. The market would then determine the 'best' forms of
packaging.
The argument is that, at present, there is a 'market failure' in the pricing
of packages because the 'external' costs of disposing of the waste products
by means of landfill, incineration or composting are not included in the
original price. The study suggests that an environmental tax would have the
effect of 'internalising' some of these 'external' costs, reflecting their
true environmental and social impact.
A blanket tax on all packages to cover these costs would not discriminate
between packages which had differing environmental impacts. Nor would it
encourage manufacturers to develop design to use less raw material.
The report therefore suggests there should be several variables within the
tax calculation to accommodate these concerns and to ensure the viability of
the 'Polluter Pays Principle', which is widely becoming accepted as an
essential component of market-based environmental solutions.
The formula for the tax (illustrated) shows how this might work.
Should the manufacturer of a packaging product reduce the weight per litre
of its product, then the burden of tax would reduce correspondingly.
Similarly, if the rate of recycling (expressed as a fraction) was increased,
then the calculation would again change and the tax would fall further.
The paper suggests that the 'external' costs should be limited to the
environmental damage resulting only from the manufacture and transport of
packaging products.
Other considerations, such as the environmental damage caused by bauxite
extraction to produce aluminium cans, should be separately regulated by
governments. Levying additional tax on a package to account for such factors
would result in inefficient double taxation.
One obvious complication is that the tax will vary when applied to different
products and countries. The costs of waste disposal are for instance very
much higher in the Netherlands than in the US, partly because if you try to
dig a landfill tip in the Netherlands, you end up with a swimming pool.
That suggests taxes have to be calculated nationally, or perhaps even
regionally. Practical problems arise as to how the tax may be collected and
what effect it might have on international trade.
Rough calculations of the effects of applying such a tax throw up surprising
conclusions, which the authors accept are 'counter-intuitive from an
environmentalist viewpoint'.
When applied to the UK market for beverage packaging, the study suggests
that cartons would be taxed lowest (mainly as a result of their low weight);
followed by plastic PET bottles; returnable glass bottles (assuming they are
re-used on average 14 times); and aluminium cans. Heavy non-returnable glass
bottles incur an extremely high tax.
The independent study was produced with the help of Tetra Pak, the Swedish
packaging group which is the world's biggest manufacturer of multi-layered
beverage cartons.
Environmentalists have nevertheless welcomed the study as a very useful
contribution to the debate.

Jonathan Dimbleby, the new president of the Council for the Protection of
Rural England (CPRE), says his CV on countryside matters has so far been
'informal rather than formal'. But, having been brought up on a farm,
attended agricultural college, and 'played midwife to more lambs than I ate
before I became a vegetarian', the broadcaster and journalist reckons he is
the man for the job.
He was approached by David Puttnam, film producer and president of the CPRE
for the past seven years, and the current chairman David Astor. Despite his
time in Hollywood, Puttnam was seen as an effective president; the Council
was therefore convinced of the merits of looking for another media
personality rather than, say, an expert planner.
'I came to the environment as an issue via development,' says the new
president, who made a film about desertification in the Sahel in the early
1970s 'when it was a non-story'.
Now his job will be to 'represent the consensus of the CPRE beyond its
natural constituency'; this includes getting city dwellers, rather than just
the denizens of the shires, interested in the Council's work. 'One of the
things that attracts me about it is that it is not a narrow Nimby
organisation,' says Dimbleby, who does, however, have his own back yard, a
beautiful valley outside Bath, to defend from a proposed by-pass.
A 'cautious optimist' about the Earth summit, which he attended as a
reporter, he thinks there are 'significant hostages for all governments'
that the environmentalists can and will winkle out of Agenda 21, the
800-page guide to sustainable development that was put together in Rio.

<TEXT>
Gavin Shreeve, formerly editor and publisher of The Banker magazine, has
moved to Extel Financial in the newly created position of managing editor of
the data products division.
Extel, strong in the provision of securities data for back office funds
valuation and administration, is this year moving into real-time prices,
designed to take the Extel name into front office trading rooms at
securities houses and fund management operation in the UK, continental
Europe and North America. 'While Reuters prices at the level it does in the
UK, there is a niche in the market for us,' according to Stuart Clark,
director in charge of data products.
Clark says the new role of managing editor is an amalgam of the posts of
City editor, in charge of news gathering, and business operations manager.
'Gavin is a people motivator. He has a wide range of contacts. And he has
the analytical skills. Ours has always been very much a culture of data
collection, not analysis.' Clark also forecasts early changes in the news
service - which has hitherto not shone.
Shreeve moves after five years at The Banker, part of Financial Times
Business Information, where he says his main contribution has been to make
the magazine 'much more technical, as well as much prettier'.
Like Shreeve, who had his own magazine Middle East Money before joining The
Banker, the new editor, Australian Stephen Timewell, is also a Middle East
specialist, with an MA in Middle Eastern studies Chicago University.
The two know each other from days on Middle East Economic Digest and
Timewell, having already been on The Banker two years, is keen to stress
continuity. 'More on emerging markets and banking structures; and more
listings and analysis,' he promises.

If proof is needed that running a City public relations firm is a high-risk
affair, Keith Lewis, chief executive of Streets, Britain's second oldest

Although he is not being replaced directly, many of his responsibilities
have been taken over by David Millham, executive deputy chairman, who only
joined Streets in April after he was made redundant from Shandwick, the
world's biggest public relations firm which he helped found.
Millham, who used to work with Lewis at the Financial Times, says that Lewis

FT  24 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Syndicate must extend cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS &amp; CO AND OTHERS v BAKER House of Lords (Lord Templeman, Lord
Jauncey of Tullichettle, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Mustill, Lord Slynn of
Hadley): June 18 1992.
A DISCOVERY extension clause in a line slip insurance policy giving the
assured an option to extend cover after non-renewal by the underwriters, is
not collectively binding on all participating syndicates but may be invoked
against an individual non-renewing syndicate irrespective of whether the
others have renewed.
The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr Colin Baker,
representative underwriter for Lloyd's Syndicate 126, from a Court of Appeal
decision (FT, March 6 1991) that Syndicate 126 was bound to extend cover to
the plaintiff assureds, Touche Ross &amp; Co and five other accountancy firms
under excess professional indemnity policies.
LORD MUSTILL said that for many years a professional indemnity programme had
been organised by Minet &amp; Co. The policies were written in layers under line
slips.
Some 120 companies and syndicates took part.
Substantial lines were taken by Lloyd's Syndicate No 126. The relevant lines
were on the first and third excess layers.
The policies contained 'discovery extension' clauses, giving the assured an
option exercisable before expiry of the policy, to prolong cover for a
further period in exchange for additional premiums.
The protection afforded by prolongation related only to claims arising from
acts already done before expiry of the policy.
In the 1980s, the insurance market contracted rapidly, so that to find
replacements for full cover on non-renewal became more difficult, and the
right to buy time by deploying the discovery extension clause cover became
more important.
The underwriters elected to terminate cover under the primary and first
excess layers from May 31 1987, and the third excess layers from May 31
1986.
The assured then set about Warning, Overset column replacing the cover, in
particular by seeking to persuade the existing insurers to reinstate it on
renegotiated terms.
Not all insurers were willing to participate. Accordingly, the assured
invoked the discovery extension clause.
With one exception the non-renewing insurers accepted invocation of the
clause without demur. That exception was Syndicate 126.
It maintained that the clause must be exercised against all the insurers or
none.
The assured disagreed, maintaining it would be absurd to read the policy as
requiring invocation of the clause against insurers who were willing to
continue full cover.
Mr Justice Leggatt found in favour of the assured. His decision was upheld
in the Court of Appeal. Syndicate 126 now appealed.
The appeal turned on the application of well-established rules and practices
to the terms of the policies. None of the following propositions were in
question:
1. Every underwriting member of Lloyd's incurred liability to the assured on
a several, not joint, basis (see section 8(1), Lloyd's Act 1982).
2. Notwithstanding that his rights and liabilities were several, the
individual 'name' never acted on his own in creating insurance contracts. He
underwrote through an agent. Business was conducted on a grouped basis,
through syndicates.
3. When an underwriting agent took a line on a policy for his syndicate, he
called into existance a bundle of individual contracts between each name and
the assured, identical save as to the respective proportions taken by the
names. That bundle was agglomerated with the other groups of contract
created when other syndicates took a line on the same insurance.
4. There was complete delegation by the name to the agent of all powers
relating to conduct of his underwriting business.
5. In practice, it often happened that some of the delegated powers were
further delegated to others. Such onward delegation was often effected in
unison by all subscribers to the risk. For example, several syndicates might
authorise a third party to contract on their behalf - as happened here with
the line slip.
The first of those characteristics of Lloyd's insurance was said by the
assureds to lead directly to dismissal of the appeal. They said the
underwriters' argument treated the contract as if it were bipartite, with
the assured on one side and the insurers as a group on the other.
They said that to understand the contract in that way was to ignore the
fundamental rule that Lloyd's insurance involved not one contract, but a
group of bundles of contracts. The fact that the underwriters were severally
bound entailed that the assured were entitled, and bound, to exercise the
contractual option in an equally several manner.
That was not accepted.
The case was about the separate treatment of syndicates, not individual
underwriters. The logic of the argument if carried through, would lead to
the conclusion that the assured would have the right to exercise the
discovery extension option separately against each individual name.
Such a result would run entirely contrary to the way in which Lloyd's
conducted its business.
Thus, although the first principle had an important part to play in the
appeal, it did not lead directly to a decision in favour of the assured.
In interpreting the policies to see which of two possible arrangements for
creation of an option to extend was intended, the practical implications of
preferring one would be an important element.
Clause IV condition 3(b) of the policies provided that 'this policy' should
be extended annually 'unless . . . either party has given the other due
notice that the expiry date shall not be extended'.
Condition 5 provided that 'if the underwriters shall refuse to extend this
policy', the assured had the right on payment of an additional premium, to
extension of cover granted by 'this policy'.
Counsel for the insurers relied on the repeated use of 'this policy', and
drew attention to 'either party'.
He said that use of the sin-gular made it plain that the subscribers to the
policy were regarded as a single body.
The argument must be approached with caution. Experience showed that
insurance documents in the London market were rarely drawn with the
precision of language needed for grammatical contrasts to be a reliable
guide to intention.
The practical consequences of the underwriters' argument were sufficient to
show that the absence of any sign that subscribers' rights were to move in
unison represented the true sense of the document.
If the underwriters' argument was sound its logic must also require that the
extension notice was also to be given for all subscribers or none.
Since the policy was self-renewing that would mean that if all but one of
the subscribers wished to bring it to an end but the others did not, all the
individual contracts would roll inexorably on from anniversary to
anniversary until the dissenter could be brought into line.
That seemed completely at odds with the need for the individual syndicate or
company to be constantly reassessing its position in regard to its own
strategies, capacity and exposures elsewhere.
If that view was right, the insurers' argument was unsustainable, since the
discovery extension clause could not be read as requiring the option to be
exercised against all, if some subscribers had chosen to remain with full
cover.
The notion that the parties could have intended the giving of an extension
notice to those who were willing to extend - a notice which would be a
useless formality and the source of unnecessary future effort - was
unacceptable.
There was nothing in the words of the policy to compel the result for which
the underwriters contended, and everything in the practical considerations
to the opposite effect. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed.
For the underwriters: Anthony Boswood QC and Guy Philipps (Simmons &amp;
Simmons).
For the assured: Jonathan Mance QC and Robert Bright (Lovell White Durrant).

FT  24 JUN 92 / Management: A wall of silence on the subject of property -
Advice to companies that are mismanaging their buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The part played by bricks and mortar in UK business is remarkable both for
its importance and its inefficiency.
'Property is often a neglected asset, despite its significant contribution
to running costs,' declared a recent survey commissioned by Stanhope, a
property company.
'Property needs to be higher on the boardroom agenda,' concluded a report by
Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property adviser, published last week.
British companies suffer some of the highest property costs in the world.
Buildings typically account for 5-15 per cent of a company's operating
costs, second only to the payroll in importance. Property is often more than
half a company's tangible assets: UK companies owned Pounds 225bn of
property in 1989.
A vast number of companies have more property than they need. DTC's survey
of the UK's 100 largest companies showed that 5 per cent of commercial
floorspace was unused - enough to accommodate the entire working population
of Bristol. For the most part, however, property receives very little
attention, with the notable exception of takeover bids where property values
tend to be an important battle ground.
Perhaps the main explanation for this is the lowly stature of property
managers. The head of property is often six or more layers down from the
chief executive. Only 10 per cent of the UK's largest 100 companies employ a
property director.
'In most companies, there is little or no representation of property within
main boards, with the result that property is never fully considered as part
of the overall business plan for the company,' says St Quintin, a firm of
chartered surveyors.
In some industries, the pressure to improve the efficiency of property
management is intense. Retailers in the south east which have been
struggling with crippling rate and rent rises are acutely aware of the need
to contain property costs.
Pharmaceutical companies are mindful of the value of their asset base
because the regulation of drug prices is linked to their return on capital.
The value of a bank's property holdings affects its capital and its ability
to lend.
Improving the way that property is managed is not easy. Property is
notoriously illiquid and cyclical. Furthermore, the structure of the UK
property industry is, almost alone in the world, designed to suit the
investor rather than the occupier. UK tenants' leases are far more onerous
than most of their counterparts overseas.
In some respects, a tenant's lot is particularly difficult at present. The
present slump is scuppering the best-laid plans for relocation, sub-letting
and the disposal of empty property.
But in other respects, the property glut has turned the tables on landlords,
who now have to place more importance than ever on attracting an occupier.
This is creating unprecedented opportunities.
Measures that should be considered include:
Tougher negotiations on new leases. Tandy, the retail chain, is refusing to
sign any leases without a five-year break clause. Boots has just won a court
case over its refusal to sign an upwards-only rent review.
Sale and leasebacks, which allow a company to unlock the capital tied up in
a building. This is likely to have increasing appeal to property-rich
companies, such as hotel chains and retailers, which want to strengthen
balance sheets.
Improved management information. At least 20 per cent of the top 100
companies do not even known the basics such as location, size and tenure of
each property they occupy, according to DTC. Only a third of large companies
have a comprehensive management information system.
Separating the role of landlord and occupier within a company. Charging an
occupier the true costs of its premises can have important implications for
its profitability. When, for instance, Kingfisher, the retail group,
introduced this arm's-length approach between shops and property investment
in the early 1980s, it exposed the poor returns of a phalanx of stores which
were then closed.
Extracting value from properties. Most portfolios offer opportunities to buy
in unfavourable leases, to realise development potential, to enhance values
by getting planning permission or release 'marriage' value by combining
freehold and leasehold in one ownership.
Even in the the trough of the property recession, there is scope for
companies to think ahead. If property is to be more than a necessary evil,
companies need to minimise costs and identify value.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Boundary 'corruption' alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Parliamentary Boundary Commission was accused of being 'corrupt' by Mr
Ken Livingstone, Labour MP for Brent East, in the Commons last night.
There were repeated protests from the government benches when he claimed
that its recommendations had been consistently biased and had resulted in an
advantage of between 10 and 20 seats for the Conservative party.
Mr Tony Banks, Labour member for Newham North West and a former colleague of
Mr Livingstone on the now defunct Greater London Council, supported his
charges.
Mr Barry Porter (C Wirral South) then asked if there was any procedure for
halting speeches by 'honourable members who have gone insane'.
Mr Livingstone complained that the Parliamentary Boundary Commission was
attempting to secure a reduction in the electorate of the London borough of
Brent so that it would be entitled to only two instead of three
constituencies.
He said he had been 'tipped off' by a telephone call from a person employed
by the Local Government Boundary Commission.
He said this commission, in response to a request from the parliamentary
commission, had produced proposals bringing the electorate down to 'within
100' of the required number.
Mr Peter Lloyd, a home office minister, dismissed Mr Livingstone's
'fantastical assertions' about the lack of objectivity and non-partisansship
of the parliamentary commission. In the general election it took 71,000
voters to elect a Conservative MP compared with 61,000 to elect a Labour MP.
'If the boundary commission were biased in favour of the Conservative party
it has done an extremely poor job,' Mr Lloyd added.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Meeting over transfer of care
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR MINISTERS met at Downing Street yesterday to try to resolve the
difficulties over the planned transfer of responsibility for community care
from the government to local authorities.
At a discussion chaired by Mr John Major and including ministers from the
health, social security and environment departments agreed to press ahead
with the aim of making the transfer as intended in April next year.
Problems over the funding of the arrangement had led to suggestions from
some ministers that the transfer should be delayed again, or even postponed
to allow an alternative policy to be developed.
The decision to carry on despite the doubts that had been raised will put
increased pressure on Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, whose
department is in the lead in the coming autumn public spending round to
ensure that enough money accompanies the transfer to make the policy a
success.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Support grows for private landlords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS widespread support among politicians and housing experts for
reviving the private landlord system, a report commissioned by the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, said yesterday.
The report called for incentives to encourage private landlords and to
secure funding for rented housing from financial institutions. It also said
there should be improved tax breaks and measures to make it easier to regain
possession of properties let out.
Among those who have given 'broad agreement' to such measures is Ms Sheila
McKechnie, director of the housing charity Shelter, and businesses that
provide private rented accommodation.
The report said reversing the decline in private rented housing was the only
way to meet the demand that councils and housing associations could not
meet. Revival of the sector would require government subsidies to bridge the
gap between the landlord's likely income from rents and the returns
available from comparable investments, the report added.
Income tax exemptions on rent and capital gains tax allowances such as those
offered to owner-occupiers should also be considered.
The report advocated steps to reassure landlords that they could regain
possession of their properties with reasonable speed from tenants who did
not pay rent. It said court procedures should be streamlined to eliminate
delays - now as long as six months - in obtaining a hearing.
Sir George Young, housing minister, welcomed the report. 'I hope we shall
succeed in creating a sector in which the major financial institutions - the
pension funds and insurance companies - feel they can invest with confidence
once more,' he said.

<TEXT>
THERE will be tight security at today's Lloyd's of London annual general
meeting, the biggest event at the insurance market since an IRA bomb shook
damaged neighbouring buildings in April. The bomb caused only slight damage
at Lloyd's itself, but in its aftermath entry to the market's steel and
glass headquarters has understandably become more time-consuming.
Lloyd's claims that there should be room for any Name to attend the meeting
as long as members bring with them appropriate membership and security
passes. Seats, restricted to the ground floor and to the edges of the
galleries of floors one, two and three will be at a premium although there
is adequate standing room and TV monitors will relay proceedings to watchers
from upper floors.
In any event Names are advised to arrive early - at the building's main
concourse reception in Lime Street for the meeting which begins at 10.30am.
As for the procedings themselves, Mr David Coleridge, backed by members of
the Lloyd's Council and leading executives at the corporation, will speak on
the market's losses - a record Pounds 2bn in its most recent underwriting
year 1989 - and prospects for Lloyd's.
Formal business is limited to a presentation of the annual report and
accounts of the Lloyd's Corporation and a vote of thanks. Little will be
decided - the meeting's formal business is limited but Names are free to ask
questions.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Building society probes up steeply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS to the building societies ombudsman more than doubled over the
past year, according to the scheme's annual report.
There were 9,525 complaints and inquiries to the ombudsman in the year to
March 31 - six times the figure for 1987-88, the first year of the scheme.
Mr Stephen Edell, the first ombudsman, said a third ombudsman, Mr Brian
Murphy, was appointed last month to help cope with the 'flood of
complaints'. Ms Jane Woodhead became the second ombudsman last summer.
Mr Edell said he did not know why numbers had risen so quickly, particularly
since complaints about Abbey National, formerly the largest building society
and now a bank, was no longer under the scheme's jurisdiction. However, he
said the success of the scheme and increased publicity as well as the
recession may account for part of the rise.
The sharpest rise in complaints related to interest rates on investments,
with over six times more complaints than in 1990-91.
The main factor in the rise was failure by building societies to alert
customers to changes and replacements to accounts, such as when accounts are
replaced with similar products offering improved rates of interest.
The report noted that most such complaints arose as a result of the launch
by Nationwide Anglia of its Bright Horizons investment range in late 1990.
Mr Edell said the onus was on individuals to look after their investments,
and that there would be no pressure to oblige societies to inform
account-holders in writing of changes to their accounts.
Complaints relating to mortgage repossessions increased by 171 per cent over
the year. However, Mr Edell said there were few cases in which action could
be taken because the ombudsman lacks the power to stop repossessions and
cannot deal with cases being handled by the courts.
The most common complaint on repossessions was that properties had been sold
too cheaply by building societies.
Complaints about insurance more than doubled, mainly as a result of the fees
customers are charged to take out insurance other than a package offered by
a building society.
While the number of complaints about home-income plans for the elderly was
small, Mr Edell expressed concern about these schemes.
Mr Edell said that the problem of negligent valuations and surveys was
difficult to deal with because it often fell outside his jurisdiction.
The Building Societies Association has proposed an ombudsman scheme to deal
with surveyors.
Mr Edell said most awards made were of hundreds of pounds or in the low
thousands. He made formal decisions in 392 cases, of which 19 were resolved
wholly in the complainant's favour.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Nuclear Electric power hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW nuclear power station, twice the size of any built in Britain, could
be the key to cheap nuclear power, according to Nuclear Electric.
The state-owned company, which operates the nuclear stations of England and
Wales, believes it could build twin reactors on the Suffolk site of Sizewell
B, Britain's latest nuclear station under construction, for less than Pounds
3bn in today's money - possibly raising money from the private sector. That
compares with around Pounds 3.5bn for the single Sizewell B reactor, due in
1994.
'We've already paid for Sizewell B,' Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear
Electric, told a nuclear conference in London yesterday: 'Now we need to
think how to capitalise on it. It's our duty to the consumer and the
taxpayer.' Nuclear Electric cannot build any stations until it passes a
government review in 1994.
His proposal surprised some analysts, who said Mr Collier's hopes of
private-sector financing, especially at the 8 per cent rate of return he
quoted, was unrealistic.
Mr Steve Thomas, nuclear specialist at Sussex University's Science Policy
Research Unit, said: 'They are saying this because they can't claim to be a
nuclear company and not have investment plans.'
The new station, which would start up around 2002, would have two 1300MW
reactors. It would be second in size only to Britain's huge coal-fired power
station, Drax, which generates power for six cities the size of Liverpool.
Nuclear Electric believes it would produce electricity at less than 3p per
unit, compared with between 6p and 8p for the oldest nuclear stations, and
just over 4p for Sizewell B.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, criticised Nuclear
Electric, saying it lived in 'never-never land.' It said: 'Never accept the
economic realities of nuclear, and never deal with the formidable
radioactive legacy of nuclear waste.'
Thirty six organisations and individuals have sent the Department of Trade
and Industry their views on the privatisation of British Coal. The 36
included companies interested in bidding for the state-owned coal company.
The companies which contacted the DTI before its deadline on Monday included
the electricity generators, mining unions and mining groups.

FT  24 JUN 92 / London expected to lag EC city league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GREATER LONDON will see the slowest economic growth of the European
Community's main city areas for the first half of the 1990s, while Greater
Manchester will be second from the bottom of the EC league, a report from a
group of research bodies says.
The European Economic Research Consortium forecasts in a report on prospects
for EC and Austrian city regions that five of the 10 slowest-growing areas
will be in the UK.
It expects the fastest-growing UK city region to be Edinburgh, ranked 23 out
of 32, followed by Cardiff and Birmingham at 24 and 25 respectively, while
the Glasgow-Strathclyde area is forecast to be 27th.
These areas are expected to achieve annual increases of at least 2 per cent
in gross value added between 1989 and 1996, while the value added to goods
and services produced in London is expected to grow by only 1 per cent a
year in that period. For Manchester, the consortium forecasts annual
value-added growth of 1.4 per cent.
Madrid and Berlin are expected to be the fastest-growing EC cities with
annual value-added growth of 4.7 and 4.5 per cent respectively.
The UK cities' poor growth outlook reflects the deep UK recession. But
London has special problems including traffic congestion, high costs and
de-industrialisation, while Manchester will be affected by a further decline
in its textile and defence-related industries.

EDINBURGH-based Channel S Television yesterday abandoned plans to bid to
operate the Channel 5 terrestrial television network, two weeks before the
bid deadline, blaming uncertainty about costs.
The contractor for Channel 5 will have to pay for the retuning of about 3m
video recorders to prevent interference from the new channel. The costs of
retuning video recorders accounts for about Pounds 50m of the Pounds 200m
estimated overall cost of launching the channel.
Mr Justin Dukes, former managing director of Channel 4 and in charge of the
Channel S plans to bid for Channel 5, said that the retuning costs 'cannot
be precisely predicted'.
He added that cost estimates 'have taken the business from being possible
to, in our opinion, an impossible one'.
The two remaining serious contenders are the Entertainment Channel - a
consortium of Time Warner, TV-am and the Daily Telegraph group - and the
Five TV group, which includes Thames TV, Sony Pictures International and
Canwest Global Communications, a Canadian-based international broadcaster.

MR MICHAEL Stoney, 42, operated close to centre of the Maxwell empire. Like
Ian Maxwell and Kevin Maxwell, he chose to remain silent when asked to give
evidence before the Commons social security select committee.
Before Mr Stoney resigned as deputy managing director (finance) of Mirror
Group Newspapers (MGN), he had become one of Robert Maxwell's most trusted
lieutenants.
Mr Stoney, who became a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
1971, began climbing the Maxwell ladder after Maxwell Communication
Corporation (MCC) took over a stationery company where he was finance
director. He was promoted by Maxwell to deputy managing director in October,
over the head of Mr Lawrence Guest, the finance director, and without
consulting other directors.
In recent weeks he is understood to have been working from the offices of
Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm which is administrator of the private
Maxwell companies, assisting investigations.
Last night it emerged that Mr Stoney had been retained as a salaried
employee of Headington Investments by Arthur Andersen.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, one of the four administrators, said that Mr Stoney had
been retained since December. He added: 'It was considered to be the most
cost-effective way to get to the bottom of a number of issues . . . his
function is to assist us in whatever we determine.'

<TEXT>
TRADE liberalisation talks between Hungary and Poland and the European Free
Trade Area are deadlocked, the Hungarian government said yesterday.
The two former communist states are refusing to accept Efta's offer on
import tariff reductions, regarding them as much less generous than the
European Community association agreements.
The Hungarian government said sympathy for eastern Europe and the political
will to overcome protectionist lobbies were fading. This could be seen in
the lack of progress both with Efta and with EC parliaments' ratification of
the association agreements.
One stumbling block in Hungary's Efta talks is the resistance of Austrian
farmers to increased food imports from Hungary. A good agreement with
Austria, a neighbour and the second most important trading partner, is
particularly important to Hungary.
Czechoslovakia's agreement with Efta, which was concluded in April, has come
under attack for setting precedents for eastern European weakness in the
face of west European negotiating strength.
Discussions between Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary on regional free
trade to parallel that with western Europe also suffered a blow with the
move to break up the Czechoslovak federation. The uncertainty will delay
talks and an independent Slovakia would resist dramatic moves to open up
markets, Hungarian officials say.
Hungary is set to back down on discriminatory vehicle import tariffs in
favour of Ford of the US after heavy pressure from European carmakers.
The government promised yesterday to reverse a decision to impose 18 per
cent duties on van imports by all companies except for Ford, which is one of
the largest investors in Hungary.
Duties on European-made vans will now be brought down to match the free
entry granted to Ford's Transit model.
The decision is a humiliating defeat for Hungary at the hands of powerful
vehicle manufacturers such as Fiat and Renault which prodded the European
Community to investigate discrimination embodied in the two-tier tariff.
Hungary gave in after European carmakers made veiled threats to hinder
ratification of its association agreement with the EC.
But the Hungarian government remained defiant even after its climbdown,
saying that it had introduced the tariff with 'noble motives' of promoting
foreign investment in Hungary.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton united yesterday to condemn
private investigations of prominent public figures allegedly ordered by Mr
Ross Perot, the likely independent presidential candidate.
Mr Bush took umbrage at the reports of Mr Perot's investigations, describing
them as 'beyond the pale' in a television programme to be shown this week.
Mr Clinton, the prospective Democratic candidate, yesterday attacked the
alleged investigations into the president and his family.
However, Mr Tom Luce, a senior aide to Mr Perot, dismissed as distortions
reports that the Texas businessman had ordered the probes. 'There were no
investigations, no detectives.' The charges against Mr Perot came 'from the
people who have specialised in saying 'we'll do whatever it takes to win','
he said.
Vice-President Dan Quayle, who has led the recent Republican assault on Mr
Perot's penchant for activities he says show contempt for the law, chipped
in by pointing out the danger to civil liberties of a President Perot in
charge of the 'IRS, the FBI and CIA'.
The particular bone of contention is a Washington Post report on Sunday
covering alleged Perot-inspired probes into the business dealings of the
president, his family and associates. It highlighted an incident in 1988
when Mr Perot personally turned over to the newspaper documents relating to
a Dollars 48m (Pounds 25.9m) Pennzoil lease transaction said to have
benefited those close to the then vice-president.
Mr Luce said yesterday this was 'a highly questionable transaction,' details
of which had been given to Mr Perot and passed on to the newspaper as a
matter of public interest. No investigation of Mr Bush has been ordered, he
added.
However, other reports have also highlighted examples of Mr Perot's alleged
proclivity to order background checks on those who might have displeased
him.
This latest controversy was not apparently a factor in a New York Times poll
yesterday, which reported a doubling in Mr Perot's unfavourable rating
compared with a previous survey in April. His comments that wealthier US
pensioners should give up social security benefits went down with a thud.
However, the poll also found Mr Bush and Mr Clinton in worse shape. Approval
for the president's handling of the economy was lower even than the depths
plumbed by President Jimmy Carter at the same stage in 1980, while the
Democrat's capacity for strong leadership was viewed as lower than either Mr
Bush or Mr Perot.
The net result was that four out of 10 people surveyed expressed
dissatisfaction with the three choices before them.

JAPAN has promised to extend loans worth Y111.91bn (Pounds 476.21m) to India
in the year ending next March, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo. This represented a 5 per cent rise
from the Y106.59b in loans to India a year earlier, he said.
The loans to be extended in 1992-93 will be used for various public works
projects, the ministry official said.
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, arrived in Japan on Monday for
a five-day official visit. He and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, his Japanese
counterpart, met yesterday for discussions on various international issues.
The two men also agreed to hold talks on promoting the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons, although details have yet to be decided, the official said.
India, which exploded a nuclear device in 1974, has repeatedly stressed that
its nuclear programme is peaceful. However, it has refused to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which it believes discriminates in
favour of existing nuclear powers. It has said it will not change its
position at least until 1995 when the treaty is reviewed.
India has also said it also objects to a US-backed proposal for a five-power
conference to create a zone free of nuclear weapons in south Asia, based on
the belief that nuclear disarmament is a global problem.
Mr Rao repeated India's objection to signing the NPT; his Japanese host
suggested New Delhi give the matter further consideration.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTEST for the post of the president of India - normally a
straightforward election for a ceremonial position - seems to be turning
into a bitter battle between the ruling Congress party and its opponents.
The Congress party last week nominated Mr Shankar Dayal Sharma, the
country's vice-president, for the election in July to replace the incumbent,
Mr R. Venkataraman.
In doing so, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister and party leader, did
not hold consultations with the opposition parties, abandoning his
proclaimed stand of being a consensus seeker. The opposition retaliated by
seeking a candidate to oppose Mr Sharma, but in so doing exposed its deep
political divisions.
First, the opposition insisted that it should be allowed to decide who the
vice-president should be if Mr Sharma were elected. Then, Mr V P Singh, the
former prime minister and leader of Janata Dal, created controversy by
maintaining that the next president should belong to what are known as the
scheduled castes (harijans) or a tribe considered backward under the
constitution.
The opposition parties found it difficult to find a common candidate despite
a series of consultations they have held among themselves. Mr G G Swell, a
former deputy speaker of the Indian parliament and a former diplomat, has
found the most support and he is expected to run against Mr Sharma. He is
from a tribal background in the north-eastern state of Meghalaya.
Mr Swell is, however, not supported by the Marxists and Left parties who
have welcomed Mr Sharma's choice. In the meantime, another opposition
leader, Mr Ram Jethmalani, a lawyer, has left the Janata Dal for failing to
nominate him for the post and has declared his own candidature. Opposition
parties are continuing their talks and yesterday the Bharatiya Janata Party,
the Hindu revivalist party which is the largest opposition grouping,
declared its support for Mr Swell. A hard-fought contest now appears
inevitable.
The president is chosen by an electoral college made up by the two houses of
parliament and the state legislatures. While opposition differences
strengthen the chances of Mr Sharma, his election is by no means a certainty
because the Congress is in a minority in parliament and a number of states
are ruled by non-Congress parties.

THE Hong Kong stock exchange corruption trial ended dramatically yesterday
when the seven men charged were found not guilty after nearly two days of
deliberation by the jury.
The High Court trial, which sprang from investigations into the conduct of
Mr Ronald Li, the former head of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, casts doubt
over similar charges to which Mr Li last year pleaded guilty.
It is unclear, however, whether the verdict will affect the four-year prison
sentence he received in October 1990 for soliciting preferential allocations
of shares in companies due to be listed on the exchange.
In the trial just ended, six defendants were charged with accepting or
soliciting preferential allocations of shares. The seventh, Mr Li's son
Alfred, was charged with aiding and abetting the other defendants. On
Saturday, Mr Justice Mortimer, told the jury that a ruling by the Appeal
Court concerning the application of the colony's Bill of Rights had altered
the basis upon which they were to judge the allegations against the six.
The Appeal Court removed the offence of unlawful possession from the
colony's law after it found that it was inconsistent with the Bill of Rights
ruling that a person is innocent until proven guilty.
The Appeal Court ruling meant that the defendants no longer had to prove
they had permission, lawful authority, or reasonable excuse, to accept the
shares.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Employees' lot dealt blow by Japanese court: Bosses can
restrict holiday time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese Supreme Court yesterday rejected an appeal from a company
worker who protested about his employers' attempts to cut short his
holidays.
The judgment was widely seen as a setback for efforts to cut working hours,
reduce unpaid overtime and generally improve the lot of the Japanese company
employee. Trade union organisations expressed dismay about the court's
verdict, saying it went against the trend of current thinking.
The case concerns Mr Toshiaki Yamaguchi, a journalist who covered science
and technology for Jiji Press, a news agency. In the summer of 1980, he
wanted to take a 32-day holiday, including 24 days' paid holiday, to go to
Europe to study the nuclear industry.
Jiji did not dispute Mr Yamaguchi's holiday entitlement, but declined to
allow him to take more than 15 days off consecutively. When Mr Yamaguchi
took 30 days off, he was reprimanded and fined with a cut in his winter
bonus.
Mr Yamaguchi claimed Y750,000 (Pounds 3,190) in compensation and took his
claim to the courts. When the Tokyo District Court rejected his claim, he
appealed to the High Court, which upheld his suit and ordered Jiji to pay Mr
Yamaguchi compensation. The court ruled Mr Yamaguchi had a right to take a
long holiday. It noted Mr Yamaguchi's absence did not disrupt the work of
his section since he had made efforts to arrange for other journalists to
cover for him.
But the Supreme Court yesterday cancelled the compensation order, saying
that the timing of a long holiday should be decided at an employer's
discretion. Employees who planned long holidays should take their employers'
interest into account in deciding the time and length of long holidays, said
the court. If they did not, an employer had the right to intervene and
instruct an employee to change his plans. Jiji had not exercised this right
unreasonably. The court sent the case back to the High Court for further
deliberation.
Commenting on the case, Nikkeiren, a leading employers' federation, said the
judgment 'couldn't have been better', since it confirmed that employees were
required to consult employers if they planned long holidays.
But Mr Seigo Yamada, secretary general of Rengo, a trade union
confederation, said the judgment ignored the fact that an individual's will
should be treated with maximum respect as far as the timing and duration of
holidays was concerned.
Mr Yamaguchi, who still works for Jiji, said the Supreme Court had lost an
opportunity to establish that Japanese had the right to take long holidays
like westerners. He said he had taken a month-long holiday every year and
would continue to do so until he retired.
Most Japanese company workers would be delighted to take holidays even half
as long as Mr Yamaguchi's. Large Japanese companies, including financial and
industrial groups, allow staff an average of 15 days' paid leave a year. But
employees are so busy that they take only an average of eight days' holiday.
The law protects workers' rights to take paid holidays, but many people
surrender their entitlements 'voluntarily' for fear of pressure from
colleagues. For similar reasons, workers 'voluntarily' count sick leave as
holiday.
Japan will go to the polls on July 26 in nationwide elections for the upper
house of parliament, the government announced yesterday, Reuter adds from
Tokyo.
It will be the first big electoral test for Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
who took office last November.
His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will be looking to do better than in 1989
when, with sex and corruption scandals tainting the cabinet and party
leadership, it lost control of the upper house for the first time since
1955.
But the conservative, pro-business LDP, in unbroken power now for 37 years,
retains its stable majority in the more powerful lower house.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S President Chaim Herzog, speaking as the country voted in a general
election, yesterday called for a change in the Jewish state's fragmented
parliamentary system to produce stable government.
He wants to end the situation whereby any of a dozen small parties which
manages to gain a foothold in parliament can hold the larger parties to
ransom in intense coalition bargaining.
The bargaining will commence today and, on past record, could last for weeks
before an administration is formed. Israel's form of pure proportional
representation, with no system of local constituency representation, meant
neither the ruling Likud party nor the opposition Labour party would win a
majority in yesterday's vote.
Labour was hoping opinion poll predictions giving it a lead over the Likud
would prove correct, giving Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the party leader, the
advantage in the process of building a coalition from among some 15 parties
expected to win seats in the Knesset.
Mr Rabin, committed to trading some of the occupied territories in exchange
for peace, wants to accelerate peace negotiations in which the Likud, under
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected the 'land for peace' formula
demanded by the Arab side.
Mr Herzog complained as he cast his vote: 'This is the sixth time in nine
years that I am going through this experience of imposing or granting the
job of forming a government on someone.' An amendment to the system allowing
for direct election of the prime minister, in parallel with the party poll,
is to take effect in the next election. But Mr Herzog said reform should go
further.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Rise in French jobless strains benefit system: Employers and
unions are counting the costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is the latest of several industrialised countries to find that rising
joblessness has put its unemployment benefit system under serious financial
strain.
Employers and unions are haggling over how to prevent the collapse of their
unemployment pay scheme, Unedic, the sole source of income for 1.7m jobless
people.
Two-thirds funded by employers and one third by workers, Unedic is FFr15bn
(Pounds 1.52bn) in the red and the deficit is growing by FFr1bn per month.
The Patronat employers' organisation which called the emergency talks, says
that unless something is done, Unedic will run out of cash from October.
The Unedic crisis comes at a time of parallel difficulties in other
countries: the US and Sweden are debating how to meet growing demands on
their benefit systems; Spanish plans to cut state benefits have provoked
protest strikes; and the German system is under considerable strain. France
stands out for being the country where the unemployment benefit system has
come closest to financial collapse.
Unedic was founded on a partnership principle sharing costs between
companies and employees. It is not state-funded and, accordingly, Mrs
Martine Aubry, the labour minister, has kept out of the talks beyond warning
that the state cannot be expected to bail it out.
The scheme was devised at a time when French unemployment was around
140,000, a fraction of today's 2.9m. Over the past year, an extra 200,000
people have signed on to Unedic, as companies cut costs. Unedic expects to
spend FFr105bn in 1992, up from FFr94bn last year. The partners agreed a
rise in contributions last December, but this proved not nearly enough.
They face several options. First, the unions want employers' and workers'
contributions raised to boost income. The Patronat argues that a further
rise in France's already high social security costs is likely to worsen
unemployment and increase the strain on Unedic. Mrs Aubry agrees.
Employers and unions appear less far apart on other options, where they are
arguing details rather than principles. One possibility is for Unedic to
make cash flow savings by delaying payments. Recipients of assistance now
get their money three days after losing their jobs. The Patronat estimates
savings of FFr200m per year for every day of delayed payments. The unions
are likely to accept a short delay.
Another option is to reduce the amount of benefits per period of
contribution. Currently, a worker who has been paying Unedic contributions
for a year is entitled to 14 months of benefits, rising to five years of
benefit for two years' contributions. When the Unedic benefits run out, the
unemployed then claim state social security, already grappling with its own
deficit.
The Patronat argues that French unemployment entitlements should come closer
into line with contributions.
The final option, already being applied, is to increase the costs to
companies of making redundancies among older workers. Around a quarter of
Unedic's budget goes on benefits for those over 55, who have taken the brunt
of the recent redundancies.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Ruhe proposes scrapping EFA for cheaper jet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German defence minister, Mr Volker Ruhe, yesterday proposed that the
controversial European fighter aircraft (EFA) should be scrapped and
replaced with a cheaper, lighter aircraft.
His compromise plan to save money, and yet still provide jobs for the German
aerospace industry and a European aircraft for the Luftwaffe, is likely to
be put to the parties in the ruling coalition next week.
The original plan for the coalition partners to decide for or against German
participation in the multi-nation project yesterday was put back until June
30, apparently at the instigation of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He is known to
be concerned to reach a decision acceptable to Britain, Italy and Spain, the
other participants, and to the Christian Social Union (CSU), the
Bavaria-based conservative party which is his closest ally in the
government.
The idea of a cheaper, lighter aircraft was first mooted in press reports
yesterday. It was greeted sceptically by the industry which saw it as a
political face-saving measure rather than a serious technical proposal at
this stage.
Mr Ruhe's plan appears to be to use technology developed for the EFA,
together with parts bought off-the-shelf from in some sort of
modular-assembly concept. 'We are talking about a new aircraft,' Mr Ruhe
said as he arrived to attend a parliamentary meeting of the Christian
Democrats (CDU) and CSU.
'First there must be a decision to say no to production (of the EFA). That
will open the way to using the development costs in the 1990s for a
different European aircraft that would be considerably cheaper.'
A spokesman for Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary which has a
33 per cent stake in the EFA project, said that any new aircraft would mean
virtually 'going back to the drawing board'. British Aerospace has 33 per
cent in the project, Italy's Alenia 21 per cent and Spain's CASA 13 per
cent.
Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday tabled a formal amendment to
the constitution, which would in future allow German soldiers to serve in UN
peace-keeping operations anywhere in the world.
The move, which clearly excludes 'peace-making' operations like the Gulf
War, is likely to be put to the vote in September, when it will require a
two-thirds majority in parliament to take effect.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and France were yesterday attempting to broker a last-minute
compromise over the 48-hour working week directive due to be put to a vote
at today's meeting of labour and social affairs ministers in Luxembourg.
The UK is vehemently opposed to the directive but its 11 EC partners appear
determined to achieve it. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK employment minister,
was due to meet Ms Martine Aubry, the French labour minister, in Paris
yesterday to discuss the issue.
The Portuguese presidency, at the behest of France and Germany, has offered
Britain concessions which would allow the UK to delay introducing the
48-hour limit for up to 10 years, when the situation would be reviewed. This
would be seven years more than the three years allowed to all member states
for the introduction of new directives.
It would also give workers willing to work more than 48 hours the right to
do so, while those unwilling to exceed the prescribed limit would get the
full protection of the law. Employers would be obliged to keep records of
both groups of workers, under the surveillance of national health and safety
authorities.
The British government indicated on Monday it was resolved to vote against
any measure which would oblige it to limit the working week, even in the
future.
It was not clear yesterday that Britain's partners would press the issue and
risk a new breach in Community unity ahead of Friday's Lisbon summit where
EC heads of government will discuss the future of the Maastricht treaty for
the first time since its rejection by Denmark on June 2.
Britain's EC partners were also considering issuing a declaration that they
would not use the concessions granted to the UK.
Such a declaration, sharply delineating the labour market aspirations of the
11 from those of the UK, would replicate the division of social policy
agreed at Maastricht - if only for a limited period.
But this first practical instance of Maastricht's agreement to disagree
would depend on 'the UK at least abstaining' on the working time directive,
according to a senior EC official.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Gonzalez sends domestic message with choice of foreign
minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPOINTMENT of Mr Javier Solana as Spain's new foreign minister reveals
a good deal more about the shifting power balance in the ruling Socialist
party than any diplomatic initiatives planned by the Madrid government.
A longstanding member of prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's inner political
circle and a physicist by profession, Mr Solana will be sworn in today to
replace Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez who has retired on grounds of
ill-health after seven years in the government.
Mr Solana, who over the past decade has successively held the posts of
minister of culture and minister of education, is the only genuine
counterweight among Spain's top socialists to Mr Alfonso Guerra, the former
deputy prime minister who as deputy leader of the party commands the party
machinery.
Like both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Guerra, Mr Solana joined the then clandestine
Socialist party as a student in the 1960s and together the three rapidly
rose to the forefront of opposition politics at the tail end of the Franco
dictatorship. Mr Solana was raised in Madrid where he attended elite schools
before doing post-graduate research in the US.
At Mr Guerra's instigation, Mr Solana, 50, was barred from the Socialist
party's executive two years ago and he has since come to represent the more
liberal wing of the party that opposes the so-called guerristas entrenched
in the party headquarters. Mr Solana's promotion to the Foreign Ministry not
only highlights the growing estrangement between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Guerra.
It also converts Mr Solana into a main contender to lead the government
should Mr Gonzalez choose to stand down.
By asking Mr Solana to take on the Foreign Ministry, Mr Gonzalez has clearly
stated his preferences. The signal was made all the stronger by the prime
minister's decision to replace Mr Solana with Mr Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba,
the secretary of state for education, who is an outspoken guerrista
opponent, and to keep Mr Carlos Solchaga, the main architect of the
government's confrontation with the unions, as economy and finance minister.
Mr Guerra's camp had hoped that the resignation of Mr Fernandez Ordonez
would lead to a big cabinet reshuffle in which Mr Solchaga would leave the
government.
The appointments follow a weekend closed-door meeting at the Socialist
headquarters in which Mr Gonzalez, as party leader, allegedly issued a stern
warning against what he viewed as the narrow sectarianism of the party
executive.
Yesterday, Mr Solana said the thrust of Spanish diplomacy was well
established and that 'a new foreign minister did not mean a new foreign
policy'. In practise Mr Gonzalez, who over the years has increasingly
relished his role as an international statesman, keeps a tight rein on
policy.
Mr Solana can nevertheless be expected to be tougher than Mr Fernandez
Ordonez, his affable predecessor, when it comes to pursuing Spain's special
interests in the EC. At the top of Spain's agenda for next weekend's Lisbon
summit is the belief that the Community should be 'deepened' before it is
'widened' and that the cohesion funds agreed at the Maastricht summit last
December should be honoured.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (15): A patchy record - Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike Brazil or Malaysia, Indonesia has kept a low profile in international
environmental politics, but neither Jakarta nor the outside world can afford
to ignore the importance of the country's forests and seas for national
economic growth and for the global environment.
'Indonesia is probably the most important reservoir for biodiversity in
Asia,' says Ms Marty Fujita, director in Indonesia for the Nature
Conservancy organisation of the US. 'It's basically the Brazil of Asia.'
Indonesia, according to a draft biodiversity action plan for the country,
makes up 1.3 per cent of the earth's land surface but hosts 10 per cent of
its flowering plant species, 12 per cent of mammals, 16 per cent of reptiles
and amphibians, 17 per cent of birds and more than 35 per cent of fish
species. The human inhabitants of the archipelago use an astonishing 7,000
different kinds of fish as a source of protein, the report says.
Although the government has eschewed the confrontational tactics used by Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister of neighbouring Malaysia, in his
negotiations with foreign interlocutors, most Indonesians share his view
that economic development is more important than protecting the environment
for its own sake.
For Indonesians, therefore, the main question is not whether the country's
natural resources should be exploited, but whether the exploitation is
sustainable in the long term.
On paper, the situation does not look too bad. The export of timber products
is one of the country's largest foreign exchange earners and Indonesia has
already set aside a laudable 11 per cent of its territory for conservation
areas and has outlined an ambitious strategy which combines exploitation and
protection.
Of the total land area of 193m hectares, 144m ha are classified as forest,
of which 66m ha will be selectively logged, 48m ha will be preserved intact
and 30m ha is being removed to make way for agriculture, settlements and
industry.
Population growth is under control and the government has recently
established the environmental impact management agency (Bapedal) to enforce
environmental regulations which are in the process of being strengthened.
On the ground, however, Indonesia's environmental record is patchy at best
and its statistics questionable. Government agencies, even if they have the
will, lack the money and the manpower to enforce the law.
Two conflicts publicised by local pressure groups and reported in the
Indonesian press in the space of five days illustrate the problem. The first
concerned a government plan to convert a 35,000ha forest reserve in south
Kalimantan into a timber estate, instead of attempting to repair the damage,
on the grounds that it was already degraded. The second was about 4,000ha of
forest reserve in Bogor, Java, which had apparently been included in a
mining concession.
Across the country, mangrove swamps have been turned into prawn farms, coral
reefs have been dynamited and rivers have been polluted. Jakarta is
suffering from the sort of traffic congestion and air pollution now common
to several south-east Asian capitals.
The formation of the Indonesian Business Council for Sustainable Development
is regarded by some environmentalists as something of an empty gesture, and
the prompt naming of Mr Mohamad Hasan, a wealthy logging concessionaire and
associate of President Suharto, as one of the group's patrons, has only
reinforced that view.
Mr Emil Salim, State Minister of Population and Environment, believes
loggers are in a strong position 'because they are the number one foreign
exchange earner of Indonesia', but he rejects the suggestion that
businessmen such as Mr Hasan can bend the rules to suit them.
'That he has influence I agree,' Mr Salim said in an interview. 'That he
dictates policy I do not.'
Mr Salim points to water pollution control as evidence of the government's
seriousness in tackling environmental issues. Under the 'Prokasih'
programme, the government concentrated on industrial pollution of 25 rivers
in 11 provinces and agreed on effluent targets with thousands of companies.
After two years, 400 companies, some of them foreign, failed to meet the
requirements and were given a warning. Of those, about 50 continued to flout
their agreements and their names were published in the media. Court cases
against three companies were being prepared, Mr Salim said, and the
companies had asked for more time to comply.
Critics dismiss the whole process on the grounds that it is far too
accommodating towards polluting industries and sets only minimal
requirements. One Indonesian economist, asked whether companies were
becoming concerned about environmental pressures, replied bluntly: 'No.'
As in other developing countries, the environmental awareness of the urban
middle class is several steps ahead of the government's willingness or
ability to enforce adequate environmental controls. 'You notice it in
letters to the press,' says Mr Salim. 'People are more conscious, even
common people. If there is pollution, sometimes they raise hell.'
Indonesians and foreigners alike agree that 'sustainable development' is the
desired goal but it will take time to bridge the gap between Indonesian and
foreign interpretations of what is actually taking place at the moment.
Few outsiders would agree that Indonesian forests are being sustainably
logged and the World Bank has recommended the payment of higher fees by
concessionaires, the granting of concession terms longer than 20 years and
closer to the 35-year cutting cycle so that loggers have an incentive to
manage the forests prudently, and the introduction of interest-bearing
performance bonds to ensure the application of sustainable forest management
practices.
According to some environmentalists, Indonesia's growth rate of 6.7 per cent
in 1991 would be a mere 2.5 to 3 per cent if the depletion of the country's
natural resources were taken into account. But even if one accepts the
validity of such calculations, the difficulty for outsiders is that most
Indonesians, like the Thais before them, would say that economic growth
makes the depletion more than worthwhile.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (16): Lessons from deregulation -
Interview
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Radius Prawiro, Co-ordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance, Industry
and Development Supervision, talks to William Keeling and Victor Mallet:
FT: What future economic deregulation is planned and what lessons have you
learnt from deregulation to date?
Radius: The deregulation programme for the coming weeks will be in the field
of trade and industry. It is possible that we will reduce our tariffs for a
number of products.
But deregulation is an on-going process and you cannot do everything at
once.
FT: Will tariff reduction apply across the board or only to Asean (the
Association of South East Asian Nations)?
Radius: We would like to be more competitive. Not only are we aiming at
intra-Asean trade but also in general we have to reduce tariffs.
Last year we lowered tariffs from an average 40 per cent to 30 per cent.
FT: Could you have a further cut of 5 per cent or 10 per cent?
Radius: To be frank, we have to bargain with so many people, with so many
producers, with so many manufacturers.
Of course, we would like to go as far as possible but those people say
'Well, I am ready to go right now, but other companies aren't ready yet'.
FT: Critics say deregulation has been limited, such as when a state monopoly
is transferred to a private monopoly. What are your concerns on private
monopolies, in particular on cloves?
Radius: It is being reduced gradually.
FT: It still retains the sole right to sell cloves.
Radius: Because they have huge stocks and they have to repay the debts of
the banks. So they have to sell. The government cannot take over because
then who would repay the debts? They are responsible for repaying the debts.
FT: Are you worried by the growth of imports?
Radius: Yes, we are very worried by the growth of imports. That's why last
year when we had an overheated economy we had to cut imports by having a
tight monetary policy.
Interest rates increased, so finally instead of having an Dollars 8bn
current account deficit we had only a Dollars 4.3bn deficit.
FT: Isn't a danger of a tight monetary policy that it hurts companies which
provide export revenue?
Radius: Let me tell you, in 1990 the export increase in non-oil and gas
goods was 6 per cent; when we introduced a tight money policy in 1991,
exports of the non-oil and gas goods increased 25 per cent.
FT: How will the new banking law affect the banking sector?
Radius: The new banking law will allow foreign equity participation up to 49
per cent in both state and private banks and will give the state banks
greater flexibilty of management and operation to compete with private
banks.
In the case of private sector banks they may want to have a joint venture
with foreign banks to improve their management and banking practices.
In the case of the state banks we are still studying what will be the most
effective and efficient way.
FT: How does the government plan to restructure the state banks?
Radius: The government has decided to follow the same capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) principles as the Bank for International Settlements, which is around
8 per cent of total assets.
But it would be very difficult for developing countries right now to jump to
that figure, so we have to go step by step.
However, nobody is going to buy shares from the state banks if their capital
structure hasn't been improved. The shareholder is responsible for that,
which means the government has to come up with equity funding. We have in
our budget certain surpluses and these can be used for equity.
FT: What is the strategy for containing international debt?
Radius: It is the setting of limits. We try to curb foreign borrowing. In
particular, we are not going to finance big projects, except those within
the ceilings.
FT: Are you concerned that by allowing large projects to proceed under
foreign ownership the strain on the balance of payments will increase?
Radius: It depends on the quality of the borrowing. If you borrow short and
use the money here for long-term financing, you get stuck. Since we have a
more active private sector, this means that the borrowing by the private
sector increases. This we have to be careful of.
FT: Wouldn't you be content for market forces to dictate what banks can
borrow abroad?
Radius: Not this time. We still have to control the borrowing. The appetite
to borrow is quite big.
FT: Yet you still have to fund enormous infrastructural projects.
Radius: We are borrowing for this from donors and these are soft loans. It
is really big, but it is concessionary with an interest rate below 3.5 per
cent.
Part is being financed by the World Bank, which is less concessionary, but
the terms are long compared to commercial borrowing.
FT: How concerned are you about Indonesia's reliance on foreign donors?
Radius: We actually have a negative outflow of capital with regard to
borrowing from the so-called donor countries.
We are repaying our debts, around Dollars 7bn a year principal and interest.
But if we can't borrow from outside it will be very difficult for us to
repay the debts.
FT: If donor countries link aid to conditions which you regard as
unacceptable, such as human rights or a particular view of democracy, might
you be unwilling to pay past debt?
Radius: No, no, no. Even to the Dutch, we thank them for supporting us for
24 years, we thank them for chairing donor meetings for 24 years, and for
their efforts to convince other donors to support Indonesia's development
programme.
What we do not like is when development assistance has been used to
intimidate us. This is not good. Human rights is a topic that can be
discussed.
We are a member of the UN human rights commission, and we are keen to
respect human rights.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (13): Real and symbolic concessions -
Islam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'RIGHT - We're Moslems' declare the stickers on car rear windows in Jakarta,
in a sort of Islamic counterpoint to the 'Honk for Jesus' message seen on
the highways of America.
Two statements are commonly made about Islam in south-east Asia. The first
is that Indonesia has the largest Moslem population in the world, with 90
per cent of its 183m people professing the Islamic faith; the second is that
the Islam practised in Indonesia and Malaysia is much milder than the Middle
Eastern brand.
Both statements are broadly true, but they gloss over the great diversity of
Indonesian and Malaysian Islam, a diversity which encompasses radical as
well as moderate and mystical tendencies.
Only this month Mr Abdul Fatah Wiranagapati, a 69-year-old Moslem
fundamentalist linked to a separatist movement in the northern Indonesian
province of Aceh, was sentenced to eight years in jail for attempting to set
up an independent Islamic state.
Aceh's mosques overflow with worshippers each Friday, the Moslem holy day,
and resentment of the central government in Jakarta has helped to fuel
Islamic fundamentalism.
In the nearby Malaysian state of Kelantan, the Parti Islam is attempting to
introduce Islamic criminal law in defiance of the central government's view
that such a move is unacceptable in a multiracial and multi-religious
society.
On the main Indonesian island of Java, Moslems opposed to gambling recently
protested against the introduction of a lottery. Last month saw the opening
of the country's first Islamic bank, Bank Muamalat Indonesia.
The rise of Islamic consciousness over the past decade - more and more women
wear Islamic scarves, for example - has prompted President Suharto and his
supporters to emphasise the country's Moslem identity and to make several
real and symbolic concessions to Moslem groups.
President Suharto encouraged the formation two years ago of the
All-Indonesia Association of Moslem Intellectuals (ICMI) to bring together
loyalist Moslems under the leadership of Mr B J Habibie, the minister
responsible for research and technology.
Last year, Mr Suharto and his wife undertook their first pilgrimage to
Mecca, earning him the title 'Haji' (one who has been on the Haj) and the
honorary first name 'Mohammed'. He was also a supporter of the new Islamic
bank.
The complex forces of Islam are evidently regarded as a useful counterweight
to the military establishment and the extent to which the authorities are
guilty of political opportunism has now become a matter of public debate.
A mass prayer in April for President Suharto's re-election became so
controversial after the event - particularly when a number of Islamic groups
said to have given their support to the prayer denied involvement - that the
president was forced to distance himself from the organisers of the rally.
'The president relies more and more on the Islamic movement,' says Mr
Abdurrahman Wahid, moderate leader of the country's largest Moslem
organisation, the Nahdhatul Ulama (NU).
'But the problem now is that when a rift takes place between the president
and the armed forces then those people who would like to formalise Islam in
state life try to manipulate the gap to make the president dependent on
them. This is the sorry state we are now in. . . I'm concerned that this
kind of manipulation will encourage the fundamentalists to come up.'
Mr Suharto is well aware of the dangers of the somewhat unpredictable
Islamic card that he has played in the recent election campaign.
He deliberately emasculated political Islam after the overthrow of President
Sukarno in 1965, forcing all the Moslem parties into the new United
Development Party (PPP) and framing the non-confessional official political
philosophy of 'Pancasila'.
More recently, Mr Suharto's 'New Order' government has discouraged
Indonesians from studying in countries such as Saudi Arabia where they might
absorb extremist Islamic ideas. Students say they have been told that there
are good Islamic studies courses in the US and Canada as well as in the
Middle East.
'The New Order de-politicises Islam and de-Islamises politics,' says Mr
Wahid, whose NU organisation is thought to have some 35m supporters. 'But at
the same time the government needs legitimacy from Islamic groups for its
programmes - like family planning for example.'
The moderate, mystical strain in Indonesian Islam remains strong. Islam was
brought to Indonesia by traders from Arabia and Persia from around the 14th
century, and orthodox Moslems, known as 'santri', are numerous on the coasts
of Sumatra, Sulawesi and Kalimantan. In Java, however, many of the poor are
classed as 'abangan', Moslems whose beliefs are mingled with pre-Islamic
Javanese mysticism as well as Hinduism and Buddhism.
Leaders of the Islamic Association of University Students (HMI) - which took
over the gloomy Jakarta offices of the banned communist party - reject the
violent style of Iranian or Afghan Islam and say they do not even mind about
the lottery.
'We want to become Moslems of intellect and professionalism,' says Ms Lena
Mariana Mukti. 'We are very tolerant. Our relations are very close with
other religious groups. For example after the Dili incident (when Indonesian
troops shot dead at least 50 pro-independence demonstrators at a funeral in
predominantly Christian East Timor) we went to demonstrate in the street.'
Mr Wahid reckons there is a core of only about 5,000 active Islamic
fundamentalists in the country, but he is under pressure from radicals
within his own organisation to take a stronger stand for Islam, and
profoundly concerned about Saudi-funded efforts to confront the supposed
'Christianisation' of society, an issue he regards as dangerously divisive.
'I was surprised one day when my eight-year-old daughter said she was on the
same bench as a Christian girl at school,' he said. 'Eight years old and
already talking about things in religious terms] It's not healthy for
Indonesia. . . Ten years ago there was no word of 'Christianisation' in the
mosques; now there's plenty.'
Mr Wahid distinguished himself as a Moslem by defending Mr Salman Rushdie's
right to free speech after Ayatollah Khomeini had condemned the British
writer to death for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses.
He believes that Islam should be a democratising rather than an
anti-democratic force and, in the face of harassment from the authorities,
he chairs the Forum for Democracy group.
'I saw the hanging of Jews in Baghdad in 1969 - 14 of them,' he says.
'That's when I decided to go for democracy. . . We don't want to divide
people into Moslems and second-class citizens. What happens in Iran now, or
Saudi Arabia? Non-Moslems have no rights at all.
'As long as we're given the right to explain the human side of Islam, then
I'm convinced that Indonesians will always be moderate Moslems,' he says.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (14): Social life centres around
funerals - Sulawesi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Friday morning in Rantepao, capital of Tana Toraja in Sulawesi, the
market comes to life. It is the day farmers bring their livestock to sell -
buffalo, pigs and chickens - and the market, with its cacophony of farmyard
noises and sharp smells, reflects the agricultural heart of Sulawesi.
The farmers make their way from hillside homes, past thousands of acres of
terraced paddy fields and small clusters of coffee, cocoa and clove trees.
As an admirer of sows, I searched out the pig section of the market;
Indonesia is the world's largest Moslem country but the people of Tana
Toraja are predominantly Christian and have an affinity for pork.
With their coats of dark, coarse black hair, the pigs are brought to market
trussed up in twine and fixed on their sides to large bamboo trays,
squealing loudly. Piglets fetch about Rp50,000 (Dollars 25), while adult
pigs cost as much as Rp200,000.
In a small covered square at the centre of the market lay about 150 pigs,
their distressed trotters twirling in the air. The largest sow needed four
men to be carried and must have weighed in at more than 20 stone. It brought
a tear to the eye to imagine that the Empress of Rantepao was destined for
the platter.
Social life in Tana Toraja centres around funerals which, while presided
over by Christian priests, are rooted in traditional religion and have as
their centrepiece the slaughtering of pigs and buffalo.
Families may save up for months or years for the funeral, keeping the
deceased wrapped in cloth, waiting in a back-room. This also allows
relatives living outside the district to make their travel plans. The
largest funerals will be witnessed by several hundred relatives.
Dozens of pigs and buffalo may be slaughtered and poorer families may take
years to pay off the debt - a buffalo can cost Rp5m, more than four times
Indonesia's annual per capita income.
Government officials now attend funerals to collect a tax on each
slaughtered animal but funerals have become, if anything, more lavish. They
are also, with the broad support of the local people, an important tourist
attraction.
'I was sat down by the grandmother of the deceased, a 10-year-old boy, who
explained to me how the child had died of an illness, showed me the coffin
and led me through the funeral ceremony,' said one tourist.
A sanguine view of death is at the heart of the region's cultural identity
which, despite recent generations leaving the region in the search for
wealth, remains strong. In part this is due to its past isolation in the
once remote hills of Sulawesi; it was only in 1905 that the Dutch colonisers
subdued the area after a two-year war and forced it into a wider world.
By the side of the road near the village of Lempo hangs a sign which reads
'Baby tree graves, 900 metres'. Down a red earth track and across a stretch
of vivid-green paddy field is a small copse. In the trunk of a hardwood tree
were dug three small cavities, closed off by rattan patchwork.
Babies which die before teething are placed into the cavities; eventually
the trunk will grow around the grave, embracing the child's corpse.
Elders from noble families - Tana Toraja historically has a class system,
now dying out - are buried in chambers chiselled into large rocks which
scatter the landscape or in chambers in mountain cliffs. Outside the
chambers, life-size wooden effigies are placed.
It remains to be seen, however, how the region will cope with the demands of
the modern world. Several large hotels are currently being constructed and
it will have to come to terms with the negative aspects of tourism -
foreigners wielding cameras - as well as the benefits of increased foreign
exchange.
Modern influences are already noticeable in the construction of new
buildings. Tana Toraja is reknowned for its Tongkana homes; wood-panelled
houses with large saddle-shaped bamboo roofs which curve sharply up at each
end. Raised on poles, they are a glamorous sight, with gaily-painted walls
and a central pole bedecked with the horns of buffaloes.
The houses are an important symbol of wealth but they are also
uncomfortable, with tiny windows and little ventilation. The new monied
class often build airconditioned bungalows beside the traditional house, or
come up with an architectural mish-mash placing the old Tongkonan structure
atop a new concrete residence, like a cherry on a cake.
What political demands of the region there might be - such as more local
autonomy - are kept firmly beneath the surface by Indonesia's inflexible
political system. Whereas the political campaign for the June 9 election
brought millions to the streets in Jakarta, in Rantepao life seemed to drift
on by. Either the region is solidly behind the ruling Golkar party, or
disillusion has turned to apathy.
However, with the mountain water slowly trickling through the paddy fields,
buffalo lazily submerged in streams cooling off after a hard day's work and
pigs snuffling contentedly in their stys, it is difficult to believe that
anything but tranquility is brewing in Tana Toraja. It is a region resting
in peace.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (10): A base for steady economic growth
 -Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S steady economic growth is derived as much from its agricultural
base as from investment in manufacturing. Indeed, one of the country's most
significant achievements in the past decade has been substantially to boost
agricultural production, both of food and cash crops.
From being the world's largest importer of rice, its staple food, in the
late 1970s, Indonesia is now self-sufficient. It has strengthened its
position as a leading exporter of commodities such as rubber, coffee, cocoa
and palm-oil.
However, the agricultural sector also provides some of the most glaring
examples of economic mismanagement. Sugar production and processing remains
within an inefficient system of state control and clove farmers have
suffered the inequities of a private trading company which has enjoyed
monopoly rights to buy and sell their crop.
About half the population is involved in rice production and marketing but
the drive toward self-sufficiency, initiated in the mid-1960s, did not meet
with immediate success. In 1979, for example, Indonesia imported a record 2m
tonnes to supplement production of 17.9m tonnes.
This year, production is estimated at 29.25m tonnes, an increase due mainly
to improved rice strains and a system of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
which in many areas has enabled farmers to grow three crops a year, instead
of the previous two.
The IPM programme was evolved to tackle the 'planthopper' insect which, in
the late 1970s, ate its way through many million tonnes of rice. Research
showed that an excessive use of pesticide was to blame, killing the
planthopper's natural predators. This led the government in 1986 to ban more
than 50 pesticides which had previously attracted state subsidies.
The demands of a growing population, however, mean that future
self-sufficiency is far from guaranteed. This year, the country will import
about 700,000 tonnes of rice due to a drought-affected crop last year. Much
of this will be done by recalling rice 'loans' made to neighbouring
countries during earlier years of surplus.
Cash crops have seen a similar surge in production.
Rubber production rose from 1.05m tonnes in 1985 to 1.27m tonnes last year,
making Indonesia the world's second-largest producer. Coffee production has
risen from 311,000 tonnes in 1985 to a forecast 476,000 tonnes this year,
making Indonesia the third largest-exporter, accounting for about 7 per cent
of world coffee trade.
Cocoa production has soared. Indonesia produced just 18,600 tonnes in 1984
and the government planned an increase to 56,000 tonnes by 1988 but the
farmers have wildly exceeded targets. Production in 1989 hit 143,000 tonnes
and is forecast at up to 160,000 tonnes this year.
Palm oil is also experiencing a seemingly inexorable rise in production,
increasing from 1.37m tonnes in 1987 to an estimated 2.9m tonnes this year.
Industry officials say production in 1993 may be as high as 3.7m tonnes.
By boosting production, however, Indonesia has contributed to the global
oversupply of these commodities and the sharp fall in international prices.
In the face of stagnant prices, the value of rubber exports rose from
Dollars 718m in 1985 to Dollars 855m in 1990. But revenue from coffee
exports fell from Dollars 560m to Dollars 372m in the same period.
Donor agencies believe that the rubber sector will pick up - the World Bank
is still funding smallholder production programmes - but coffee may be
heading for a crisis. Industry officials forecast Indonesian supply
outstripping demand by 77,000 tonnes next year. The future of palm oil
depends on the industry countering suggestions that it contains a high
cholesterol content.
Some farmers have moved towards higher-value commodities by developing
aqua-agriculture, particularly shrimp farming. The value of lobster, shrimp
and prawn exports rose from Dollars 269m in 1986 to Dollars 704m last year,
with Japan the principal market.
Where farmers have been given a free hand, the result has mostly been one of
higher and more efficient production.
This has not led, however, to the de-regulation of the sugar sector which -
with land forcibly turned over to production, prices set by government and
80 per cent of processing capacity in the hands of the state - is a
throw-back to the centrally-controlled economy of the early 1960s.
Donors say Indonesia, like the European Community, lacks a comparative
advantage in the production of sugar and the domestic price is over 25 per
cent more than the world market price. Production has been stagnant over the
past four years at about 2m tonnes.
This year, sugar imports, also government-controlled, are expected to reach
375,000 tonnes, providing a substantial source of revenue when sold to the
consumer at the set domestic price.
The cloves sector has suffered most from government intervention, albeit
through the guise of introducing private sector participation. Cloves are
the key ingredient in Indonesia's fragrant kretek cigarettes and up to 4m
farmers are expected to produce 100,000 tonnes of cloves this year.
In January 1991, the government awarded a monopoly over the buying and
selling of cloves to Badan Penyangga dan Pemasaran Cengkeh (BPPC), a private
company headed by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, President Suharto's youngest son.
BPPC set a farm gate price of Rp7,900 per kilo and a selling price to
cigarette companies of at least Rp12,700 per kilo (more than four times the
world market price), giving a projected sales revenue last year in excess of
Rp1,000bn. In addition, the company received Rp759bn in low-interest credit
from the central bank.
Donor officials say most farmers received just half the ceiling price for
their crop in 1991 and in February Mr Putra announced that BPPC would be
unable to service its loans. He suggested farmers cut down one third of
their clove trees to ease oversupply.
Critics of the government say the private monopolies raise doubts about the
commitment of senior members of the administration to de-regulation.
Government ministers, however, have said privately that the issue of
monopolies will be tackled within a year, although further de-regulation of
agriculture is certain to be high on the donors' agenda when they meet in
Paris next month.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (9): A market for the brave of heart -
The Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Jakarta stock market has had two turbulent years, its composite index
crashing from a high of 682 in April 1990 to under 225 last October.
Since then, however, steps have been taken to restore investor confidence
including new listing requirements and the transfer of the exchange's
management to a private company.
On June 10, the day following parliamentary elections, the index broke 320,
amounting to a 44 per cent rise in less than eight months. While many
investors are carrying large losses from two years ago, fast profits can
still be made.
The share values of some of the most traded companies prove the point:
between April 20 and early June Indocement, the largest company on the
market, rose 14 per cent; Astra International, which accounts for half
Indonesia's vehicle sales, went up 30 per cent; and Kalbe Farma, the leading
pharmaceutical company, increased 25 per cent.
The Jakarta market, however, is for the brave of heart. As Miss Sian Hansen,
analyst at Crosby Securities, explains: 'Forces behind the Jakarta stock
market are unusual. Companies' share values often fail to reflect underlying
market principles. Instead, the market is fuelled mostly by sentiment'.
A report by Hoare Govett in April, when the market stood at 271, predicted a
15-20 per cent growth in the index by the end of the year. Since the report,
the index has risen a further 11 per cent and some brokers are talking of
the index nudging 400 by year-end.
The overriding characteristic of the Jakarta exchange remains its
illiquidity and this brings with it volatility in share prices. Shares in
Bakrie and Brothers, a conglomerate with key interests in the steel sector,
have risen 100 per cent in three months on the back of heavy buying by
foreign brokers.
Regulatory changes drawn up by Bursa Efek Jakarta, the new private managers
of the stock exchange, were due to come into force on June 18 and should
improve liquidity.
They provide tougher qualifications for a new company wishing to be listed
on the exchange: an operating profit for two consecutive years; minimum
assets of Rp20bn; equity capital of at least Rp7.5bn and paid-up capital of
more than Rp2bn; at least 200 public shareholders; and a free-float of at
least 1m shares.
Companies may be struck off if they record losses for three consecutive
years; if their shares are not traded for more than six months; if they
cannot produce scheduled financial reports or if accounting standards are
not met.
The measures are designed to boost investor confidence after a series of
scandals which began the index's precipitous fall in 1990. The worst was
when Bank Duta, more than 70 per cent owned by charities chaired by
President Suharto, failed to disclose foreign exchange losses of Dollars
419m a few months before the bank went public.
Confidence in the business community was hit last year with the announcement
by two companies, the Mantrust conglomerate and Bentoel, a cigarette
company, that they would be unable to service loans totalling Dollars 770m.
And there may be more bad news waiting in the wings.
The Soeryadjaya family, which own 76 per cent of Astra International, the
second-largest quoted company, have admitted that their private Summa Group
requires financial restructuring. Brokers believe the Soeryadjaya family is
preparing to sell up to half its stake in Astra International worth over
Dollars 500m.
The future of Astra International relies largely on who takes up the
Soeryadjaya shares. If it is a reputable foreign company which can bring
with it new technology and management expertise, Astra could emerge the
stronger. Brokers are fearful, however, that the family is under pressure to
sell to domestic, politically well-connected, companies with only limited
experience in motor cars.
Astra may not be be alone in having potential problems. Dr Mari Pangestu,
head of economics at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in
Jakarta, says: 'Perhaps the greatest concern. . . is a string of company
failures' in the year ahead.
Many of the domestic conglomerates which expanded rapidly in 1989-90 have
been vulnerable to high interest rates which followed the tightening of
money supply in early 1991. However, Dr Pangestu says: 'In most cases core
business is still relatively profitable.'
If some companies are in trouble, the first to be affected will be the
banks. A measure of investor confidence in Indonesia will be how the value
of bank shares react to a new decree, expected to be finalised this month,
which will allow foreigners to buy up to 49 per cent of a listed bank's
shares.
Brokers say the initial signs are mixed. Foreign investors have been working
through domestic institutions to buy shares in advance of the decree but
following a recent rally in bank share prices, concern over loan-loss
provisions may dampen investor enthusiasm.
Nevertheless, the long-term prospects for the market are bright.
With a population of 183m and annual per capita income forecast by the World
Bank to double to more than Dollars 1,000 by the turn of the century,
Indonesia remains a vastly under-developed and potentially lucrative market.
Mr Hasan Zein Mahmud, president of BEJ, bemoans the lack of initiative shown
by many domestic institutions, such as state pension funds, which prefer to
place their funds on time deposit. As such, he believes the future of the
stock market lies in foreign investors' hands.
He says there are thousands of potential companies waiting to list but adds:
'Who will be the buyer of shares? It must the foreign investor'.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (11): Shake-out may be imminent -
Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING sector deregulation has been at the heart of Indonesia's economic
growth over the past 10 years, prompting a surge in the number of banks and
in the availability of credit to companies wishing to expand.
It has done little, however, to improve efficiency and bankers say a
shake-out of the sector may be imminent.
Deregulation began in 1983 when ceilings on credit expansion were removed,
but the real impetus came with the 1988 reforms which allowed new private
domestic banks to set up, existing foreign banks to open limited branch
networks and new foreign banks to create joint ventures with domestic
institutions.
Between 1988 and 1991 more than 70 banks and 2,000 branches were opened.
Coinciding with a flood of new investment in low cost, export-oriented
manufacturing, the result was a credit explosion. Total bank credits rose
from Rp44,001bn in 1988 to Rp97,696bn in 1990.
While banks chased clients with offers of large loans and generous credit
card terms, bankers chased high salaries. The chief foreign currency dealer
of one foreign bank was poached with an up-front payment of Dollars 400,000.
In the past 18 months, banks have had to come to terms with a series of
government initiatives that have reduced credit growth from a peak of 60 per
cent year-on-year in mid-1990 to a forecast 15 per cent this year:
In February 1991, the government ordered 12 parastatals to convert Rp8,000bn
of their bank deposits - equivalent to about one third of money in
circulation - into certificates issued by Bank Indonesia (BI), the central
bank.
Banks were told to raise their capital adequacy ratios requirement to 5 per
cent of total assets by last March; banks had previously averaged about 2
per cent. This has to be raised further to 7 per cent by next March, and to
8 per cent the following December.
Last October, ceilings on new foreign borrowing were announced. Private
banks are collectively restricted to Dollars 500m of new borrowing in each
of the next four years; the seven state banks are allowed up to Dollars 1bn
of new foreign borrowing a year until 1996.
In December 1991, a complex set of regulations was introduced which limited
banks' offshore funding to 30 per cent of their equity. In addition, the
central bank said that by next year 80 per cent of banks' lending in foreign
currency portfolios must be to export-oriented companies.
The restriction on foreign borrowing was prompted by the rapid growth of
Indonesia's international debt which increased 44 per cent to Dollars 75bn
in the past three years. Private debt accounts for one third of the total
and has been growing most rapidly.
Donors say, however, that the decision to announce new regulations is a sign
of Bank Indonesia's weak capacity to supervise the sector. Confidence in the
central bank was also shaken with the recent removal of its head of banking
supervision. The official had complained that a leading private bank's loan
portfolio was over-committed to companies belonging to its main shareholder.
The central bank has not shown much inclination to enforce last December's
regulations. Banks have handed in figures for their offshore borrowing but
have not heard from Bank Indonesia if the sector is within its limit.
Joint-venture banks have been told that they need not strictly comply with
the rule limiting foreign borrowing to 30 per cent of equity.
The regulations have, however, capped the worst excesses of the banks and
made them look to the quality of their loan portfolios.
Central bank officials say the level of bad and doubtful debts in the sector
has increased from 3.9 per cent of total loans in 1990, to 5.9 per cent in
1991.
Donor officials say that for the five state commercial banks, which account
for about half the banking sector's assets, the position is considerably
worse, with bad debts accounting for 15-25 per cent of their portfolios.
The World Bank is proposing a Dollars 300m loan to restructure the state
banks which, if all parties agree, should be in place by August. Bankers
estimate that the state banks will require a capital injection of about
Dollars 2bn by December, 1993, to satisfy capital adequacy requirements.
Many private banks have also found themselves over-extended but have made
use of a loosening of the money supply to lower deposit rates to about 17
per cent, while keeping lending rates relatively high at 24 per cent.
One foreign broking house estimates that most banks in Indonesia need a
spread of 7.6 per cent over deposit rates to break even. This allows for
high overheads (3 per cent) and for provisions of bad debts (4.6 per cent).
One bank which has accepted the need for restructuring is Bank Summa,
majority owned by the Soerjadjaya family which also holds 76 per cent of
Astra International, Indonesia's second-largest quoted company.
Bank Summa has been hit by a sharp decline in the property development
market. Its shareholders have recently injected up to Rp550bn but, bankers
say, Bank Summa may require a further injection of capital unless property
prices pick up soon.
Like Bank Summa, many private banks must come to terms with bad debts on
their books. A recent report by Jardine Fleming Nusantara, local subsidiary
of Jardine Fleming merchant bank in Hong Kong, estimated that on average
banks were providing just 1.0-1.5 per cent of performing loans for bad debt.
While the state banks are looking to the government and donors for new
capital, private banks will be looking to the foreign investor. A new
banking decree, due to be finalised this month, will allow foreign investors
to buy, for the first time, up to 49 per cent of a bank's listed shares.
Foreigners are likely, however, to be selective of the banks in which they
invest. While Bank Indonesia is certain to step in as a lender of last
resort for any bank in crisis, a series of mergers in the year ahead remains
on the cards as the sector attempts to reduce overheads and accommodate bad
debt.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (7): Key role for Singapore - Batam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S attempts to develop far-flung reaches of its territory away from
the main island of Java have finally borne fruit in the Riau islands, but
the exploitation of Batam, Bintan and the other islands owes as much to the
determination of nearby Singapore as to the Indonesians themselves.
Under the so-called 'Growth Triangle' concept espoused by Singapore, the
Riau islands and the southern Malaysian region of Johor can benefit from
Singaporean investment and expertise while providing the labour and the land
which Singapore and the multinationals based there find so hard to obtain.
Batam alone is two thirds the size of Singapore and there is a plentiful
supply of contract workers flown in from overcrowded Java.
Singaporean efficiency in constructing the necessary infrastructure was
crucial to the development of Batam as an industrial location for foreign
investors.
Indonesia granted foreign investors the right to 100 per cent ownership of
their Batam operations three years before the privilege was extended
nationwide in April this year. But of eight industrial estate projects on
the island, the only one operational is run by Batamindo, the Dollars 400m
joint venture between Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp and Jurong
Environmental Engineering (both of Singapore) and the Indonesian Salim group
of Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the wealthy business associate of President Suharto.
So far, 29 companies, including Thomson, Philips, AT&amp;T and Bowater have
begun operations at the Batam Industrial Park. In all, 40 per cent of Batam
has been set aside for industry, while the larger island of Bintan is being
marketed as a tourist attraction as well as a location for factories.
The proposed Dollars 2.2bn Bintan Beach International Resort is being touted
as 'Asia Pacific's playground of the 21st century' and will be sold together
with Singapore as a single tourist destination.
Singapore's relationship with Indonesia, like its older tie to Malaysia, may
be complementary but it has not been without friction. Singaporeans find
themselves frustrated by what they politely refer to as Indonesia's
'different work ethic' while the Indonesians sometimes accuse the
economically-advanced Singaporeans of arrogance and condescension.
A priority for Singapore has been smoothing the way for Singapore-based
companies to base themselves in Batam - for example by introducing a 'smart
card' for immigration control at ferry terminals - but the impatient
attempts to bypass Indonesian bureaucracy can easily be interpreted as an
assertion of de facto sovereignty.
'The problem we have is that we don't want to over-emphasise that we are
running the show,' says one senior government official in Singapore.
Mr Chudri Nizar of Indonesia's Batam Industrial Development Authority -
asked in Jakarta if the sovereignty issue was a problem - replied: 'It can
be.'
Indonesian officials acknowledge, however, that the confidence inspired by
Singaporean economic management and the proximity of Singaporean financial
and technical services are essential in the drive to attract international
companies to Batam.
Ms Jean Tsai of Thomson Consumer Electronics, the first company at the
Batamindo estate to start operating in early 1991, describes Thomson's
SDollars 3m investment in a television modulator and tuner assembly plant as
'a toe in the water', but says the experience has been positive and an
expansion is on the cards. Thomson already has plans to employ 1,000 people
on Batam.
'We operate on Indonesian soil but Batamindo is there to smooth the way,' Ms
Tsai says. 'Batam is close. Expatriate Singapore managers can come here
(Singapore) for the weekend.'
Environmentalists might balk at the damage done by development to Batam's
natural beauty - soil erosion is visible everywhere - and labour activists
might criticise the idea of housing migrant workers in a dormitory building
on the estate, but investors are happy to reap the rewards of low labour
costs.
Batamindo officials say most of the production workers they supply are women
between the ages of 18 and 25. Companies pay about SDollars 220 per month
per worker to Batamindo, of which the employee receives about SDollars 150.
After the difficult start-up period, companies are anxious to employ their
own production workers and to hire skilled Indonesian staff to take over
managerial jobs from expensive Singapore expatriates who find the living
conditions on Batam relatively harsh.
'The main problem now is the training of the staff to take over more
responsible positions,' said Mr M. S. Leow, manufacturing manager at
Thomson's Batam plant.
Earlier problems included difficulties with telecommunications and the
movement of goods. These are said to have been resolved, although a new
harbour may have to be constructed because the main port is working at full
capacity.
Batam, vigorously promoted by Mr B. J. Habibie, minister of state for
research and technology, saw its population grow to more than 107,000 last
year from a mere 6,000 in 1973. By the end of next year, the airport is
supposed to be capable of receiving Boeing 747 jumbo jets.
Batam's exports rose to Dollars 210m in 1991 from Dollars 148m in 1990, but
officials agree that it is difficult to gauge the economic significance of
the gross export figures because the island is a low-cost assembly location
and imports are presumably rising rapidly as well.
The Riau islands are developing fast, but they will continue to depend for
the time being on the backing of the Indonesian government and of Singapore.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (6): Regulations relaxed - Foreign
Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment is no luxury for Indonesia. 'Every year we have to create
2.4m new job opportunities,' says Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, chairman of the
Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM). 'That's the population of the
Republic of Singapore. That's why we invite foreign investors and domestic
investors to build new factories.'
With this in mind, and in the face of continuing competition from other
capital-hungry developing countries, the government announced a
liberalisation of foreign investment rules in April.
Henceforth, foreigners can start with 100 per cent ownership of a project
either if it has a paid-up capital of at least Dollars 50m, or if it is
sited outside the main island of Java and the more developed parts of
Sumatra.
This is in accordance with the government's efforts to spread development to
the remoter reaches of the archipelago, or if the project is located in a
designated industrial park in Java or Sumatra and all production is for
export.
Within five years of start-up, the investors must sell at least 5 per cent
to Indonesian interests, usually rising to 20 per cent within 20 years.
Regulations for existing investors have also been relaxed. Previously, 100
per cent foreign investments were allowed only on the bonded island of Batam
near Singapore.
Potential foreign investors will welcome the new rules if they are properly
implemented, partly because the revised regulations reduce the need for
political connections when launching a project and allow more time for the
difficult task of finding a suitable local partner.
'I think they are very happy about it,' says Mr Sastrowardoyo. 'We do hope
that many more foreign investors will come to Indonesia, because now they
don't have the immediate difficulty of finding the Indonesian partner and
they can select calmly and systematically within five years.'
The BKPM, which covers all investments except for oil, gas and finance,
approved Dollars 3bn worth of new foreign investment in the first four
months of this year, which compares favourably with the figures of Dollars
8.7bn and Dollars 8.8bn reported in 1990 and 1991 respectively. In the past
25 years, half the foreign investment approvals by value have actually been
implemented.
'We can say optimistically that by the end of this year the level (of
foreign investment approvals) will be the same as in the last two years,'
says Mr Sastrowardoyo.
The government's 'tight money' policy, however, has sharply reduced domestic
investment and officials fear that foreign investment will also be curtailed
by the slowdown of the world economy and Japan's financial turmoil.
Indonesia's low labour costs remain particularly attractive - workers have
complained that some Korean employers do not even pay the legal minimum - so
much so that questions have been raised about whether Indonesia is getting a
sufficient return from its manufactured exports.
Sports shoes from dozens of Indonesian factories, for example, are exported
through Singapore middlemen. 'The production costs of a pair of Nike or
Reebok shoes or whatever are only Dollars 6-Dollars 7 a pair,' says Mr
Sastrowardoyo, 'while the same pair sells in Europe or the US for Dollars
70-Dollars 85.'
As in other south-east Asian countries, the transport and communications
infrastructure has been overwhelmed by rapid economic expansion. Mr
Sastrowardoyo acknowledges that there are complaints about electricity
supplies but he says investors know that infrastructural deficiencies are
temporary, and they can pay extra for their own supply.
Political stability has always been high on the list of investors' worries
about Indonesia and it is difficult to say if the recent troubles in
Thailand will exacerbate those fears (by highlighting the instability of the
region's under-developed political systems) or allay them (by suggesting
that Indonesia is no worse than supposedly stable Thailand).
'The Indonesian political system has provided stability and room for
discussion,' said one prophetic stockbroker in Jakarta before the clashes
between troops and demonstrators in Bangkok last month.' Gross domestic
product has increased steadily. There has been a shift from oil to non-oil
export growth. Yet we come to 1992 and Indonesia's political risk rating is
far higher than, say, Thailand.'
A complicating factor for large foreign investments in Indonesia is the
government's understandable concern about its foreign debt, which has risen
44 per cent in three years to some Dollars 75bn. The government set ceilings
on foreign borrowing in October, postponed several large investments,
including four petrochemical projects, and redoubled its efforts to persuade
investors to finance their projects with equity rather than loans.
One of the petrochemical projects, the Chandra Asri plant backed by
President Suharto's second son, was subsequently reprieved on condition that
it be scaled down and transferred to foreign ownership. The new investment
rules were announced later, leading to charges that the liberalisation was
designed to legitimise, post facto, a go-ahead for Chandra Asri.
Other large investments in the pipeline include foreign bids for units of
the Paiton power complex, the proposed Dollars 1bn Exor III refinery on
Bintan Island (a joint venture between BP and C. Itoh), two US chemical
plants and two US banana projects, Mr Sastrowardoyo says.
There are no immediate plans to provide further ownership incentives for
foreign investors. 'That's it for the time being,' says Mr Sastrowardoyo.
'We are going to move in another direction. We are going to simplify our
negative list.'
The number of sectors restricted for new investment fell to 60 last year
from 75 in 1989 and there are plans to reduce the figure further.
Indonesian officials are hoping that any decline in Japanese interest will
be compensated for by countries such as Taiwan (which had the highest value
of investment approvals last year) or by western companies anxious to
establish a springboard for exports into the rest of Asia.
Mr Radius Prawiro, the minister responsible for overseeing the economy, says
the focus of Indonesia's trade is moving away from commodity exports to
Europe and energy exports to the US towards closer links with the Asia
Pacific region.
'Our trade with Asia and the Pacific now takes 70 to 75 per cent of our
exports,' he says. 'This makes our country attractive for non-Asian
investment.'

Gas industry

INDONESIA'S oil sector is at a turning-point. A record number of contract
areas have been signed in the past three years, confirming oil companies'
interest in the archipelago.
The number of new discoveries, however, has been disappointing and Indonesia
is unlikely to postpone the date on which it becomes a net importer of oil
until after the turn of the century.
Production has averaged about 1.5m barrels per day and reserves remain
around 11bn barrels, enough to sustain production at current levels for
another 20 years. In addition, only 36 of Indonesia's 60 known oil basins
have been explored and only 14 developed.
Most new areas of exploration, however, are in complex geological structures
or are deep offshore.
Current reserves were built up during two periods of extensive exploration
in the 1940s, and again in the 1960s. The country is now undergoing a third
wave of exploration. The number of new production-sharing contracts signed
between Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company, and foreign oil
companies, rose from seven in 1987 to a record 22 last year.
However, the level of exploration commitment under the new contracts - over
Dollars 2.8bn within the next 10 years - is not particularly high, and oil
companies want contract incentives improved.
The government disagrees, saying the incentives are adequate. 'How else can
you explain the jump in the number of new contract areas, except that the
conditions are sufficient?' said one government official.
Foreign companies insist, however, that the terms are among the least
attractive in the world. As one executive noted: 'The number of signed
contract areas may be up, but the level of drilling is down'.
Even if exploration drilling increases, the number of sizeable deposits
remaining to be discovered is an unknown quantity, although the immediate
omens are not good. As an executive of a foreign oil company explained: 'The
last block awarded that had over 100m barrels was in 1971. No-one taking up
new acreage has had significant discoveries.'
Meanwhile, domestic fuel consumption is growing rapidly. In 1990 it rose 20
per cent to nearly 700,000 barrels a day (b/d) and the rate of increase is
expected to continue over the next decade. Government and industry officials
agree that at some point between 1997 and 2005 Indonesia will become a net
importer of oil and will have to leave the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
This will go hand in hand with a move to process more of domestic
production. The wilder fancies of Pertamina received a blow last September
when the government announced that 16 refining projects, provisionally
scheduled for construction before 1996 with a total cost of Dollars 21.5bn,
had been postponed.
A number of projects have, however, be allowed to proceed. These include the
Dollars 420m upgrading of the Musi and Balikpapan refineries and
construction of the Dollars 1.5bn Cilicap olefin plant and the Dollars 2bn
Exor-1 refinery.
The government has also given approval for a Dollars 1.6bn Chandra Asri
olefin plant to go ahead under 100 per cent foreign ownership, although how
its Indonesian backers, including the Bimantara Group run by President
Suharto's second son, will meet this condition is uncertain.
Also likely to be given approval under condition of foreign-ownership is the
Dollars 1bn Exor-3 refinery in joint partnership between BP of the UK and C
Itoh of Japan.
While the future of the oil sector is uncertain, the gas sector is likely to
expand over the next decade. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of
liquified natural gas (LNG) with exports in 1991 estimated at 22.5m tonnes,
and also produces liquified petroleum gas (LPG), with exports of 2.6m tonnes
in 1990.
In 1990, LNG and LPG export revenue totalled Dollars 4.2bn, equivalent to
about 550,000 b/d of crude oil. Between January and October last year, LNG
exports totalled Dollars 3.1bn and LPG exports reached Dollars 287m.
Indonesia's principal buyer remains Japan, although Taiwan and South Korea
are emerging markets.
Upgrading of LNG production facilities is expected to raise capacity to from
22.6m tonnes in 1990 to 23.5m tonnes this year. A Dollars 750m contract to
construct a sixth LNG train at Bontang, East Kalimantan, has been awarded to
the Humpuss Group led by President Suharto's youngest son. Due for
completion by 1994, it will boost Indonesia's total production capacity to
27m tonnes.
The new train will supply 20-year contracts to sell 2m tonnes a year to
Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and Toho Gas of Japan.
In total, Indonesia has long-term LNG contracts to export 24.5m tonnes from
1994. Industry officials expect further contracts to raise production to a
sustainable level of 30m tonnes a year shortly after the turn of the
century.
The one area of uncertainty is the development of the Natuna gas field
situated in the South China Sea which, with 45 tscf (trillion standard cubic
feet) of commercial gas reserves, is at the heart of the industry's future.
Esso Indonesia has a 50 per cent stake in the field, with the remaining
interest held by Pertamina. Government officials concede, however, that
Pertamina will be unable to fund its share of the Dollars 15bn required to
develop the field.
'Pertamina cannot raise the money and government officials say Pertamina may
reduce its stake in Natuna to 10 per cent. Whoever takes the 40 per cent
will be expected to carry Pertamina's financing obligations', an industry
executive close to the negotiations explained.
Companies which have shown an interest in taking a stake include Nissho
Iwai, Mitsui and Mitsubishi of Japan, and Mobil of the US.
The high capital cost of the project is accounted for by the heavy platforms
and technology needed to handle the gas which has a 70 per cent carbon
dioxide content.
Exactly how the carbon dioxide will be handled, given environmental concerns
that it should not be released into the atmosphere, has not been finalised.
A deal must be struck this year if Natuna is to come on stream by 1998, the
year when Pertamina starts to renegotiate important long-term LNG agreements
with Japan. These are currently being supplied by the Arun field off north
Sumatra, but its reserves are insufficient to guarantee new contracts.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (5): Curbs on foreign borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST October, the government announced ceilings on new foreign borrowing for
the next four years. A total of Dollars 5.6bn is permitted this year,
divided between the central bank (Dollars 500m), state banks (Dollars 1bn),
state enterprises (Dollars 1bn), private banks (Dollars 500m) and private
enterprises (Dollars 2.6bn).
The ceiling is to be gradually raised to Dollars 6.5bn by 1995, the increase
being split between state enterprises and private companies.
Since the announcement was made, private banks have handed in details of
offshore borrowing to the central bank and waited for further news.
Donor officials say Bank Indonesia has collated the figures and defined a
mechanism by which banks will receive individual limits.
There is considerable doubt, however, whether this mechanism will ever be
implemented. Not only is it open to abuse, with preferred banks receiving
more generous limits, it is also tantamount to a foreign exchange control
and the antithesis of Indonesia's liberal exchange regime.
In a recent report, the Asian Development Bank said: 'Foreign investor
confidence has been eroded somewhat by the uncertainties caused by the
dramatic policy measures'.
The report described the ceilings as 'only a target (not a quota) for the
private sector' but warned that 'until the economy recovers, restoration of
that confidence cannot be expected'.
The ceilings have since been watered down by a decree in April allowing 100
per cent foreign ownership of new companies. Previously, foreigners were
only allowed full ownership of companies inside bonded zones such as Batam
Island.
The new decree applies to investments with a paid-up capital of more than
Dollars 50m in the heavily populated provinces of Java and Sumatra. Projects
with lesser capital must be situated in the more remote provinces to
qualify.
The government has said that ceilings on offshore borrowing do not apply to
loans raised to support wholly foreign-owned projects. Under the new decree,
investors must sell 5 per cent of their equity to an Indonesian company or
individual within five years, and transfer 20 per cent within 20 years.
There is no requirement to export production.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (4): A particularly delicate phase - The
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA has moved from a centrally-controlled, bankrupt economy in the
mid-1960s to a nation with a 20-year record of annual economic growth
averaging more than 6 per cent. Attracted by a programme of economic
deregulation, twice as much foreign investment has been approved in the past
five years - more than Dollars 26bn - than in the preceding two decades.
The country has benefited from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore
which have perceived Indonesia, with its 183m population, as an investment
opportunity. The political stability of the 'New Order' regime and the
presence of western-trained government technocrats with at least one hand on
the economic tiller, have engendered investor confidence.
Despite these achievements, the jury is still out on the long-term success
of the economy. Certain monuments to central control persist, such as the
highly regulated sugar sector, and deregulation has sometimes meant little
more than the transfer of a public monopoly to a private,
politically-connected company.
Serious infrastructural bottlenecks, such as a shortage of power and a
grossly inadequate telephone system, threaten to restrict future growth.
Bankers estimate Dollars 85bn of infrastructural investment is required by
the turn of the century, but sources of finance remain uncertain.
While Indonesia's great attraction is cheap labour - 2m people enter the
employment market each year and annual per capita income is low at about
Dollars 600 - there is a danger the country will become the mere repository
of labour-intensive industries discarded by the newly-industrialised
countries of the region.
Of the 1992 budget of Rp56,100bn 59 per cent goes to routine expenditure,
such as civil service salaries and debt servicing, and 41 per cent to
development expenditure which includes infrastructure, education and health
services. International donors, such as the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and western countries, are expected to provide Rp9,100bn
toward this year's development budget.
Budgeted oil and gas revenue assumes a price of Dollars 17 per barrel and is
forecast at Rp13,900bn, down 7 per cent on 1991. The overall budget,
however, is 11 per cent higher than last year and the extra revenue is to
come from a 36 per cent increase in income tax revenue, and a 34 per cent
rise in value-added tax receipts.
Indonesia now has a more diverse economy than ever before. The role of oil
and gas has fallen steeply in the past 10 years from 80 per cent to 39 per
cent of export proceeds.
The contribution of manufacturing was 14.9 per cent of GDP in 1990.
Agriculture contributed 19.5 per cent. However, the world Bank estimates
that manufacturing will soon overtake agriculture and by the year 2000
should contribute 22.8 per cent of GDP compared to 14.5 per cent for
agriculture.
Important export-oriented manufacturing industries include shoes, textiles
and garments. The government's Investment Co-ordinating Board has approved
more than 175 applications to build shoe factories with a total capacity of
600m shoes a year. Textile export earnings have risen from Dollars 806m in
1986 to Dollars 3.6bn last year.
The country's non-oil and gas export drive has brought impressive results,
with exports increasing from Dollars 6.5bn in 1986 to Dollars 17.56bn last
year (itself an 18 per cent increase over 1990).
The depth of Indonesia's agricultural and mining sector remains an important
source of economic strength, despite generally low international commodity
prices. In world rankings, Indonesia is in the top three producers of
rubber, palm oil and coffee. It is among the world's largest exporters of
shrimps and prawns.
Exports of forest products totalled Dollars 3.35bn in 1990 and Indonesia is
the world's leading producer of plywood. It is also an important producer of
copper, nickel, tin and coal.
But dreams of an economic 'take-off', the point where economists imagine
growth becomes self-sustainable, received a knock last year when the
government stepped in to cool an overheated economy. Money supply was
tightened in February and ceilings on foreign borrowings were announced in
October, as well as the postponement of up to Dollars 79bn worth of
large-scale projects.
The move was prompted by concern at Indonesia's public and private
international debt, Dollars 50bn and Dollars 25bn respectively, which has
grown 44 per cent in the past three years.
A debt-service ratio of 31 per cent of export earnings - 24 per cent public
and 7 per cent private - has led to a deteriorating current account deficit.
The latter stood at Dollars 4.48bn last year but, government ministers
concede, would have hit Dollars 8bn without immediate intervention.
Donors are concerned at the level of debt and say that manufactured exports
will need to rise 20 per cent a year for the next four years if the
debt-service ratio is to be significantly reduced. They say that last year's
government intervention to cool the economy should have come sooner.
Bankers say the International Monetary Fund warned in early 1990 that, due
to an explosion in bank credit, the economy was overheating.
When the brakes were applied fully last September, a fantastic array of
large projects had been lined up for government approval. These included 16
oil refining proposals worth more than Dollars 21.5bn and tabled for
construction before 1996. The situation was an ugly reminder of the
mid-1970s when debts built up by Pertamina, the state oil and gas company,
threatened to scupper the economy.
What appeared a firm government commitment to restrict borrowing has since
been watered down with several postponed projects likely to go ahead,
including the Dollars 2bn Exor-1 refinery and the Dollars 1.5bn Cilacap
olefin plant. Others may proceed under foreign ownership, such as the
Dollars 1.6bn Chandra Asri olefin plant and the Dollars 1bn Exor-3 refinery.
Government ministers say loans raised by wholly foreign-owned projects will
not count toward Indonesian debt, although the effect on the balance of
payments will be the same as foreign loans raised by domestic companies.
Donor agencies are concerned that projects supported by politically
well-connected companies will proceed under the guise of foreign ownership
and that a secondary debt, not recognised by government but serviced by the
country's export proceeds, will be accumulated. Such a debt would undermine
efforts at reducing the country's debt service ratio.
It would also compound the adverse economic effect of other politically
motivated decisions such as the granting in 1991 of a private monopoly for
the buying and selling of cloves which last year cost the country about
Dollars 350m.
Donors forecast a slightly higher current account deficit of Dollars 4.8bn
this year, increasing the country's reliance on aid from the donor community
which will meet in Paris next month to discuss new commitments. Indonesia
will be looking for at least as much as the Dollars 4.75bn committed by
donors at their last meeting in March, 1991.
Indeed, after 10 years of deregulation the economy is at a particularly
delicate phase.
Deregulation of the banking sector, of which the biggest tranche occured in
1988, led to a surge in the number of banks and a 122 per cent growth in
credit between December, 1988 and the end of 1990. This restricted the
government's ability to squeeze inflation which has risen from 6.2 per cent
in 1989 to 9.2 per cent last year, although it is expected to fall to about
eight per cent this year.
The tightening of money supply in February 1991 sent bank lending rates to
30 per cent. Although money supply has since been relaxed, 12-month lending
rates have remained relatively high at about 24 per cent, although deposit
rates have fallen to 17 per cent.
The higher cost of capital, combined with a relative downturn in export
markets, has had a knock-on effect for companies.
In the past year two companies, Bentoel and Mantrust, have defaulted on
loans totalling Dollars 770m. Economists fear they may be joined by other
groups which over-expanded when credit was easily available. At the very
least companies, and the larger conglomerates in particular, will undergo a
period of consolidation.
The same applies to banks, many of which lent with poor, sometimes
non-existent credit analysis. The seven state banks, which account for half
the banking sector's assets, are in need of an immediate overhaul. Many
banks in the private sector are little better off and a series of mergers is
likely.
A worst case scenario would see a string of company failures in the second
half of the year exposing an ill-managed banking sector. But this would be
to underestimate the ability of the government to manage what remains a
dynamic, if volatile, economy.
Most economists predict a continuation of a steady GDP growth of between 6
and 7 per cent, assisted by the coming on-stream of new export-oriented
manufacturing capacity.
Despite a significantly lower oil price, provisional total export revenue of
Dollars 7.28bn for the first quarter of 1992 is down only 1.5 per cent on
the same period of last year, reflecting continuing growth of non-oil and
gas exports. Total imports for the period remained constant at Dollars
6.32bn.
Equally, GDP growth of 6 per cent is unlikely to deliver the 'take-off' of
which the optimists dream. Given the cost of infrastructural improvements,
the uneven state of development in the archipelago and the flood of new
labour, every step towards greater economic prosperity will be a hard-fought
battle.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (2): Parliament flexes its muscles -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a month of campaigning, more than 100m voters turned out on June 9 to
elect a new parliament in what was officially termed 'a feast of democracy'.
Provisional results give the ruling Golkar party 67.5 per cent of the vote -
down from 73 per cent in 1987 - with the two opposition parties splitting
the remainder.
In 1987, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), with its roots in the
nationalist movement of former President Sukarno, took 11 per cent of the
national vote, while the United Development Party (PPP), a loose coalition
of Moslem groups, won 16 per cent.
With little chance of assuming power, opposition leaders have taken to
criticising Indonesia's style of democracy.
Golkar is backed by the civil service and has a distinct advantage over its
two opponents in terms of funding and organisation. At the last election it
took 299 of the 400 seats on offer. The opposition parties also find
themselves outnumbered by a further 100 members nominated by the armed
forces (Abri).
Parliament has proved to be an ineffective counterbalance to executive
power. Since President Suharto took the helm of state in 1965, parliament
has neither blocked, nor initiated, a single piece of legislation.
But there are signs that the parliament is beginning to flex its muscles.
Members have openly criticised the trade monopolies granted to companies led
by Mr Suharto's children. A 1965 decree granting the president absolute
powers is soon to be revoked.
Nevertheless, the real balance of power lies outside the political parties
and the elected parliament.
Indonesia's political system is rooted in a national philosophy entitled
entitled Pancasila. It consists of five principles:
Belief in one God - this safeguards Indonesia from becoming an islamic state
as it provides an umbrella for other religions;
Justice and civility among peoples - government officials highlight this
principle as an enshrinement of respect for human rights;
The unity of Indonesia - political parties, and individuals, are not allowed
to raise issues which might threaten disunity;
Democracy through deliberation and consensus among representatives; and
Social justice for all.
The three main interacting and competing forces in Indonesian politics are:
Mr Suharto and those who enjoy his patronage; the armed forces, whose dwi
fungsi (dual military and political) role is enshrined in law; and Islam,
the popular leaders of which are becoming increasingly politicised and
vociferous in their demands for democratic reform.
Senior Abri officers say privately that increased national wealth and better
education are irresistible forces pushing political change.
They also insist that the dual role of the armed forces is essential to
Indonesia's future.
Diplomats believe some officers, including General Benny Murdani, minister
of defence, are concerned that Mr Suharto is not keeping a tight enough rein
on his children's business interests.
This has led some Abri officers, diplomats say, to cajole the PDI party into
nominating a candidate to oppose Mr Suharto when, as is widely expected, he
runs for a sixth term of office next March. This would be a significant
embarrassment for Mr Suharto who has always attracted all-party support for
his election.
Names of alternative candidates include Mr Rudini, minister of home affairs,
although his nomination by PDI would almost certainly be without his
blessing.
The process by which the president is elected, however, weighs heavily in Mr
Suharto's favour if and when he should decide to stand. The 1,000-member
electoral college is made up of all the MPs plus another 500 members
approved by Mr Suharto.
The focus of attention is more likely to be on who stands for the post of
vice-president to replace Mr Sudharmono, who is not expected to seek a
second term. The winner would be in a strong position to succeed 71-year-old
Mr Suharto should he decide to call his sixth term the last.
Likely candidates for the post are General Try Sutrisno, commander in chief
of the armed forces, and Mr B. J. Habibie, the charismatic minister of
research and technology, and a close associate of Mr Suharto.
In the past, however, potential successors have fallen like autumn leaves
and Mr Suharto may wish to groom someone to reflect the aspirations of a
younger generation of Indonesians.
One potential candidate is Lt-Col Prabowo Subianto, a divisional commander
in the strategic reserve corps and married to Mrs Siti Hedjanti Herijadi, Mr
Suharto's second daughter.
Moslem leaders such as Mr Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of Nahdhatul Ulama (NU)
with an estimated 35m members, are likely to be thorns in the sides of both
Mr Suharto and Abri.
Mr Wahid says the government is afraid of democracy and he believes that
Islamic organisations, such as NU, should 'liberate the population from
poverty through democratic means'.
Mr Wahid, widely regarded as a moderating force in Islam, says he will
accept Mr Suharto as president for a sixth term, but his argument for not
setting a timetable for democratic reform carries with it an implicit demand
for change.
'Vaclav Havel did not have a timetable,' he explains. 'The people in
Tiananmen Square did not have a timetable, Aung San Suu Kyi (the Burmese
opposition leader) does not have a timetable'.

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (3): Human rights still an issue -
Foreign Aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S decision in March to reject aid from the Netherlands startled
foreign donors not merely by its suddenness but also because of the
uncharacteristically vitriolic language in which it was couched.
Responding to Dutch criticism of the killing of at least 50 protestors by
soldiers in Indonesian-annexed East Timor in November, the Jakarta
government spurned all Dutch assistance and issued a statement condemning
'centuries of inhuman colonial subjugation' and the 'barbarous atrocities
carried out by the colonial forces during the war of independence' in the
1940s.
The government also dissolved the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia
(IGGI), through which aid was pledged, because it had been chaired by the
Netherlands, the former colonial power, since 1968.
Coming from a country which received Dollars 4.75bn in pledges though the
IGGI in 1991 alone, and which depends heavily on foreign aid for the
development of its infrastructure as the economy expands, the decision could
have been seen as remarkably rash.
In fact, as President Suharto had presumably predicted, very little has
changed and very little damage has been done, except to some of the 175
projects financed by the Dutch and to those Indonesian non-governmental
organisations which relied on Dutch support.
The World Bank will henceforth chair the donors' forum, which is due to meet
in Paris in July, while both the Dutch and the Indonesian governments have
taken pains to announce that they plan to continue and even strengthen their
normal commercial relations. Everyone else has kept rather quiet.
Most aid workers and diplomats believe that Indonesia's outburst was a
calculated effort to boost the government's electoral appeal and appease the
armed forces - which had been criticised in an official inquiry for their
role in the East Timor shootings - without seriously endangering the flow of
aid.
'President Suharto had to show the military that he was rapping their
knuckles not because of external pressure alone,' said Mr Jusuf Wanandi of
the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta.
The Dutch were the perfect target: as the ex-colonial power they are the
traditional scapegoats for the country's ills; their aid pledged for the
1991-92 financial year amounted to only Dollars 91m; well behind the World
Bank, Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) - all of which promised
more than Dollars 1bn.
And Mr Jan Pronk, the Dutch development aid minister, was highly unpopular
among Indonesian officials for his abrasive, emotional style of doing
business both in the 1990s and in a previous tour of duty in the same job in
the 1970s.
'Indonesia needs aid but in terms of major investment, in terms of
agriculture, this comes from the World Bank and the ADB,' said one senior
western diplomat. 'The rest, I'd say, is very marginal.'
Significantly, countries such as Canada, which had been as outspoken as the
Netherlands in their treatment of the East Timor incident, were ignored by
Indonesia.
Although some Indonesian ministers were unhappy with the ferocity of the
Indonesian gesture and western governments were offended by the undiplomatic
language of the statements about the Dutch, the decision struck a
sympathetic chord with Indonesians.
Mr Wanandi said it was unacceptable for the Dutch to continue ordering the
Indonesians about after 300 years or for the west to take the high moral
ground.
'Look at Los Angeles (where several people were killed in recent riots). For
them to be condescending or coercive is not acceptable.'
The sentiment was echoed by Mr Radius Prawiro, the senior minister
supervising the economy, industry and development. 'What we do not like is
when development assistance has been used to intimidate us,' he said in an
interview.
He thanked the Dutch for their support over the previous 24 years and
predicted that overall development would not be seriously affected, since
donor countries were free to fund whichever projects they regarded as
suitable from Indonesia's 'blue book' of development plans, often in a field
which allowed them to support their own industries.
The larger issue of linkage between aid and human rights, however, is
unlikely to go away.
The European Community has made it clear in discussions with the Association
of South East Asian Nations (Asean, the six-country group of which Indonesia
is a member) that it would like to see progress on human rights and on the
environment.
Mr Prawiro did not sound too concerned. Overseas aid would account for 41.9
per cent of development funding in the projected 1992-93 budget, he said,
compared with 52 per cent in 1991-92 and nearly 70 per cent two years ago.
'We actually have a negative outflow of capital with regard to borrowing
from the so-called donor countries,' he said, noting that aid included loans
as well as grants and that Indonesia was repaying Dollars 7bn a year. 'If we
can't borrow from outside, it will be very difficult for us to repay the
debts.'

FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (1): Mixed signs for future - Will
Indonesia's progress towards prosperity continue unabated? Will a political
vacuum emerge after Suharto goes? The giant of south-east Asia faces a test
both of its nationhood and its economic resilience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia, in power since 1965 and one of the world's
longest-serving leaders, must decide whether to stand for a sixth term of
office in elections next March. His achievements in bringing political
stability and economic growth have been immense.
Whether or not he decides to carry on, he will be aware that the country's
next great challenge will be the transition from his rule.
Doubts are emerging about whether progress towards prosperity can continue
unabated and whether a political vacuum will emerge when Mr Suharto goes.
There are fears that Mr Suharto's departure will remove the lid on simmering
ethnic and religious tensions. Indonesia has about 300 ethnic groups and,
though 90 per cent of the population is Moslem, there are significent
Christian, Buddhist and Hindu minorities.
The time of reckoning is likely to be delayed for a further five years if,
as expected, Mr Suharto stands for re-election. When it does come, much will
depend on the groundwork being laid by the president.
Indonesia's size, as an archipelago of more than 13,000 islands stretching
3,200 miles east to west, makes it the giant of south-east Asia. The economy
has grown rapidly, attracting considerable foreign investment in
manufacturing industry.
A steady programme of deregulation has brought the economy to a watershed: a
World Bank report published last month described Indonesia as ready 'to
become a solid middle-income country. . . by the end of the decade'.
When Mr Suharto came to power following a failed communist coup, more than
70 per cent of the population lived in absolute poverty and the economy was
hamstrung by 600 per cent inflation. Born in central Java in 1921, he began
his career as a police officer before rising through the army to the rank of
general.
His critics say he has run an authoritarian government, is unreceptive to
criticism and ruthless to those he considers endanger national unity.
They argue that the parliamentary elections, held on June 9, were simply the
affirmation of a de facto one-party state. The ruling Golkar party retained
control with an estimated 67.5 per cent of the vote.
However, when questioned on Mr Suharto's economic legacy, even some ardent
critics acknowledge the scale of his achievement.
His deft political skill was exemplified by his handling of the aftermath of
last November's killing of at least 50 civilians in East Timor, the former
Portuguese territory forcibly annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
He appeased the international community by criticising the army for its part
in the atrocity. Then, in March, he pacified his domestic constituency by
rejecting all aid from the Netherlands, the former colonial power which had
been most outspoken over the East Timor incident and which chaired the
long-standing donor forum.
Mr Suharto, asserting that Indonesia would not accept the linkage of aid to
human rights, asked the World Bank to create a new donor consultative group
without the Dutch. Donors meet in Paris next month and are expected to
pledge more than Dollars 4bn in aid for the year ahead.
With up to Dollars 85bn of infrastructural development planned before the
turn of the century - overstretched electric power and telephone networks
are probably the greatest limitation to further economic expansion -
Indonesia will require foreign aid flows for many years to come.
Before reaching into their wallets, however, donors will look closely at the
economy. Indonesia has moved a long way from the centrally controlled model
of former President Sukarno but old economic distortions remain and some new
ones have appeared.
Rules on foreign investment have been relaxed and export-oriented industries
have multiplied. Indonesia has benefited from investment from the group of
more industrialised countries which it endeavours to join: Japan, Taiwan,
South Korea and Singapore.
But some sectors of the domestic economy, particularly agriculture, remain
highly regulated. Appeals for the government to ease controls have largely
fallen on deaf ears. Political barriers to change appear to have blocked the
gifted western-educated technocrats within the government who champion
reform. Since the beginning of 1991 the situation has worsened with trade
monopolies in cloves and oranges granted to two private companies led by
sons of Mr Suharto.
The monopolies have highlighted the business interests of Mr Suharto's six
children and have provided fuel to opponents who accuse the government of
nepotism.
'The president and his wife are proud of their children's contribution to
the economy,' says one western ambassador, who notes that the president's
children have helped to break the hold on the economy of the ethnic Chinese
community, which numbers about 4m out of a total population of 183m.
Critics say Mr Suharto should restrain his children's commercial ambitions
and withdraw the trade monopolies they enjoy. This has been accompanied by
calls for greater government transparency and concern among economists that
contracts for large public sector-related projects have sometimes gone to
the highest bidder.
However, the record shows 20 consecutive years of economic growth of more
than 6 per cent.
Exports excluding oil and gas have increased 171 per cent in the last five
years to Dollars 17.6bn in 1991. Foreign investment approvals of Dollars
26.2bn in 1988-91 were twice the sum approved in the period 1969-87.
Even though there has been a concomitant rise in external debt and a
worsening current account deficit forecast at Dollars 4.8bn this year, the
economic gains have been impressive.
A surge in the Jakarta stock market following the election indicated that
foreign investors find Indonesia increasingly attractive.
The lack of government accountability, however, cannot be so easily
discounted. In the longer term it acts to heighten the political risk and
raises the question of what dangers may await Indonesia in the post-Suharto
era.
The signs for the future are mixed. Mr Suharto is slowly relinquishing some
control - a 1966 decree granting him effective absolute power is to be
revoked at his instigation - and parliament, which has neither initiated,
nor blocked, a single piece of legislation under his rule, is becoming more
critical of government.
Most important, some senior officers of the armed forces say they accept
that greater wealth and better education are irresistible forces for
political change. When Mr Suharto goes, a unified and flexible military will
be essential to a smooth transfer of power.
There is no guarantee, however, that those business people currently
benefiting from the regime, and who would have most to lose after Suharto
leaves office, will be so far-sighted. Some have queried the right of the
ruling Golkar party to question their business affairs. For them the
prospect of political reform, bringing with it greater public scrutiny, must
seem an anathema.
The government has a team of technocrats with a proven ability to manage the
economy through times of boom and bust. Their success, however, has been
grounded in the political stability which Mr Suharto has brought to bear on
the country.
Indonesia's test of nationhood and economic resilience still lies ahead.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken control unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish government announced yesterday the creation of a new state
company which will control all the shares of Nordbanken, the ailing
commercial bank from September 1. The state was forced to intervene and take
over the bank last month in the face of its increasing financial problems
caused by bad debt losses.
The Ministry of Finance said yesterday the new company, Venantius, had
purchased so far 13.8 per cent of the 22.7 per cent of remaining equity and
voting shares in Nordbanken from a number of its larger shareholders,
including Nobel Industries, for SKr21 per share. The remaining 77.3 per cent
of equity in Nordbanken is already owned by the state.
A prospectus setting out the terms of the bid is to be published at the end
of next month.
The Swedish parliament two weeks ago agreed to the SKr20bn (Dollars 3.53bn)
rescue plan for Nordbanken to save it from possible financial collapse. It
was then authorised that a limited company made up of five officials from
the Ministry of Finance should administer the shares.
In the first quarter, the bank made a SKr1.97bn deficit and it expects a
credit loss of between SKr6bn and SKr8bn for the full year.
Standard and Poor's, the US credit rating company, yesterday placed
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, on credit
watch with negative implications. It said that the action reflected 'the
continuing sharp deterioration of the bank's asset quality, together with
the increased pressure on earnings cause by the rapid build-up of
non-performing loans.'
Norway's Banking Association said yesterday that the country's troubled
banks could begin to show a small profit next year after seven years of
losses as long as there were no more setbacks. It estimated that while this
year Norway's banks will lose NKr9bn (Dollars 1.46bn) in credit losses that
will fall to NKr5bn by 1995.
It believes there will be an increase in income and higher charges on
customers. But the association added that the weakness of the banks would
make it difficult for them to help in a revival of the Norwegian economy.

FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: First-half shortfall at Airtours
reduced

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the UK's third-largest package holiday company, yesterday reported
reduced first-half losses after a sharp rise in sales during winter.
Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the summer holiday market as a whole for
the year to May had increased 20 per cent, the first growth in two years,
and that the winter market had also grown - by 8.3 per cent in the year to
end-March - for the first time since the 1988-1989 season.
Holiday bookings at Airtours in April and May were higher than in the same
period last year, but the first two weeks of June had been weak with volumes
maintained but at the expense of lower margins.
Airtours' summer bookings were 31 per cent ahead of last year following a 30
per cent increase in the number of holidays on offer.
Mr Crossland said Airtours had taken a large slice of the market left when
Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group collapsed last year.
The company remained as dependent as ever on margins that could be
attainable in the late booking market, he said.
The results suggested that in spite of the recession, holidays were among
the last non-essential costs to be cut.
In the six months to the end of March, Airtours increased the number of
passengers carried by 77 per cent and its sales by 83 per cent to Pounds
101.55m.
UK holiday companies traditionally make losses in the first half as they
pre-pay certain of their summer season costs. But, in spite of the jump in
sales, Airtours cut its losses to Pounds 5.59m from Pounds 6.21m.
This loss included for the first time a seasonal loss on its leased aircraft
fleet and Pounds 1.1m in start-up costs on the introduction of three
aircraft.
The company will pay a 0.55p dividend, up 10 per cent on last year, while
the loss per share fell to 4.29p.

'WHAT DO the Europeans think of us now?' one of Denmark's 5m giant-killers
wanted to know at the news stand yesterday.
There is not one of them who is not walking nine feet tall after first
telling Europe where to put the Maastricht treaty and then booting their way
to the final of the European Cup soccer championships with a 7-6 victory
over favourites and reigning European champions Holland in the semi-final in
Gothenburg on Monday night.
The country has never had such an impact on Europe before, politically or in
sport.
The Danish team was a last-minute entry to the championships, replacing the
embargoed Yugoslav team days before the championships started. When Danish
player Kim Christofte kicked the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out after a
2-2 draw after extra time more than 50,000 people poured into the streets in
the city centre in joyous celebration. And, said police, it was joy
untrammelled by rioting or hooliganism.
Spirits even rose at the Foreign Ministry, where officials have been sunk in
a deep depression since the electorate voted down the Maastricht treaty in
the June 2 referendum. One visitor said there was victorious singing in the
corridors.
National pride after killing off the Maastricht pact is already boundless.
From a 50.7 to 49.3 per cent vote against the treaty on June 2, opinion
surveys show that the No vote has since soared to 60 per cent. Where it will
end if the Danish soccer team beats Germany in the final in Gothenburg on
Friday is anyone's guess.
Danish shipbuilders and shipowners fear a drop in orders and jobs following
the approval by the European Commission last week of a DM6bn (Dollars 3.70n)
support programme for east German shipyards.
Mr Thorkil Christensen, chairman of the Danish Shipbuilder's Association,
said the agreement might even lead to the closure of some yards.

FT  23 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE overnight fall in Tokyo, together with reports pointing to a gloomy
outlook for the UK economy, produced a dull day's trading in the derivatives
market, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,608,
which proved to be the day's high point, for September went into retreat
thereafter, sending the underlying cash market lower.
With dealers remaining on the sidelines, September continued to decline in
the morning on very light volume, and figures showing a narrowing of the
UK's trade gap for May had no effect on trading.
While the early afternoon saw September continue to drift lower, the poor
opening on Wall Street caused further falls in the contract and by 3.30pm
September had fallen to 2,580.
September ended at 2,578, down 49 from the previous session's close and
below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 35. Turnover at the
official close was a very poor 5,580 lots.
In traded options, volume was also dull, reaching only 24,842 contracts. The
FT-SE option saw 12,014 contracts transacted. Midland Bank led the league
table of the day's best performing stock options. It traded a total of 1,785
contracts, with the June 420 calls particularly busy.

FT  23 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tokyo sets the pace for further
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS IN the UK stock market to find a stable footing after last week's
setback were undermined overnight by the plunge in the Nikkei average, and
yesterday brought further losses across the range of UK equities. There was
no great weight of selling but London's weakness deepened after Wall Street
opened the new session in poor form.
Worries over the Japanese stock market, where some UK analysts fear that the
Nikkei could face a further setback, and also over the outlook for Wall
Street, strengthened London's fears over the sluggishness in world
economies.
UK investors continued to back away from cyclical stocks, and increased
holdings of defensive sectors only very sparingly. Once again, economic
factors were largely ignored, a narrowing of the UK trade deficit in May
having no effect in the stock market.
It was an entirely negative session. The FT-SE Index opened nearly 12 points
off at what proved to be the day's best, and closed almost 35 down at the
session's low. The final reading of 2,550.3 showed a fall of 34.5.
Some lines of stock in leading companies came on offer but trading volume
across the market was not on any great scale. Seaq-reported business
totalled 371.8m shares, against Friday's 440.6m. The total was swollen at
the close when a fairly large programme, mostly on the sell side, was
printed; the trades taking place earlier in the session.
Traders believed that many fund managers were content to stay out of a
market now looking thoroughly nervous. Some managers were creaming the last
of their profits on shares bought just before the general election at the
beginning of April, when the Footsie stood more than 100 points lower than
last night's close.
The shadow of GPA's pulled share issue continued to hang over the stock
market, which concentrated on plans for the international offer of stock in
Wellcome, the UK drugs group. However, there was a ready response for a
Pounds 34m share placing by Hays, the business services group, to purchase a
French food distributor. Good preliminary interest was also reported for the
planned flotation of the Daily Telegraph, ahead of the prospectus expected
today.
The overall picture was of a market still overshadowed by the Maastricht
debate, in spite of the 'yes' vote in the Irish Republic, and the prolonged
agony imposed by the domestic recession. The new, and potentially
disturbing, factor is the fresh weakness in the Nikkei Average, which some
UK analysts see dropping to between 12,000 and 13,000 and putting pressure
on the US market.
Against this is a belief, expressed this weekend by SG Warburg Securities,
that the UK market represents good value and is in danger of 'overshooting
on the bear tack'. The strategy team at Kleinwort Benson predicts a mild
downward drift this week, but warns that if the Dow Average breaks downwards
then the UK is likely to follow. Mr Peter Thorne, at Nikko, expects the
market to stay around Footsie 2,550-2,600 for the present, with volume
remaining at its current low levels.

FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sluggishness of US recovery
spreads gloom

<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH US share prices recovered from heavy early losses yesterday, market
sentiment remained depressed amid deepening gloom about the sluggishness of
the US economic recovery and its effect on corporate earnings, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally off 4.55 at 3,280.80, a
substantial rally from early afternoon when it had been 30 points down.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost a net 0.27 at 403.40, he American SE
composite shed 3.77 to 375.62 and the Nasdaq composite gave up 4.47 at
549.73. Turnover on the New York SE was 169m shares.
The market has fallen in four out of the last five trading days (the only
exception being Friday when options-related buying lifted the Dow 11
points), and analysts have interpreted the declines as part of a concerted
sell-off by investors - a substantial correction of the recent bull phase.
Some say that an increasing number of investors now believe equities are
overvalued and, troubled by the feebleness of the economic recovery, find
more reasons to sell stocks than to buy them.
Merck bucked the trend, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 50 1/2 in heavy
trading on news that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved
the company's Proscar drug, used in the treatment of enlarged prostate
glands.
Another rare gain was recorded by Time Warner, which rose Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 110 7/8 as investors celebrated news that the new Batman Returns
film, produced by subsidiary Warner Brothers, earned more than Dollars 46m
in gross receipts over its opening weekend.
Boeing eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 on reports that the aircraft
manufacturer is fighting European consortium Airbus Industries for a Dollars
2.4bn contract for jetliners from United Airlines.
International Rectifier dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 8 1/8 after the
company warned that previous earnings projections were too optimistic and
said its fiscal fourth-quarter net would be only slightly in the black.
The losses on Latin American, and especially Mexican, markets took their
toll of certain stocks, notably Telmex, down Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 44 7/8
, Mexico Fund, Dollars 1 5/8 lower at Dollars 20 7/8 , and Brazil Fund, off
Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 17 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq market, Heart Technology plunged a further Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 9 1/4 after voluntarily recalling its coronary rotablator device
following five reported failures. On Friday the stock fell sharply when the
company asked customers to stop using the product.
Canada
TORONTO rallied from early weakness in line with Wall Street, the TSE 300
index ending a net 10.2 off at 3,340.7 after a near 30-point initial fall.
Declines led rises by 342 to 219 and volume was 23m shares.
The gold group recovered from Friday's decline, rising 1.37 per cent. The
New York spot gold price was up USDollars 2.75 to USDollars 343.25 an ounce.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Weakness in yen and dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR strengthened against the yen but weakened against European
currencies yesterday, writes Peter Martin.
Across most markets, however, trading was thin, with dealers already
influenced by the G7 meeting in two weeks' time.
Record low figures for Japanese money supply growth and a drop in the Nikkei
stock market index below the 16,000 level for the first time since 1986 left
the yen languishing. The dollar ended Tokyo trading on Monday at Y127.47, up
from the Y127.00 reached late on Friday in New York.
Paul Chertkow of UBS in London said the Japanese government would do what
was necessary to strengthen the stock market, which meant a fiscal stimulus
package around the time of the G7 meeting. In the meantime, he said, the
Japanese authorities would want to keep the yen strong against the dollar to
allow a cut in the official discount rate (ODR) later on.
'The interesting thing is that today the Bank of Japan's money market
actions suggest a slight tightening,' said Gerard Lyons of DKB
International, in London. 'That suggests that the authorities are not keen
to relax monetary policy ahead of the G7 meeting.'
In European trading, the yen weakened further, moving through the Y81.00
level against the D-Mark. It closed at around Y81.10, compared with Y80.82
on Friday.
Against European currencies, the dollar continued its weakness of recent
days. It opened at DM1.5735, down from Friday's DM1.675, then moved to
DM1.5660 by the London close. Technically minded traders were testing the
DM1.56 level, said UBS's Paul Chertkow, with the thought of a possible move
back to DM1.5350, seen earlier in the year. In New York the dollar finished
at the DM1.5660 London close.
Among EMS currencies, there was little change. The D-Mark continued to edge
down in the wake of Irish voters' endorsement of the Maastricht treaty, but
still retained much of the strength acquired after Denmark's 'no' vote.
The lira, which had to be defended by the Bank of Italy in the middle of
last week, slipped to DM756.25 from Friday's DM757.30. As some commercial
banks raised lending rates, the lira escaped from the bottom of the EMS by
the close, to be replaced by sterling. The Portuguese escudo, at the top,
was 5.81 per cent above its central sterling rate. The pound was steady at
DM2.9153.
South Africa's financial rand fell sharply, as the African National Congress
called an emergency meeting for today to discuss whether to pull out of
constitutional talks. The financial rand closed 6.7 per cent down at R3.84
to the dollar, from a Friday close of R3.60. The discount to the commercial
rand widened to 27 per cent, the highest this year.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash trading quiet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS little activity on the UK money markets yesterday, which were
described by one trader as 'deathly'.
Interbank rates barely moved on the day and trading on the sterling futures
market, which took a long time to warm up, was extremely thin. The slightly
better than expected trade figures caused a ripple of enthusiasm but
generally failed to make an impact.
Said one trader: 'I think most people are fairly devoid of inspiration at
the moment.'
Overnight rates touched 12 per cent twice during the morning, once before
the Bank of England announced the day's shortage, and again after only
limited assistance was given in the early round.
The three-month interbank rate firmed slightly to 10 1/16 per cent from last
Friday's close, while further out, six-month money ended at 10 per cent.
The Bank of England's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.85bn.
Assistance in the early round amounted to Pounds 218m and included Pounds
50m of band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 78m of band-1 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 50m of band-3 bank bills at 9 21/32 and
Pounds 40m of band-4 bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent.
Later in the morning the shortage was all but removed when the Bank bought
bills totalling Pounds 1.4bn. This included a further Pounds 476m of band-1
bills at the same rate as before, Pounds 314m of band-2 bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, and Pounds 167m of band-3 bills and Pounds 73m of band-4 bills, both
at the same rate as before.
The shortage was revised to Pounds 1.9bn in the afternoon. The Bank
intervened once more to buy Pounds 256m of bands-1 and 2 bills at 9 7/8 per
cent.
On the sterling futures market, the September short sterling ended unchanged
at 90.25 with only 7,869 lots traded.
The Bank of Finland, the Finnish central bank, will institute a new system
for regulating the supply of bank liquidity in a move to create a better
functioning market, it was announced yesterday. The change, which takes
effect on July 1, will do away with the current fixed call money rate and
penalty rate. Instead, commercial banks' deposit and loan rates will be tied
to the central bank's tender rate, the weighted average of all accepted bids
for central bank funds or certificates offered for sale in the money market.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Trading in LDC loans regains
composure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in loans to less-developed countries regained some composure
yesterday following heavy price falls and hectic dealing activity last week.
The sell-off was sparked by increasing tension surrounding corruption
allegations levelled against Brazilian President Collor de Mello. The
uncertainty was seen as reducing the chances that Brazil will reach a
Brady-style debt restructuring agreement with creditors.
Yesterday, the price of Brazilian benchmark commercial bank debt stabilised
at around 34 1/2 per cent of face value, having plunged from around 40 per
cent to 30 per cent last week.
Nervousness spread to most areas of the LDC debt market as investors
withdrew, although there was no change in the economic fundamentals of most
countries.
The slide in the cash market was amplified in the price of warrants on LDC
debt recently issued by several investment banks.
For example, warrants issued by Paribas Capital Markets - which offer
holders the right to buy Brazilian DFA debt at 40 per cent of face value -
were yesterday quoted at 2 5/8 -3 1/8 per cent of face value, from an issue
price of 5.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government bond market rallied yesterday, recovering some of the
losses which were made in the wake of Friday's surprise announcement that
the Treasury plans to exchange some of the old illiquid bond issues for its
newest stocks.
The statement from the Finance Ministry on Friday took the French bond
market by surprise and led to a fall in prices before the weekend and
yesterday morning.
The French Treasury plans to exchange FFr140bn of existing state bond issues
for the newer Obligations Assimilables du Tresor (OATs) in order to improve
the liquidity and extend the maturity of the government's debt.
With effect from today, the Treasury will offer to exchange 45 old stocks,
worth about FFr140bn altogether, for newer issues. The old bonds include
stocks issued by Caisse Nationale des Banques, Caisse Nationale de
l'Industrie and the Fonds Special des Grands Travaux.
'Many of these issues are due to be redeemed in 1994, so the Treasury is
trying to smooth the pattern of redemption,' said one economist.
Dealers said the market reacted badly to the news initially due to concern
that the exchange would mean an increase in supply at the longer end of the
market. However, foreign buying helped to lift the market, and the Matif
September futures contract settled at 107.22, up two basis points on the
day.
THE Italian government bond market picked up helped by a stronger lira and
hopes that a government may be appointed by the end of the week. Although
the market gained nearly half a point at one stage, it later fell back and
closed only slightly higher on the day. The Liffe September BTP contract
reached a high of 96.34 but settled at 96.17, up from Friday's 95.84 close.
UK gilts slipped as worries about funding and the prospects for European
economic and monetary union continued to haunt the market.
The cash market ended lower across the range of maturities. The benchmark 11
3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening of 116 1/8 to trade at
115 15/16 by late afternoon, yielding 9.34 per cent, while the 10 per cent
gilt due 1994 slipped from 101 3/8 to 101 5/16 to yield 9.25 per cent. The
gilt futures contract ended the day slightly higher at 97.22, compared with
its opening of 97.19, in healthy trading volume.
The release of better-than-expected trade data for May led to a slight
bounce in gilt prices in the morning but the effect was short-lived as
funding worries continued to dominate the market. Tomorrow the Bank of
England will auction Pounds 2.75bn of the 9 per cent Treasury stock due
2012, its largest to date.
US Treasury prices moved in a tight trading range yesterday as investors
held their fire ahead of this week's auctions.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at
101 27/32 , yielding 7.832 per cent, while at the short end of the market
the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.969 per cent.
Trading volume was reported to be extremely light.
The lack of new economic statistics denied the market a new direction, and
the subdued nature of business was exaggerated by concern among participants
about taking large positions before today's Dollars 15bn sale of two-year
notes and tomorrow's Dollars 10.25bn sale of five-year notes.
In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve completed a round of three-day
system repurchase agreements aimed at lowering the Fed funds rate, which was
trading slightly above its 3 3/4 per cent target at 3 13/16 per cent.
HOPES of lower interest rates helped to lift the Japanese government debt
market yesterday, and bond prices ended slightly firmer or unchanged.
The sharp drop in the Tokyo equity market contributed to speculation that
the Bank of Japan would be forced to lower short-term interest rates to help
the stock market and boost the economy, dealers said. The Nikkei index
closed 598.65 points lower at 15,921.22, its lowest level since 1986.
The rate on three-month certificates of deposit, which has fallen in recent
weeks, was quoted at 4.50 to 4.55 per cent yesterday, compared with 4.55 per
cent on Friday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue traded in a range of 5.355 to 5.375
per cent, but ended the day unchanged at 5.36 per cent. The September
futures contract moved in a range of 102.42 to 102.55, ending the day at
102.50.

INDOCEMENT, Indonesia's largest quoted company, has announced conditional
acquisitions totalling Rp720bn (Dollars 848m). The purchases, which are in
food and property, will diversify Indocement away from the cement sector in
which it accounts for 52 per cent of national capacity.
The principal acquisition is PT Bogasari Flour Mills, an integrated flour
milling company with an estimated 85 per cent market share in wheat flour
and cash-flow of about Rp160bn a year. The purchase cost of Rp1,179bn
includes the assumption of about Rp350bn of debt, a cash payment of Rp220bn
and the issuance of long-term promissory notes totalling Dollars 300m.
Indocement will also acquire a 51 per cent stake in the Indofood Group for
Rp777bn; the group of nine principal companies and 20 subsidiaries produces
more than 140 products and is a leading producer of instant noodles.
The final acquisition is Wisma Indocement, an 23-storey office building in
central Jakarta for which the company is paying Dollars 56m.
Analysts expressed surprise that there had been no mention of likely
purchases at the annual general meeting held earlier this month.
Indocement said the purchases would be paid out of cash resources of Rp400bn
and long-term borrowing of Rp1,320bn, giving it a debt-to-equity ratio of
132 per cent. Brokers said a new share issue was likely within a year.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: LTV petitions court in labour
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LTV, the large US steelmaker which has been operating under the protection
of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code for the past six years, said yesterday
that its steel unit had asked the bankruptcy court for authority to reject
its labour agreement with the United Steelworkers of America.
The union speedily retaliated, however, threatening industrial action if the
current collective bargaining agreement is thrown out. 'We have repeatedly
told the company that if its petition results in the rejection of our labour
contract, a work stoppage would follow,' said Mr Anthony Rainaldi, chairman
of the union's negotiating committee.
'There is no question that the company risks committing suicide with this
step, and the negotiating differences between us do not warrant that risk,'
he said.
The increased tension comes in the wake of an LTV reorganisation plan, which
was hammered out earlier this year and appeared likely to win the backing of
the group's leading creditors. If implemented, this would finally allow the
company to emerge from bankruptcy. However, the plan pegged creditors'
recoveries to union concessions, and management at LTV's steel division has
subsequently held a series of talks with the USW.
Under US bankruptcy law, a debtor can, with court approval, reject a labour
agreement if negotiations fail to produce an acceptable new accord. It can
then effectively impose its own terms.
Yesterday, LTV said 'deep fundamental differences' still separated the union
and the management positions, even after the latest round of bargaining
which started on May 18. It added, however, that it was committed to 'good
faith bargaining' and did not intend to implement 'unilateral modifications
to the labour agreement' until the outcome of the sale of its aerospace and
defence division was certain.
By contrast, the union claimed that LTV had walked out of negotiations, and
accused the company of 'stubbornly sticking to all of its concession
demands, both for active and retired workers'. It said it was making
'preparations for the upcoming fight'.
When LTV first raised the possibility of revoking the labour contract in
April, the union said that it would not permit the wages and benefits of its
members and pensioners 'to be held hostage'.
'If the company persists in its misguided strategy, there will be serious
repercussions in the plants and the marketplace,' it warned two months ago.

<TEXT>
KNIGHT-RIDDER, the Miami-based media group, said it expected new labour
agreements at the Detroit newspapers operation it owns jointly with Gannett
to result in a second-quarter pre-tax charge of about Dollars 12m, writes
Alan Friedman in New York.
The 11 cents-a-share charge is for severance payments over the expected
axing of up to 400 jobs, but the company said earnings in the quarter would
be higher than the 82 cents a share, or Dollars 41.6m, last year.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Argentine privatisation by
stealth - The flotation of YPF, the national oil group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatisation of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina's
national oil company, gets underway early next year. Bit by bit, the group
will be floated on local and international equity markets with the aim of
eliminating the federal government's shareholding.
A start will be made in January with the sale of American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs) in New York and London, together with straight equity in
Buenos Aires.
Eventually these tranches, amounting to 51 per cent of YPF, are expected to
raise around Dollars 4bn.
Rather than place the shares on the market at one go, the government plans
to ration the flotation over a number of tranches. The rest of YPF will be
held by employees with 10 per cent and provincial governments with 39 per
cent.
However, the government has yet to get parliamentary approval for the sale.
The government submitted a bill in November, expecting it to sail through
Congress. But senators want the state to retain a minority stake in YPF.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, the YPF president who spent most of his career in the
private-sector oil industry, says his ultimate aim is to slim down YPF into
an integrated, well-balanced oil company with annual assets of Dollars 8bn.
His reform plan was drawn up together with McKinsey and Arthur D. Little,
the US management consultants. This calls for drastic reshaping of YPF. He
says: 'I am downsizing the company by cutting away all the fat.'
Eventually the workforce will be reduced to 12,000 from 52,000 in 1990.
The group has already raised Dollars 1.53bn from asset sales, mainly the
disposal of stakes in oilfields. Other assets earmarked for sale include
pipeline networks and a tanker fleet.
YPF's financial performance is beginning to improve. It estimates 1991 sales
at Dollars 5bn, which would be an increase of around 20 per cent on 1990,
and says profits for last year should emerge at more than Dollars 300m.
In the four months to April, YPF's share of national oil output fell to 59
per cent, or 5.93m cubic metres. Two years ago, it produced 97 per cent of
Argentina's oil.
Mr Estenssoro says new management and control systems should be implemented
and operational by January, 1993 and restructuring should be at least 70 to
80 per cent complete by 1993.
This, he says, should leave the ground well preparted for the first
international issue of shares in YPF.

MERCK, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, has received US
regulatory permission to market its Proscar drug for the treatment and
control of benign prostate disease, writes Karen Zagor.
The Food and Drug Administration's ruling comes about four months after an
advisory panel to the US watchdog decided that the benefits of Proscar
outweighed the risks.
Although the FDA had been widely expected to approve the drug after the
advisory panel's decision, news that Proscar would be on the market by late
July spurred active trading in Merck shares, which rose Dollars 2 1/4 on
Wall Street yesterday to close at Dollars 50 1/2 .
Merck believes that Proscar will be its next Dollars 1bn product. Earlier
this month Proscar was approved for marketing in the UK.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: State rejects reselection of
Lorentz as head of Bull
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government has refused an attempt by Mr Francis Lorentz, the
chairman of Groupe Bull, to be reselected for a second term at the head of
the loss-making, state-owned computer maker.
Mr Lorentz, who has had a series of disagreements with the government over
Bull's strategy during the past 18 months, said yesterday he had no deep
regrets about leaving the job because he was handing over to a businessman
with good industrial experience who was likely to pursue the same policies.
The name of Mr Lorentz's successor is due to be announced today.
'Sometimes a change of face is a good thing in itself. . . you see your
credibility progressively diminishing over time,' said Mr Lorentz, aged 50.
He fully accepted the right of a state shareholder to change the management.
Mr Lorentz said he applied six weeks ago to renew his mandate - which
expires next Monday - to ensure continuity in the three-year programme of
reorganisation of the company's structure and products. 'I did not see at
the time someone who would be able to replace me very fast and make the
company go ahead at the same speed and at the same direction.' Bull is only
half way through the plan, which lasts until 1993 and is designed to restore
it to profitability by the end of this year.
The change, part of a three-yearly review of the mandates of 45 public
sector chairmen, was expected because of the well-publicised clashes between
Mr Lorentz and Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime minister. They differed
over the acquisition of a 4.7 per cent stake in Bull by NEC, the Japanese
electronics company - which Mrs Cresson tried to block - and a technical and
marketing accord with IBM, in which the US computer maker took a 5.68 per
cent stake in Bull.
Mr Lorentz achieved his business objectives both times, but is thought to
have made enemies beyond Mrs Cresson's immediate entourage. 'I have had to
fight in order to make my ideas prevail inside the circle of my
shareholders,' he admitted.
Supporters of Mr Lorentz believe it is no coincidence the move comes at the
same time as the publication of the annual results of the Cour des Comptes,
France's official accounting watchdog, which criticises several aspects of
Bull's management.
Criticisms in the report that Bull's marketing costs were too high were
based on a poor understanding of the computer industry and had no connection
with the government's decision, added Mr Lorentz.
Bull is one of the biggest lossmakers in the French state sector and has
absorbed FFr4bn (Dollars 769m) of state capital over the past few years. It
lost a record FFr6.79bn in 1990, falling to FFr3.3bn last year, in line with
the experience of several competitors.

<TEXT>
BSN, the French food group, is expanding its interests in Belgium by taking
control of Alken-Maes, one of the largest Belgian breweries which produces
Maes Pils and Cristal.
The French company is increasing its stake in Alken-Maes, which had sales of
BFr5.73bn (Dollars 177m) in 1991, from 50 to 75 per cent.
For BSN, already Europe's second biggest brewing group, the Belgian deal
forms part of a programme of increasing its international beer interests,
which provided one-tenth of its FFr66bn (Dollars 12.69bn) group sales last
year.
Earlier this year, BSN strengthened its position in the Spanish beer market
by buying a 24 per cent stake in San Miguel, one of the country's best-known
beer brands.
BSN already had substantial a brewing business in Spain due to its 33 per
cent holding in the Mahou brewery.
BSN, under its veteran chairman, Mr Antoine Riboud, has become one of the
most aggressive players in the increasingly competitive European food market
by developing an international portfolio of products in sectors such as
mineral water, biscuits and yoghurt.

<TEXT>
THE French government has set a price of FFr230 per share on the 12.4 per
cent stake in oil company Total that it is selling to the public, the
Finance Ministry said in a statement, agencies report from Paris.
The ministry also said French stock market authorities had approved its plan
to exchange another 6.5 per cent of Total stock for Total investment
certificates held by investors.
The government will raise FFr5.27bn (Dollars 1bn) from the sale of its 22.9m
shares in Total and its direct shareholding in Total will be reduced to 15
per cent from 34 per cent. The share sale will open today and close on June
25. The certificate swap will open shortly.
French investors will be offered 8m shares under the sale. There will also
be an international offering of 7.5m shares plus a US tranche of 7.4m
shares. Depending on demand, the French tranche could be increased by 10 per
cent with shares taken from the international offering.
When it disclosed its intention to trim its stake in Total, the government
indicated it would retain a 5 per cent direct shareholding in Total, but did
not make clear how the remaining 10 per cent stake would be distributed. The
ministry said state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais and Assurances Generales de
France, a state-controlled insurance group, would each take 4 per cent of
the 10 per cent stake. The remaining 2 per cent stake would go to Groupement
des Assurances Nationales, a state-sector insurance group.

Lower oil prices left post-tax profits at Hardy Oil &amp; Gas 29 per cent down
at Pounds 7.22m in the year to March 31, against Pounds 10.1m.
Turnover improved from Pounds 39.3m to Pounds 41m, despite low prices and
dollar weakness, which resulted in oil sales being lower than expected.
However, the company said that exploration results had been outstanding.
There were three oil and gas discoveries on the UK continental shelf, four
gas field discoveries in the US and good progress in Canada.
The board is recommending a single final dividend of 1p, the first since its
demerger from Trafalgar House three years ago. The move is in line with the
company's previous expectations. Earnings per share were 8.3p (16.1p).

FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Developing a new image for its core
businesses - Hanson maintains the new key to its success is building up its
main companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HARRIS, vice president of Cavenham Forest Industries, has survived
more changes of ownership than he cares to remember.
During the last seven years the US timber and wood products business has
evolved from the Crown Zellerbach Corporation into an independent company
owned by Sir James Goldsmith who then swapped it with Hanson for the
conglomerate's 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining.
Mr Harris, based in Portland, Oregon, said trying to extract cash for the
previous owners became a trying routine of selling properties and closing
manufacturing facilities. 'The big difference working for Hanson is that we
now look for acquisition opportunities instead of divestiture
opportunities.'
This new emphasis on building core business seems at odds with Hanson's
reputation for squeezing cash out of companies and spending the minimum
necessary on developing them.
In the past Hanson has explained the logic of its highly diverse portfolio
of businesses in terms of their conformity to a set of characteristics. Its
best-known criterion is that the business should have only a limited
appetite for capital.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's US arm, said
Hanson had always been willing to invest in its businesses but 'nobody has
focused on that side before'.
Nevertheless, he accepted that Mr David Clarke, Hanson Industries' chief
executive, had articulated the importance of managing core-businesses more
clearly than anyone before him.
Mr Clarke said he would continue to exploit the group's expertise in buying
and selling assets. But the key to the group's success, he believes, was to
manage businesses better than any other group.
Forget the UK image of Hanson as a takeover glutton, chewing up and spitting
out companies, he said. 'The bedrock of Hanson is to manage worldwide
businesses into a class of their own.'
In the US, Hanson has given core-business status to Cavenham, Peabody Coal,
Beazer, the aggregates business, Grove Industries, the crane manufacturer,
and SCM Chemicals.
Such status is not a carte blanche for spending against all the Hanson
traditions of tight financial control. But it does mean that the ground
rules are not as simple as they were in the past, when Hanson was best known
for buying and selling companies, not organic growth.
Mr Harris of Cavenham said his instructions from the New Jersey head office
of Hanson Industries was to grow both organically and by acquisition. 'Our
requests for capital expenditure have not been turned down.'
Grove, too, has been given approval for expansion. Mr John Panettiere, until
recently Grove's chairman, had the idea of asking Fried. Krupp, the German
steel and engineering group, whether it wanted to sell its loss-making
business.
In the end Hanson balked at the Pounds 250m price tag, but it came close to
making its first substantial continental business.
Mr Panettiere's successor, Mr Bob Stift, is continuing to look for another
crane company. With Hanson holding a 53 per cent share of the US market and
70 per cent in the UK, Mr Stift says the quickest way to grow is by
acquisition. He has even looked at the possibility of establishing a joint
venture with a Japanese company.
Another Hanson core business planning expansion is Peabody Coal. Mr Irl
Engelhardt, president of Peabody, says: ''The idea that Hanson is only
interested in cash generation is just not true'. Annual capital expenditure
is expected to rise by 60 per cent this year, which is likely to put it
significantly above Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m).
Acquisitions continue apace. Martinka Coal, a subsidiary of Peabody has
recently agreed to pay around Dollars 165m over 14 years, with an initial
Dollars 62m payment, to acquire a coal mine and reserves from Southern Ohio
Coal. Mr Engelhardt is eyeing mines across the world for further potential
acquisition targets.
SCM Chemicals is also making heavy capital expenditures as it switches from
to sulphate technology to produce titanium dioxide to the more
environmentally acceptable chloride technology.
Since SCM Chemicals was acquired by Hanson in 1986 Mr Don Borst, president
of the company, said the conglomerate had made capital expenditure of more
than Dollars 450m of which 68 per cent of it over the last three years.
'Hanson scrutinises our requests for capital investment; but we have never
yet had them turned down,' he said.
That is because Mr Borst was able to persuade head office that there was an
obvious 'pay back' over the next several years. When SCM Chemicals starts
reporting increased profits the cash will begin to flow back to New Jersey.
'The important thing,' said Mr Borst, 'is that we received the capital
expenditure when we needed it.'
A number of consumer and recreational and leisure companies, such as Ertl
toys and Tommy Armour golf equipment, are likely to be disposed of by way of
flotation. 'In some cases we should not be spending time on smaller
companies' said Mr Clarke.
The picture in the UK-side of Hanson is less clear to observers. The only
obvious stand alone core-business is Imperial Tobacco. The ARC aggregates
business and London Brick form another core business under the label of
building products.
They are also looking at selling some of the smaller companies worth in
total Pounds 200m. But that still leaves a large grey area of largish UK
businesses, which are not being sold but which are neither core businesses.
The market is still unsure whether Hanson Plc is transforming itself from a
highly acquisitive conglomerate into a commited builder of core businesses
on the lines of Hanson Industries.
Until that problem is resolved the shares are likely to continue to trade at
a 20 per cent discount to the average prospective price/earnings ratio in
the UK.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Wellcome Trust in talks on size of share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, was last night meeting Robert Fleming,
the global co-ordinator for the sale of Wellcome shares, to discuss the size
of the planned issue. A preliminary indication of the amount of stock to be
sold in the offering next month will be announced on Thursday.
The trust is cutting its stake in the pharmaceutical company, headed by Mr
John Robb, from 73.5 per cent to below 50 per cent, and possibly to as low
as 25 per cent.
Estimates of the amount likely to be sold are currently around 35 per cent.
The amount will be fixed at a level which Fleming believes will maximise the
proceeds from the sale.
Shares in Wellcome, which produces Retrovir, the HIV treatment, and Zovirax,
the anti-viral medicine, slipped 12p to 913p yesterday, a percentage fall in
line with the FT-SE 100 index. However, since the trust announced its
intention to sell a large part of its stake in early March, Wellcome's
shares have fallen from 1126p, and underperformed the UK market.
The recent weakness of the stock market is affecting new issues in general.
The price for The Telegraph flotation, to be announced today, is likely to
be under 330p, lower than earlier hopes of up to 350p. Hollinger, the
Canadian publisher headed by Mr Conrad Black, is selling 26m shares in The
Telegraph to reduce its stake to 68 per cent.
Wellcome Trust's advisers at Fleming yesterday met managers of the nine
regional syndicates assessing the level of interest among investors around
the world.
Fleming and the trust will agree an indicative size for the issue but the
tender does not officially open until July 6 and will remain open for two or
three weeks after that.
It is thought that Fleming does not wish to scale the offer down once the
first indication of size is published and is therefore expected to fix that
at a figure it is confident of reaching.
Fleming is using the 'green shoe' mechanism under which it can increase the
offer by 15 per cent. It would achieve this by over-alloting shares and then
buying shares in the after-market to stabilise the share price. Thus while
the maximum available to be sold is 48.5 per cent, the highest amount that
would be put on offer is around 42.2 per cent.

FT  23 JUN 92 / BMW plans South Carolina factory as US sales pick up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BMW is poised to become the first German luxury carmaker to build a
full-scale production plant in another country, following its choice of a
site in South Carolina from a shortlist of four possible US locations.
It will also be the only German car producer with a US plant since
Volkswagen closed its loss-making facility in Pennsylvania four years ago.
Like other German companies, BMW has suffered in recent years from falling
US sales as a result of the recession and the weak dollar. But its US
business has picked up sharply this year as the economy there has begun to
revive and it has introduced new models. In the first five months, BMW's
sales in the US rose by 24 per cent to nearly 25,000 cars.
BMW said Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, the chief executive, would announce the
new plant at a press conference in Munich today, although it gave no
details. However, BMW's US subsidiary said it was holding a press conference
in the Greenville/Spartanburg area of South Carolina where the plant is
expected to be built.
The company confirmed in April that it had looked at sites in the US. The
plant will probably cost about DM1bn (Pounds 300m), with output likely to
start around 1996. South Carolina is believed to have put together a package
of incentives worth at least Dollars 35m (Pounds 19m). This would include
the purchase of the land to be leased to BMW for its 'greenfield' site and
road improvements.
BMW, which expects a further profit rise this year after the 12.5 per cent
increase in 1991 earnings to DM783m, is not the only German company to
consider a plant in the US, although its plans are the most advanced. Audi,
the up-market subsidiary of VW, has eyed sites in the US, Canada, and
Mexico. VW now serves the US mainly from its modernised low-cost Mexican
plant.
As well as recession in the US and the slide in the dollar since the
mid-1980s, German carmakers have had to contend with a new luxury tax on
products above Dollars 30,000. There has also been a rising volume of
Japanese models made in US 'transplant' sites.
Although BMW has no full production plant outside Germany, it builds engines
in Austria and sends parts in kit form for small-scale assembly in
south-east Asia and South America. Lean and mean, Page 18

FT  23 JUN 92 / Banks agree Pounds 260m rescue for MGN: Eve-of-results
package eases pressure on newspaper group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMMEDIATE financial pressure on Mirror Group Newspapers eased last night
with the announcement that the company's banks had finalised a Pounds 260m
financial package.
The deal comes on the eve of the newspaper group's first accounts today
since it was floated on the Stock Exchange last May.
The Pounds 260m refinancing has been provided by a small group of banks led
by National Westminster and Midland Bank.
MGN, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, The People, Scottish
Daily Record and Sunday Mail, said yesterday the two-year credit facility
'strengthens the group and provides financial stability for the future'.
In addition, leasing finance of around Pounds 180m remains in place.
MGN has been trading profitably, in spite of Mr Robert Maxwell's death, and
is expected to announce trading profits of around Pounds 80m today.
Money missing from the MGN accounts, losses suffered by its pension funds
and a series of Maxwell deals charged to the MGN accounts are likely to lead
to losses of around Pounds 300m.
The costs range from a loss on the sale of a stake in the Canadian
commercial printing company, Quebecor Printing, to a Pounds 24m loan
attributable to MGN for the large financing and consultancy charges being
paid to banks.
Since December the majority stake in the newspaper group, which was owned by
Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests, has been in administration.
The stake is effectively controlled by a group of banks because the MGN
shares were pledged as collateral for other loans.
Mr John Talbot, of Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell
interests, has said he has no plans to sell the stake.
Today's accounts should give some indication about the financial health of
MGN.
The company wants its shares, suspended at 125p in early December, to be
relisted although this is thought unlikely for at least another two weeks. A
relisting would almost certainly see a sharp fall in the share price.
Up to nine groups are believed to have expressed an interest in buying MGN,
including a management buy-out team led by Sir Peter Parker, former chairman
of British Rail, Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, and Mr Conrad
Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Iceland to study undersea electricity link to Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP and murky waters north of Scotland could be set for a new buzz if a
feasibility study to transmit electricity underwater from Iceland to the UK
turns into reality.
The National Power Company of Iceland has commissioned Pirelli Cables, the
UK subsidiary of the Italian cables and tyres group, to look into the
possibility of laying an undersea power link to Britain.
The 1,000 kilometre cable would be almost five times longer than any
existing underwater power link.
Lying at depths of up to 1,000 metres, it would pose a new technological
challenge to the cable-laying industry, including working in some of the
world's coldest and most dangerous waters.
Moreover, transmitting electricity over such a distance would also involve
huge energy losses, making the scheme potentially uneconomic. 'That is one
of the things we will have to study', a Pirelli official said yesterday.
The scheme may have been given a boost by the end of the Cold war. The
waters north of Scotland are plied by the submarine fleets of Nato and the
former Soviet Union.
The seabed in the region is believed to contain many sophisticated listening
devices, which could be disturbed by the proximity of heavy electric
transmissions.
Iceland has immense capacity to generate power through hydroelectricity.
However, its potential has so far been largely untapped as a result of its
small population and limited industrialisation. Current consumption of
electricity from hydroelectric sources is just 6bn kilowatt hours a year,
against an estimated capacity five times as high.
The UK, which already imports some electricity from France through cables
beneath the Channel, is expected to have a surplus by next century.
And by the end of 1994, Scotland will be able to export twice as much power
to England and Wales.
But the UK could represent just the beach-head for a series of further
cables taking Icelandic electricity to continental Europe. With growing
concern about nuclear power and the environmental damage of many
coal-burning power stations, hydroelectric energy generated from Iceland's
prodigious mountains and streams could find a ready market in an
increasingly 'green' Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERB MILITIA forces showered mortar bombs on central Sarajevo yesterday,
killing 19 people, including at least three children, and wounding 87.
According to Sarajevo Radio, three mortar bombs exploded in front of the
National Bank in the city centre, where people were queueing to collect
their pay. The streets were unusually crowded with people who had come out
of shelters for the first time in days during what had been a lull in the
fighting.
Bodies were laid out in hospital corridors and trails of blood smeared ramps
leading into emergency wards at three hospitals, witnesses said. The death
toll rose from eight to 19 after nightfall as critically injured victims
succumbed to their wounds, said Sarajevo Radio.
Serb forces launched a similar attack on a bread queue last month, killing
16 people and maiming dozens more. Serb leaders from Bosnia yesterday denied
responsibility for the attack.
Mr Mirsad Becirovic, an editor of Sarajevo Radio, said three children were
among those killed in the sudden mortar attack. 'They were playing on the
streets. We can't keep our children always locked up in underground
shelters. People had left their basements to get water, newspapers or their
salaries from the bank.'
Ms Shannon Boyd, a spokeswoman for United Nations peacekeeping forces, said
the news was discouraging. 'We're in a rather painful holding pattern.' A UN
plan to reopen the city airport for humanitarian flights collapsed at the
weekend.
In New York, UN officials expressed concern about ceasefire violations and
over the wounding of three Canadian UN observers, one seriously. There was
no suggestion of further action by the Security Council.
General Lewis MacKenzie, UN commander in Sarajevo, said UN forces would not
restart work on the airport until a ceasefire held for at least 48 hours.
'There are still obvious breaches of the ceasefire going on fairly regularly
. . . Even by Bosnian standards we don't have a ceasefire.' He said the
opening of the airport was only one step needed in the relief of Sarajevo.
'What is really needed is for the roads to be de-blockaded coming into
Bosnia because we have got to have large convoys of trucks. You can imagine
the amount of food that would be required,' he said. Some 300,000
inhabitants face starvation and chronic shortages of water and electricity.
Bosnian officials accused the UN of giving in to Serbian pressure to halt
work on the airport. They say Serbian forces, which control the airport, do
not want to hand it over to the UN and allow food in to the mainly Moslem
inhabitants of Sarajevo.
Serb irregulars, backed by remnants of the Yugoslav federal army, have
besieged Sarajevo for 77 days, demanding the surrender of at least half the
city to Serbian forces.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Sharp rise seen in long-term mortgage arrears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of homeowners more than six months in arrears with their mortgage
payments has risen sharply to 290,000, according to a survey published today
by Roof magazine. Roof is published by Shelter, the housing pressure group.
The survey shows that while the level of short-term mortgage debt fell in
the year to the end of March, the number of cases over six months in arrears
leapt by 38 per cent.
Steps taken recently to reduce the number of repossessions are partly
responsible for the growth in arrears over six months, according to the
researcher who carried out the survey, Ms Janet Ford of Warwick University.
Until these moves, lenders began repossession proceedings when arrears
exceeded six months. Cases which avoid repossession will increasingly show
up in the long-term arrears figures.
Ms Ford suggests, however, that lenders may put renewed pressure on
borrowers if the housing market revives. At present it does not suit them to
evict borrowers who have agreed to make regular payments, because their
properties would probably have to be sold at a loss.
But once it looks possible for lenders to recover debts more quickly by
repossession, some mortgage customers with serious arrears could find
themselves losing their homes.
The Roof survey provides evidence that short-term arrears have started to
decline. The number of loans two months in arrears has dropped 22 per cent,
with a 10 per cent drop in three to five month arrears.
This drop reflects falling interest rates and house prices which have
reduced the number of loans getting into trouble, according to Ms Ford.
These 'have helped recent buyers to establish and maintain a more manageable
balance between income and housing costs, lessening the risk of
over-committing themselves', she says. However some of the drop in
short-term arrears reflects borrowers moving into longer-term arrears, she
added.
Overall, the figures show a slight decline in the number of arrears of two
months or more, which still affect one in 13 of the 9.8m outstanding loans
for home purchase in the UK.
The survey reports that provision for bad debt rose rapidly in 1991,
threatening the viability of some lenders. Building societies, for example,
must put up new capital equivalent to 10 per cent of arrears. Societies say
this obligation is not onerous in practice. Most have already made provision
against loans six months in arrears and say that their capital is ample for
the levels of business they are doing with the housing market still subdued.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Playing catch-up with private sector fat cats / A look at
the arguments for and against high pay increases for top UK public servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Strathclyde local authority advertised for a new chief executive this
year, the starting salary of Pounds 105,000 will have touched some raw
nerves among senior employees in other public service jobs.
Strathclyde may be the largest authority in Britain but Mr Neil McIntosh,
the successful candidate, will earn more than Sir Robin Butler, head of the
civil service, Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, and Field Marshall Sir
Richard Vincent, chief of the defence staff, all of whom receive an annual
Pounds 104,750. Until this year, Strathclyde paid its chief executive Pounds
76,000.
This level of pay rise for the new generation of public sector executives
exacerbates what was always going to be a difficult year for the government
on top people's pay. It is caught between pressures to reduce widening
differentials between the private sector and the 2,040 senior public
servants whose salaries are covered by the Review Body on Top Salaries, and
the need to hold down pay in the public sector.
The Review Body's 15th report, and the first full-scale review of
comparability with the private sector since 1985, is due to go before the
prime minister later this week. It is widely expected to recommend a big
narrowing of the gap between senior public servants and company directors,
especially for those civil servants on a salary of Pounds 50,000-plus at the
bottom end of the scale.
The case for such a rise is strong. In big companies, earnings of Pounds
140,000 or more for full-time board members, and Pounds 250,000 or more for
chief executives, are common. In the past seven years, while pay at the top
of the private sector has almost doubled - up 96 per cent according to Hay
Management Consultants, if incentives and bonuses are included - rises for
top public servants have barely matched inflation.
On top of that is the 'Strathclyde' factor. Strathclyde is a
Labour-controlled council which realises that it has to offer competitive
salaries to get good people. The government is pushing even harder in this
direction and its determination to introduce private sector methods into the
public services is starting to release a small explosion in the pay of the
new public sector bosses.
Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive of Guys Hospital, one of the first
hospitals to acquire trust status under national health service reforms, now
earns about Pounds 90,000, double what the general manager of a large
hospital earned five years ago. Mr John Mackintosh, head of the
grant-maintained Oratory School, earns about Pounds 60,000, a possible
bench-mark for the heads of schools which are opting out of local education
control under the govern-ment's education reforms. The most well-paid public
servants of all are to be found among the heads of the Next Step agencies,
quasi-autonomous public sector bodies, such as the Defence Research Agency
whose head, Mr John Chisholm, earns Pounds 140,000.
These salaries may be seen as desirable and even necessary to attract
suitably qualified managers but they have severely upset the pay balance at
the top of the public sector. Those covered by the Review Body - judges,
senior civil servants and top military personnel - are not used to being
outflanked on pay from within the public sector.
They are, however, accustomed to being outflanked by the private sector.
Figures collated by the Public Finance Foundation, a pay research group,
show that between 1985, the last important adjustment to top salaries, and
last year, the pay of the highest earners in the Civil Service rose by 40
per cent and that of Grade Three civil servants - formerly called
under-secretaries - the lowest paid in the review group, by 54 per cent.
However, the top 10 per cent of non-manual workers in the private sector saw
earnings rise by 71 per cent over the same period. Those figures may be
distorted by a one-off private sector 'catch-up' for top managers in the
privatised utilities.
On the other hand, the figures also mask higher rises for the most senior
executives in British industry, and exclude perquisites such as subsidised
mortgages and company cars. Research for last year's Top Salaries Review
Body found that the median salary, plus bonuses, of chief executives at
private sector financial companies with turnover of more than Pounds 70m a
year was Pounds 230,000 a year, more than twice the Pounds 104,000 earned by
those covered by the Review Body.
Part of the difference between public and private sector salaries has been
justified by superior pension benefits and job security enjoyed by the
public servants. To counter this, the Association of First Division Civil
Servants, the National Union of Civil and Public Servants and the Institute
of Professional Managers and Specialists, which represent senior civil
servants, have presented evidence to this year's Review Body based on a
report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm.
The report says not all job turbulence in the private sector is a result of
less secure employment. Job changes reflect a desire by private sector
managers for wide experience, and head hunting by employers. 'Even in the
midst of recession the length of time on average between jobs does not seem
to outweigh the length of time over which financial support is available,'
says the report.
The unions also argue that if the government wants more job flexibility
between the private sector and the Civil Service, pay differentials will
have to be narrowed.
However, even if the Review Body and the government were to accept this
argument, and the case for a catch-up, there are equally strong pressures
for resisting big pay rises.
First, pay rises for private sector executives have become much more modest
in the past year, falling, according to Hay, to 7 per cent from a peak in
1988-89 of 20 per cent.
Second, the recession means that the problems experienced by public sector
employers in recruiting and retaining staff in the late 1980s have faded.
The Treasury says there is no indication of a decline in the quality of
candidates for fast stream entry - designed for high-flyers - to the Civil
Service and that, apart from some specialist areas, there are an adequate
number of high-flyers to fill Grade Three posts, the most junior civil
service grade covered by the Review Body, and above.
The most powerful argument of all for the government to resist large rises
is a feeling that they would send the wrong signals both to the private
sector - where pay settlements have only recently fallen below German levels
for the first time in many years - and the majority of public sector workers
whose pay is determined by collective bargaining. They will only receive an
increase of about 4 per cent, the rate of inflation, this year.

One might think that Tony Ryan, the hard-working chairman of GPA, would have
ordered all his top executives to return to base to discuss how to salvage
the company's credibility after it had to cancel its global stock market
debut last week. But if he has, then Colm Barrington, chief executive of GPA
Capital, has a more pressing engagement.
He was reported yesterday to be 'watching the sun rise over Galway Bay' at
the helm of Whirlpool, the lead boat in the Round Ireland Yacht Race which
set off from Wicklow last Saturday. But the 46-year-old Barrington, who
holds more GPA shares than any director save Ryan, was said by the race
organisers 'to be keeping very quiet on the VHF radio'  - out of earshot not
only of the following boats but presumably Ryan as well.

Big Italian companies have a habit of hiring ex-diplomats. Even so, there is
some surprise at the speed with which Ferruzzi/Montedison, Italy's chemicals
and foodstuffs conglomerate, has grabbed Giandomenico Picco, the UN hostage
negotiator.
The 44-year-old Picco, who is stepping down as under-secretary general, has
made a name for himself as an expert behind-the-scenes negotiator. He played
a central role in obtaining in great secret the release of hostages from
Lebanon, and indeed the news of his switch to Ferruzzi comes precisely when
the last remaining western hostages, two Germans, have been freed.
Picco is expected to be based primarily in New York and help beef up the
group's US profile which declined when the flamboyant Raul Gardini was
running Ferruzzi.
Interesting to see whether he makes as big a mark in the private sector as
he did in the public sector.

No other European country goes in for the sport of royal bashing like
Britain does. But it sounds as if Spain is about to suffer a minor outbreak.
King Juan Carlos - sporty, simpatico and best remembered as the man who
stopped the coup - is being accused of falling down on his public duties.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who is expected shortly to name a new
foreign minister, told journalists last week that he had been unable to
inform the king of his ministerial choice because the monarch was out of the
country. The 54-year-old king, who was resting near St. Moritz, did return
to see the prime minister briefly before heading back to Switzerland - with
the result that he missed his father's 79th birthday party.
What has prompted even more tongue-wagging is that the monarch will for the
first time in years not attend the annual bullfight this afternoon organised
by the Madrid press association; worse still, he has cancelled at short
notice the traditional palace garden party held to celebrate St John's day
on June 24.
In yesterday's El Mundo newspaper Jorge de Esteban, a distinguished
constitutionalist, broke hostile new ground in the domestic treatment of the
royals by suggesting a regency to cover the king's absences. De Esteban
sternly quoted Horace at the crown: Rex eris si recte facies.

<TEXT>
The 'To let' signs came down last week from Rose Court, the Southwark office
block built on top of the remains of the Rose Theatre, neighbour of
Shakespeare's Globe.
It was not, alas, because the building had found a tenant. Rather it was
because a TV crew had moved into its top floor to film 'The Golden Hello', a
tale about an ambitious, ruthless headhunter to be screened by the BBC next
spring. Ironically, it stars James Fox, one of those who stood arm-in-arm
with Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Ian McKellen three years ago to prevent
bulldozers destroying the theatre's remains.
This is not the first time that the empty building has been put to artistic
uses. The developers' campaign to market it has included staging art and
drama there, including a performance by an estate agent in sixteenth century
costume of Shakespeare's words set to music. Surely, with such cultural
credentials the office block should have a special appeal for the new
heritage ministry? Despite a request by the local MP Simon Hughes for the
ministry to consider the building, the Ministry of Fun has not yet even
looked at it.

If you are going to get fired, it is hard to imagine a more dramatic exit
than that just made by Stephen Chao. Until a week ago, young Chao was one of
the rising stars in Rupert Murdoch's media empire. Then he thought up this
really great idea of how to grab his managers' attention and impress the
boss at a conference in Colorado.
The newly named president of Fox Television stations had wanted to
illustrate a point during a talk on censorship to managers from Murdoch's
News Corp and Fox's parent. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times,
Chao hired a male stripper to disrobe in front of the audience, although it
was unclear what point he was trying to make. Whatever, it came as a great
embarrassment to Murdoch and his assorted guests - including US defense
secretary Dick Cheney.
An enraged Murdoch told Chao that he was fired. 'Sometimes the hardest job a
captain has is to terminate his best lieutenant,' Murdoch is reported as
saying. 'But one thing this company has to stand for is that there are
limits.' It may come as a surprise to readers of The Sun and the News of the
World that Murdoch is a bit of a prude at heart.

FT  23 JUN 92 / The tiger refuses to leave its cage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India has been characterised as a caged tiger. Just release the energies of
this powerful beast, it is argued, and it will startle the world. It turns
out that the promise is easier to make than to deliver.
The proposed formula is familiar. Liberalise the economy. Privatise the
extensive public sector. Open the sub-continent to trade with the outside
world. Introduce competition from abroad. End the monopolies and cosy deals
that cushion domestic manufacturers, with the consequence that they produce
low-quality goods at a high cost. Sweep away the regulations that stifle the
free development and growth of our potential new Asian economic superpower.
Then watch.
There is a flaw in this line of thinking. It is best put in a remark
attributed to an Indian politician. 'The door is open,' this sagacious
fellow is supposed to have said, 'but the tiger will not come out of the
cage.'
During the decade just passed, successive Indian governments have attempted
to release their country's entrepreneurial spirit. Mrs Indira Gandhi began
to flirt with such a strategy. Her son Rajiv took it further. Both failed. A
year ago, a new prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, initiated the most
far-reaching programme of economic reform yet undertaken. His finance
minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, devalued the rupee and later, in his recent
budget, made it partially convertible. The projected deficit was slashed. A
large chunk of the 'permit raj' - the mass of regulations that made the
corruption of officials a necessary cost of investment - was swept away.
Foreign money was welcomed; joint ventures with outsiders were most
assiduously courted. A start was made on lowering the tariff walls that
protect domestic industry.
Now, it seems, confidence in the sustainability of this little revolution is
beginning to ebb. If the government does not stay the course, if Mr Rao and
Dr Singh do not pursue liberalisation with the vigour with which they began,
the tiger will remain stuck. I believe that it is too early to make such a
judgment. Indians, and India-watchers, are natural pessimists. Their gloom
is understandable. When you consider the history of this huge republic over
the half-century since independence, there is much to be pessimistic about.
The mood of a conclave of India specialists held at Ditchley Park, the
international conference centre in Oxfordshire, at the weekend was, however,
cautiously optimistic. Those present included economists, diplomats, a
sprinkling of politicians, and academics. Most of them came from India,
Britain, or the US. It was generally although by no means unanimously agreed
that the Rao government is right to pursue its programme of economic reform,
but there was sharp debate about its motives.
One flatly expressed view was that it is all a sham - that the country was
broke when Mr Rao was propelled into the top job at the age of 70 and that
he had no option but to go to the IMF and the World Bank to borrow money.
The terms insisted upon by those Washington-based global missionaries are
well known. The gospel of liberalisation, free markets and prudent budgeting
must be embraced. Then the heathens will receive their beads.
Others were less world-weary. They insisted that genuine conviction
motivates India's most prominent enthusiasts for liberalisation, of whom
perhaps a dozen could be identified as sitting in key positions in the
administration. The reforms are backed by the great longing for western
comforts and standards of achievement that is so evidently felt by India's
relatively affluent 'middle class' ('actually upper class' said someone at
the weekend).
Middle or upper, the latter group constitutes an aspirant nation within a
nation. It numbers somewhere between 80m and 200m people, depending on
definitions, in a country of 850m. If you think of the central core of this
bourgeois India as comprising 15m families, then every one of them has at
least one relative abroad, mostly in Britain, the US, or Canada but actually
spread around 42 countries. This huge diaspora of 'non-resident Indians' is
the subcontinent's window on the world.
It is difficult to believe that with such a force behind it the attempt to
modernise in a western way will be abandoned. In truth, there is no other
hole to go to. For most of the near half-century since independence, India
has run a mixed economy - mixed between the huge state-owned sector and a
hugely protected and inefficient private sector. The republic's principal
trading partner, and the supplier of many of its early ideas on economic
planning, was the Soviet Union. That entity no longer exists. Some Indians
look with a mixture of envy and apprehension upon China and wonder whether
an authoritarian regime plus freer markets may not be the way. To India's
great credit its own lively democracy is too deeply embedded for that.
In the long run, therefore, that tiger will be sprung. What is questionable
is the immediate future. A bad monsoon could sweep the Rao government out of
office. Assuming it survives, it has to move to the agenda of unpopular
decisions. Cutting the immense subsidies that clog the economy could lead to
rioting in the streets. Sacking workers from inefficient industries, the
'exit policy', is something from which any government would shrink.
Increased social spending, which is vital if the poorest third of the
population is to be brought into the modern economy, may mean higher direct
taxation of the 'upper' class. Yet it is urgent that more money is spent on
such social programmes as the spread of female literacy, the single factor
most likely to reduce the birth rate.
At the same time, India's foreign policy, evolved under Nehru, must be
reshaped to meet a single goal: the furtherance of its economic development.
This means abandoning old delusions of grandeur, based on leadership of the
now-redundant 'non-aligned movement'. The quarrel with Pakistan must somehow
be settled; solutions to the almost intractable problems of Kashmir and the
Punjab sought. Then the military budget can be trimmed - after the Russians
have been paid for what they have already supplied.
I suspect that Mr Rao understands all this, but that he has enough on his
plate managing domestic politics and keeping his economic reform programme
moving. He has to keep his balance while India conducts a national debate.
For all the assumptions upon which all post-independence decisions have been
based are now under question. That is why the tiger is stuck. It is still
thinking.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Time to become lean and mean / Examining the challenges
confronting the German car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ferdinand Piech grinned as he drove off in a big black Audi limousine. He
told his driver to get in the back, and slipped behind the wheel himself.
It was a small incident on a sunny day in Munich, but enough to show that Mr
Piech, 55, is different from the usual run of executives who are happy to
let their chauffeurs take the wheel. His appointment to take over next year
as head of the Volkswagen group, which owns Audi where Mr Piech is the chief
executive, was controversial. Not only is he a somewhat prickly personality,
he has uncompromising views on how the industry should improve productivity
and cut costs. Both shareholder and union representatives on VW's
non-executive supervisory board agreed that Mr Piech - who impressed at Audi
with his record of rising profits and attractive new models - was the man to
give the company a thorough overhaul.
On a broader level, the arrival of Mr Piech at VW marks the growing
awareness of German car makers that their once-dominant position is under
threat. German companies account for about 40 per cent of total west
European sales - producing nearly 5m cars a year and exporting roughly half
of them. There are nearly 2m production jobs at German motor manufacturers
and suppliers, and twice as many if sales, repairs and other activities are
included - one in every six jobs in west Germany. The industry accounts for
about a fifth of gross national product and as such has underpinned
Germany's postwar 'economic miracle'.
In spite of the industry's obvious successes, German executives have become
edgy. The global recession outside their home markets is forcing car
companies to squeeze more profits from existing domestic plants rather than
relying on steady growth in worldwide sales. The slowdown is compounding
German companies' increasing vulnerability to Japanese competition
increasingly in the luxury car area, both from Japanese-built imports and
from plants set up in Europe. By the mid-1990s, the latter should be
producing more than 1m cars a year. The situation mirrors that of the US in
the late 1980s. 'The US did not react (to the Japanese invasion) and now
it's very late for them,' Mr Piech says. 'It's no good asking your opponent
not to attack any more. It's better to hit back.'
Closer to home, European competitors, notably in France, have made great
strides. Car makers such as Renault and Peugeot have slashed their
workforces and improved efficiency. In the European Community (except
Germany), car producers have, over the past decade, shed 410,000 jobs; in
Germany, automotive jobs have risen by 79,000 over the same period, spurred
by strong demand from eastern Germany following unification in 1990. This
artificial boost temporarily masked some of the underlying problems.
The productivity gap between the rest of the EC and Germany has also
narrowed. In the 1980s, productivity at French and UK motor companies rose
by an average rate of about 6 per cent a year compared with 5 per cent for
Spain and only 2 per cent for Germany.
In spite of this development, by 1990, Germany still topped the European
league - France's productivity was 91 per cent of Germany's, with Italy at
74 per cent and the UK (before the full impact of recent Japanese
investment) still some way behind at 61 per cent - but it lagged Japanese
home-based production by some 50 per cent. Mr Achim Diekmann, managing
director of the German motor industry association, says: 'We still have some
catching up to do.'
Catching up will be difficult as long as German wage costs continue to march
ahead of productivity. Including social security payments, they are among
the highest in the world (see chart). One solution to the problem is to cut
jobs - a course now being taken:
VW has said some 12,500 jobs will disappear over the next five years from
its domestic workforce of 130,000. Mercedes-Benz has announced it will shed
up to 10,000 jobs this year after its workers, along with others in the car
industry, won a 5.8 per cent pay award for 1992. BMW is shedding 3,000 from
its domestic workforce of about 62,000 this year and will today announce the
site of a new US plant in South Carolina to help it produce more cheaply for
the local market.
Opel, the profitable subsidiary of General Motors of the US, wants to reduce
the 31,000-strong workforce at its main plant at Russelsheim by about 6,000
over the next five years. Like VW, Opel is building a plant in east Germany.
Despite the urgency with which these measures are being implemented, 'things
look quite gloomy', on the costs front, says Mr Holger Karsten, of
management consultants Arthur D Little. So gloomy that Germany's
still-superior productivity cannot offset lower costs elsewhere in Europe.
Opel says it takes DM 750 (Pounds 260) more to make its Vectra mid-range car
at its main Russelsheim plant near Frankfurt than Vauxhall (also part of GM)
needs for the same vehicle (the Cavalier in the UK) at Luton in England.
Even though productivity is lower in the UK, favourable unit costs more than
offset this disadvantage.
In addition, German car makers are hampered by shorter working hours than
their main overseas competitors. Mr Werner Schmidt, VW's marketing and
overseas director, says a VW worker in Germany spends less than 1,200 hours
a year on the production line compared with up to 2,000 hours in Japan.
Employees at VW's Spanish plants work 25 per cent more hours than their
counterparts in Germany; staff at VW's plant in Mexico work 33 per cent more
hours. Next year, the introduction of a 36-hour working week will make the
German motor industry keener than ever to extract more productive value from
the hours worked.
Here they are looking east for guidance: for Japan's car makers are
Germany's biggest rivals partly because of management and production line
restructuring which is being continuously improved.
What most frightens German executives is the prospect of a rising volume of
cars built more cheaply by Japanese companies in the UK, many of which will
be exported to continental Europe. 'The Japanese plan to build between
700,000 and 800,000 cars a year in the UK, roughly the same as Opel's German
capacity, including Eisenach (the new east German plant),' says Mr Peter
Enderle, Opel's production director.
Already, German makers regard the Nissan plant in Sunderland in north-east
England as a prime threat. Opel says the Primera mid-range car made there by
Nissan is priced markedly lower than its German-made Vectra. 'Nissan
Sunderland has set a new standard for us all,' says Mr Piech who has visited
the plant. 'We have to challenge the Japanese.'
How? Cutting jobs will not be enough. So, prodded by the notions of 'lean
manufacturing', 'lean management', and 'simultaneous engineering', German
companies have set about redesigning their production methods.
This involves shifting even more of the car production process, and thus the
cost burden, to outside suppliers. In Germany, the usual level of 'vertical
integration' - the share of the car built inside the car plant - is about 40
per cent; the target for new east German sites is about 25 per cent.
Audi has reduced its level of vertical integration to 20 per cent, keeping
only complex operations in-house, such as engines, gears, bodywork and final
assembly. It has made big savings by having wiring systems made in Hungary
and Poland. German car makers in general are putting increased emphasis on
buying not just single parts but whole systems such as wheel assemblies from
outside suppliers. 'The innovative ability in the German automobile industry
comes in part from the highly specialised supply companies,' says Arthur D
Little's Mr Karsten.
On the production line, more team work is being introduced to give employees
extra motivation and responsibility. But, adds Mr Karsten, management
structures must also be made more flexible, so that rigid German production,
development and marketing divisions are dissolved. Traditionally, Germany's
corporate pyramid has been fairly rigid and hierarchical, and breaking down
entrenched ways of working at companies such as Mercedes-Benz and VW will
not be easy, says Mr Karsten.
Many of the leaner, streamlined working and management practices are being
introduced at greenfield sites in Germany. Mercedes' new Rastatt car plant
in west Germany incorporates more widespread use of team work than in its
other plants; VW set up a special team comprising experts from all divisions
for the design and production of its latest Golf model.
We are bringing in efficiencies we never had,' says VW's Mr Schmidt. The
trick is applying the Japanese-inspired lessons at home. Mr Schmidt reckons
productivity in VW's west German plants can be raised by an annual 6 per
cent through a variety of modest improvements, including group working.
Will all this radical change work? Already the powerful IG Metall union has
expressed doubts about Opel's plan to contract to (lower-paid) outside
suppliers some of its body-stamping work.
In the past, consensus has been reached through the German system of
co-determination at board and plant level. But, as Mr Diekmann of the motor
industry association, says: 'We are approaching a new structure in the
industry. It can only be done if unions and management co-operate.'
Though this year's engineering sector wage deal of 5.8 per cent will not
help the German industry in its effort to dampen rising costs, next year's
agreed 3.4 per cent rise indicates that the car unions have started to
realise the gravity of the industry's problems. They are reluctantly aware
that jobs must be lost and productivity gains must be made if they are to
compete.
The choice of Mr Piech to run VW shows unions and management are trying to
work closer together. This is a positive sign. Like their US rivals, German
companies have been slow to react to Japan's penetration of their markets
but the determination of German industrialists to cling on to sales means
competitors in Europe and Japan are in for a tough fight. The Germans are
unlikely to be the losers in the long run, but success will have its price:
the shape of the German car industry will change inexorably as manufacturers
invest more abroad and cut jobs at home. Within 10 years the industry will
have developed a new streamlined shape - not so much a Mercedes family
sedan, more a sleek and sporty Audi.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: Mmm - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Clark's identity is that of the naughty boy of British dance. His
generally youthful public is eager for the trappings of rudery, the zany
dress and the occasional flash of bottom or dildo, with which he has cocked
various snooks at establishment dance. A cross between Tyl Eulenspiegel and
Arthur Rimbaud, anarchic clown and boy genius, this persona is now both
unwise and constraining for a man of 30 who seeks, I suppose, to be taken
seriously, and who is unquestionably a dancer of prodigious if ill-served
gifts.
His new show - one can't call it a dance-work - is Mmm, a mutation of the
Modern Masterpiece which started out a few months ago. It uses Stravinsky's
Rite of Spring. Not the ideal score for a choreographer whose earlier
productions have been short-breathed and disjointed, and cursed with the
need to live up to its creator's irreverent and titillating reputation.
Clark has already worked on the score in New York, in a joint venture with
Stephen Petronio. This new version is, alas, still decked with those
trappings of Clark-shock which so effectively hinder it from proper
development - and serious consideration.
Clark again adopts his role as dance's alternative comedian, obliging his
audience with smut, juvenile irreverence. Thus the incidentals of tickets,
leaflet, tee-shirt and badge emblazoned with a roughly gynaecological
drawing. Thus the appearance of Clark's mother, a vulnerable figure as she
manifests herself, topless, in the cause of her son's art. Thus, too, the
appearance of Leigh Bowery - onlie begetter of the frightful costuming -
shrouded in white and identified for us by the C-word writ large, though
from his lumbering and blubbery appearance he is more like Moby Dick.
And hence the ear-shattering racket by the Sex Pistols as prelude to Sacre,
which is also amplified to brutish levels. The resultant performance is
inconsiderable, though it does indicate that Clark is seeking to provide
sustained dance interest.
The evening begins with a magnificent double solo for Clark and his new
colleague, the very gifted Joanne Barrett. Clark's dancing in this brief
section is purer, more potent, more exquisite in articulation than we have
seen for years. Every gift is his, from purity of line to the most delicate
and precise shaping of steps. Thereafter, gimmicks and what might best be
known as dirty tricks, proliferate, until Sacre begins and Stravinsky serves
as a vehicle on which Clark hitches a lift.
With his companions Barrett, Julie Hood and Matthew Hawkins, he rides the
score, marking its incidents with thin, piece-meal movement that wriggles
about to the music without saying anything very pertinent until the danse
sacrale. Here - and the music is cast-iron theatre - he devises a solo for
Barrett that conveys the compulsive and convulsive nature of the sacrifice,
which Barrett performs with superb control and force. Together with those
moments when Clark dances, and eschews everything except his own radiant
talent for movement, this is the justification for the evening.
But we pay terribly for it in sitting through the din and the fatuities that
surround these fascinating moments of true dance, true choreography. Clark,
I venture to suggest, has paid even more.
The Kings Cross Depot is a cavernous warehouse - its sightlines not of the
best - to be found in the hinterland behind the railway station. It is not
an area,in which I would chose to be after nightfall. Shareholders in Beck's
Beer will doubtless be flocking to see how their money is being spent.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: If wishes were horses .. / Review of Richard Hamilton
at the Tate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A full retrospective at the Tate Gallery is not an unusual honour for a
living British artist, but it is a signal honour nonetheless. It was denied
to Graham Sutherland, for example, in his lifetime, and is one which Lucian
Freud and Frank Auerbach have yet to enjoy. To go on with the comparison
and, with Melbourne relish it further for having 'no damned merit to it' may
be going too far, but to look down the list is to begin to wonder whether
merit has much to do with it.
Richard Hamilton is now 70 and this present retrospective is his second at
the Tate. The first was in 1970, and so familiar does the work remain -
indeed much is the very same - that it seems like yesterday. But the
familiarity is no mystery. Hamilton has never suffered by lack of
documentation - ever copious on his own account as well as critics and
curators ever willing to come forward to explain him to himself and to the
world at large.
Even by 1970 he was that rare creature in British art, a truly international
figure, and so he has remained, his reputation resting quite as much on his
general influence as on any physical work of art he might have made. Here
was the neo-Dadaist who brought Marcel Duchamp back into the light as the
spiritual father of modernism, the conceptual artist avant la lettre, the
founding theorist of Pop Art. Here, above all, was the teacher who asserted
the fundamental precedence of the idea over the practice. 'In the beginning
was the word.' Hamilton has indeed lived and thriven by the written and
spoken word.
There is no proscription on writing and theorising on the visual arts, but
for an artist whose creative efforts must be centred upon the work of art as
such, the physical entity as the vehicle of his experience, the dangers that
march with them are great. To the would-be creative writer, criticism and
theory afford a perfectly legitimate opportunity, for the medium of language
is the medium of the chosen art.
Who would deny that Johnson or Hazlitt, Baudelaire or Pater, Eliot or Woolf
were true artists, though wearing a critic's hats?
The poor visual artist, however, is not so lucky. Whatever the quality of
his ideas, and of the language into which he may choose to cast them by way
of exegesis, he is still left with the work he must make, the painting to
put on the wall or the sculpture in the middle of the room.
When we come to look at Hamilton's works, as they are presented on the wall
rather than in his head, the doubts are inescapable. From first to last,
they are, where his own hand is evident, quite simply badly done, weak in
the drawing, flaccid and insensitive in the handling of the paint. The image
chosen may be striking enough - a bland Hotel Foyer, the H-Block Dirty
Protest, an Andrex advertisement, Hugh Gaitskell as a Monster of Filmland,
Mick Jagger arrested, Marilyn Monroe, an American limousine, a Hoover - but
whichever it is, Hamilton's own intervention, once we get beyond the
presentation, is almost invariably singularly inept.
Only with collage does he show a truer assurance, and collage is the most
seductive and facile of the graphic media. And it is to collage in the
larger sense that he has always been drawn in practice, bringing together,
in his paintings, sculptures and installations, elements already made,
elements, more to the point, that he does not have to make himself. His
career-long preoccupation with the camera and now the computer, and all the
mechanical devices of print-making, bear the same rationalisation.
Hamilton makes much of his experience as a student, even showing some
youthful schematic studies of the figure by which to establish his academic
credentials, but the demonstration is unconvincing. Returning to the Academy
Schools after the War, he was soon asked to leave for 'not profiting from
the instruction given', his self-justifying retort being that there was none
by which to profit. After National Service he migrated to the Slade, and by
1953 was a lecturer in the Fine Art School of what is now Newcastle
University. There through the 1950s, in collaboration with Victor Pasmore,
he developed the principles of Basic Design upon which the authorities were
persuaded to remodel the country's art schools, the effects of which reform
we live with still.
Two landscape paintings of 1954, 'Transitions III &amp; IV', show what he was
about at this time, Pasmore-esque in their tentativeness, uncertain in their
perspectives, woefully inadequate in their drawing, with hints at Cezanne
and Seurat to mark their pretensions. And what, in the cant question of
1960s teaching, are these works about? An enquiry into the nature of
pictorial space perhaps? The flat surface of the canvas? The mark? The
moving eye? Nothing at all?
For an intelligent man to wish to be an artist is an honourable ambition,
but to suppose that it may be achieved merely by the intelligent application
of the will is to suppose, pace the beggar's long experience, that wishes
were horses. Talent, touch, intuition, technique - bogey-words all - are
also necessary, and require long study in the cultivation. The sad truth,
for Hamilton as for all of us, is that they cannot be fudged or evaded. We
can only feel for him in his difficulty.
This is not to doubt Hamilton's sincerity in any way, but the Emperor in the
story was sincerity itself, for all his vanity. Hamilton has been no less
ill-served by his courtiers. The Andrex 'Soft Landscape' paintings of the
early 1970s, air-brushed and daubed onto a photographic base, invoke, so a
caption tells us, the 'magical ambiguity' of a Watteau. Who, we might then
ask ourselves, has only stood before Watteau with his eyes closed? It was
ever easier to strike an attitude than paint a picture.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: Amsterdam remembers Nono / Review of 'Prometeo' and
other late works at the Holland Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Luigi Nono died in Venice in May 1990. He belonged with Boulez and
Stockhausen as one of the mainsprings of the post-war avant-garde, a
composer whose music continued to pose new questions and to colonise fresh
expressive territory right to the end of his life. In most of Western Europe
his music is recognised and accorded the importance it deserves. In Britain
it remains too little known and too rarely performed, regarded with unease
because of its uncompromising rigour and unflinching political idealism; in
particular only a handful of the wonderfully refined and elusive pieces from
the last decade of Nono's life have been heard here.
One of the mains strands of this year's Holland Festival, which runs its
usual discursive course throughout June in Amsterdam, is a survey of those
late works. Five concerts include one or more pieces, and they are clustered
about three performances of what is the most extraordinary and refractory of
all his output, the tragedia dell'ascolto after Aeschylus, Prometeo. Claudio
Abbado conducted the first performance in the deconsecrated church of San
Lorenzo in Venice in 1984; a revised version was performed at La Scala,
Milan, a year later.
If the percussion piece Con Luigi Dallapiccola of 1979 and the string
quartet Fragmente-Stille of 1980 were the signals that the poster-bright,
agit-prop rhetoric of Nono's music of the 1960s and '70s had been
superseded, Prometeo emerged as the key to that late contemplative style. In
retrospect it appears as the fixed point, the philosophical, musical and
textual centre, around which all the other pieces revolved.
The idea of a new kind of dramatic synthesis was conceived in the wake of
the Frankfurt staging of his second music-theatre work Al gran sole carico
d'amore in 1978; Nono settled upon Aeschylus' tragedy as his starting point
and enlisted the philosopher Massimo Cacciari to prepare the text. What
Cacciari produced was dense and many-layered: it incorporated material from
Aeschylus alongside other classical Greek poets, the cosmogony of Hesiod,
extracts from Nieztsche and Holderlin, Walter Benjamin and Cacciari himself.
In place of a linear narrative there is a series of independent sections,
which Cacciari likened to a group of islands in an archipelago. These
'islands' are interspersed in the revised version with other elements
borrowed from the forms of Greek drama, and prefaced with a substantial
prologue. Nono's musical response was similarly intricate. Prometeo is
scored for five solo vocalists, two narrators, mixed chorus, a collection of
solo instrumentalists and four instrumental groups; computers transform the
sounds and pan them around the auditorium.
The Venice premiere took place within an ark-like construction of platforms
designed by the Italian architect Enzo Piano; the audience sat in the nave
of the church, with the performers arrayed around and above them. The
Amsterdam performances took place in the magnificent space of the
Goederenbeurs in the Beurs van Berlage, home of the Netherlands
Philharmonic; the solo instrumentalists were grouped around the upper
galleries, while the ensembles at the points of the compass were also above
the audience.
There is nothing conventionally dramatic about Prometeo, no dramatis
personae, no scenic directions. It is, as the subtitle suggests, a 'tragedy
to be heard'; not an oratorio nor a piece of music theatre, but something of
both, a musical ritual of strange power and enchantment. It is not, though,
an easy or ingratiating experience. Prometeo is long, an unbroken
two-and-a-half-hour span, a musical journey with only the most generalised
of maps. Much of it is hermetic and bare, with slowly changing choral and
orchestral lines and sudden eruptions of colour or subdued moments of drama
 -an intricate instrumental solo or duet here, sensuously intertwined vocal
lines there, passages of limpid narration which break through the misty
outlines of the text settings.
A portion of the near capacity audience failed to stay the course, but the
vast majority that remained responded with great enthusiasm to the
performance, which was co-ordinated by Andre Richard, conducted by Ingo
Metzmacher and Peter Rundel, with the Netherlands Chamber Choir and Radio
Chamber Orchestra and a distinguished roster of soloists. The total effect
of Prometeo is certainly vastly impressive, much more than the sum of its
individual parts; every element in its arcane scheme seems perfectly placed.
It is never going to be a regular concert work, but will continue to give
perspective to the last phase of Nono's career.
The evening before the opening of Prometeo the Nieuw Ensemble was directed
by Andre Richard in three of Nono's late pieces; barely 50 minutes of music
altogether, yet fiercely concentrated pieces in wonderfully committed,
intense performances that drew the listener with absolute certainty into
their magical sound world. Guai ai gelidi mostri (1983) offers another
textual collage by Cacciari in a setting for two contraltos, six instruments
and live electronics; Post-Prae-Ludium no. 1 'Donau' (1987) places a solo
tuba among computer reflections and transformations of itself, a delicate
study of tiny gestures.
Omaggio a Gyorgy Kurtag (1986) is again based on a text devised by Cacciari,
a conflation that includes Melville and Ingeborg Bachmann. Nono's own
programme note makes reference to Schubert's Winterreise, an allusion that
could be applied to almost all the music here. The suppressed expressive
world, the intimate relationship between sounds and texts, conjure
Schubertian comparisons; it is 'late' music of the most rarefied and special
kind.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that many of its inmates are not the greatest fans of the
controversial Lloyd's building is obviously no hindrance to participating in
the world of design philanthropy, since its architect, Sir Richard Rogers,
59, has just been appointed a trustee of London's design museum.
The Richard Rogers partnership is currently working on the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg and Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport, outside
London. He has also taken to the printed word recently, co-authoring a
blueprint for changing Britain's capital city with Mark Fisher, the Labour
party's shadow arts minister.
Joining Rogers on the enlarged, 14-member trustee's board will be Alice
Rawsthorn, 33, a journalist with the Financial Times' Paris office. Before
taking up her Paris post last year, Rawsthorn wrote for the FT on
advertising and design in London.  A case of poacher seduced into
gamekeeping if evere there was one.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government 'firm' on EC hours limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government might accept a compromise on the European Community
working time directive but is not prepared to agree to the controversial
48-hour limit on the working week, even if it is delayed for 10 years.
A meeting of senior cabinet ministers yesterday finalised Britain's 'bottom
line' on the directive, which will almost certainly be voted on at the
meeting of EC ministers responsible for employment legislation in Luxembourg
tomorrow.
Britain is insisting that there should be full flexibility on designating
Sunday as an official day of rest; that negotiations on directives between
employers and employees can take place at local and not just national level;
and that employees should be free to work more than 48 hours a week if it
does not put their health at risk.
The first two points are unlikely to cause difficulty, but several countries
would prefer to keep the 48-hour limit, even if it is delayed for 10 years
as proposed by the Portuguese. If Britain cannot win an indefinite
postponement of the 48-hour limit it will probably launch a legal challenge
against the directive.
Although Britain alone cannot vote down the directive, ministers believe
that other EC countries are less likely to impose the directive on the UK
after the Danish referendum result.
One senior minister said after yesterday's talks that the government had
agreed a position that combined 'firmness with reason'. It was anxious to
avoid an open breach with its EC partners on the eve of the Lisbon summit,
but there were limits beyond which its supporters in the Commons would not
accept compromise.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, today meets her opposite
number in Paris, Mrs Martine Aubry, for what might be a crucial last-minute
negotiation on the directive.
The French have been among the most enthusiastic supporters of the
directive, including the 48-hour limit, but Mrs Aubry has a reputation for
pragmatism.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Debate may foil Tory Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR may directly confront his critics in the Conservative party by
holding a full-scale Commons debate on Britain's priorities for its
presidency of the European Community.
Senior ministers said the prime minister was considering a debate before
parliament begins its summer recess next month.
The suggestion came amid indications that European enthusiasts in the
cabinet have decided to move on to the offensive against the Euro-sceptics
in the Tory party who are opposing the Maastricht accords on European Union.
Mr Major, who will tonight hold talks in Downing Street with Mr Jacques
Delors on his plans for the presidency, has made clear that the legislation
to ratify Maastricht will not return to the Commons until the late autumn.
But ministers said that he might seek to isolate the Euro-sceptics by
calling a more general debate before the recess.
The debate would be framed so as to prevent either Labour or rebels in his
own party from forcing a substantial vote while rallying support for the
government's position.
Mr Major has put enlargement of the Community, the completion of the single
market and tight controls on spending at the centre of his agenda for the
next six months.
In a speech last night Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, fired the first
shots in what colleagues said would be a determined campaign by the
ministerial enthusiasts for European integration.
Mr Hunt, whose speech was approved in advance by Downing Street, called on
Conservatives to embrace a 'bold vision' of Europe, seizing the opportunity
to create an ever more united community of peoples while preserving national
diversities.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour tries to heal its European
wound / Examining the party's division over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gerald Kaufman is enjoying a characteristically combative swansong as
Labour's outgoing shadow foreign secretary.
Last weekend, he again challenged the government to come to the Commons and
spell out its plans for the future of the bill ratifying the Maastricht
treaty.
Speaking in his Manchester, Gorton, constituency, he warned that Ireland's
firm 'yes' in its referendum last week would do nothing to solve the
quandary on how to proceed without splitting the Conservative party.
'Unless and until a clear way through is shown for the treaty, it will be
improper for the government to ask parliament to pass the Maastricht Bill,'
Mr Kaufman said, comfortable in the certainty that no such 'way through' is
likely before his return to the back benches.
If his invitation to debate is declined, it is not impossible that Labour
will use some of its own time allocation to table a suitably caustic
European motion of its own.
But the wording will have to be delicately chosen. There is now plenty of
evidence that the Danish referendum result has left Labour quite as divided
over the future of the Maastricht accords as the government.
In the past 10 days alone, Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader, has had to
decline the presidency of the Confederation of Socialist parties and hint
that Labour just might support a national referendum on Maastricht.
Both moves are indicators of the deep ferment on the Labour benches as the
old leadership ebbs away. 'Gerald is demob happy, Neil is buckling under the
pressure and John Smith can't say anything as he's not yet elected,' one
worried party disciplinarian commented yesterday.
That mood is beginning to alarm longstanding Labour 'Europeans' who fear
that the party is now risks sacrificing its hard-fought struggle for
credibility on the Continent for a short-term tactical victory in
Westminster.
Mr Giles Radice, the Euro-phile MP for Durham North, appears to have had a
premonition of such a danger. His new book, Offshore: Britain and the
European Idea, published next week, warns against Labour being a 'reluctant
European' party or even reverting to an anti-European stance.
Yet there are probably no more than 25 anti-Europeans in the parliamentary
Labour party. The real threat now comes from a pro-European faction, driven
by the newly reformed Tribune group led by two prominent soft-left
backbenchers, Mr Peter Hain and Ms Clare Short.
They are arguing that the Danish referendum outcome offers an opportunity to
re-open the treaty negotiations to address Labour's demands for, for
example, more democratic accountability of Community institutions and
British adhesion to the social chapter.
Such arguments provoke despair among longstanding Labour Europhiles who say
that any short-term gain from defeating the government on ratification would
be paid in lost credibility abroad.
As Mr Radice points out, if France approves Maastricht in its own
plebiscite, Labour opposition to the treaty - on whatever grounds - could
end up scuppering the social chapter it publicly espouses.
The Tribunites counter that factors such as the highly-monetarist
convergence criteria for economic union are so flawed as to justify
rejection of the Maastricht terms.
'If Britain voting it (Maastricht ) down led to a renegotiation, I might go
for it,' Ms Short said.
In part, this owes much to a growing appetite for confrontation - both with
the government and, arguably, the party leadership - provoked by the
frustrations of opposition. Yet fellow socialists in Brussels - Labour MEPs
included - say it demonstrates an historic unreliability and general lack of
seriousness over the European project.
For Mr John Smith, a month away from his coronation as leader, the European
question will be his first test.
So far, as an impeccable European, he has delicately endorsed the
Tribunites' criticisms of Maastricht as 'not enough,' but stressed the need
to work closely with Labour's European allies.
Opposed to using a referendum as sticking plaster over party divisions, his
instincts will be to back another neutral abstention when the treaty comes
to a vote.
Yet with Labour in its current mood there is a danger that, just months
after taking office, he may face one of the party's biggest rebellions since
the bad old days of the early 1980s.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour in talks on union role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEHIND-THE-SCENES talks are under way to find a face-saving formula aimed at
averting a public clash between the trade unions and the Labour leadership
over the unions' role in selecting or deselecting MPs.
Last week, the national executive's organisation committee agreed rule
changes to carry through Mr Neil Kinnock's objective of excluding union
votes and confining the process to individual party members.
But continuing opposition to the changes from the big general unions, the
TGWU and the GMB, and Nupe, the public employees' union, threatens to
overturn that decision at the annual conference in October.
Now it has emerged that Labour officials are discussing a compromise whereby
the proposed changes are formally adopted at the national executive meeting
tomorrow, then immediately taken into a wider review of union links.
If such a compromise is agreed, it will avoid a conference debate in October
in which the leadership might be unable to muster the two-thirds majority
required for a rule change to be adopted.
A lobby group representing Labour's constituency activists has targeted Mr
John Smith's shadow budget as the party's 'biggest vote loser' at the April
general election and calls for a new convergence of the centre-left.
The report by the soft-left Labour Co-ordinating Committee, published today,
says that while the budget was a 'bold move', a failure to project a vision
for the economy left tax issues at the centre of its policy by default.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Boundary proposals attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people eligible to vote in England and Wales might be as much
as 1.7m higher than the number registered, Mr Alistair Darling, shadow home
affairs spokesman, asserted yesterday.
He was moving a Labour amendment to the government bill which seeks to
ensure that changes in the boundaries of constituencies are implemented
before the next general election.
Labour's amendment would allow boundary commissions to delay submitting
their reports to the government if they were satisfied that the register on
which they were basing them was inaccurate.
While it was known electoral registers were inaccurate in many areas,
boundary commissions were nevertheless expected to report on the basis of
the information they contained, Mr Darling said.
He laid much of the blame for the unsatisfactory situation on the poll tax,
which had made 'breaking the law an acceptable act to many people who would
never ever have contemplated it in the past'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, insisted that British rates of voter
registration were high by international standards.
The Labour amendment fell by 59 votes (303-244).
Individuals earning more than Pounds 50,000 a year will be Pounds 21,000
better off this financial year than if 1978-79 income tax rates had simply
been indexed, the Treasury said in a parliamentary written answer last
night. Those earning less than Pounds 5,000 will be just Pounds 150 better
off.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Employers 'hostile' to pregnant women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIZENS' Advice Bureaux are to press the government for tighter rules on
the protection of pregnant women at work.
The call follows evidence that women are being dismissed when their
employers find out they are pregnant, the National Association Citizens
Advice Bureaux claims in a report published today.
The association says the attitudes of some employers to pregnancy are
'hostile and uninformed'. It is the latest group to lobby for increased
legal protection for pregnant women ahead of the meeting of EC ministers
responsible for employment legislation in Luxembourg tomorrow. Both the
Equal Opportunities Commission and the Labour party yesterday urged the
government to agree to improvements in maternity pay.
Mr Tony Blair, the opposition employment spokesman, was joined by MEPs at a
news conference to press the case for all women having 16 weeks paid leave,
remunerated at 80 per cent of their regular salaries. The UK government
wants the payments to be at a lower rate, equivalent to statutory sick pay
levels.
It is thought unlikely that British objections will be overruled tomorrow:
either maternity pay at the lower rate is likely to be agreed or the draft
directive in its entirety could be scrapped.
The Equal Opportunities Commission also backed the call for 80 per cent pay.
It added that it objected to the proposed link between maternity pay and
sick pay. 'Pregnant women are not sick. If the Council of Ministers should
decide to link maternity pay with sick pay, then . . . British women would
end up with only about 25 per cent of the average full-time women worker's
wage', it said.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Job adverts by phone to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of premium-rate telephone services to advertise jobs and business
opportunities is to be investigated by the industry's watchdog body after a
sharp increase in complaints last year.
The review was ordered by the Independent Committee for the Supervision of
Standards of Telephone Information Services (Icstis) after it received
allegations that some of the business and job opportunities advertised did
not exist or were advertised in a misleading manner.
Complainants said they had made telephone calls at 48p a minute - 36p cheap
rate - in response to advertisements offering job opportunities, to find
that none existed.
The overall number of complaints about all premium-rate telephone services
rose 45 per cent to 6,753 from 4,658 in 1990. A record number of services
were removed last year.
Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, chairman of Icstis, said complaints about
employment services increased more than fivefold to 843, about 13 per cent
of total complaints.
In one case a service advertised in Scotland claiming to be looking for
people to pack goods at home for distribution was found by Icstis to have no
goods and no vacancies.
Sir Louis said callers to some such services were sometimes faced with a
charge for applying for the vacancy or opportunity, as well as the premium
cost of the call.
The employment services were only the most recent and conspicuous among a
number of services that have fallen foul of guidelines for use of the
premium-rate telephone services drawn up by Icstis.
As the industry has grown from Pounds 67m in 1987 to Pounds 200m last year,
according to industry estimates, the number of services removed or amended
trebled last year to 665 and 370 respectively. Icstis ordered the withdrawal
of 833 advertisements that did not comply with its guidelines. Sir Louis
said persistent offenders tended to be in the adult entertainment sector.
Icstis has strengthened its rules on misleading services and advertisements
and has included in its revised code of practice a requirement that
interactive services lasting more than 10 minutes should inform callers of
the total cost of the call and give regular warnings of additional time
spent connected.
In addition to complaints about employment services, those relating to
competitions offering prizes to callers approximately doubled while those
relating to sales promotions - mailings inviting people to call premium
numbers offering incentives - rose tenfold.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Fastest Jaguar road car sets off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELIVERIES are beginning this week of the fastest and, at Pounds 350,000
each, the most expensive roadgoing Jaguar cars ever built.
However, growing environmentalist sentiment and the difficulties some
customers apparently face in paying for their cars make it almost certain
that the 500-plus horsepower 212mph XJ220 is likely to be the first and last
of its type to be offered under the Jaguar badge.
'We all recognise that a long-term shift is taking place in what will appeal
to buyers. No one can afford to ignore the environmental issues,' according
to Mr Bill Donnelly, sales and marketing director of JaguarSport, which is
based at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, where the XJ220 is being built.
JaguarSport, which has engineered and is producing the cars, is a 50-50
joint-venture company set up in 1988 between Jaguar - itself now owned by
Ford - and Mr Tom Walkinshaw's racing organisation to develop
high-performance versions of Jaguar's mainstream models as well as to
undertake special projects.
The XJ220, said Mr Donnelly, 'will probably turn out to be the ultimate
roadgoing Jaguar. We'll take a different slant in the future; something
smaller and lighter, with the emphasis very much on weight-saving.'
The XJ220 plant is to be taken over by another Ford subsidiary, Aston
Martin, to make a new Aston Martin model - expected to be priced below
Pounds 100,000 - at a rate of 625 a year as soon as XJ220 production ends in
early 1994.
The car's debut could hardly be worse timed, coming when the UK and other
once buoyant markets for expensive cars are still struggling to emerge from
the recession, and when cars in general are being increasingly pilloried
over environmental issues such as exhaust emissions, energy conservation,
congestion and pedestrian safety. The XJ220 may meet all emissions standards
envisaged until at least 1994, but its speed and inevitably high - but so
far undisclosed - fuel consumption make it a likely focus for anti-car
campaigners.
JaguarSport is not alone. Several other 200mph-plus 'supercars' conceived on
their creators' computer screens in the boom period of the late 1980s have
also been announced in the past few weeks. They include the Pounds 530,000
McLaren F1, a car based on the Surrey racing group's grand prix technology;
and the Yamaha OX99-11, a 200mph single-seater to be produced for the
Japanese vehicle manufacturer at its Ypsilon Technology subsidiary at Milton
Keynes.
According to JaguarSport, 1,500 would-be owners applied to buy the cars,
backing their orders with a Pounds 50,000, non-returnable deposit when the
project was first announced in the autumn of 1989. But with the market for
very expensive cars having suffered a spectacular collapse, there is growing
speculation within the investment-car market about whether 'supercar' sales
confidence may be misplaced.
According to Mr Robert Brooks, principal of the international auction house
which has sold many of the world's most valuable cars, the present
investment value of virtually all 'supercars' is well below their new
purchase price. 'The investment money is simply not there,' he says. 'How
many cars like this can the market absorb, particularly at a time when the
speculative investment buyer has gone out of the market?'
Under the XJ220's order terms, options are tradable. Originally seen as
offering the potential for a premium, the recession has meant some option
sales have been made simply to recoup the Pounds 50,000 and escape payment
of a second Pounds 50,000 instalment required before a car's construction
starts.
JaguarSport has yet to try and test the veracity of another speculation
circulating among collectors of cars: that a few option owners looking to
escape from purchase but finding difficulty in selling their options have
'sold' them to asset-less shell companies which it would be pointless for
Jaguar to pursue for payment. If that is happening, said Mr Donnelly, the
instalment payment system means that JaguarSport will get warning at least
six months before construction of a particular car starts.
'If there are problems, it simply won't get built - at least not until
another firm buyer is found,' he added.

FT  23 JUN 92 / More at school after 16
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR saw a big rise in the number of 16-year-olds staying on at school
in England and Wales, according to a report by the Careers Service published
yesterday.
The report shows that of the half million pupils who reached school leaving
age last summer, 61 per cent - the highest proportion ever - remained in
full-time education. In 1990 it was 53 per cent, and in 1989 48 per cent.
If Youth Training is included, 76 per cent of those eligible to leave school
remained in full-time education or training last year compared with 70 per
cent in 1989.
For the first time in recent decades, that puts England and Wales within
reach of France and Germany where the full-time staying-on rate is between
80 per cent and 90 per cent - although many people doubt the comparability
of Youth Training, which accounted for 15 per cent of last year's school
leavers, with Continental training schemes.
The recession is clearly a factor in the increase.
The Careers Service report, published by the Association of County Councils,
shows a far higher staying-on rate among girls (68 per cent) than among boys
(55 per cent).
Among girls leaving school to go into jobs, traditional feminine career
patterns persist unchecked. Most girls went into clerical, retail,
hairdressing and the 'caring' professions. The five most popular occupations
for boys were construction, retail, mechanical and production engineering,
processing and the armed forces and police.
The survey shows large regional variations. With 68 per cent of 16-year-olds
remaining in full-time education, the south-east tops the league. Behind it
come outer London, (67 per cent), the south-west (66 per cent) and inner
London (63 per cent). The north scores lowest, with only 51 per cent staying
on.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Changes to legal aid urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL changes to legal aid are needed to control the continuing rise in
the cost of the scheme to the taxpayer, Mr John Pitts, chairman of the Legal
Aid Board, said yesterday.
The net cost of legal aid rose 35.4 per cent to Pounds 760m last year
according to the board's annual report.
The increase arose largely from a substantial rise in the demand for
legal-aid services, an increase in the number of bills paid and an increase
in the average cost of cases.
Mr Pitts said the increases were partly created by the recession, which had
increased demand for legal help.
The costs of cases are controlled through assessment by the courts and
determination by the board. 'Neither process has proved capable of keeping
average costs in line with inflation, nor does it appear that with the
present arrangements either process is capable of achieving this,' Mr Pitts
said.
The board's estimate of expenditure in 1992-93 was Pounds 890m, and the
provision was Pounds 682m. There was no possibility of expenditure being
contained within that figure and the board would have to apply for a
supplementary provision, Mr Pitts continued.
The situation might have been worse if the board had not met all its
performance targets. The average cost of processing applications and bills
had fallen by more than 18 per cent in real terms in the past three years.
while the quality of the service had improved substantially.
That had been achieved through good management, Mr Pitts said.
He attacked the decline in productivity of legal-aid solicitors. Over the
past five years, the amount of payments to solicitors out of the legal-aid
fund had doubled while the number of firms doing legal-aid work had
declined, he said.
The report also expressed concern about suspected fraud by solicitors. Six
solicitors face charges of defrauding the legal-aid fund and a further 29
cases are being investigated by the police. In total, 60 cases of suspected
fraud are under investigation.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Tureen survives revolution to score success: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S and Christie's spent the weekend in Monaco holding sales of
paintings, furniture and silver. Results were mixed, but Sotheby's scored a
success with its dispersal of 45 pieces of 18th-century French silver
collected by the late Arturo Lopez-Willshaw, making FFr33.3m (Pounds 3.35m)
with everything sold.
The French Revolution had a devastating effect on French silver and few good
items survived. But Lopez-Willshaw owned a soup tureen made by by
Edme-Pierre Balzac in Paris in 1757 and a ragout dish, the work of Thomas
Germain, both part of the Penthievre-Orleans service, the only French royal
service to survive. They sold for FFr6.6m and FFr3.3m respectively, the
former being acquired by the Louvre. The star of the auction was a rococo
coffee pot by Francois-Thomas Germain, which quadrupled its estimate to sell
for FFr8.3m, a record for a silver coffee pot.
The auction of Old Master paintings totalled FFr32m but 33 per cent was left
unsold. An American collector paid FFr2.2m for a pastel portrait of the
Marechal of Belle-Ilse by Maurice-Quentin de la Tour, at the bottom of its
estimate.
Christie's did quite well with a private collection of French furniture that
totalled FFr26.3m and was 18 per cent unsold, but less well with paintings,
which brought in FFr18m, with more than 40 per cent unsold.
In the furniture a console desserte in the Anglo-Chinese style, attributed
to Adam Weisweiler, was just within estimate at FFr3.4m. Three similar
consoles, which were made for the Prince Regent, are now in Buckingham
Palace.
Christie's sale of 19th-century pictures in London on Friday was also
something of a disaster, with the two top lots, 'Prometheus Bound' by
Gustave Moreau, and a view of Taormina by Carl Rottmann falling well below
their estimates of about Pounds 400,000. Yesterday at Christie's an Italian
maiolica bowl made around 1525, painted with the Deposition from the Cross,
made the top price of Pounds 55,000. In 1938 it had sold for Pounds 125.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Equal pay cases up by 200%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of cases claiming equal pay for equal value being brought to
industrial tribunals more than trebled last year compared with 1990,
according to an analysis by Industrial Relations Services, the independent
pay and conditions group.
Much of the increase was accounted for by about 600 cases brought by
domestic staff against four Northern Ireland health boards, claiming equal
pay with porters. Overall, almost 90 per cent of the applications involved
just six employers.
The study found that the average wait for cases to be determined by
tribunals is just less than 17 months, although cases can take much longer.
Two cases settled last year, both without the need for a tribunal ruling,
took almost four years and six years to resolve.
Long waits reflect the complexity of the legislation. The Equal
Opportunities Commission has argued that existing equal pay and sex
discrimination legislation should be replaced by a single, more simple act.
The principle of equal pay for equal value means that an individual can
claim equal pay with someone of the opposite sex, even if they are in a
different post in the organisation, if it can be argued that the work makes
equal demands.
There were 1,313 applications on those grounds last year - the most since
1987, the study found.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Call for greater hospital efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS SPEND two or three hours a day walking around hospitals rather than
treating patients, according to research published yesterday, Alan Pike
writes.
A study of 10 National Health Service hospitals by Andersen Consulting,
management consultants, showed that junior doctors walked six or seven miles
in a typical shift.
The research showed that an average of 10 staff are involved in a routine
test, with a turnround time of 18 hours. In a five-day stay in hospital,
patients would be likely to come into contact with 47 staff.
Dr Nicholas Edwards of Andersen Consulting said: 'Critical processes could
be simpler and involve fewer people.' He said junior doctors were forced to
do an amount of travelling around their places of work which 'most people
would take exception to in getting to work'.
Andersen Consulting carried out the research to test the scope for
patient-centred care in UK hospitals.
It involves dividing hospital buildings into discrete units. All routine
tests and treatment are carried out in the units, greatly reducing the
movement of patients and staff around the hospital.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Music fails to seduce Bentalls' customers / Visiting a south
London store in the front line of the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRY the pianist tickles the ivories in an attempt to lull the shoppers
into spending their money. But they are not so easily enticed and wander
around the gleaming white Bentalls department store clutching their bags
close to their chests and staring suspiciously at the serried ranks of
merchandise.
This is Monday morning in Kingston, south London - the retail recession's
front line - and there are few signs of the gloomy mood lifting, in spite of
Harry's best efforts.
'This is the longest sustained difficult trading period I have known in my
30-year career,' says Mr Richard Goodwin, the store manager. 'And I do not
believe recovery will be fast,' he adds.
'Since the election we did see more interest from our customers and spending
increased for five or six weeks. Then it dropped off a little. People may
just be waiting for the sales to start. Shoppers are not daft and they know
that retailers have to get rid of excess stocks,' he says.
Staff bustle around him, filling shelves for the start of the sale on
Thursday.
Mr Goodwin believes the lingering downturn (he does not like the word
recession) has two principal causes: fear of the jobs situation and the
steep fall in house prices, which have slid by as much as 25 per cent in the
Kingston area. Neither will be quickly reversed, he believes.
'I do not suppose there is any family around here that does not know of
somebody who has become unemployed within the past year to 18 months. When
it gets as close to home as that, people begin to fear that if it's happened
to my aunt, my uncle, or my neighbour it could also happen to me.'
There are some encouraging signs: the slight fall in unemployment figures is
one. After rising from 2.1 per cent in 1989 to 6.9 per cent this year, the
unemployment rate has just fallen back for the first time in 20 months.
'I think there will be some move towards recovery during the sales period
and we will see an improvement from then on, but how long it will take is
anybody's guess,' he says.
At a group level, Bentalls' sales of Pounds 71m in the year to February 1
are still below those of 1988 in spite of an increase in retail space.
Profits of Pounds 1.43m are only a third of those recorded four years ago.
Mr Grenville Peacock, managing director, says there is little he can do to
trim costs any further, since staffing has been already cut heavily to
1,200. 'We are employing 20 per cent less people than we were 3 1/2 years
ago,' he says.
He believes only a significant cut in interest rates can help restore
consumer confidence and says he finds talk of the recession persisting for
another three years 'really alarming'.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Exit the big spenders: Consumers still squeezed by debt -
Stores report slow sales - Growth in exports broadly based / Why there is
somuch caution in the high street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH consumer, chastened by debt and fearful of rising unemployment,
may well be developing a new and sober attitude to spending in the high
street.
As the uncertainty of the general election fades and interest rates move
slowly downwards, shoppers have failed to respond with the enthusiasm many
retailers were expecting.
Instead, there appears to be a trend among spenders to seek quality ahead of
flashiness, durability ahead of fashion, and above all the benefits of
savings ahead of conspicuous consumption.
Hopes that spending was about to revive were demolished by the paltry rise
of retail sales in May. A limited splurge in spending in April dwindled to a
trickle last month as consumers continued to stay away from Britain's high
streets.
The reluctance to spend is at odds with the general trend of consumer
confidence, which has been moving upwards since the beginning of the year.
Consumers appear to believe that the worst of the recession is over, but are
still cautious.
The main squeeze on consumers, and still the biggest cause for uncertainty,
is debt. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, has estimated that about 1.8m people are sitting on so-called
'negative equity', where the value of their house has fallen below the value
of their mortgage.
Inflation - at 4 per cent and falling - can no longer be relied upon to
erode the value, and hence the burden, of the debt. At the same time,
unemployment continues to rise, creating a general air of uncertainty about
the future.
But although the debt burden and fear of unemployment weigh heavily on
Britain's households, not everyone is feeling the pinch. Average earnings
growth of 7 per cent a year against inflation of about 4 per cent should
mean that those in work are feeling better off. Mortgage payers everywhere
have seen interest payments come down as base rates have dropped from 15 per
cent to 10 per cent.
One theory to explain the timidity of British consumers is that a new mood
of sobriety has combined with the constraints on spending left over from the
1980s.
The horror of indebtedness is still foremost in people's memories so that
consumers, once bitten in the 1980s, are twice shy in the 1990s. 'There is
no point looking to the credit figures for signs of an upturn,' says Mr
James Barty at Morgan Grenfell. 'People will start to spend out of extra
cash rather than borrow to spend.'
Yet that alone does not explain the more stoical mood of consumers that has
been noted by the retailers themselves.
'There is plenty of cash out there but there is still too much emphasis on
saving,' says the managing director of a chain of electrical goods shops
based in the south-east. He blames government incentives such as tax-exempt
special savings accounts and personal equity plans, which are taking funds
that would otherwise go on discretionary expenditure.
According to retailers, those who are spending are spending differently. The
finance director of a clothing chain says consumers are looking for clothes
that are more durable, if a little less fashionable. The managing director
of the electrical goods chain says turnover of toasters costing Pounds 37.95
is much higher than turnover of toasters at Pounds 11.95, whereas the
reverse was true during the boom.
'People are less prepared to take risks and try out different products,' he
says. 'They want quality, something they know will last.'
Some have even suggested that spending on flashy products is no longer
fashionable. Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, speaks of
'conspicuous non-consumption' restraining demand, and points to a cut in
advertising expenditure on consumer products at the same time that spending
on savings products has held up.
Mr Douglas McWilliams, economic adviser of the Confederation of British
Industry, puts it another way. 'Spending is not as fashionable as it used to
be. There is no need to keep up with the Joneses if the Joneses aren't
spending.'
There are also fewer new innovations on the shelves to tempt shoppers, and
with the economic outlook still uncertain, investment in innovation is
likely to remain modest. The store manager of a London electricals store
says: 'Sales of brown goods, such as radios and televisions, have held up
pretty well because the technology moves on. But white goods have not sold
well because there has been little innovation in fridges and cookers.'
Perhaps the key to explaining the change in people's attitudes remains the
torpor of the housing market. People do not feel as wealthy as they did when
the value of their homes was on a seemingly endless upward path.
Furthermore, because people are not moving, they are not buying expensive
items such as curtains, kitchens and carpets. As long as the housing market
remains stagnant, spending on smaller moveable items such as lamps and rugs
might tick over, but big expensive items will shift only slowly.
How long then are retailers going to have to wait to see life return to the
high streets?
Optimists believe that the brighter sentiment consumers are expressing now
in confidence surveys will soon translate into higher retail sales. Others
think sales will remain feeble until the housing market perks up.
Those retailers that have survived the recession appear to be braced for
such slow growth. 'I don't think we are in a recession,' says the managing
director of the small electricals chain. 'This is something different. This
is the level of retail sales we are going to have to get used to - what we
saw in the 1980s was an aberration.'

FT  23 JUN 92 / Imports continue strong rise but exports up 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sharp declines last month in Britain's visible trade and provisional
current-account deficits represent more a return to normality than any
significant improvement in the nation's trade performance.
While exports rose 4 per cent in May to an all-time high of Pounds 9.17bn
and last month's seasonally adjusted visible trade deficit, at Pounds 845m,
was the lowest monthly total so far this year, imports have continued to
advance strongly.
Moreover, at Pounds 1.19bn, the latest monthly visible trade deficit less
oil and the so-called erratic items such as aircraft, ships, North Sea
installations and precious stones, was consistent with that measure of the
deficit for most months since the middle of last year. The Central
Statistical Office and the Treasury consider that the measure gives a
reasonable guide to underlying trade performance.
The good news in the latest trade figures is that export growth is broadly
based. Taking the figures for volume exports, Britain exported more of every
type of product except certain consumer goods in the three months to the end
of May compared with the three months to the end of February. Altogether,
volume exports rose by 2.5 per cent between the two periods and were up 5
per cent in the three months to the end of May compared with the comparable
three months last year.
The bad news is that imports grew more strongly, with growth in volume terms
of 4 per cent in the latest three months compared with the three months to
the end of February and an increase of 7.5 per cent compared with the three
months to end-May last year. Those figures give a better guide to the trend
of Britain's imports than the 1.5 per cent drop in the value of imports to
Pounds 10bn last month from April's Pounds 10.18bn.
Excluding erratic items, the latest trade returns show that volume exports
of manufactured goods rose by 2.5 per cent in the latest three months
compared with the previous three months.
Volume imports of manufactured goods, including finished manufactures,
increased by 4.5 per cent in the same period. A notable feature was an 18
per cent jump in the volume imports of cars in the latest three months while
car exports in volume terms increased by only 1 per cent compared with the
three months to the end of February.
It is too early to judge whether the latest figures point to a serious
reversal of the recent revival of UK car exports.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Tunnel to be built under Medway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 70M road tunnel is to be built by a UK-Dutch joint venture under
the river Medway to relieve traffic congestion and to encourage the
redevelopment of the historic former naval dockyard at Chatham.
The contract to build a largely publicly financed tunnel has been awarded by
Kent County Council to a joint venture between Tarmac, the British
construction and building materials group, and HBM Civil Engineering, part
of Hollandsche Beton Groep of the Netherlands.
The tunnel, a twin-bore immersed tube, will stretch between Frindsbury on
the west bank to the Chatham Maritime development being carried out by
English Estates, the government-sponsored development agency, on the east
bank.
More than 300 acres of the the dockyard, where some of Britain's most famous
warships were built, including Nelson's flagship HMS Victory, were set aside
for redevelopment when the dockyard closed in 1984.
At that stage it was hoped to build a privately financed tunnel or bridge
across the Medway.
English Estates and Rochester Bridge Trust, a 600-year-old charity which
owns and operates the twin bridges carrying the A2 across the Medway at
Rochester, are making a Pounds 20m contribution to the cost.

THE Scottish deep mine industry will wither under privatisation, unless
linked with the country's opencast activities under a separate and
independent Coal Corporation, the Scottish miners conference heard yesterday
at Inverness.
Mr George Bolton, NUM area president, told delegates that a 'dire
consequence' of the general election victory was the government's
determination 'to ram through what they have called the ultimate
privatisation, that of coal'.
His call for a 'Scottish Coal Corporation, not a company' was unanimously
endorsed by the conference. It follows the union's submission to Mr Tim
Eggar, energy minister, stating that under any privatisation programme
Scotland's coal assets should be sold off separately and intact.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, was rebuked for a 'decade of inactivity'
at the negotiating table.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for survival by the UK's two naval dockyards took a new turn
yesterday.
Babcock Thorn, manager of Rosyth dockyard in Fife, announced plans for a
substantially cheaper facility for refitting Trident submarines there than
that proposed by the Ministry of Defence. The ministry scheme would cost
more than Pounds 500m, but the company said it could do the job for Pounds
267m, largely by omitting a covered dockyard proposed by the MoD.
Babcock Thorn, a joint venture between Babcock and Thorn EMI, also proposed
that the two yards, Rosyth and Devonport in Devon, which have been managed
by private-sector operators since 1987, be brought under a single management
structure. It said the yards should specialise, with Rosyth concentrating on
submarines and Devonport on surface ships.
The MoD is reviewing the Navy's requirements for dockyards in the light of
the reduced refitting programme as fleet numbers are cut.

staff equivalent to a 4 per cent annual increase. The sum will not be
consolidated in pay.
The move follows a three-year agreement in which staff received additions to
pay proportionate to rises in the cost of living.
Unions at Anglia were meeting last night to decide their attitude to the
offer and a secret ballot is likely.
Mr David McCall, the Anglia chief executive, declined to comment last night
while negotiations are continuing.
In addition to the pay freeze changes are also being made to overtime
payments at the television station.
Anglia staff have also been warned that 300 production jobs in Norwich are
dependent on the company's winning commissions from the the ITV network.
Under the new commercial television regime that begins in the autumn, all
the ITV companies and independent producers will be free to bid for
programme commissions.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Companies restrict business travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES ARE encour-aging employees to travel by road and rail rather than
air in response to the recession, according to a report published yesterday.
The amount spent on rail travel rose by two thirds to Pounds 2bn last year
compared with 1989. Spending on air travel fell 21 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn
over the same period, according to the report by American Express on travel
and entertainment.
The fall in spending on air travel did not necessarily reflect a fall in
passenger numbers. 'People are also being encouraged to change to
lower-class seats,' said Mr Jim Jamison, vice-president of travel management
services at American Express.
The report also noted a fall of 14 per cent in spending on hotels. That was
partly made up for by a rise in spending on fuel.
The total amount spent on travel and entertainment fell from about Pounds
20bn in 1989 to more than Pounds 18bn last year. Some 37 per cent was
incurred on overseas trips.
The fall was partly a result of declining employment, said Mr Donald
Osborne, the report's author. Those companies which have survived over the
past two years saw spending rise 4 per cent. Retail prices rose 14.2 per
cent over the same period.
Business travel and entertainment accounted for 6.6 per cent of total
business costs last year, and amounted to about Pounds 1,000 per employee.
Four out of five businesses expected spending to increase parallel or faster
than - revenues.
The report also said the number of women business travellers had risen to 17
per cent of the total last year from 11 per cent in 1989. Many hotels were
now concentrating on providing more convenient facilities for women
travellers as numbers increased.
In spite of the sums spent, almost half the 407 companies questioned did not
have a written travel policy. A total of 44 per cent of companies said they
had no arrangements for securing corporate discounts.
Three quarters of companies had recently taken steps to control spending on
travel and entertainment. But almost a third said they were not yet
satisfied with their efforts to control this spending.

The Shambles, built in the 13th century as the city's butchery centre, is
set to lose its last butcher's shop, Chris Tighe writes.
Dewhurst has earmarked its branch in the street for closure as part of a
national programme to cut its outlets from 1,000 to 400. One of the
best-preserved medieval streets in Europe, the Shambles was formerly called
the Fleshammels, meaning meat counters.
It has 47 shops, most of which were once butcher's. Dewhurst said: 'The
Shambles really is a tourist haunt now. It's not the ideal trading
environment for a butcher's' An increase in supermarkets in and around York
has also curbed trade.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Dealer loses plea on sentence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW KIMMINS, the jailed head of the failed Blade Group of futures and
equities dealers, yesterday lost an appeal against his 30-month prison
sentence for fraudulent trading.
Mr Kimmins, 33, had sought a reduction in his jail term. But Mr Justice
Simon Brown, sitting in the Court of Appeal with the Lord Chief Justice,
Lord Taylor, and Mr Justice Roch, said the sentence already fully reflected
the mitigation in the case.
Mr Kimmins, of Henley-on-Thames, was jailed on March 5 after admitting two
counts of fraudulent trading between 1986 and 1988.
He was alleged to have 'recklessly' carried on the activities of his Blade
Securities and Blade Investment companies when he knew they could not
survive without outside help. The net loss to investors was put at Pounds
1.6m.
His counsel, Mr Philip Singer, said yesterday that lax accounting and bad
investment advice had contributed to the group's failure. Mr Kimmins had not
sought to enrich himself at the expense of investors.
Mr Justice Simon Brown said the court accepted it was not 'acquisitive
dishonesty'.

</HEADLINE>

   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceutical group, yesterday launched a wide-ranging
charitable programme called Positive Action 'to help meet the global
challenge of HIV and Aids'.
The programme's start-up costs will be about Pounds 1m, but Mr James
Cochrane, Wellcome's European operations director, said the company's
commitment was open-ended. Total spending on Positive Action by Wellcome's
businesses around the world might run into tens of millions of pounds.
Sales of the company's best-selling Aids drug Retrovir (AZT) are expected to
exceed Pounds 200m this year.
Positive Action has four main initiatives: support for Aids education and
care in the community; action to prevent HIV infection and care for Aids
patients in developing countries; improved services for children affected by
Aids; and developing policies concerning the disease in the workplace.
Wherever possible, Wellcome will join forces with existing organisations.
For example, its partner in the developing countries initiative is the
Population Council, based in New York, which has considerable experience of
community-based health work in Africa.
'We are firmly committed to a response to HIV and Aids which goes beyond
producing effective medicines,' Mr Cochrane said. 'Positive Action brings
together the crucial elements of education, care and community support which
need to be combined on a global basis if we are to minimise the potentially
devastating consequences of the pandemic.'
Wellcome executives concede that the company's critics, who have attacked it
for making excessive profits from Aids, might see Positive Action as a
grandiose public-relations initiative. 'But it's not,' insisted one. 'To the
cynics I would say: 'Wait and see. Maybe we will convince you over time'.'
The Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading Aids support group, welcomed the
announcement. Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive, said: 'It will go a long
way to reversing the very severe criticism Wellcome has come up against in
the past.'
The company said the announcement was unconnected with next month's planned
share offer.

FT  23 JUN 92 / MP to accuse Lloyd's chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER, ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR MP will today step up political pressure on Mr David Coleridge and
other senior figures at Lloyd's of London on the eve of the insurance
market's annual general meeting.
Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, will use an early-day motion to charge that Mr
Coleridge and other members of the Lloyd's Council are running syndicates
that have benefited substantially from the reinsurance spiral - in which
syndicates and London market companies re-insure each other's exposure to
catastrophe losses.
Several thousand outside Names - the individuals whose assets support
underwriting at the insurance market - have suffered heavy losses as a
result of their membership of spiral syndicates in the 1989 year. Losses
amount to Pounds 2bn, the biggest deficit ever recorded by the market.
In his motion, Mr Hain will say that that underlines the need for a
government inquiry into the management of Lloyd's. An inquiry by Lloyd's
into earlier allegations made in parliament that market insiders were
benefiting at the expense of outside Names is due to report to the council
next week.
Separately, Lloyd's said yesterday it would convene an extraordinary general
meeting next month, after two separate requisitions from rival groups of
Names. One group of Names was critical, the other supportive of the Lloyd's
Council, the market's governing body.
The meeting will be held on July 24 at Lloyd's. A total of 110 dissident
Names are aiming to focus attention on what they call the 'disastrous state
of Lloyd's regulation' and are also calling for the council to be replaced.
However, 220 working Names - those who have jobs with agencies and brokers
on the market - presented a separate petition, reaffirming their confidence
in the market's governing council.
Mr Richard Astor, a legal adviser to the dissident outside Names, said that
the EGM would be the biggest since 1982. 'Hopefully the membership will tear
the place apart. If it doesn't it is not a good result,' said Mr Astor. The
meeting would serve as a 'creative brainstorm'.
Mr Claude Gurney, an outside Name who has helped organise the EGM, alleged
that Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, 'has lost track with reality
and no longer represents the interests of Names'. Mr Gurney said he has been
in talks to raise capital from merchant banks to bail out the losses of the
most recent years by mortgaging a proportion of future earnings.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Pressure over Maxwell report grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLS FOR the government to publish the report by Imro, the investment
management regulatory organisation, into the supervision of the Maxwell
companies intensified yesterday.
MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners believe that the way the
government is allowing the row over publishing the report to continue while
extracts are selectively leaked jeopardises the work of the special unit set
up to recover pension-fund assets.
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead and one of the MPs leading the
campaign on behalf of the pensioners, has warned the government that it
risks accusations of a 'cover-up' if it continues to allow attention to
focus on what might still remain secret in the report, rather than on the
role of the banks and others.
Pressure has been heightened by a report in the London Evening Standard that
the Imro report says the Bank of England prevented Robert Maxwell purchasing
two British merchant banks in the late 1980s.
The Bank of England declined to comment on the report, saying it could not
discuss its supervisory activities.
The newspaper report said the Bank told Imro Maxwell wanted to purchase
Guiness Peat in 1987 and in 1989 sought to take control of the private
merchant banking group Robert Fraser.
The Bank confirmed its policy would be to require any purchaser of a 15 per
cent stake in a UK bank to pass a 'fit and proper' assessment and Maxwell
never acquired a stake larger than that in any UK bank.
The Financial Times last week received a telephone call from a woman
claiming to have a copy of the report and offering it for sale. Sources in
the Evening Standard said the paper had not bought the Imro report, although
it had heard that an individual had been offering to sell it.
Last night the Securities and Investments Board and Imro were considering a
formal investigation into allegations that the document had been offered for
sale. Only limited numbers were printed and each was numbered.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, yesterday demanded a
government statement in the Commons about publishing the Imro report.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Clinton refines economic policy: Strategy seeks to create
jobs through Dollars 50bn-a-year investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate,
yesterday returned his campaign to policy specifics, in which he excels,
with a detailed reformulation of his economic programme.
Refining the policies he endorsed during the four-month Democratic primary
campaign, Mr Clinton called for an economic strategy that would create jobs
by investing Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27bn) a year in education and
infrastructure, while cutting the federal budget deficit by half over four
years.
Mr Clinton, the Arkansas governor, launched his programme at a meeting of
the US Conference of Mayors in Houston. He emphasised proposals for 'Dollars
20bn a year of hard, federal dollars' to invest in transport and information
technology infrastructure, as well as the creation of urban enterprise zones
 -a policy pressed by Mr Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban
development in the Bush administration - and more community policing.
His programme also calls for 'lifetime learning' with investment in
education all the way from kindergarten to adult retraining, as well as
healthcare reforms embracing the 'play or pay' approach, by which employers
would either have to provide health insurance for their employees or pay a
levy into a state-run health insurance fund.
Mr Clinton still supports shifting the tax burden away from middle-income
families towards the wealthiest taxpayers, but he has weakened his proposal
for a middle-class tax cut, which drew from his principal Democratic
opponent, Mr Paul Tsongas, the charge of pandering for votes.
The Clinton programme would now allow middle-income families either a
children's tax credit or a reduction in their income tax rate - but not
both, as he had previously advocated.
Higher income tax rates for the richest 2 per cent of the population,
coupled with a surtax on millionaires, would raise Dollars 17.8bn of
additional revenue in 1993, the Clinton plan says, rising to Dollars 23bn in
1996.
'I believe that during the 1980s the rich got richer and the middle class
took it on the chin,' Mr Clinton said.
The other main sources of revenue in Mr Clinton's programme are additional
cuts in defence spending totalling Dollars 37.5bn over four years, and
measures to tax foreign subsidiaries operating in the US more heavily by
clamping down on their transfer pricing arrangements with their parent
companies.
Mr Clinton estimates that this could raise an additional Dollars 45bn over
four years.
This measure, along with a plan to discourage companies from moving
manufacturing operations to other countries by no longer allowing them to
defer paying tax on overseas earnings, echoes a package put forward in
Congress by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House of Representatives
ways and means committee.
Shying away from the politically sensitive issue of tackling entitlement
programmes such as social security and Medicare, which are the fastest
growing component of the federal budget, Mr Clinton expects only Dollars
4.4bn of savings from entitlement reforms.
Mr Clinton projects a federal budget deficit still totalling Dollars 141bn
in 1996 if growth remains moderate, compared with an expected deficit of
Dollars 400bn this year - a more modest claim than that of Mr Ross Perot,
the prospective independent candidate, who said he could eliminate the
deficit 'without breaking a sweat'.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Arrests in Exxon kidnap case fail to clear mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE mystery over the abduction of Mr Sidney Reso, president of Exxon's
international division, has deepened, despite the arrest last week of a
former Exxon security guard and his wife in connection with the case.
A team of more than 30 federal, state and local law enforcement officials
followed a trail across the US before charging the couple with the April 29
kidnapping.
Yet police still do not know where Mr Reso is or whether he is alive. The
FBI is searching for a third suspect, on the assumption that at least one
other person is holding Mr Reso.
Some light has been shed on the case by court documents filed in connection
with the arrests in New Jersey early last Friday morning of Mr Arthur Seale
and his wife Irene. The couple were refused bail during a hearing in a
Newark, New Jersey, court yesterday.
Mr Seale, 45, worked on security matters for Exxon until 1987, having served
previously as a policeman in a New Jersey town. The court documents say
Exxon received the first ransom demand from the Seales within a day of Mr
Reso's disappearance, when his car was found abandoned at the bottom of the
driveway to his New Jersey home. The kidnappers then requested that Exxon
set up a cellular telephone so that future messages could be phoned in.
A series of calls and letters continued to arrive in recent weeks, with one
call two weeks ago from a Georgia telephone about 30 miles from Hilton Head,
South Carolina, where the Seales had owned a yacht. Police following the
trail of the Seales went as far as Vail, Colorado, where the Seales lived
for a time after Mr Seale resigned from Exxon.
Last Tuesday, as Mr Reso's wife Patricia made a televised appeal for the
return of her husband, the Seales allegedly used a tape recorded message,
phoned in from a New Jersey phone box, to alert the authorities to a ransom
letter that would be delivered to a local sheriff's office. The letter
demanded millions of dollars of ransom, to be paid in used Dollars 100 bills
and placed in laundry bags.
By Thursday evening, after FBI agents had placed the Seales under
surveillance, more phone calls gave instructions for the ransom. Nearly an
hour after midnight on Friday, the Seales were arrested when they returned
an Oldsmobile sedan to a car hire agency in New Jersey.
The police who arrested the couple found a 1985 directory of the home
addresses of Exxon executives, along with rubber gloves and laundry bags.
The arrests mark the first break in the long-running case, but the FBI says
the Seales, although questioned at the weekend, have refused to speak about
Mr Reso's whereabouts.
The FBI has meanwhile confirmed that the Seales are the same people who sent
a note in early May claiming to be members of an ecological extremist group
called the Rainbow Warriors.
But they doubt that the Seales have any ecological affiliation.
The Exxon case, according to Mr Joe Rosetti of Kroll Associates, private
investigators, 'looks like a classic, almost textbook, kidnapping of the
kind you normally see in South America'. Exxon is declining to comment.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Gutsy governor drops the financial gimmicks / Profile of the
independent policies of Connecticut's Lowell Weicker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE is being called the 'gutsiest governor in America' and a precursor and
political role model for Mr Ross Perot's independent bid for the US
presidency.
Mr Lowell Weicker, the subject of these eulogies, is the governor of
Connecticut, a small New England state not normally associated with the
political cutting edge.
Yet Connecticut anticipated the nation's current distaste for mainstream
party politics in 1990 when it elected Mr Weicker on an independent ticket -
making him one of only a handful of politicians this century to have won
state governorships without major party backing.
Mr Weicker kept Connecticut at the forefront of political consciousness by a
long battle with the Democrat-controlled legislature which eventually pushed
through the state's first income tax.
Locally, the move was extremely unpopular. Connecticut, a state of leafy
suburbs boasting one of the highest per capita incomes in the US, prided
itself on being among the few remaining states without a tax on income.
Mr Weicker, accused of breaking election promises, was spat on and hung in
effigy before a crowd 40,000.
Nationally, however, the tax tended to be viewed far more sympathetically:
as a rare example of a politician prepared to put his neck on the block by
taking tough action in a fiscal crisis. Time magazine labelled him the
'gutsiest governor' while he recently won an award - named after President
John F. Kennedy - for political courage.
Such is Mr Weicker's national reputation that there have even been rumours
he could emerge as Mr Perot's vice-presidential running mate. The governor,
however, insists there is absolutely no possibility of him quitting
Connecticut to stand on anybody's presidential ticket.
Aged 61, an imposing 6ft 6in tall, and a descendant of the family which
founded the Squibb pharmaceuticals group, Mr Weicker made a name as an
independent-minded Republican liberal in 1973 when he served on the Senate
committee investigating the Watergate scandal and aggressively grilled
President Nixon's White House staff.
His term as governor underlines some of the advantages and drawbacks of
independent candidates. Mr Weicker contends he only managed to get the
income tax bill into law because he was an outsider. 'Neither party was
going to lay claim to being the father of the tax,' he says.
But independent candidates offering sweeping change can also generate
unrealistic expectations of painless problem-solving, as the row over the
Connecticut tax demonstrates.
During the gubernatorial campaign Mr Weicker did not explicitly rule out an
income tax, but he did say such a levy would be like 'pouring gasoline on
the fire' of recession, and promised no new taxes if the state produced no
new fiscal surprises.
Defending himself against accusations of lying, he points out that by the
time he took office, Connecticut faced a fiscal deficit of Dollars 1bn on an
Dollars 8bn budget - the highest percentage shortfall of any state in the
union.
The income tax has been accompanied by a thorough reform of the state's tax
structure, including a reduction in punitive business rates which were
driving companies away.
However, the governor insists he never set out to be quite such a
thorough-going reformer. He settled on the income tax after three weeks of
seeking alternatives which did not work. He was not prepared to go along
with the 'the accounting gimmicks, smoke and mirrors, crooked Ouija boards
and other apparatus of deception that had led to our fiscal crisis. We
resolved government would tell the truth to the people and attempt to fix
the problems for the long term rather than for the next election.'
The budget crisis has now eased following spending cuts and a shake-up of
the civil service.
His top concerns now include reviving the inner cores of cities like
Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven, islands of minority deprivation in
Connecticut's sea of affluence; and attracting business to an economy hit
hard by recession and US defence cuts. The state is putting together Dollars
200m (Pounds 108.1m) of its own funds, together with Dollars 1bn from the
private sector, to ease a credit crunch.
All this is improving Mr Weicker's local popularity. The governor puts it
down to the fact that 'we faced up to reality. The state of Connecticut was
exactly like the United States (after) 10 years of Reaganomics which said
you can have it all and you don't have to pay for it. In essence, what the
state of Connecticut - not just its government, but a group in the
legislature, people in the street - said was: 'we know there's no such thing
as a free lunch'.
'Whatever the problem is, apply realistic answers, not political answers,
and the politics will take care of itself.'
Easily said, but the test of this benign view will only come this autumn,
when Connecticut's somewhat nervous legislators face re-election.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Supreme court refuses Citibank appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US supreme court yesterday refused to overturn a ruling that US banks
can be held responsible for deposits in their foreign branches, even when
those deposits are frozen by a foreign government, writes George Graham.
The court refused to hear an appeal by Citibank, the New York banking group,
against an appeal court ruling that it must repay with interest a Dollars 2m
(Pounds 1.08m) deposit made in Manila in 1983 by the Singapore branch of
Wells Fargo Bank, even though the Philippine government had frozen the
deposits of all foreign banks.
Citibank's appeal had been backed by the Bush administration, which argued
in a submission to the supreme court that the appeal court decision would
create 'new and unforeseeable liabilities' for US banks 'arising from the
unpredictable actions of foreign governments'. Mr Kenneth Starr, the
solicitor general, argued that US banks should be held liable in such cases
only if the two parties had specifically agreed in advance that the home
office should bear responsibility.
Citibank said yesterday it would be discussing with bank regulatory agencies
whether legislative or regulatory changes might be needed to deal with the
consequences of the decision. It would also be discussing with other
international banks the possibility of expanding deposit documentation to
cover the issue of head office liability.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VETERAN Chinese leader Li Xiannan has died in Beijing at the age of 83. Li
was president for a five-year term from 1983, and is the first of China's
eight 'revolutionary elders' to die.
His death was announced yesterday by the official Xinhua news agency. He had
been in poor health for some time. In March illness kept him from the annual
meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a largely
powerless body, of which he was chairman.
Li was one of the first Chinese leaders to appear on national television
after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in June 1989, to defend
the army's handling of 'the turmoil'.
A self-taught economist who favoured central planning, he supported China's
modernisation process after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution but became
increasingly concerned about the economic liberalism of the reformers.
Li championed a more orthodox economic approach in the traditional Marxist
mould, identifying himself with the leftist economic policies of the
post-Mao period which are now under official criticism. His death removes
another obstacle to the reform process favoured by the most powerful
revolutionary elder, Deng Xiaoping.
Born in 1909 to a peasant family in Hubei province, Li worked as a
carpenter, joining the communist party at the age of 22. A veteran of the
Long March, he became governor of his native province after the Communist
victory, moving to Beijing where he became finance minister and a member of
the politburo.
Of all China's senior politicians he was alone in weathering the political
storms that have afflicted China since 1949, surviving even the Cultural
Revolution as a supporter of Premier Zhou Enlai when almost all Zhou's
colleagues were purged.
After that, Li played an important role in arresting the Gang of Four in
1976, among them Mao's widow Jiang Qing.
In the largely ceremonial post of president, Li travelled the world, and in
Beijing played host to national leaders, among them the Queen and Mr Ronald
Reagan.

FINAL opinion polls for today's Israeli general election were unanimous

However they indicated a stalemate once support for small parties allied to
the big two were taken into account, reinforcing widespread speculation that
a Labour-Likud coalition is likely.
Labour, led by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a former prime minister, is desperate to
overturn 15 years of Likud supremacy, replacing the uncompromising ideology
of its rival with a more pragmatic approach which it promises will produce
early progress in Middle East peace negotiations and restore frayed
relationships with the US.
Likud, under Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the 76-year-old prime minister, has been on
the defensive throughout the campaign, internally divided and often giving
the appearance of a political force past its prime.
Three election-eve polls gave Labour a lead of between nine and 14 seats
over Likud in the 120-seat Knesset. Such a gap would represent a big
breakthrough for Labour, given the marginal swings usually seen in Israeli
elections. It would give Mr Rabin the whip-hand in the inevitable coalition
bargaining that would start tomorrow.
But similar polls in previous elections turned out to be wrong. A fourth
poll yesterday, based on the widest sample, put the Labour lead at only two
seats. Two of the polls also predicted Likud would be able to muster a
narrow majority along with small right-wing and religious parties.
Labour has focused on Mr Rabin's tough image in its attempt to woo
disaffected Likud supporters, who are thought to make up a large portion of
the 20 per cent undecided voters.
In its final television broadcasts, the party ran clips from 1976 of
Menachem Begin, the great Likud hero and then leader of the opposition,
warmly praising Mr Rabin, then prime minister, for ordering the successful
commando rescue of a hijacked airliner at Entebbe airport in Uganda.
A key to the result may lie in the 500,000 first-time voters, more than half
of whom are recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and in the
390,000 Arab voters.
To succeed, Labour needs to win heavily among the former, and either a big
direct vote from Arabs or a strong result for the three Arab-based parties
which would sup-port a Labour-led government.
Altogether 25 parties are standing, encouraged to do so by the system of
proportional representation in which there are no local constituencies and
seats are distributed according to the proportion of national votes.
However, this year the minimum needed to enter the Knesset has been raised
from 1 per cent of votes cast to 1.5 per cent.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Algerian subsidy removal cuts import bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A WEEKEND decision by Algeria to remove subsidies from foodstuffs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with the exception of bread, semolina and milk, for which subsidies have
been halved - is expected to save the country Dollars 500m (Pounds 270m)
worth of imports or a quarter of its total foreign food bill in a full year
as consumption patterns are changed. Food imports have accounted for a
quarter of all Algerian imports. This year's savings are expected to amount
to around Dollars 150m.
The decision by the government of Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali removes a big hurdle
in discussions with the International Monetary Fund, with which Algeria is
negotiating its third standby credit since 1989.
It will also comfort western creditors, in particular Italy and Japan, which
have encouraged lenders to refinance Algerian state or commercial bank debt
as a gesture of support for reforms aimed at liberalising the country's
economy.
The move will halve the cost of food subsidies, which would have amounted to
AD52bn (Pounds 1.3bn) this year. The 7.4m poorest Algerians, out of a
population of 25m, will be spared the worst, as a safety net, which by all
accounts is working reasonably well, introduced welfare payments to them
three months ago.
The liberalisation will end the large black market in commodities such as
sugar, coffee and dairy products conducted with Morocco and Tunisia, where
prices on such products have been much higher than in Algeria for years.

<TEXT>
UN AND Iraqi delegates yesterday reached tentative agreement on a limited
resumptions of Iraqi oil exports solely for humanitarian purposes after six
months of protracted negotiations.
The accord would permit Iraq to export about Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil over
a six-months' period, Mr Giandomenico Picco, the United Nations
undersecretary and chief negotiator told reporters.
'I think that almost all the technical issues have been cleared up,' he
said. He did not disclose technical details or conditions in the settlement,
which has to be approved by the UN Security Council and the Iraqi
government.
A full economic embargo imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990 bars any oil sales not specifically authorised by the UN
Security Council.
If accepted, the pact would represent a significant concession by the
Iraqis, who have so far rejected any agreement that would impose limits and
conditions on their oil exports.

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL treaty outlawing chemical weapons looks virtually certain
to be completed this summer, after negotiations lasting more than 20 years.
Mr Adolf von Wagner of Germany, current chairman of the ad hoc committee on
chemical weapons of the United Nations Disarmament Conference, yesterday
presented the committee with what he expects to be the final treaty draft.
If all goes according to plan, the treaty will be endorsed by governments
within the next seven weeks and approved by the UN General Assembly in New
York this autumn before a signing ceremony in Paris early next year.
The chemical weapons convention, the most ambitious multilateral disarmament
accord ever attempted, will ban the development, production, stockpiling and
use of toxic arms and require destruction of all stockpiles and production
facilities within ten years of the treaty coming into force.
The chemical weapons ban will be policed by an international inspectorate,
to be based in The Hague, with wide-ranging and intrusive powers to enter
and search not only highly sensitive military installations, but also
civilian chemical plants making chemicals for peaceful uses such as
fertilisers that could be diverted for weapons production.
The negotiations in the 39-member disarmament conference have been slowed by
the difficulties of balancing the need for rigorous checks to beat cheating
with countries' desire to protect military and commercial secrets. The US
last year backed off its own proposal in 1984 for inspections 'anywhere,
anytime'.
This followed objections from the Pentagon that open access would allow
countries to snoop around military establishments developing, say, Stealth
bomber technology.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA was yesterday dragged further into strife with other former Soviet
republics, as conflicts round the edges of what had been a monolithic Soviet
Union intensified.
Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president, said his parliament must 'declare
war' on Russia, which he accused of directing the 14th Russian Army against
Moldovan forces in the breakaway TransDnestr 'republic'.
In Bendery, which twice changed hands between Moldovan and TransDnestr
forces over the weekend, TransDnestr guards still commanded the centre of
the town. Gunfire stopped last night after a ceasefire was reached. The
mayor said the truce was brokered by General Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian
vice-president.
Interfax news agency reported earlier that tanks and armoured vehicles were
being moved up to Bendery from Moldovan bases, and that MiG-29 fighter
aircraft which had been handed over to the Moldovans when the Soviet
military pulled out were being readied for bombing raids on the breakaway
region.
Meanwhile, leaders of the South Ossetian region being besieged by the
military forces of Georgia, of which it is a part, said their only salvation
was in union with Russia.
Russia's parliamentarians view such a request sympathetically, but it would
put Georgia in direct conflict with Russia.
The South Ossetian leaders, talking to journalists in Vladikavkaz, the
Caucasus city which is the capital of North Ossetia - an autonomous republic
within Russia - said all possibility of a compromise with Georgia was over.
Mr Alan Chachiyev, deputy speaker of the South Ossetian parliament, said:
'The only chance we see is to join with North Ossetia in the Russian
Federation.'
Mr Akhsardek Galazov, the South Ossetian parliament's leader, said if Russia
did not defend his people, volunteers would gather in North Ossetia and go
to fight the Georgians - 'and who knows where that will end?'
At stake in these conflicts is the future allegiance of Russian, or
pro-Russian, minorities in regions under attack by forces of the countries
in which they live.
If Russia takes up arms in their defence - as both Mr Snegur and Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, have accused it of doing already - it
opens the door for a host of other such actions, from the Baltics to Central
Asia.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday confirmed vice-president Rutskoi
as the man in charge of these conflict areas, an apparent sign of
presidential approval of Gen Rutskoi's uncompromising defence of the
TransDnestrians and South Ossetians at the weekend, and of his promise to
assist them with Russian arms.
However, Gen Rutskoi's statements were roundly condemned by Mr Shevardnadze
and Mr Snegur yesterday as a 'declaration of war'.
Within Russia, the 'war party' seems to be gaining ground: Mr Sergei
Filatov, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament, yesterday laid total
responsibility for the violence at the doors of the Georgian and Moldovan
presidents, and said that Russia should and would protect its army, its kith
and kin, and the peoples who wished to be allied to it.
The issue has become critical just as Mr Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
Ukrainian president, prepare for a session of talks today in the Black Sea
town of Dagomys.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank and the Economics Ministry yesterday issued cautiously
optimistic forecasts for growth in the second half of the year, in spite of
the uncertain outlook for exports in the world market.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, forecast overall growth
of gross national product, for the united Germany, of between 2.0 and 2.5
per cent - up from earlier forecasts of just 2.0 per cent growth.
'I do not see any sign of slipping back into recession,' he said in a speech
to the German-Greek chamber of commerce in Athens. But he expressed
continuing concern over the rate of inflation, still 'well over 4 per cent',
and insisted that the time had not come for 'an all-clear signal on the
monetary policy front'.
In Bonn, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, also predicted a
'gradual improvement' in growth prospects for the west German economy in the
rest of the year. 'The German economy is proving itself robust, in spite of
the unstable international environment,' Mr Mollemann said in a commentary
on the monthly report of his ministry.
Growth of GNP in western Germany in the first quarter reached a real 3.1 per
cent compared with the same quarter of 1991, while gross domestic product -
excluding the earnings of workers commuting from eastern Germany - was up by
just 1.8 per cent.
The increasingly confused debate in Germany over the future of the European
Fighter Aircraft was thrown into fresh turbulence yesterday when it was
agreed to postpone a decision by one week.
The move was reported to have been made at the request of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, under pressure from his fellow-leaders in Britain, Italy and Spain to
keep a German foothold in the project.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Moscow signals retreat on credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, yesterday appeared to signal a
further retreat by the government in the face of industrial pressure for
credits to alleviate its vast debt problem.
Mr Gaidar, whose new title has not yet been confirmed by the parliament, was
quoted by Reuters news agency as saying that Rbs500bn would be granted over
six months to help enterprises cope with a Rbs2trillion debt.
This would appear to increase by Rbs300bn the Rbs200bn aid promised just
before the Congress of People's Deputies in April, but not yet disbursed.
There are no details on the interest rates at which the credits would be
offered, nor to whom.
Mr Gaidar was quoted as saying that 'there is reason to believe that they
(the credits) will not provoke hyperinflation or seriously worsen the
financial situation'.
However, the move fitted the recent drift of the government away from
radical reform to a much closer accommodation with the industrial lobby, on
which it now relies for its support. The industrial lobby, in turn, is
naming as its price more credits and controlled energy prices.
The move also comes as the International Monetary Fund team completes talks
with government ministers and officials, with no sign of an accord on the
government programme which would release the funds of Dollars 24bn. Figures
released showed that Russian industrial output was down 13.2 per cent in the
first five months of 1992.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Record exports reduce UK trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD exports last month helped to cut Pounds 500m off Britain's visible
trade deficit in May, bringing the gap between exports and imports to the
lowest level so far this year.
But the news failed to help sterling, which closed at the bottom of the
European exchange rate mechanism and little changed against the D-Mark and
the dollar in London and New York last night. The better-than-expected trade
figures also gave no support to equities, which finished sharply lower, as
the City reasoned that the reduced deficit represented little more than a
return to normal after a poor trade performance in April.
The Central Statistical Office reported that the UK's visible trade deficit
fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 845m in May from Pounds 1.36bn in April
after a 4 per cent jump in exports to Pounds 9.17bn last month and a 1.5 per
cent drop in imports to Pounds 10bn.
It tentatively estimated the UK's surplus from invisible trade such as
banking, insurance and tourism was Pounds 200m in May and April, implying a
sharp fall in the current account deficit to Pounds 645m last month from
Pounds 1.16bn in April.
However, the improvements in the trade and current account figures largely
reflected an increase in oil exports and a drop in imports of aircraft in
May. After stripping out such items, last month's trade performance was
broadly in line with that in the nine months to the end of March. While
exports last month were a record in terms of value and volume, imports also
reached a new high in May in volume terms.
The figures were welcomed by the Treasury, which said that May's strong
exports were encouraging while the high level of imports was a sign that the
economy was recovering.
But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, said that figures for the
past year showing imports rising faster than exports were a sign that 'the
much promised post-election recovery has simply not materialised'.

FT  23 JUN 92 / EC pact may trigger air fares cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIRLINES WILL come under growing pressure to cut air fares within Europe
after transport ministers last night agreed on a radical 'open skies'
programme which removes government restrictions on air travel within the
Community.
Under the agreement, airlines will be allowed to set air fares as they wish
from next year, injecting more competition into the market as all EC
airlines gain access to routes dominated by national flag carriers.
Earlier, more modest, packages, introduced in 1987 and 1990, failed to cut
air fares. The European Commission hopes this 'Third Aviation Package' will
succeed where the others failed.
EC Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert predicted last night: 'This
package should now lead to lower air fares.'
The UK government said last night that the deal, which secured 'the vast
majority' of what it was seeking, would bring 'massive' opportunities for
British airlines. It would bring about 'significant and noticeable' changes
and after ten years of negotiation, it was 'a great achievement'.
Transport Secretary John MacGregor said: 'This final clincher after two
earlier interim air packages represents a real opening up of the European
skies to competition.'
On the likely effect on prices, Mr MacGregor said: 'Our agreement has put in
place all the right mechanisms. The market will do the rest.'
Mr John Parr, director general of the Air Transport Users' Committee, warned
that passengers might have to wait for any big fare reductions. 'You only
have to look at the financial results of airlines to see that they cannot
afford to cut fares,' he said.
Virgin Atlantic chairman Richard Branson said that he saw the agreement
eventually leading to his airline being able to set up operations in France,
Italy and Germany to 'provide the sort of low long-haul fares that Britons
enjoy but Europeans don't'. For example, two routes he would be interested
in operating would be Frankfurt to Orlando, Florida, and Paris to Tokyo.
Final agreement was delayed until last-minute differences over the pace of
improving market access were sorted out. France and the southern EC member
states wanted a longer transition period while the air transport liberals -
the UK, Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark - wanted a faster move to a free
market.
The freedom to set air tariffs will be limited by safeguards against
'predatory pricing', by which large carriers take temporary losses through
unrealistic price cuts designed to force out smaller competitors.
Market access will include, from next year, the right of EC-registered
airlines to so-called 'seventh freedom' and what are known as 'consecutive
cabotage' flights within the Community.
Seventh freedom rights will, for example, allow British Airways to compete
on a route between two countries which begins in, say, Paris and ends in
Berlin. At present they are obliged to start or end at a British airport.
'Consecutive cabotage' means BA could offer services within one country, for
instance between Paris and Marseilles or Berlin and Frankfurt, if the flight
originated in the UK.
Ministers agreed on a transition period of four years and three months for
untramelled cabotage - the right to ply any other member state's internal
routes without conditions.
A final element in the third package sets common air licensing rules -
governing technical fitness and capital adequacy - intended to facilitate
new airlines entering the industry. Current national licensing systems tend
to reinforce national monopolies.
The Commission's highly contested proposals to loosen flag carriers'
stranglehold on landing and take-off slots at hub airports are being kept
held out of the package for later negotiation.

JAPANESE shares plunged yesterday as investors lost faith in the
government's willingness to act quickly to stimulate the country's flagging
economy.
The Nikkei average of leading stocks fell 598.65 to 15,921.22, the first
time it has finished below 16,000 since October 1986.
The fall added to nervousness in London over the sluggishness of the main
world economies, and the FT-SE index closed almost 35 points down at
2,550.3. In New York, however, leading US stocks rebounded to close with
modest losses after declining more than 30 points at one stage on the back
of the depressed markets in Japan and Britain. The Dow Jones industrial
average ended off 4.55 at 3,280.80.
In Tokyo today, stocks weakened further in hesitant early trading and the
Nikkei had fallen by nearly 50 points.
Yesterday, when the bear market plumbed new depths, brokers were unable to
forecast how much further stocks might fall. Mr Jason James, an analyst at
James Capel, the UK-based securities company, said: 'There are chances that
the 15,000 level for the Nikkei will hold. But, on the other hand, there
really isn't a reason why it should.'
Mr Tatsuhiko Kusuzawa, a senior managing director at Yamaichi Securities,
said: 'The private sector cannot do anything. Everything now depends on what
kind of fiscal and monetary boost the authorities can implement.'
The government gave no clear indication of its plans, undermining the
impression given last Friday that ruling Liberal Democratic party officials
were forcing the cautious Ministry of Finance into advancing plans for
increased government spending.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said at a press conference marking
the end of a session of the Diet that the economy was now the Japanese
people's main concern. However, he made no specific commitments to take
action to stimulate the economy.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, ruled out action to resuscitate the
stock market through immediate measures, such as increases in public works
spending. But behind the scenes LDP officials are lobbying with increasing
intensity for an extra spending package of up to Y5,000bn (Pounds 21bn) to
Y8,000bn.
The stock market's fall below 16,000 has cut into the value of securities
holdings of big financial institutions, including banks and life assurance
companies. Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, a general manager at Daiwa Securities, the
stockbroker, estimated that the Nikkei's drop would lead to some banks
having difficulty in meeting international standards of capital adequacy set
by the Bank for International Settlements.

FT  23 JUN 92 / De Klerk halts trip as ANC calls crisis talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN president FW de Klerk decided yesterday to cut short a visit
to Spain and return home in time to chair a cabinet meeting tomorrow on the
country's political turmoil.
His change of plan follows a decision by the African National Congress -
which on Sunday cut off bilateral talks with the government - to convene an
emergency national executive committee meeting today.
The ANC, which accused Mr de Klerk of insensitivity in leaving the country
at this time, will discuss its response to last week's massacre of 42 people
at Boipatong, near Johannesburg.
It blames the attack on the Zulu-based Inkatha movement, and is incensed
that three more people were killed on Saturday by police who opened fire on
a crowd soon after Mr de Klerk aborted a visit to the township.
The ANC, is expected either to suspend temporarily its participation in the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) - the constitutional
negotiating forum made up of 19 political parties - or to make further
participation dependent on the government's response to the massacre.
South African financial markets reacted nervously yesterday to the
deteriorating political mood. Worst affected was the financial rand, the
investment currency for foreigners, which fell by 6.7 per cent from Friday's
close to finish at R3.84 to the dollar. The discount to the commercial rand
widened to 27 per cent, the highest this year.
On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the overall index closed at 3,639, down
42 points.
This is the worst crisis in South Africa's negotiation process since the
unbanning of the ANC in February 1990. But there were hints from both sides
that they may be seeking to pull back from the brink. Mr Tertius Delport,
the government's spokesman on Codesa, said it would be a 'tragedy' if the
ANC was to pull out of the forum.
Mr Delport said an invitation to the ANC by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister
and acting president in Mr de Klerk's absence, to join the government in
talks was an effort to move forward.
Professor Kadar Asmal, a member of the ANC executive, said the organisation
was 'firmly committed' to negotiations, but added the way out of the impasse
was to move quickly to an interim government.
Britain urged all sides to return to the negotiating table. Mr John Major,
the prime minister, was said to be 'very distressed' at the events.

FT  23 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker sector upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUGGESTIONS that Lloyd's brokers and underwriting agencies may be asked to
contribute to Lloyd's Central Fund upset shares in the insurance broking
sector.
Lloyd's Central Fund was established to pay for claims in the event of
underwriting syndicates being unable to meet their commitments.
There were also hints that directors of some of the broking firms may have
been selling blocks of shares in the sector. The rumours coincided with an
announcement yesterday that Mr JP Marland, a director of Lloyd Thompson, the
wholesale insurance and reinsurance broker, recently sold a block of 200,000
shares in Lloyd Thompson, reducing his stake to 3.63 per cent.
Insurance broking analysts were sceptical of stories that the broking and
underwriting firms may have to put up as much as Pounds 200m, with a figure
of nearer Pounds 50m, split equally between the two groups, said to be more
likely. 'It would mean that the big insurance brokers, such as Sedgwick and
Willis Corroon, would need to put up between Pounds 1m to Pounds 5m, spread
over three years, not really a major hit,' said one broking specialist.
The sector was additionally unsettled by the recent weakness of the dollar.
Lowndes Lambert, scheduled to report preliminary figures on June 30, was
given a severe mauling, albeit in thin trading, and closed 19 lower at 263p,
while Sedgwick dipped 7 to 193p and Willis lost 8 to 224p. Lloyd Thompson
eased 5 to 210p, and Sturge, the underwriting agent, declined 4 to 91p.
Glaxo tumbles
Indications of increased competition for one of its prominent products from
a rival drug already marketed for the past 50 years left Glaxo down 22 at
689p, its lowest level since last October.
The pharmaceuticals arm of Sandoz said a study had concluded that an
injection of its DHE-45 relieved headache pain in nearly half of migraine
patients within 30 minutes, and in most patients within an hour. The drug
has always been used in Europe but not in the US. However, the recent study,
which will be released next week, involved 38 US clinics. The study is
believed to show that the Sandoz drug has many similarities with Glaxo's
potentially massive earner, Imigran, and because it is off patent it would
be significantly cheaper.
Carlton flourish
Media group Carlton Communications entered the FT-SE Index of the 100 most
highly valued companies with a flourish yesterday. It closed 5 up at 632p on
above-average turnover of 3.7m.
The shares reached the 650p level after the general election and have since
held up well against a sliding market. Yesterday's closing price translates
into a shareholder valuation for the company of Pounds 1.248bn, whereas
Pounds 1bn tends to be the minimum capitalisation for Footsie qualification.
Lasmo weakens
Oil group Lasmo suffered from a bearish note by Strauss Turnbull. The stock
was also undermined by stories circulating in the market that the proposed
international public offer of shares in the US downstream interests it
acquired with its takeover of Ultramar would be priced much lower than had
been expected, in light of the failed GPA flotation. Lasmo lost 6 1/2 to
187p.
Business services group Hays held up relatively well against the market
after the company carried out a successful placing. The stock shed a modest
3 to 187p after Hays placed around 19m shares at 182p, through Schroder, and
SG Warburg-owned broker Rowe and Pitman, with 50 institutions to raise
Pounds 34.3m. The company is to use the funds to buy Groupe FRIL, a French
specialist distribution business.
Reuters Holdings failed to hold up in spite of news that it is this week
extending its foreign exchange trade matching system, Dealing 2000-2, to
banks in Germany and Switzerland. The shares were up 8 against the market on
small turnover but crumbled in late trading to close 4 off on balance at
1105p.
Dealers reacted to a press report on Wellcome, which said that the size of
its imminent share flotation would be at the lower end of expectations. The
stock fell 12 to 913p.
Hints that the remnants of a large line of stock placed in the market last
week was still overhanging trading kept British Gas under pressure and the
shares closed 5 1/2 off at 243 1/2 p.
BP dipped 6 to 245p ahead of expected news of substantial job cuts at its US
operations. The proposed sale by Shell Oil of its coal assets, valued at
around Dollars 1bn, failed to sustain Shell Transport shares, which closed 9
down at 495p.
Splitting of the Electricity Package and reinvestment into some of the
individual electricity stocks left the Package down 35 at Pounds 3100.
Troubled jewellery chain Ratners remained active, on turnover of 3.1m, as
the share price lost another penny to 9p.
Storehouse and Sears were the subject of board changes, with the former
easing 2 to 145p and Sears losing 3 to 88p.
The recent departure of its finance director and last week's profits warning
continued to pose problems for Amber Day, the shares dropping 8 to 48p.
Switching between the big supermarket chains benefited Tesco, up a penny at
283p in an active market of 3.1m shares, as J. Sainsbury lost 6 to 462p on
turnover of 2.4m.
The brewing and drinks sector was depressed by fears that economic recovery
had been put off again after some ambiguous UK trade figures. Bass slipped
11 to 602p, Whitbread 'A' 12 to 422p and Guinness 13 to 567p. A bright
exception was Mansfield Brewery, up 15 at 710p, but traders pointed out that
demand from one institution was tending to move an illiquid stock.
Last week's institutional visit to Vosper Thornycroft continued to benefit
the shares, which added 3 at 348p.
'A dead cat bounce' is how one market watcher described a rise in British
Aerospace. The shares firmed 3 to 270p in light trade of 1.8m.
Glynwed International fell 9 to 229p after a leading agency broker advised
caution on the stock due to the continued recession. British Steel shed a
penny to 70p as Smith New Court reiterated its sell recommendation.
Trafalgar House weakened 7 to 107p after US investment house Lehman Brothers
weighed in with a profits downgrading.

FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weakness abroad outweighs a
little Irish comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER firming on Friday following the Irish 'yes' vote on the Maastricht
treaty, markets weakened yesterday after Tokyo's steep overnight decline,
writes Our Markets Staff.
The Irish referendum result had given traders a brief moment of comfort
following the Danish 'no' earlier in the month which seemed to have
effectively derailed hopes for closer economic union.
There was general agreement among analysts yesterday that whatever muted
euphoria had been generated by the Irish referendum result had been
dissipated by the start of trading.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs said he did not expect European bourses
to move decisively higher until the French referendum on Maastricht had been
held. He also pointed out that there was uncertainty over Germany's attitude
towards Maastricht, with the possibility that the German government might
seek to make amendments.
PARIS erased most of Friday's gains as a domestic newspaper poll showed that
only 29 per cent of investors were bullish about the stock market. Weakness
in the Matif, as arbitrageurs covered their positions following the
government's FFr140m bond swap plan announced on Friday, also weighed on
share prices.
The CAC 40 index dropped 28.15 or 1.5 per cent to 1,885.77 in turnover of
FFr2.4bn, of which around FFr421m was generated by a block trade in BSN and
FFr297.5m in Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Dealers said that the block trades were likely to have been executed by an
insurance company in order to realise a profit in one fund, and transfer the
stock to another fund. Lyonnaise fell FFr6 to FFr522 and BSN lost FFr12 to
FFr1,080.
Michelin dropped FFr7.50 to FFr191.50 on rumours, denied by the company,
that it was about to have a FFr12bn rights issue.
FRANKFURT saw the DAX index close just 2.25 lower at 1,770.64 after a 1.36
decline to 704.12 in the FAZ at midsession, and share prices moved little in
the post-bourse. Turnover fell from DM13.9m, inflated by the expiry of
derivatives contracts, to just DM4.4bn.
Volkswagen's drive for volume in the European mass car market, reflected in
a 17.5 per cent market share in the first five months of 1992, was marked by
a small rise in the shares which closed just DM1.60 higher at DM403.70.
Mr Reinhard Fischer, head of European research at Paribas Capital Markets,
observed that VW shares had already produced a 20 per cent gain relative to
the DAX index since the start of 1992. He added that VW's marketing costs
were shooting up, and that Paribas saw earnings on a declining trend over
the next two years.
MILAN rose on dealers' hopes that a government would be formed this week.
However, a further rise in interest rates, reflecting higher bond yields and
the lira's weakness, acted as a brake on the market. The Comit index rose
4.69 to 474.57 in turnover estimated at between L80bn-L90bn after L79.5bn.
Fiat rose L137 or 2.6 per cent to L5,452 as professionals and institutions
bought the stock in anticipation of a stock market rally when the new
government is announced. On the screen market, the state telephone company
Sip remained the most heavily dealt stock, gaining L4 to L1,304 in volume of
3.4m shares.
ZURICH heard that hopes of an economic recovery in the first quarter of 1992
had not been fulfilled, and the SMI index lost 22.4, or 1.2 per cent to
1,846.9.
Roche recovered some early losses after the group said that its Hivid AIDS
drug had received FDA approval for use in combination with Wellcome's
Retrovir. The certificates, which headed the active list, ended SFr40 easier
at SFr3,330 after SFr3,310.
AMSTERDAM declined in sluggish trade, the CBS Tendency index losing 0.20 to
125.20 in turnover of some Fl 400m.
Volmac fell Fl 3.40 or 12.6 per cent to Fl 23.50 with just 18,000 shares
traded: the software group reported disappointing profit figures after the
close on Friday. KLM's weakness continued, down Fl 1.10 to Fl 37.20, on
nervousness that the transatlantic price war may affect earnings.
Profit-taking in Heineken saw the shares off Fl 2.00 at Fl 166.20.
MADRID fell in line with other markets, the general index losing 3.08 to
246.41. Trading in Ercros, the chemicals group, was suspended at Pta177
after the chairman announced his resignation. Its shares have lost 33 per
cent over the last month.
STOCKHOLM eased but a large block trade in the pharmaceutical company,
Astra, accounted for more than half of turnover which climbed from SKr430m
to SKr837m. Astra shares became free of foreign ownership restrictions
yesterday; the A ended SKr1 lower at SKr543 on in SKr547m as the
Affarsvarlden General index fell 4.2 to 924.7.
In COPENHAGEN, the central bank's weekend promise to meet Unibank's
liquidity requirements, following rumours about the bank's financial
soundness, stabilised the share price which closed up DKr2 at DKr158. The
All-Share Index slipped by 1.69 to 316.93, writes Hilary Barnes.
Danisco fell by DKr25 to DKr733 following a report that the company is being
investigated by the EC in connection with allegations of a price cartel in
the European sugar market. Danisco's annual results for 1991-92 are due
today.
TEL AVIV hit a new record, anticipating decisive results from today's
Israeli general elections and contradicting opinion polls which have
projected a deadlock. The blue chip share index rose 2.48 to 137.22 in
turnover of 92.2m shekels.

FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls 3.6
per cent to 68-month low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LOWER futures market prompted arbitrage-related selling, depressing the
Nikkei average by 3.6 per cent to its weakest level for 68 months, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell 598.65 to end at 15,921.22, its lowest close
since October 22, 1986. The index rose to the day's high of 16,649.64 after
the opening on short-covering, but later dropped on a steady flow of
arbitrage-related selling, reaching the day's low of 15,885.79 in the
afternoon. Volume decreased to 230m shares from Friday's 236m.
Worries about economic prospects kept investors from committing funds and,
while small-lot buying by public pension funds was noted, traders said the
amounts were not large enough to counter the arbitrage selling pressure.
Declines overwhelmed advances by 732 to 204, with 151 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks shed 27.09 to 1,240.18, but in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.69 to 968.99.
Sentiment deteriorated as the market fell through the 16,000 psychological
support level. Ms Kathy Matsui at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said that while
there was no panic selling, share prices were spiralling down because of
lack of buying interest.
Mr Jason James at James Capel said institutional investors, looking for
weaker market levels in the near future, were hedging their long positions
by selling in the futures markets. 'The market has broken out of its bottom,
and some chartists are saying it is 'open country' from here,' he added.
Nippon Life, the leading life insurer, said its fund managers were buying in
small lots. However, prospects of an orchestrated move among life insurers
were unlikely, since most of unrealised gains had been already wiped out at
some of the leading insurance groups.
Mr Fumio Hiramoto, manager of Nomura Securities' stock market division, said
the bottom should be around 15,500-15,600, due to a number of technical
resistance lines.
Dealers unloaded short-term speculative holdings. Meiji Milk Products, the
most active issue of the day, fell Y39 to Y991 and Morinaga Milk Industry
plunged Y33 to Y858.
Daikyo, the condominium maker, lost Y75 to an all-time low of Y670. The
stock is now 84 per cent off its peak registered in the early 1980s. Other
real estate-related companies also retreated, Mitsui Fudosan slipping Y10 to
Y827 and Mitsubishi Estate Y45 to Y741.
High-technology issues declined on institutional selling. Hitachi weakened
Y23 to Y760, Fujitsu Y28 to Y602 and Sony Y150 to Y4,010.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 275.69 to 19,000.52 in volume of 13.5m
shares.
Roundup
THE Japanese market woes had a limited effect on equities elsewhere in the
Pacific Basin.
TAIWAN saw its heaviest trade since February, turnover doubling from
TDollars 24.7bn to TDollars 49.2bn as speculative buying pushed the weighted
index up 79.64, or 1.7 per cent, to 4,697.66.
China Development, a recent speculative favourite, led the heavily weighted
financial sector to a gain of 3.6 per cent as it rose TDollars 7.50 to
TDollars 121.50. Food companies were strong because of the appreciation in
the Taiwan dollar, making their raw material imports cheaper.
MANILA was lifted by Friday's Dollars 1 3/4 rise to Dollars 38 1/8 in
Philippine Long Distance Telephone, the composite index adding 25.62 points
at 1,519.54.
SEOUL reached a low for the year as the composite index lost 6.97 to 558.32.
Falls in banks and securities houses spread to other sectors, and sentiment
was also affected by worries about an oversupply of shares after a statement
by South Korean finance vice-minister Lee Soo-yoo that he would consider
allowing the state-run Industrial Bank of Korea to make an initial public
offering.
HONG KONG climbed, although afternoon profit-taking trimmed early gains. The
Hang Seng index closed 32.34 higher at 5,819.94 in turnover down from
HKDollars 3.04bn to HKDollars 2.73bn. Initial gains on the strength of last
Friday's Tokyo and Wall Street performances were more than enough to offset
the weakness in Japan yesterday.
AUSTRALIA edged higher in quiet trade, the All Ordinaries index firming 2.4
to 1,636.3, with investors preoccupied by Tokyo's decline and the initial
public offering of shares in GIO Australia.
The offer will raise up to ADollars 1.2bn, and will employ a constrained
open-pricing mechanism with an application price of ADollars 2.40, and a
final sale price determined by demand.

JOHANNESBURG fell following the ANC's decision to withdraw from negotiations
on power-sharing with the government. But the weakness of the financial
rand, which lost 7.5 per cent earlier in the session before recovering
slightly, helped lift those companies with offshore assets. The overall
index lost 42 to 3,639 and industrials were down 51 at 4,471. The gold index
shed 17 to 1,141. Minorco gained 25 cents to R47.25 and Lonrho added 15
cents to R5.55. De Beers shed R1 to R87.50.

FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo's problems weigh on bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty on Friday lifted European
bourses after their recent weakness, but Tokyo remained beset with problems,
and bore much of the blame for last week's 2.1 per cent fall in local
currency terms in the FT-Actuaries World Index.
Investor sentiment in Tokyo was dented by the release of the tankan, the
Bank of Japan's quarterly business survey, which showed a deterioration of
business confidence among company managers, as well as indications that the
government might have to cut its economic growth forecast for the year to
March 1993.
Nomura International believes the outlook for Japanese equities remains
bleak in the short term. 'Concern about the real estate market following
negative rumours on Daikyo, and bad debt at the banks, is putting severe
pressure on the asset side of the market - which still appears overvalued to
many investors,' the broker says in its weekly report.
Mexico was the worst performer, dropping 8.2 per cent on the week in heavy
trading, weighed down by foreign selling. Mr Federico Laffan of Latin
American Securities says several factors are pulling the market lower: Mr
Ross Perot's rising popularity and his anti-free trade stance; worries,
considered unfounded by Mr Laffan, that Telmex union members might sell
their 3 per cent stake; the government's scaling back of economic growth
forecasts; and a rush of new equity issues.
He points out that investors are overlooking some positive factors: the
government's commitment to low inflation, recent privatisations and debt
reduction; and GDP growth still higher than that of developed countries.
After the recent downward correction, the market is attractively valued, in
his view, while earnings growth remains strong. 'None the less, external
factors are likely to keep the market volatile over the next three to five
months,' he adds.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian natural rubber output
continues to fall

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S production of natural rubber fell by 1 per cent to 391,278 tonnes
in the first quarter of this year, according to the government statistics
department. The fall is part of the continuing trend in Malaysian rubber
production.
Last year, production fell by 3 per cent to 1.25m tonnes as growers,
frustrated by a prolonged period of low prices, switched to more profitable
crops such as palm oil. There are also serious labour shortages on many
plantations.
Traders say there are now serious doubts that the government-projected
production figure for this year of 1.3m tonnes can be met.
In the first quarter of this year, Malaysian rubber exports totalled 351,159
tonnes - an 11 per cent drop on the same period last year.
Malaysian officials expect cocoa production to fall 20 per cent to a
five-year low of 184,000 tonnes this year as a prolonged price slump forces
some growers to abandon the crop, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint):  Match
point for Britain's top-seeded strawberries - The Wimbledon Championships
provide an ideal showcase for the best of the home-grown crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL UK strawberry growers are fans of Wimbledon. It is not so much that they
fancy themselves as potential Navratilovas or McEnroes, nor that they spend
the whole of the last two weeks of June glued to their television screens;
they hardly have time for that. But Wimbledon means strawberries and cream.
The country's best growers compete for the prestige involved in supplying
the championships and the sales of all the rest benefit from the visual
promotion on sports programmes of this delicious summer fruit.
This year is turning out to be an especially good one for strawberries. The
sunny weather through most of May added sweetness to the growing berries and
the rains at the end of the month filled them out. The result is a main UK
crop that is not only earlier than usual but is of exceptional quality, as
anyone who has sampled it (as I have, several times) can verify.
The introduction a few years ago of a Dutch-bred variety, Elsanta, is also
partly responsible for the good fruit. It combines good taste with good
appearance and a shelf life that gives the retailer three days to sell in
the knowledge that the fruit will still be good to eat at least four days
after picking. Needless to say it earns a premium price over other types and
has now been widely adopted in the UK as the main dessert variety.
A previous market leader, Cambridge Favourite, has been relegated to parts
of the pick-your-own trade, where the enthusiastic but amateur expertise of
the pickers may be lower and it is perceived that there is a need for a
tougher variety. Cambridge Favourite is still, however, a major variety,
with a high proportion of those grown going for processing into jam,
yoghurt, confectionery and so on.
But this is just the main crop harvested during mid-summer. As connoisseurs
will be aware English strawberries are now available from April until
November. And the technology that has been imported from all over the world
in order to achieve such a long season in a relatively hostile climate is
quite incredible.
It began in Kent a few years ago when members of a marketing co-operative
realised that a variety of techniques were being used in other countries to
supply the UK out of season. Further investigation persuaded them that these
techniques could be modified to fit UK conditions and they have now been
perfected and adopted by many growers in this country.
The range of techniques involves some measures to advance the ripening of
fruit and some to delay it. Few growers attempt all on the same farm,
preferring to fit their production patterns into a co-operatively organised
and co-ordinated programme.
In some cases, if they have no glass houses, they erect walk-in plastic
tunnels to encourage early strawberries. A secondary method is to cover the
plants, from February onwards, with a thin plastic mulch. This warms the
land and, along with trickle irrigation, increases growth, bringing the
plants to maturity earlier than they would otherwise. It is even possible to
influence the time of ripening by using different colours of plastic, which
permit different amounts of light and heat to affect plants.
Some growers with a selection of land on which to grow strawberries will
choose warm, south-facing slopes, combined perhaps with one of the other
methods mentioned for their early crops, and land kept cool by sea for those
they wish to market later.
Most sophisticated of all is the system of lifting growing strawberry plants
from the land at a crucial stage in their development and putting them into
cold storage to be held for a period in a state of suspended animation. They
are then brought out as required for the marketing programme and replanted.
Eight weeks later they produce a crop.
All these techniques, or variations of them are used in places like Israel,
California and Spain, where long hot summers make strawberry plants fruit
for months and enable growers to produce enormous yields unheard of in the
UK. But because they grow so fast and are required to have an even greater
travelling- and shelf-life in order to reach UK shores, the quality of the
fruit produced in those countries is almost universally inferior to the
British product.
British growers are, in fact, relatively sanguine about such imports of
fresh and very expensive strawberries because they begin by Easter before
domestic fruit is ready and help to prepare committed consumers for the
superior home-grown quality, which follows soon after.
They are less happy about the increasing tonnages of processed strawberries
being imported, mainly from eastern European countries. Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, traditional suppliers of such soft fruit to western Europe,
are consistently able to undercut UK prices because of the availability of
large quantities of cheap seasonal labour for picking.
The European Community has association agreements with these countries
allowing them to export certain quantities of fruit to community markets.
From June 1 this year this trade has been subject to minimum import prices
to stop the suppliers, who are in desperate need of hard currency, from
undermining community producers' returns. The minimum prices are nominally
set at levels that are no lower than EC production costs.
It is early days, of course, but UK growers fear not only that some of the
new minimums are too low but that there is insufficient monitoring of
imports. They believe, in fact, that, as has happened in the past,
considerable tonnages are being transported to what was East Germany where
they mysteriously acquire a new nationality and then move further west to
threaten their markets and prices.
They worry particularly because similar things have happened before. Indeed
the level of imports of processed strawberries from the east has almost
trebled during the past decade and many UK strawberry growers who
specialised in supplying the processing market have been driven out of
business.
Meanwhile over the same period the fresh market has held relatively firm,
helped no doubt by the growers' own ingenuity in extending the season. And
this year, as they contemplate near-record main crops and good prices, the
growers of fresh strawberries are content.
The dairy industry should be feeling modestly confident, too. Even in an
average year sales of fresh cream during the main strawberry eating season
rise by 20 per cent. This year with extra and better strawberries around
they may sell even more.

Some stability returned to ZINC after last week's sharp price declines on
the LME. The cash premium over three-month metal narrowed to Dollars 89.50 a
tonne. This helped three-month metal to hold above Dollars 1,200, although
the likelihood of further inventory increases in the short term will keep
the market under downward pressure, with Dollars 1,180 the objective.
ALUMINIUM continued to weaken, with fund selling and liquidation pushing
prices to a 4 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,259 a tonne during the day.
Support was seen around the lows, but a rise in IPAI production rates for
May and expectations of stock increases will limit the extent of advances,
dealers said. GOLD eased on the London bullion market. Precious metals
remained unaffected by the escalation of violence in South Africa, which has
threatened to upset political reform in the world's largest producer of gold
and platinum. Dealers believe that gold now looks like trading in a range
between Dollars 341 and Dollars 344. London's robusta COFFEE futures closed
with small losses on key positions, but the market continued to lack any
clear trend while news was awaited from this week's talks on a new pact at
the ICO.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market fears further
central bank selling - The main issue worrying delegates to the FT
international conference in Montreux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT central banks would sell off their gold reserves with devastating
effects on the price dominated the first day of the Financial Times World
Gold Conference in Montreux, Switzerland, yesterday. Central banks control
about 30,000 tonnes of gold compared with the 1,782 produced by the world's
mines last year and questions about their attitudes to these reserves were
raised again by the recent sale of 202 tonnes by Belgium.
As Mr Robert Guy, a director of NM Rothschild and Sons, told the conference,
the central banks are 'the most powerful influence at work in the market
today'. But the banks seemed to have no strategic, long-term thinking about
their gold reserves.
He pointed out that the issue was particularly important in Europe where a
European central bank, when it was set up, would hold about 40 per cent of
all official gold reserves.
'Clearly central bank policy toward gold is a sensitive issue but
sensitivity should not be an excuse for continued inaction,' said Mr Guy.
'Lack of clarification and explanation is only serving to undermine the
value of member states' gold reserves.'
He added: 'Members of the European Community might consider two options. One
is to follow the example of the Swiss National Bank and state that they have
no intention of selling their gold'.
Otherwise, Mr Guy suggested, the central banks should take up an idea put
forward by Mr Ricky Hall of the Bank of International Settlements and create
their own European Mutual Gold Fund into which they could put a proportion
of their own gold reserves.
'In the event that individual members needed additional foreign exchange
reserves they could draw down currency up to 75 per cent of their initial
gold subscription. In this way the value of gold reserves could be mobilised
without depressing the market.'
Two of the central bankers present suggested that in desperate times it was
useful to hold some gold reserves. Mr James Cross, general manager of the
South African Reserve Bank's gold and foreign exchange department, pointed
out that gold had proved invaluable when his country faced international
economic sanctions. He said his bank followed a 'lean-into-the-wind' market
strategy, occasionally intervening in the market to buy gold 'without
presuming to influence longer term price trends'.
During 1991 South Africa's gold reserves had increased by 2m troy ounces and
buying continued this year. At the end of May it had 6.8m ounces in its
reserves. 'With South Africa's debt profile improving it is unlikely that
significant additional bullion sales will take place and the policy of the
bank is to increase its gold holdings still further.'
Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said his
country's deposit of 46 tonnes of gold in London last year as collateral for
loans during a short-term liquidity crisis had shocked many of his
countrymen but it had brought home to them the extent of the crisis. He
described how India was attempting to cut gold smuggling by allowing some
official imports. These efforts were already having an impact because in May
India's official gold imports shot up to 10 tonnes compared with less than
half a tonne a month in previous years.
Eventually, India would allow a free flow of gold imports and exports as
part of a policy to liberate its financial markets, but Mr Venkitaramanan
would not indicate when this might happen.
Mr Terry Smeeton, chief manager of the Bank of England's foreign exchange
division, pointed out that European economic unity is likely, for practical
purposes, to reduce the major investment currencies to only three: the
dollar, the yen and the European currencies. Against this background the
relative attractions for central banks and investment managers of having
another string to their bow in the form of a gold portfolio of some type
seemed to be much greater. As for the possible behaviour of the European
central banks in the run up to monetary union, Mr Smeeton said it was
unlikely that any central bank would hand over its gold reserves before the
end of the century when the European System of Central Banks came into
operation.
'My own view is that this body would be likely to be wary of making any
major changes in an area as sensitive as gold and much of it may well remain
with national central banks. All that said, as we have seen recently with
Belgium, the run-up to monetary union may cause participating central banks
to examine their policies towards holding gold much more closely than has
been the case in the recent past.'
Forward sales of gold and hedging by producers has also been blamed for
holding down the gold price in recent years, but Mr Ted Reeve, gold equity
analyst at First Boston Canada, said he believed the industry was now past
the point where hedging added to the gold supply and could be cited as a
negative factor for the price. He gave up to date estimates of gold hedging
by North American, South African and Australian producers and said it
totalled 1,000 to 1,100 tonnes.
The question of whether cuts in gold production would help the price to
recover was raised by two speakers. Mr Stewart Murray, chief executive of
Gold Fields Minerals Services, said that Russian gold output was bound to
fall again this year, perhaps by 30 per cent, because of the lack of
equipment and even roubles to pay the workforce. However, in the long term,
the CIS countries might become net importers of gold rather than suppliers.
Mr Mark Keatley, senior investment officer at the International Finance
Corporation, an affiliate of the World Bank, said countries in sub-Saharan
Africa had the potential to double annual gold output to 165 tonnes, almost
the same as Canada's production today.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ban on industrial fishing
called for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL FISHING should be banned in the North Sea, according to
Greenpeace, the UK environmental pressure group. A report published today
suggests that industrial fishing - which takes fish for uses other than
human consumption - is responsible for falling fish stocks. The fish are
processed into fish meal and fish oil for such industries as pig and poultry
feed, paint, and shoe polish.
Industrial fishing, which takes up to 50 per cent of the North Sea catch,
targets small species such as sandeels, which provide food for bigger fish,
sea birds and marine mammals. Greenpeace believes the practice is
destructive and wasteful, and describes regulation of the European Community
fleet as inadequate.
Ms Mary Munson, the organisation's fisheries campaigner, believes the UK
presidency of the community will give the UK 'a unique opportunity to
influence the EC and stop the pillage of our seas'. As well as a ban on
industrial fishing, Greenpeace is calling for environmental effects to be
considered in every EC fisheries decision and for measures to end the
catching and discarding of non-target species.
Greenpeace points out that improved technology has increased the efficiency
of the total fishing industry. 'As fishermen have increased their abilities
to catch the few remaining fish, stock after stock of commercial fish has
significantly declined.'
British landings of cod, for example, have decreased from 380,000 tonnes to
60,000 tonnes since the 1970s.
The report admits that it is unlikely that over-fishing will lead to the
extinction of any species as fishermen rarely find it worthwhile to continue
when a stock is severely depleted. 'However, the loss of such a huge
proportion of fish populations is alarming in itself,' says the report.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Five NHL bonds marked down
over UK property fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Home Loans (NHL), the UK centralised mortgage lender which
completed a debt restructuring package with banks earlier this month, has
had five mortgage-backed bond issues downgraded by Moody's Investors
Service, the US rating agency.
The move surprised many market participants because there has been no
serious deterioration in the condition of the UK housing market this year.
Moody's said that the downgradings reflected both the performance of the
mortgage pools underlying the bonds and 'structural and legal aspects' of
the issues.
The agency was concerned about the impact of re-possessions, especially
where re-possessed properties are then re-sold at a loss.
The bonds were issued by special purpose companies and formerly assigned the
top triple-A credit rating by Moody's on the basis of subordinated loans
provided by NHL itself.
Mr Nigel Terrington, NHL treasurer, said that the legal issues were
'technical'.
'We are disappointed by these ratings and do not believe the issues
highlighted by Moody's are significant,' he said.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the other big US rating agency, maintains three of the
five bond issues at a higher credit rating than Moody's. It rates
mortgage-backed bonds issued by CMS No 3 some four notches higher than
Moody's.
'One of the rating agencies has to be wrong,' commented one banker
yesterday. 'There is obviously a fundamental disagreement about the level of
credit protection available to bondholders.'
Dealers said that the downgradings had little impact on bond prices in the
secondary market. NHL has bought back bonds trading below par, balancing the
impact of any selling. The five issues amounted to Pounds 960m, although
only some Pounds 600m is still outstanding.
Bankers were yesterday anticipating new issues of mortgage-backed bonds from
other lenders. However, Midland Bank, which was expected to make a debut
issue of at least Pounds 200m, has pulled back from the market.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Surge of demand greets Ecu350m offering
from EIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank's reopening of the fixed-rate Ecu bond market
with an Ecu350m offering yesterday captured a surge of demand which took
traders by surprise, but is not expected to persist.
Apart from a small issue of floating-rate notes, the Ecu bond market has
been closed since the Danish referendum rejecting the Maastricht Treaty on
June 2 sent Ecu bond prices tumbling.
Although the positive result of last week's Irish referendum restored some
confidence in the future of the market, dealers said that buying interest
had remained thin. Friday's rally on news of the result was used by many
investors as an opportunity to sell bonds which they have been trying to
offload.
The reopening is unlikely to be followed by many more deals, as the EIB is
unusual in having a natural need for Ecu. The deal will be used to finance a
number of Ecu loans due to be disbursed. The bank was pleased to have an
opportunity to reopen the market, an official said.
The sell-out of the EIB offering represents something of a special case. A
substantial portion of the paper was sold to European central banks, some of
which may have been politically motivated to support the Ecu bond market. A
large portion of paper was also placed in Italy, where the EIB is exempt
from withholding tax for domestic investors.
The deal also met demand from fund managers due to the attractive pricing of
the 10-year bonds at a yield spread of about 12 basis points above the
comparable French government OAT issue, about six basis points more than the
bank had to pay prior to the Danish referendum. At this level, the bonds
yield just two basis points less than the theoretical 10-year Ecu bond
yield, based on the basket value of the Ecu.
The deal closed at 99.25 bid, above its fixed-reoffer level of 99.17.
Eurodollar bonds issued by Statni Banka, the central bank of Czechoslovakia,
yesterday stabilised at a yield spread of around 350 basis points over US
Treasury bonds, writes Simon London.
The Dollars 200m deal was launched last October at a spread of 300 basis
point over Treasuries and narrowed to 280 basis points earlier this year.
However, the bonds have under-performed since elections strengthened the
position of Slovakian nationalists pressing for independence. Nomura
International, which lead-managed the issue, yesterday reported 'good
two-way trading' in the bonds at the new yield spread.
The covenants of the bond make it an event of default if Statni Banka ceases
to be the central bank of either the Czech or Slovak republics. In this
case, bondholders would be able to put bonds back to the issuer at par.

THE Hong Kong Futures Exchange hopes to launch Hang Seng Index options late
this year or early in 1993, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
A decision will be taken in October, according to Mr Gary Knight, the
exchange chief executive.
He said a decision on whether to introduce electronic matching and to start
new currency and interest rate contracts would follow the options move.
He warned against expecting heavy turnover immediately. 'When we launch
options we will not see the big volumes on day one,' he said.
Mr Knight said options trading would continue for some time under the open
outcry system used for existing contracts.
The exchange was studying the possibility of introducing electronic
matching, although he stressed that a decision was not imminent.
'The electronic dealing system decision is in process. Our focus is on
options right now,' he said.
If electronic trading went ahead, new interest and currency products could
follow.

MACQUARIE Bank, the unlisted Australian merchant bank, yesterday revealed
that a higher tax charge led to an 11 per cent fall in net profits to
ADollars 47.21m (USDollars 35.4m) for the year to March 31, Reuter reports
from Sydney.
However, Mr Tony Berg, managing director, said the bank expected an increase
in earnings in the current year because of growth in its businesses through
better trading conditions and new products and services.
Macquarie is 16 per cent owned by Hill Samuel Bank, the UK merchant bank
which is part of the TSB group. Mr Berg said Hill Samuel was going ahead
with plans to sell its stake in Macquarie Bank by December 31.
Macquarie said pre-tax profit for the year to March 31 rose 4 per cent to
ADollars 76.39m. Tax expenses rose to ADollars 29.18m from ADollars 20.59m.
Mr David Clarke, chairman, said: 'The 12 months ending March 31 1992 were
difficult for Australia and even more difficult for its banking sector.
'While the recession has affected several of the bank's businesses, it has
given us the opportunity to make gains through capitalising on difficult
market conditions to increase our market share,' he said.
Total assets were steady at ADollars 2.36bn at March 31, while group
shareholders' funds rose to ADollars 272.8m during the year from ADollars
236.5m.
Provisions for bad debts, mostly on property loans, fell to ADollars 10.2m,
from ADollars 16.2m in 1990-91.
Mr Berg said he expected moderate growth in the Australian economy in the
current year, but there was unlikely to be significant growth in corporate
or financial market activity.
Macquarie said 27.6 per cent of its income came from trading businesses in
the year to March 31, 34.6 per cent from fees and commissions and 37.6 per
cent from interest margins.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: S African glass group cuts
payout on earnings slide
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLATE GLASS and Shatterprufe Industries (PGSI), part of the South African
Breweries stable, reported a steep drop in earnings and is cutting its
dividend.
Increased second-half US losses and weakness in domestic markets left net
attributable earnings 24.5 per cent lower at R50.8m (Dollars 14.1m) for the
year to March 1992. The dividend is going down by 32 per cent to 150 cents a
share.
The directors said, however, they expected earnings growth in the current
year as losses in Belron International, focus of the group's international
trading activities, were expected to be considerably lower.
Turnover last year dropped by 14 per cent to R1.98bn, due mainly to
discontinued operations. Margins were also squeezed because of difficult
trading conditions and development costs.
This caused operating profit to fall by 19 per cent to R248m. At the net
level, lower interest and tax bills were offset by an increase in preference
dividends and an unchanged minority share.
Last year's second half was eventful for PGSI with the acquisition from
Pilkington of a half-share in Glass and of furniture group Afcol's 24 per
cent holding in PG Bison.
A R354m rights issue was successfully concluded. SA Breweries now has an
effective 67 per cent controlling interest in PGSI following the acquisition
of Placor, PGSI's holding company, and its financial participation in the
Glass and PG Bison deals.
Mr Ronnie Lubner, chairman, said the group planned to focus on continued
leadership of the South African board and glass industries and on aggressive
development of the offshore automotive replacement glass (ARG) installation
business. PGSI has 600 ARG outlets in 11 countries.
'Following the Pilkington and Afcol deals, we now hold 97 per cent and 72
per cent of Glass and PG Bison respectively. We will continue to defend our
position against imported glass and strive to be globally competitive,' said
Mr Lubner.
Other than the UK, Benelux and central Africa, which returned good results,
the other main divisions experienced lower profits. Efforts by US management
to cut costs and increase marketing initiatives were countered by a 4 per
cent market dip and falling prices. Increased competition and the slowdown
in the automotive, building and furniture industries in South Africa
hampered the performance of local operations.

<TEXT>
GIO Australia, the insurer being privatised by the New South Wales state
government, will be offered to the public at ADollars 2.40 a share,
according to Mr Nick Greiner, the state's premier, Reuter reports from
Sydney.
Institutions have been invited to tender at prices between ADollars 2.10 and
ADollars 2.40 a share. A total of 500m shares will be issued, Mr Greiner
said in launching the prospectus for the flotation.
The government hopes to raise ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 799m) from the sale
of 100 per cent of GIO, which had net assets at end-1991 of ADollars 1.06bn.
GIO was formerly the Government Insurance Office, a general insurance
company owned by the state government.
The final price will be set on the basis of public and institutional demand.
'All investors, both institutional and private, will pay the same price for
shares,' the state government said.
Directors have forecast an operating profit after tax for the year to June
30 1992 of ADollars 105m, or 21 cents a share, compared with ADollars 95m in
the year to June 1991. GIO intends to pay a 14 cents a share dividend in
November 1992.
'Directors expect to maintain the dividend in respect of 1992/93 and it will
be payable in May and November of each year,' the state government said.
Institutions have to apply for 50,000 shares or more. The offer,
underwritten by County NatWest, Bain and Co and Potter Warburg, opens on
June 29 and closes on July 24.
GIO shares are due to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on August
20. At ADollars 2.40, a share GIO will be capitalised within the top 50
companies in Australia.
Foreign investors will be allowed to take part in the flotation. All
investors will be limited to a 10 per cent stake on application and an
on-going shareholding of 15 per cent.
GIO was established in 1927 to provide workers' compensation and general
insurance for the New South Wales government and now manages about ADollars
8bn in assets.
It is ranked A for long-term debt and A-1 for short-term debt by credit
rating agency S&amp;P Australian Ratings.
'The privatisation is a key plank of my government's micro-economic
reforms,' Mr Greiner said, adding that it was the country's first ever 100
per cent privatisation by flotation.
The federal government last year floated 30 per cent of Commonwealth Bank of
Australia.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Indocement unveils Dollars
848m acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDOCEMENT, Indonesia's largest quoted company, has announced conditional
acquisitions totalling Rp720bn (Dollars 848m). The purchases, which are in
food and property, will diversify Indocement away from the cement sector in
which it accounts for 52 per cent of national capacity.
The principal acquisition is PT Bogasari Flour Mills, an integrated flour
milling company with an estimated 85 per cent market share in wheat flour
and cash-flow of about Rp160bn a year. The purchase cost of Rp1,179bn
includes the assumption of about Rp350bn of debt, a cash payment of Rp220bn
and the issuance of long-term promissory notes totalling Dollars 300m.
Indocement will also acquire a 51 per cent stake in the Indofood Group for
Rp777bn; the group of nine principal companies and 20 subsidiaries produces
more than 140 products and is a leading producer of instant noodles.
The final acquisition is Wisma Indocement, an 23-storey office building in
central Jakarta for which the company is paying Dollars 56m.
The reaction of brokers to the announcement was mixed. They say all three
purchases are from the 'Salim Group', a loose collection of companies in
which Mr Soedono Salim, reputedly Indonesia's richest businessman, is a
major shareholder.
Companies in which Mr Salim has an interest hold over a 40 per cent stake in
Indocement, which has a market capitalisation of Rp7,396bn. Mr Salim and
five other commissioners and directors of Indocement have announced an
interest in the companies to be purchased.
The reaction of brokers in Jakarta to the announcement was mixed. The food
sector is expected to have high growth over the medium-term, but the flour
industry is highly protected and may be the subject of deregulation shortly.
Although analysts were expecting Indocement to make large-scale
acquisitions, they expressed surprise that there was no mention of likely
purchases at the annual meeting held earlier this month.
A local broker noted 'a lack of synergy between cement and instant noodles'
but conceded that 'Indocement has gone as far as it can as a cement company
and needs to diversify'.
Indocement says the purchases will be paid out of cash resources of Rp400bn
and long-term borrowing of Rp1,320bn. This will give Indocement a
debt-to-equity ratio of 132 per cent and brokers say a new share issue is
likely within a year.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: 'No malign effect' of stock
index futures trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no evidence that trading in stock index futures increases
volatility in the underlying UK stock market, according to a report
commissioned by the Securities and Investments Board.
The Financial Markets Group of the London School of Economics was
commissioned to examine the linkage of cash and derivatives trading in the
UK equity market, after concern about the negative impact of futures trading
following the 1987 stock market crash.
The report goes some way to refuting suggestions that futures trading
increases volatility and undermines traditional markets.
'That the study finds no indiction of such malign effects in the UK is
reassuring,' the SIB commented.
The report comes at a time of mounting concern about the risks inherent in
derivatives trading, particularly among bank regulators.
Mr Gerald Corrigan, who heads the Basle-based Committee on Banking
Supervision, and Mr Richard Farrant, head of banking supervision at the Bank
of England, are among supervisors to have expressed concern recently.
In a speech in London in March, Sir David Walker, then chairman of the SIB,
also warned of the risks inherent in derivatives business.
'This is a market for management to watch with particular care,' he said.
The SIB has invited comments on the LSE report in an effort to build a
broader picture based on the views of market participants.
Meanwhile, the Group of Thirty, the Washington-based think-tank, is about to
begin a wide-ranging review of the risks which have built up in the
financial system as a result of the explosive growth of derivatives markets
in the last decade.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: National Bank of Kuwait regains
vigour after surviving Gulf crisis - The first full set of results since the
invasion suggests NBK is stronger than ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the emirate's banking system was
shattered. But within a few months of the invasion, National Bank of Kuwait
(NBK), the largest Kuwaiti bank, was up and running again.
In May this year, NBK published results for the combined years of 1990-91,
its first full set of figures since the invasion. They are impressive by any
standards.
Though group assets have fallen by 21 per cent since 1989 to Dollars
10.17bn, profits of Dollars 155.5m are 32 per cent higher and - to judge by
the strength of its capital base - NBK looks even more muscular than it did
before the invasion.
Its risk-to-assets ratio has risen from 14.4 per cent before the invasion to
15.2 per cent in May. By the standards of most banks in North America and
Europe, this suggests almost excessive caution. But NBK takes the view that
it lives in a hazardous part of the world and needs a stronger capital base
than western banks.
Just how hazardous was shown on August 2 1990 when Iraqi troops marched into
Kuwait City. By a happy coincidence, NBK's chairman, Mr Mohamed Abdul Mohsin
Al-Kharafi, and most of its directors were in London that day, as was Mr
Ibrahim Dabdoub, its chief general manager.
As a result, there was never any question about the validity of decisions
taken in exile, and lines of authority inside the bank were never in
question.
By 10.20am on the morning of the invasion, the bank's board had sent out
messages worldwide, revoking all the powers of the Kuwait-based operations.
At that point, about half the bank's assets and 65 per cent of the loan
portfolio was outside Kuwait.
Even so, in the immediate aftermath of the invasion, the bank's management
had to battle desperately on three fronts. One was the struggle to get
freezing orders against Iraqi and Kuwaiti banks in western countries lifted
so that its branches outside Kuwait could function normally. It took three
days to get the US authorities to lift their order and a week before a
similar order in the UK was removed.
Meanwhile, the bank's staff had to cope with thousands of customers stranded
outside the country with traveller's cheques and credit cards which no
longer worked. Not surprisingly, many of them quickly switched to banks
based in western countries.
NBK's branches never formally closed down during the days of the freeze, but
they were at a considerable disadvantage when handling customer needs. 'We
lost quite a few customers in the first few weeks after the invasion,' NBK
says.
Since then, it has regained much of the lost business and taken on new
customers, largely as Kuwaiti customers of the country's other banks shifted
to it.
The third and trickiest problem was to regain access to its records housed
in its head office in Kuwait City. Computer records were quietly collected
and driven out of Kuwait and into Jordan via Iraq by courageous employees.
Within a few months, all the bank's records were reunited at its temporary
headquarters in London.
There followed months in which NBK's prime concern was to remain liquid and
ensure that the rest of the international banking system could see that it
was making its payments on time. Cut off from its traditional funding base
of customers' deposits, it sold assets furiously, shedding much of its loan
portfolio and commercial paper to keep up with commitments.
In December 1990, NBK published interim results. These showed that the bank
in exile had total assets of Dollars 5.6bn, about 43 per cent of its
pre-invasion size. By then, NBK had two strategies in place.
The first strategy was designed to ensure it could operate indefinitely in
exile if Kuwait remained under Iraqi control. The other was to start making
tentative preparations for the work that would be needed once a return to
Kuwait City took place.
As it turned out, there had been little physical damage to its Kuwait head
office. A new mainframe computer was installed and the bank began
functioning again in its old headquarters.
But the environment in which it operated had changed dramatically. The
Kuwaiti government confiscated Kuwaiti banks' hidden reserves and
collateral. Along with other banks, NBK had to accept government bonds in
exchange for its domestic loan portfolios.
It also lost about 100 staff as part of the general exodus of Palestinians
from Kuwait after the war. Mr Dabdoub, the chief general manager and the
driving force in the bank, is Palestinian. He remained in London until eight
months after the war's end.
A post-war strategic review of its future concluded that NBK's existing
strategy as a regional niche player should continue unchanged. 'We are fully
back to normal, even if we are a bit smaller,' NBK says.

<TEXT>
CHEVRON, the fourth-largest US oil and gas company, has signed a memorandum
of understanding expressing its interest in joining a consortium that is
planning to build a pipeline to transport oil from the former Soviet
republic of Kazakhstan.
The San Francisco-based company stressed yesterday it was not yet a formal
partner in the consortium, which is led by the government of Oman. Chevron
added it would only consider joining the consortium once the pipeline had
been constructed.
Chevron is, however, already deeply involved in the exploration for oil in
Kazakhstan, having last month signed an agreement with the republic that
could lead to the multi-billion dollar development of an area covering about
4,000 sq km.
Oman, which announced the pipeline plan, said the completion cost could
range between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1.6bn, depending on the route chosen
from Kazakhstan. The pipeline plan calls for the shipment of oil from the
former Soviet republic to world markets along one of eight possible routes -
these could run to the Mediterranean, the Black Sea or the Persian Gulf.
Oman and Kazakhstan last week signed an accord to form the pipeline
consortium. Officials in the energy industry say Chevron is just one of
several possible consortium partners being canvassed by the two governments.

CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday turned in underlying
second-quarter earnings of Dollars 88.4m, or 47 cents a share, a 15 per cent
advance on the same period last year.
However, net income was reduced by a pre-tax charge of Dollars 16.3m linked
to a special charge to cover costs related to silicone breast implants at
Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical. As a
result, Corning had net income of Dollars 72.1m, or 38 cents, against
Dollars 75.9m, or 41 cents, a year earlier.
Sales in the period rose 19 per cent to Dollars 926.7m from Dollars 778.2m.
For the first half, Corning had net income of Dollars 150.2m, or 79 cents,
on sales of Dollars 1.72bn. The results compare with earnings of Dollars
124.3m, or 67 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.47bn a year earlier.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US and Hitachi of Japan have announced an expansion
of their long-standing co-operative agreements, opening up new opportunities
for GE to export power transmission and distribution technology to Japan.
The two companies said yesterday they had entered into long-term
co-operative agreements designed to strengthen their competitive position in
the utility transmission and distribution market.
The agreements extend for another 10 years the companies' joint venture,
launched in 1977, to market high-voltage breakers in the US. The venture
will change its name from High Voltage Breakers to GE-Hitachi HVB.
The new agreement also allows GE to access the Japanese market with its
transmission and distribution equipment, and provides for the sharing of
technology.
Obtaining access to the Japanese transmission and distribution market is a
significant boost for GE, complementing the position it has already
established in power generating equipment. GE is prime contractor on Tokyo
Electric Power's 2,800MW combined cycle plant, the largest in the world,
which is due for completion in the mid-1990s.

<TEXT>
GOTA, Sweden's fourth-largest commercial bank, yesterday announced the
appointment of a new president and chief executive from September 1.
The move follows last week's announcement of a SKr13.5bn (Dollars 2.4bn)
five-year financial insurance plan designed to stabilise the bank in the
face of mounting financial troubles caused by credit losses this year
estimated at around SKr4bn in 1992.
Mr Per Lundberg, at present deputy chief executive of Investor, the
investment company controlled by the Wallenberg family, will take charge of
the bank. He will also take a leading position in the insurance giant
Trygg-Hansa SPP, which is the dominant shareholder in Gota.
Most of Mr Lundberg's business career has been within the Wallenberg empire.
He began work with Stockholm's Enskilda Bank in 1969. After its emergence in
1972 as Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, he became head of company analysis
and credit administration. From 1979 until last year, Mr Lundberg was chief
executive of Providentia, the Wallenberg-controlled investment company that
was recently merged with Investor.
Mr Lundberg also sits on the boards of a number of the Wallenberg companies,
including Atlas Copco and Saab Automobile.
Mr Bjorn Sprangare, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa SPP, said Mr Lundberg's
long experience with SEB and Providentia, as well as his work on the boards
of industrial companies, made him well-qualified to lead Gota.
Mr Lundberg replaces Mr Gabriel Urwitz who has been Gota's president and
chief executive since 1989.
In a statement, Mr Urwitz said it had been important to give Gota a stronger
base for the future. Having achieved this goal, he added, it was the right
moment for a change of leadership at the bank.

SHAREHOLDERS in Hoesch, the Dortmund-based German steelmaker, yesterday
bowed to the inevitable and gave the green light to their takeover by the
rival Essen-based Fried. Krupp group.
Yet it was not without angry criticism of the whole 'shotgun wedding' from
the floor at yesterday's seven-hour annual meeting.
The 850 shareholders in attendance voted by a large majority to do away with
the company rule that a single shareholder can only exercise a maximum
voting right of 15 per cent. That allowed Fried. Krupp, led by Mr Gerhard
Cromme, the chief executive who plotted the whole campaign, to use the full
62 per cent of the capital it has acquired, since launching the 'forced
merger' bid last October.
Mr Cromme and three other Krupp executives were elected to the Hoesch
supervisory board, and Mr Cromme was expected to be elected chairman last
night.
The resistance to the merger came especially from Hoesch
employee-shareholders, according to the VWD news agency, after they gave
notice of no fewer than 90 contrary resolutions to the proposals of the
Hoesch supervisory board.
Accusations from the floor were directed at both Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief
executive of Hoesch, and Dr Herbert Zapp of Deutsche Bank, the chairman of
the supervisory board.
There was also anger that Mr Neukirchen, only appointed as Hoesch chief
executive last year, will still receive more than DM6m, the full remaining
value of his five-year contract, if he leaves the company early after the
merger, the agency reported.
Mr Neukirchen result standing DM80m (Dollars 50.6m) above the same period of
1991. In 1991, Hoesch made a profit of just DM126.8m on turnover of
DM13.1bn.

OMV, the Austrian oil company, is facing a sharp drop in 1992 earnings
following a loss in the first five months of the year.
The company, which is majority-controlled by the state holding group
Austrian Industries (AI), is said to have suffered a Sch100m (Dollars 9m)
shortfall in the January-May period, mostly because of losses at its
plastics subsidiary PCD.
The fiscal year's poor start could cut the full-year operating profit to
about Sch1bn from Sch1.7bn last year, which would damage AI's chances to
undertake its scheduled initial public stock flotation in 1993, industry
sources say.
OMV generates nearly half of its parent company's annual earnings. An OMV
spokesman declined to confirm the figures, which were reported in the
Austrian press.
For the first quarter, OMV reported a loss of Sch300m, but the company's
results usually improve in the course of the year. Industry sources say OMV
still aims for an operating profit of Sch1.5bn for 1992, which would permit
the company to keep its dividend at Sch20 a share.

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food manufacturer, said yesterday it intended to pay
HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for 51 per cent of the manufacturing assets
in Hong Kong and southern China of Dairy Farm International, the Hong
Kong-based international food retailer.
Dairy Farm said it would sell a controlling stake in its wholly-owned Hong
Kong dairy products manufacturer as well as control of its 70 per cent-owned
Guangzhou (Canton) ice cream maker, Guangzhou Refrigerated Foods.
The deal, which is expected to be concluded in October, marks Nestle's first
move into food manufacture in the colony and increases its presence in
mainland China.
The Swiss company also plans to buy the Jardine Matheson-controlled Dairy
Farm's brand names.
The two companies said they would establish a joint venture company to make
and distribute ice cream and chilled products, such as milk and yoghurt, in
Hong Kong and China.
Mr Chris Nelson, managing director of Dairy Farm, said the company had been
looking for a partner for some time to help develop the possibilities for
large-scale food manufacture now available in China.
'We have been getting so many approaches from other cities and provinces in
China but we did not have the resources to meet the demands,' Mr Nelson
added.
The cash released to Dairy Farm by the sale will allow it to develop further
its retailing operations in Hong Kong, Britain, Spain, Australasia, China
and Taiwan.
The deal also marks a further retreat by Dairy Farm from manufacturing to
distribution and retailing.
For Nestle, the deal adds a consumer food manufacturer to its other two main
manufacturing interests in China.
In Heilongjiang, in north-east China, it makes infant foods and full-cream
milk powder; in Dongguan, south of Guangzhou, it has China's largest instant
coffee manufacturing plant.
Mr K. F. Lim, Nestle's chief in Hong Kong, said the purchase of Dairy Farm's
assets strengthened the company's position in Hong Kong.
The turnover of its two businesses in China was greater than Dairy Farm's in
China, he added.
Mr Lim said the potential of the Chinese market was great. Although it was
false to look at it in terms of China's population of 1.2bn people, in the
coastal provinces of the country there were between 300m and 400m people
with money and the relative freedom of choice.
'When an economy reaches a certain stage as has China's, people can afford
the luxury of choice,' he said.
'It is then that products such as ice cream come into their own. We believe
there is considerable room for growth in China.'

venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S three remaining indigenous large computer manufacturers have formed
a joint venture to develop trans-European systems for public authorities.
Groupe Bull of France, Olivetti of Italy and Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany said
yesterday they had created a new company, Trans European Information Systems
(TEIS), which would have its headquarters in Brussels.
The new company, which will have the legal structure of a European economic
interest group, is a further step in a scheme to build a European-wide
computer network - the 'European Nervous System' - which the three
manufacturers have been exploring for well over a year. They have already
established a number of laboratories to work on technical aspects of the
system.
The European Nervous System had its origin in an idea floated by the
European Commission but it has been seized on enthusiastically by Europe's
beleaguered computer manufacturers.
The two major benefits are an increase in sales of data processing equipment
through a form of public procurement which could not be seen as financial
aid and the opportunity to gain valuable experience of large scale projects.
They complain that US computer companies have benefited greatly from their
involvement in large public sector and defence projects.
The purpose of the new company will be to provide local authorities with
applications that improve the availability of information technology
services within the framework of the single European market.
Computer systems in each of the member-states which 'talk' to each other is
seen as a prerequisite for the establishment of harmonised services in areas
such as healthcare and environmental protection.
The applications which will run on the trans-European network will include
systems to guarantee the free movement of people, goods and capital
following the dismantling of intra-Community barriers.

venture

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATHESON INVESTMENT Management, part of Jardine Matheson Holdings, and BDO
Binder Hamlyn, the accountancy firm, yesterday formed a joint venture to
manage Pounds 300m of combined investment funds.
Matheson has bought a majority stake - believed to be 80 per cent of the
equity - in Binder Hamlyn Investment Management for an undisclosed sum, to
create a new company called BDO Matheson Investment Management.
The new venture - one of the first such launched by an accountancy firm -
boosts Binder's funds from their current level of Pounds 125m, which is
mainly derived from large private clients. The existing staff of 13 will be
increased to 20, and be based in Matheson's office in London.
Mr Roderick Collins, a director of Matheson and the chairman of the new
venture, said the company would offer a range of global equities and fixed
income investment.
He said the venture had been driven by a desire from Matheson to expand its
portfolio and to generate economies of scale.
Mr Edmund Wood, a partner with Binder Hamlyn who will serve on the new
board, said: 'We are very excited by the venture. It will grow and
strengthen the services to our clients.'
He said it would strengthen the reputation of the firm in investment
management because, 'the approach and ethos of an accountancy firm are not
necessarily identical with investment managers. It is a distinct
discipline.'
He denied that the resignation of Mr Chris Swinson - the national managing
partner of Binder Hamlyn who left the company last Thursday after his
replacement was appointed - would have any effect on the arrangements.
Mr Wood said Binder Hamlyn Investment Management was established four years
ago and became profitable two years ago after achieving a portfolio of
Pounds 80m.

FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ivory &amp; Sime jumps to Pounds 4.55m after
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IVORY &amp; SIME, the Edinburgh-based fund manager, announced a 55 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.55m for the year ended April 30, but
opted not to increase dividends. The final was unchanged at 4.5p, making a
same again total of 5.75p.
Mr David Newbigging, chairman, said the decision had been made to restore
dividend cover to a more prudent level. He added that it was now the
directors' intention 'to recommend dividend increases in line with any
increases in earnings per share'.
Earnings jumped from 6.15p to 9p per share, leaving the dividend covered
1.56 times. It said that such fast growth in earnings per share was unlikely
to be sustained.
According Mr Allan Munro, managing director, the company's main aim was to
restore funds under management, which rose 11 per cent to Pounds 2.9bn
during the year, following a 16.5 per cent rise in the previous year. These
had decreased substantially between 1985 and 1988 - pension funds alone
dropped from more than Pounds 1bn to around Pounds 500m during the period -
and confidence was initially damaged when new management was installed in
April 1990, after the group's former managing director and four senior fund
managers left abruptly.
The company also restructured its marketing department last year to aim its
investment trusts more directly at private investors via regular savings
schemes and personal equity plans. The company intends continuing with this
effort, as well as trying to find new institutional clients.
The figures also take account of Ivory &amp; Sime's purchase of Argosy Asset
Management with Pounds 420m of funds for Pounds 1.75m last April.
Administrative expenses were held to Pounds 9.94m (Pounds 9.88m).

Pounds 3.21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE year to March 29, Allen, the USM-quoted housebuilder, contractor,
plant hirer and property developer based in Wigan, Lancashire, saw the end
of its 23-year record of growth.
Pre-tax profits fell 39 per cent to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 5.25m) on turnover
almost 13 per cent down at Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 67.5m). Although
housebuilding had held up better in the north, Mr Donald Greenhalgh,
chairman and managing director, described Allen's performance as
'creditable' - indeed, the final dividend is lifted to a proposed 3.35p (3p)
for a total of 5p, up from 4.9p.
Forecasts for margins and operating profits on the contracting side had been
too pessimistic - the former improved a 'comfortable' 4.26 per cent and the
latter 2.2 per cent to Pounds 1.4m, though turnover declined 18 per cent to
Pounds 32.9m.
Although bad debt in plant hire was reduced, operating profits fell 55 per
cent to Pounds 745,000. Beskab hired out more site offices thanks to price
reduction.
Housebuilding profits were down 25 per cent at Pounds 2m on turnover 4 per
cent lower at Pounds 15.4m. Servicing the bottom third of the market and
building to exchange of contract rather than reservation helped the
division, where completions rose by 5 to 271 at an average price of Pounds
56,000 (Pounds 60,000).
Mr Greenhalgh said the company had 'not ducked the question' of provisions
on its 3-year landbank, but had concluded none was necessary.
Provisions of some Pounds 340,000 were made on the property development
side, where profits tumbled 67 per cent on turnover down 15 per cent at
Pounds 1.6m.
Group earnings fell to 9.69p (15.47p) per share.

FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bonus boost for Boots' chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES Blyth, chief executive of Boots, the retailing and pharmaceutical
group, saw his pay increase by two-thirds last year with the benefit of a
hefty bonus. He will, however, only receive the full extra payment if the
company out-performs its competitors over the next four years.
Sir James's basic pay increased 14 per cent to Pounds 385,000 but he
received a further Pounds 186,000 bonus taking his total pay to Pounds
571,000. Sir James's salary in the previous year included a Pounds 6,000
bonus.
Boots' other executive directors also received generous bonuses in 1991-92
sharing Pounds 900,000 between them compared with Pounds 54,000 the year
before.
The company's annual report and accounts, released yesterday, revealed
details of a complicated long-term bonus scheme for executive directors
which came into effect from April 1 1991 with the intention of 'locking in'
valuable executives. Bonus payments under this scheme depend on the
company's dividend and share price performance over the next four years when
set against 10 competitors in the retailing and pharmaceutical fields.
Part of the bonus payments last year were taken in the form of provisions
anticipating the future performance of the group over the four-year period.
Should the company not match these expectations, the directors will not
receive their full bonus payments.
The executive directors also benefit from a one-year bonus scheme, based on
performance against budget targets. This has now been scaled down to match
that operating for all senior managers.
In the year to March 31, Boots' pre-tax profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds
374.2m. Earnings per share climbed 9 per cent to 26.4p. Boots' staff
received a 9 per cent pay increase last year.

FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BM withdraws from Thwaites purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on the possible sale of Thwaites, the site dumper manufacturer,
are to continue following the withdrawal yesterday of a proposed purchase by
BM Group, the acquisitive construction equipment manufacturer.
BM's decision to pull out followed a referral earlier this month of the
proposed bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The Department of Trade and Industry had maintained that a takeover raised
competition issues in the supply of site dumpers in the UK market, but
yesterday BM said any proposed merger would not be against the public
interest.
However, it did not wish to 'devote the considerable management time or
incur the excessive cost in presenting the case to the MMC for such a small
potential acquisition.'
Consequently, BM has ceased discussions with privately-held Thwaites, which
announced in February that it had hired Robert Fleming, the merchant bank,
in connection with a possible sale.
It is thought that BM would have had to pay Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m for
Thwaites, which would have brought BM some new products and an efficient
factory at Leamington, recently reorganised.
Close observers of the situation say BM's withdrawal was a disappointment
but not a big surprise, once the referral was announced. An inquiry would
have taken some months, and an eventual defeat for BM would have been
embarrassing.
However, there are other 'irons in the fire,' according to a source close to
the discussions. The BM approach was no further advanced than those by other
companies, and the lifting of the uncertainty caused by the referral could
bring other negotiations to a head.
Thwaites' core site dumper business has been badly hit by the construction
industry recession, and depends primarily on the UK market. But its
manufacturing facilities make it an attractive acquisition candidate for an
Asian equipment producer seeking a European production base - not
necessarily for site dumpers.
A purchase by a Korean producer remains a possibility, but is not expected
to happen quickly - Asian purchasers are traditionally slow to reach a
decision.
Additionally, the worldwide recession in the construction industry is only
now beginning to lift, and conditions are hardly ideal for selling equipment
manufacturers. Thwaites has stressed from the outset that it will remain
independent if acceptable terms cannot be negotiated.

FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hays in Pounds 38m French acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYS, the business services group, yesterday announced a long sought move
into Europe through the acquisition of a French food and drink distribution
company financed by a Pounds 34.3m placement of shares.
The company is paying Pounds 37.5m for Groupe FRIL, a private distributor of
drinks and chilled foods for customers that include Carrefour, Yoplait and
Moet Hennessy. Hays could pay an additional Pounds 15m over three years,
depending on FRIL's profits.
Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman and chief executive, said Hays had been wanting to
expand in Europe for 18 months and that the FRIL acquisition would be
followed by one in the commercial services area in France or Germany.
After yesterday's placing, the group's balance sheet was in good shape to
make further acquisitions without issuing any more new paper.
Gearing had fallen from 30 per cent to 26 per cent on net debt of Pounds
38m. 'There are a lot of good acquisition targets out there in Europe and
England,' Mr Frost said. 'I am in an acquisitive mood.'
He said FRIL would enhance the company's earnings, previously forecast at
12.3p in 1992-93, to about 12.6p. The acquisition would deliver earnings
equivalent to 18p for each of the 19m new Hays shares being issued.
FRIL had sales of FF450 (Pounds 45m) in the year to September 1991 from its
three trading groups - Logistique Barre, Transports Barre and TAC
Developpement. It made operating profits of FF48m before interest, tax and
start up losses on new contracts.
Hays is buying net assets revalued last September at Pounds 7m and is also
assuming FF250m of FRIL's debt.
Since Mr Frost brought Hays to the market in 1989, two years after a
management buy-out from the Kuwait Investment Office, the company's market
capitalisation has almost doubled to Pounds 723m. But the company has
remained almost totally dependent on the UK economy.
Mr Frost said FRIL provided a platform to widen Hays' geographical spread.
'Hays' existing activities in distribution, together with those of FRIL,
will be able to offer continental European customers the type of services
that they are beginning to demand.'
Schroders underwrote and Rowe &amp; Pitman placed the shares yesterday morning
at 182p with a range of institutions. Hays share price closed down 3p at
187p.
Mr Frost said there continued to be no evidence of economic recovery in the
UK. The personnel division - the third business area which supplies
specialised people - remained flat. When the recession came to an end,
however, it would recover very quickly and about 70 per cent of its billings
would go straight to the bottom line, he said.

<TEXT>
PHILIP HARRIS, the pharmaceutical and scientific equipment supplier,
yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits helped by a turnkey project
in Indonesia.
The company also announced it is paying Pounds 1.64m for nine retail
chemists in Oxfordshire. The move will improve its pharmaceuticals
distribution network, but Harris has no plans to become a big retail
operator, according to Mr David Newcombe, chief executive.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 871,000 to Pounds 1.76m in the
year to March 31. Turnover increased 17.5 per cent to Pounds 79.1m (Pounds
67.3m).
The Indonesian contract, for the supply of scientific equipment, added about
Pounds 6.5m to turnover. The company would not give an indication of the
contract's profitability.
Earnings per share increased to 14.58p (10.03p). The company is recommending
a final dividend of 4.25p (3.75p) to make a total of 6.25p (5.75p), an
increase of 8.7 per cent.
Harris is buying Proctor's pharmacies and HM Brooks, which operate nine
pharmacies in and around Oxford. This brings to 15 the number of retail of
retail outlets owned by Harris.
Harris is issuing Pounds 1.29m of three year, guaranteed loan notes and will
pay the balance of Pounds 350,000 in cash. Following the purchase, Harris's
debt will rise to Pounds 4.6m with gearing increasing from 28 per cent to 48
per cent.

Mothercare
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID DWORKIN, the chief executive designate at Storehouse, is already
going through the retailing conglomerate like a dose of salts.
Yesterday, the company announced that Mr Derek Lovelock was resigning as
chief executive of Mothercare to be replaced by Ms Ann Iverson, who was
appointed last month to the number two slot at the childrenswear chain.
Further management changes at Mothercare are expected shortly.
Storehouse also announced that Ms Sheila Forbes's job as group personnel
director had been made redundant following a head office reorganisation.
This slimming-down exercise will see the 40-man head office cut by half and
symbolically relocated within the BhS building, where Mr Dworkin has ruled
the roost for the past three years.
The company stressed that the moves were no reflection on Mothercare's
current trading position. Sales increases are said to be running in the
'double-digits'.
The changes at Mothercare follow a similar restruc-turing exercise at
Habitat last month which led to the departure of Mr Michael Harvey as
chairman and chief executive.
Mr Dworkin has already announced that he wants Mothercare's management team
to work more closely with that of BhS to share sourcing expertise and
increase buying muscle. The appointment of Ms Iverson looks an ideal means
of achieving the goal. She was formerly stores director at BhS and
previously worked with Mr Dworkin at Bonwit Teller, the US fashion chain.
Mr Dworkin officially succeeds Mr Michael Julien as chief executive after
the company's annual meeting next month.

<TEXT>
CROWN COMMUNICATIONS, the troubled commercial radio group which owns LBC,
has announced that losses are continuing to mount and the company is now
seeking to eliminate its problem areas.
Crown reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.58m in the six months to March 31.
This compared to losses of Pounds 4.68m at the interim stage last time, and
losses of Pounds 6.79m in the year to last September.
Crown said it is looking for a partner for its stake in RFM, the French
radio network. Crown described France as a critical problem. It said RFM's
revenue growth had been below expectations and recent audience surveys have
shown no improvement.
Crown also admitted publicly yesterday for the first time that a preliminary
agreement for the sale of three quarters of its 40 per cent stake in
Independent Radio News had not been concluded.
The company added that discussions on IRN's future were continuing. It is
believed however that significant commercial radio groups want to pay a
fixed fee for a national news service which could be provided by either
Crown, Independent Television News or the Press Association.
LBC Radio reduced its operating losses from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 300,000,
helped by increased advertising revenue. The other main UK subsidiaries,
Business Communications and Independent Radio Sales, were also loss-making.
There were exceptional losses of Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 393,000) on the
disposal of unspecified investments and terminated contracts.
Losses per share totalled 8.3p (7.8p) and again no dividend is being paid.
The after-tax loss for the period of Pounds 4.88m will wipe out the proceeds
of last October's Pounds 4.5m rights issue.

FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Pepe warns of losses and passed dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPE GROUP, the USM-quoted jeans designer and distributor, will make a small
loss after tax for the year to end March because of rationalisation of its
international operations.
It will also pass its final dividend for the first time since it came to the
market in 1985.
Its shares yesterday fell 30p to close at 42p.
The profits warning comes less than a year after the then chairman Mr Arun
Shah said the board was optimistic that performance for the current year
would reflect a marked improvement on the previous year.
Mr Shah, who is now deputy chairman, was succeeded as chairman by Mr Silas
Chou in March. Mr Chou has decided to bring forward the reorganisation
resulting in big exceptional charges.
The group is to concentrate on its brand name, Pepe, instead of spreading
its resources on other names such as BSCO, Hardcore and Buffalo.
Pepe is also to change its strategy of trying to increase overall sales in
favour of chasing higher margins on less turnover.
There are likely to be substantial extraordinary charges relating to the
sale or closure of subsidiaries.
Operating profits, whilst below those achieved in previous years, are likely
to be in line with market expectations.
In spite of a slight increase in sales from Pounds 81.3m to Pounds 82m,
pre-tax profits in the six months to September 29 fell by 13 per cent, from
Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3.09m. The interim dividend was cut from 2.5p to 2p.
Group borrowings for the year have fallen by just over half to Pounds 14.5m.
The balance sheet was strengthened by a Pounds 9.4m convertible preference
share issue in July.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Japanese brokers losing face and profits: Foreign success in
the Tokyo market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the Nikkei's continuing plunge - yesterday it fell through the 16,000
mark - has dragged down the fortunes of Japanese stockbrokers, a small band
of foreign securities companies is raking in record returns.
Figures circulated in Tokyo this week showed that in the year to March, the
Japanese office of Salomon Brothers of the US made more profit than any
Japanese broking company except Nomura Securities. Goldman Sachs, another
Wall Street house, secured third place in the league table ahead of Daiwa
Securities. Morgan Stanley and the securities arm of Societe Generale were
not far behind.
What particularly annoys Japanese broking company managers is that the
successful foreign-owned operations make their money largely from trading
their own capital using computer-driven programmes. No need for customers.
Nor for Japanese-speaking staff. Nor, indeed, for anyone who knows anything
about Japanese companies.
Japanese brokers have tried to get into the game but have failed to keep up
with the skills of the Wall Street imports. So they must rely on a dwindling
flow of orders from investment clients, which is proving insufficient to
keep them out of the red.
Japanese companies have even tried to persuade the Ministry of Finance to
clamp down on arbitrage between the cash market and stock index futures -
locking in profits between the cash and futures markets, a technique which
gives scope for computer-programmed investment. In the past, Japanese
brokerage officials have termed arbitrage trading as a 'malaise' to the
stock market.
The ministry has tightened the rules but cannot stop the practice altogether
for fear of angering the US authorities.
The earnings figures could prompt further criticism from Japanese brokers
and financial authorities of futures and options trading by foreign brokers.
Even as the Nikkei average fell to a six-year low yesterday, Japanese
brokers were quick to blame arbitrage trading for the decline. 'The
foreigners seem to be realising profits from arbitrage-selling, but profits
are not everything,' said Mr Tatsuhiko Kusuzawa, senior managing director at
Yamaichi Securities.
According to results submitted to the Japanese finance ministry and then
leaked, pre-tax profits at the 50 foreign brokers totalled Y49.2bn (Pounds
208.5m), 5.6 times higher than the previous year.
Market share for foreign brokers has also seen a steady rise, because of
their expertise in options and futures trading. According to brokers'
estimates, activity at foreign houses only accounted for 3 per cent of the
market in the first half of 1988. Because of the sharp fall in orders for
domestic institutions at the Japanese brokers, the figure has risen to 20
per cent.
However, the fates of foreign houses were divided among those with expertise
in stock futures and options markets, and those relying on client orders.
Leading UK houses such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd, SG Warburg and County
NatWest were among the 23 foreigners which posted pre-tax losses. County, in
an effort to stop further losses, has shifted its focus on the derivatives
markets and cut staff.
The Americans, on the other hand, have come out on top. Pre-tax profits at
Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley accounted for 85 per cent
of total foreign brokers profits.
The figures will increase tensions between foreign and Japanese brokers as
profits, even at the Big Four, are falling into the red on the operating
level for the first quarter of this fiscal year.
However, one UK broker says the reign of the arbitrageurs will not last too
long. 'The arbitrage techniques have enabled companies to reap good profits
in the past couple of years, but due to the increase in efficiency of the
markets, arbitrage possibilities are narrowing.' The demise of arbitrage
activity could spell relief to some foreign brokers in Japan as well as the
Japanese.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Glaxo drug challenged by cheap rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS OF a cheap rival to Glaxo's new migraine drug sent the share price
sharply lower yesterday.
Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation, the US subsidiary of the Swiss drugs
group, announced preliminary results of clinical trials for DHE 45, an old
product no longer covered by patents and therefore extremely cheap.
They showed that a single injection relieved pain in nearly half of patients
within 30 minutes, and in most within an hour, according to the subsidiary.
Studies have shown Glaxo's Imigran is more effective but it costs about
Pounds 10 for each pill and about Pounds 20 for every injection. DHE 45
costs less than Pounds 1 an injection.
Imigran is thought by some analysts to be capable of eventually generating
sales of more than Dollars 1bn a year.
Glaxo's share price dropped 22p yesterday, closing at 689p in a falling
market.
Full details of Sandoz's DHE 45 study, involving 311 patients at 38 US
clinics, will be announced next week. However, the drug has been associated
with adverse side-effects in the past.
Mr Robin Gilbert, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel, said: 'There is no
doubt the drug works to some extent. The main question is the side-effect
profile.'
Analysts also raised doubts about the design of Sandoz's study. It was
'open', meaning it was not compared with a placebo nor alternative
therapies. Glaxo's trials for Imigran were far larger than those for DHE 45
and were placebo-controlled and double-blind - meaning the clinicians did
not know which patient received which medicine until after the results were
compiled.
Sandoz's US arm was spurred into financing the trials after Glaxo's
substantial efforts for Imigran, known in the US as Imitrex, appeared to be
creating a new market for migraine treatments. Glaxo claims there is no
effective alternative. DHE 45 has been available since the 1950s.
Imigran has been licensed in 18 countries but is yet to receive a licence in
the US where there are about 11.2m migraine sufferers a year, according to
figures given to the International Headache Congress last year.
The US Food and Drug Administration asked last autumn for additional data
from studies currently under way to demonstrate the long-term safety of
Imigran.

FT  23 JUN 92 / De Klerk to chair talks on political turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN president FW de Klerk announced yesterday he would cut short a
visit to Spain and return in time to chair a cabinet meeting tomorrow which
will address the country's political turmoil.
Mr de Klerk's move follows a decision by the African National Congress,
which on Sunday cut off bilateral talks with the government, to convene an
emergency national executive committee meeting today.
The organisation attacked Mr de Klerk yesterday for his insensitivity in
leaving the country at such a time.
The ANC will discuss its response to last week's massacre of 42 people at
Boipatong, near Johannesburg. It blames the attack on the Zulu-based Inkatha
movement, and is incensed that three more were killed on Saturday by police
who opened fire on a crowd soon after Mr de Klerk aborted a visit to the
township.
The ANC, is expected either to suspend temporarily its participation in
Convention for a Democratic South Africa - the constitutional negotiating
forum made up of 19 political parties - or to make further participation
contingent on how the government responds to the massacre.
South African financial markets reacted nervously yesterday to the
deteriorating political mood. Worst affected was the financial rand, the
investment currency for foreigners, which fell by 6.7 per cent from Friday's
close to finish at R3.84 to the dollar. The discount to the commercial rand
widened to 27 per cent, the highest it has been this year.
On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the overall index closed at 3,639, down
42 points or more than 1 per cent.
The ANC executive meeting comes against the backdrop of the worst crisis in
the negotiation process since the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990.
There were, however, hints from both sides yesterday that they may be
seeking to pull back from the brink.
Mr Tertius Delport, the government's spokesman on Codesa, said it would be a
'tragedy' if the ANC was to pull out of the forum. 'That would be putting us
back a lot . . . we would be very disappointed if the ANC would entertain
the idea.'
Mr Delport said an invitation to the ANC by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister
and acting president in Mr de Klerk's absence, to join the government in
talks was an effort to move forward.
Professor Kadar Asmal, a member of the ANC executive, said the organisation
was 'firmly committed' to negotiations but added the way out of the impasse
was to move quickly to an interim government.
Investment analysts think the equity market will probably continue to move
lower until there is evidence that Codesa is back on track. Mr Mike Soekoe,
chief dealer at stockbroker Simpson McKie, said it had been a very nervous
day with volumes low and few people keen to buy.
Britain urged all sides to return to the negotiating table. Mr John Major,
the prime minister, was said to be 'very distressed' at the events.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Mr Steve Tshwete, ANC sports spokesman, both
called into question South Africa's participation in the Barcelona Olympics.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It appears there was some limited intervention by the Reserve Bank of South
Africa yesterday to support the financial rand. Those responsible, though,
probably felt as helpless as if they had been using a pea-shooter to attack
an elephant. Prompted by the formal suspension of the country's peace
process over the weekend, the investment currency for foreigners slid 7 per
cent in early trading, ending the day at a 27 per cent discount to its
commercial counterpart. That means it is weaker than at any point since the
March referendum, eloquently reflecting foreigners' worsening perceptions of
political risk.
The reality is that the central bank's surprise decision earlier this year
to start intervening in the financial rand market - hailed as an important
milestone in exchange rate policy and a step towards ultimate abandonment of
the two tier system - is a policy for more stable times. Mr Mandela may be
forced in the end to return to the negotiating table; in the meantime
markets are bound to take fright from his rhetoric and the graphic
television pictures of township violence. The Reserve Bank can smooth short
term fluctuations - and even nudge the discount in the right direction - but
it cannot halt the underlying trend.
It is always possible that Swiss and German investors will be tempted back
into high yielding bonds at current levels. But the appetite for South
African equities will surely be dulled. By all accounts the recent Liberty
Life and Sappi placings in Europe went reasonably well. They may be the last
for some time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 500m positive swing in the balance of payments between April and
May is less encouraging than it appears. Take out the oil and erratic items
and the visible trade balance is in much the same rut as it has been for
most of the past year. Besides, it is difficult to know what constitutes
good news on trade. In volume terms, imports were up only 4 per cent in the
three months to May compared with 6 per cent in the three months to April,
but the drop owes much to a slowdown in imports of basic materials,
semi-manufactures and capital goods.
If that suggests manufacturers are lowering their sights on the recovery, it
is in contrast with a continuing quarterly volume rise in imports of
passenger cars and consumer goods. The explanation may be that prolonged
recession has indeed left the UK with a supply side problem. British
manufacturers increasingly doubt not only the timing of recovery, but their
ability to exploit it when it finally appears.
Against that background, the continuing volume gain in exports looks
suspicious. Unit labour costs have fallen sharply in the UK, but exporters
seem condemned to charging ever higher prices while those of imports have
been falling, especially for manufactured goods. The overall picture
suggests industry continues to labour under an over-valued real exchange
rate, in which case exports cannot run at record levels indefinitely. One
has to wonder how many are already being won at the expense of margin.

FT  23 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC/Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds' withdrawal left the outcome of HSBC's bid for Midland, which closes
on Thursday, pretty much a foregone conclusion. Indeed Lloyds may ultimately
have helped HSBC's cause by showing that there was no real alternative. It
is hard to see a majority of investors turning their backs now, especially
as that would bring a sharp fall in Midland's price.
Just the same, it looks as though the 'yes' vote will lack conviction.
Indeed, one reason for the difference between yesterday's Midland close of
423p and the bid's value of 441p may be selling in the market for cash. The
deal will bring short-term benefits to Midland holders in the form of a
dividend restored to a level they could otherwise only expect much later in
the UK bank's recovery. In theory they will also share in south China's
growth prospects.
Yet HSBC itself has underperformed the Hang Seng index by 14 per cent since
the bid was revealed, partly due to the disclosure of its Dollars 780m
exposure to Olympia &amp; York. The merger may bring some synergy benefits in
areas such as foreign exchange, but Midland holders will face exposure to
Chinese politics, as Cable &amp; Wireless holders found after the Tiananmen
Square massacre. More immediate worries are the impact on Hong Kong of
deadlock in the Uruguay Round and of Japan's economic slowdown.
Some of this may be forgotten in the initial euphoria as HSBC joins the
Footsie. A place in the index does not normally confer lasting
outperformance, however. That could provide a further opportunity for those
investors who remain suspicious of the merger concept to sell into strength.

FT  23 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: London's liquid liability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was easy enough to conclude last week that there were special factors
behind the great GPA flop. The continuing lack of enthusiasm for equities in
London, though, will do nothing for the nerves of Wellcome's advisers or the
clutch of smaller companies with flotations now at an advanced stage.
Wellcome ought to make it if for no other reason than that it is a notable
member of the Footsie, in which major investors are badly underweight.
Un-like the now empty-handed aircraft lessors, moreover, the company is in
the position of not needing the money itself, which would limit the damage
if the issue did have to be pulled.
The problem is not just that the economic recovery has again failed to
arrive, but a marked shortage of liquidity. Eighteen months ago cash
represented around 7 per cent of institutional portfolios, but the
proportion is now nearer 4 per cent. Last year's spate of rights issues was
partly responsible, but the growing number of pension fund holidays and
lower dividend increases have also taken their toll. The third quarter of
1992 coincides not only with calls from the flotations, but instalment
payments from BT and the regional electricity companies, while government
funding in the gilts market continues apace.
In itself, of course, liquidity would not be an obstacle if equities were
thought to be cheap. Perceptions will change at some stage - but it arguably
does not help that institutions' UK equity weighting is close to the top end
of its 10 year range.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's costs and assets base seen as root of
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SMALLBONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The answer to your leader's first question - 'was there any
wrongdoing?' - is 'Yes: by past committees of Lloyd's and agents, acting in
concert to suppress Lord Cromer's recommendations of 1969 - to favour their
interests at Names' expense'.
Lord Cromer deplored the incorporation and sale of agencies and recommended
a deficit clause to discourage under-reserving, but above all he pointed out
that Lloyd's was peculiarly ill-adapted to the underwriting of the very
classes of business in which so many syndicates specialised - high excess
catastrophe risks.
He pointed out that the tax regime applied to insurance companies
facilitated the building of reserves and that Lloyd's needed similar
treatment. He stated that tax changes were the responsibility of government
and parliament too. Yet these essential needs were not made a principal
plank of the Lloyd's Bill in 1982.
The reason is clear. Reserves can be made only from profits in good years,
but anything which reduced the base on which agents could levy 'profit'
commissions would reduce the prices of underwriting agency shares.
Those Names who were placed by reckless agents on ultra high risk syndicates
have a legitimate complaint against the rota committees who interviewed them
if the chairman did not point out to them that Lord Cromer had long ago
warned against such involvement, but that Lloyd's had deliberately failed to
seek the legislative changes he suggested.
That is why agents and brokers should now contribute pound for pound with
Names, to the exceptional central fund levy.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr ALAN J LEBOFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an external Lloyd's Name I have so far gone along with David
Coleridge's comment that Names 'freely signed pieces of paper authorising
membership of each Syndicate', despite my misgivings as to the expertise of
my agents and the losses my children and I have suffered of Pounds 100,000
for 1988 and Pounds 200,000 for 1989, with (I am told) further losses to
come at least for 1990, and have not joined in litigation despite being
urged to do so.
However, at my rota interview I asked the same questions I had of my
prospective agent: 'What will membership cost me in fees etc, and (as l was
wary of joint and several liability) what if other names on a syndicate
cannot pay their share of losses?' and received the same answers: to my
second question, 'each Name writes for themselves, not one for another'.
When my children joined subsequently the Outhwaite problems were receiving
wide publicity and at their rota they asked, 'is there any way we could end
up paying for these other people's losses?' and were told unequivocally
there was not.
The Council of Lloyd's has now decided that the market losses require that
we should pay a levy, effectively retrospectively in that resignation now
would not avoid it, which in real terms would cost us an additional Pounds
112,500 on top of our further losses to come.
This makes 'not one for another' a travesty; I do not expect anyone else to
pay our losses, but we did not join Lloyd's as captive providers of
indefinite amounts of capital.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN D INCLEDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You identify correctly the key issue for Lloyd's and its future, in
your editorial 'Lloyd's and its casualties' (June 19). Unless Lloyd's can
build its capital base, it has no future - a truism for any business
organisation.
My 11 years as a Lloyd's Name have led to an overall loss from my membership
 -with further losses to come. In aggregate, I have handed over money to the
society for the dubious privilege of risking all the assets on which my
family and I depend. Yet I do not face financial ruin and would prefer to
remain a Name.
But the worldwide casualty insurance business has shown dreadful returns for
its sources of capital in recent years - whether shareholders or private
capital, as at Lloyd's. The Hoare Govett report on Lloyd's in May shows
clearly that Lloyd's, the UK composites and the US insurers do not produce
profits to match the risks being taken. There has been too much insurance
capacity chasing too little worthwhile business - and the situation may well
be continuing.
Why Lloyd's should believe it can attract corporate capital, when it cannot
retain the capital it has already, escapes me. Yet, perhaps there are
insurers who would prefer to have Lloyd's underwriters act for them rather
than conduct the underwriting themselves. To attract this business, Lloyd's
will have to demonstrate that its costs are competitive.
Lloyd's has come to believe that an annual salary of Pounds 100,000 should
be commonplace for an active underwriter of a medium size syndicate and
syndicates believe they should take profit commissions of between 12 per
cent and 20 per cent of profit, while Lloyd's brokers believe their
commissions should always be at least 10 per cent of premiums payable. The
whole Lloyd's infrastructure had become greedy and complacent.
But once sensible returns are in sight, risk capital will return from
individuals as well as companies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, How depressing to witness Dr John Ashworth, director of the London
School of Economics, enthusiastically supported by the FT, urging the
government to cancel the sale of County Hall to Shirayama Shokusan company
in favour of the LSE. For two such illustrious parties to offer such advice,
which is manifestly wrong in financial terms, is extraordinary.
The FT and respected economists spend much time urging the government to
keep public spending under rigorous control. Then, your leading article of
June 16 blandly refers to the proposed unnecessary expenditure of Pounds
120m as 'modest'.
We are assured the LSE is the foremost social science university in Britain,
perhaps in Europe. If this is so, and if it is to continue to be so, its
standing will be a function of the quality of the teaching staff and the
students, and not the grandeur of its building. Christopher H Burt,

22) of Sir Charles Groves? It should not be forgotten that throughout his
life Sir Charles was a vigorous champion of the amateur musician, conducting
choirs and orchestras throughout the country and giving them the recognition
they deserved for their service to the community. For eight years from
1972-1980 Sir Charles was the federation's president and supported our work
in every possible way. Since 1980 as a vice president he was unstinting with
his time and encouragement for amateur musicians and never once refused our
requests for help. Sir Charles' death has deprived us all of our last senior
conductor who happily collaborated with amateurs and professionals alike.

<TEXT>
THE LAST time Czechoslovakia was dismembered it was a victim of Nazi
invasion and western impotence. This time the decision to break up into two
separate sovereign states follows a general election, in which 85 per cent
of the electorate turned out to vote, and several rounds of talks between
the elected leaders of both the Czech and Slovak nations. Although deeply to
be regretted, the decision at least places responsibility securely upon
Czech and Slovak shoulders.
The political situation has polarised and crystallised with extraordinary
speed. All pre-election opinion polls showed that a large majority in both
republics wanted the common state to continue in some form or other. Now the
Czechs, and with slightly less conviction the Moravians, of whom more may be
heard later, appear to be rallying behind Mr Vaclav Klaus. He won electoral
support in the Czech lands because he promised to continue, and even
accelerate, the pace of privatisation and other reforms. These are designed
both to prevent a return to the authoritarian past and to fulfil the
criteria for full European Community membership by the turn of the century.
His view that continuation of a common state on lines demanded by Mr
Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, would both jeopardise economic reform
and risk pulling Czechoslovakia back towards its recently shed authoritarian
past is widely shared in the Czech lands.
But the outcome of the negotiations also furnished the latest proof that the
richer and more numerous Czechs do indeed call the shots in the common
state, as Slovaks have complained for decades. It is not easy to play second
fiddle without hope of advancement, and many Slovaks feel that 1,000 years
in somebody else's shadow is enough. It is also true that they have suffered
more than the Czechs from economic policies made largely in Prague. Their
heavy industry was more vulnerable to the collapse of the Soviet market,
more difficult to privatise and less able to adapt to western markets.
Once independent, the Slovaks will be able to work out their own policies,
and make their own mistakes. This may be psychologically a good thing, if it
helps them to work out long felt resentments. But they are likely to find
that their freedom of manoeuvre is savagely limited.
Independent Slovakia aspires to eventual EC membership, but to qualify, it
will have to fulfil onerous entry requirements. That means an open and
competitive economy and respect for the rights of minorities. The irony is
that this will require following similar policies to those demanded for
continuing the federal state.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Leading Article: South Africa on the brink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA has reached a watershed in its search for democracy.
Constitutional negotiations have ground to a halt. Not coincidentally,
political violence is increasing.
The danger that now confronts the country is that only more violence and
civil upheaval will break the impasse in the battle to reconcile majority
rule and minority rights. The fearsome possibility that the country could
tilt towards ungovernability will undoubtedly be uppermost in the minds of
Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) executive at their
meeting today, not to mention President FW de Klerk and his cabinet when
they meet tomorrow. Looking into the abyss should be enough to give fresh
and urgent impetus to negotiations.
The events of the past week, horrific as they were, do not in themselves
signal a turning point in South Africa's prospects. Since Mr Mandela's
release over two years ago, there have been killings as savage as those that
took place in Boipatong township last Wednesday. They have been accompanied
by the same allegations that supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's
Inkatha Freedom Party were responsible, together with accusations of
security force complicity. The South African police force once again showed
on Saturday, when it fired on a grieving crowd and killed three people, how
ill-equipped it is for its role in post-apartheid South Africa: badly
disciplined, trigger happy and hostile to change.
But when they are set against the background of the breakdown of
constitutional talks last month, these latest acts of violence take on a
greater significance. The government's insistence on what amounts to a white
veto in a new constitution, coupled with its inadequate response to
political violence, has persuaded an increasing number of black South
Africans to make a fundamental shift in their assessment of President de
Klerk's commitment to reform.
A year ago Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) leader,
could assuage his constituents' anger by reaffirming his belief in Mr de
Klerk's integrity, and holding out the prospect of multi-party talks at a
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Progress at these talks,
which would have joint supervision of the security forces on the agenda, he
argued, was the best way to tackle the country's seemingly endemic political
violence.
Last weekend Mr Mandela's message to angry and disillusioned supporters was
very different. The negotiations were in tatters, he had to admit, and he
could no longer use Codesa as a political safety valve. Talk now is of 'mass
action' - strikes, marches, demonstrations, boycotts.
The ANC has yet to show that it can sustain such activities; but the shift
in tactics risks delivering a heavy blow to government hopes for new
investment and fresh borrowing, both essential if the economy is to pull out
of its recession.
Moreover, the ANC's campaign carries an obvious risk of further violence,
whether in confrontation with security forces or with Inkatha. While Mr
Mandela may not intend as much, a generation of angry young blacks who
sacrificed their education in order to man township barricades, will take
this as a mandate for insurrection.
The answer is not, as President de Klerk hinted at the weekend,
reintroduction of tougher security measures.
He should instead be restoring his credibility by ordering an independent
inquiry into the police role in both the Boipatong tragedies - last
Wednesday's massacre and the shootings on Saturday - including allegations
that the authorities failed to act on warnings of impending slaughter. He
ought to encourage rapid reform of the grim, all-male hostels in the
townships, source of so much tension. He should also authorise a more
rigorous investigation of the so-called 'third force', right-wing extremists
set on destabilising the peace process by instigating violence between black
parties.
A convincing demonstration of government good faith is needed if
negotiations are to resume and South Africa is again to pull itself back
from the brink.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THIS YEAR'S report from the UK's Top Salaries Review Body
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
expected to land on the prime minister's desk later this week - is already
causing a political storm. Due before the general election, the report is
thought likely to recommend pay rises taking some judges, generals and
senior civil servants well over Pounds 100,000 a year. The government
postponed publication to avoid top people's pay becoming an election issue.
The delay has done nothing to make more palatable possible pay rises of 30
per cent. Junior and middle-ranking civil servants have had to make do this
year with rises of 4.5 per cent or less and the level of settlements in the
private sector has been falling.
Yet if the report makes recommendations of this magnitude, the government
will not wish lightly to set them aside. The TSRB last year pointed out that
the salaries of public servants in its remit are generally less than half
the median earnings of comparable managers in the private sector.
Recruitment and retention of high quality public servants is in the public
interest, as is two way traffic in high-fliers between private business and
Whitehall.
Comparison of risk and reward in the private and public sectors, however, is
not as easy as is sometimes assumed. In a period when the government is
trying to introduce clearer performance standards into the public services,
the debate about civil service pay also needs to become more subtle. A
useful next step would be for members of the TSRB to defend their
recommendations in public, paving the way for government to set out the
reasons for its decision in some detail.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: Le Coq d'Or - Opera in concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is odd of us to keep calling Rimsky-Korsakov's opera that, rather than
The Golden Cockerel - especially when it is sung in Russian, as at the
Barbican on Sunday. (Rimsky never heard it in any language, for he died
before the irritable Moscow censors would allow it to be performed.) There,
however, the mysterious Queen who arrives with the famous 'Hymn to the Sun'
proved to hail from 'Shemaka', instead of the familiar old 'Shemakhan'.
Along with the programme-book came the complete text in Edward Agate's
rhyming, facetious English. Presumably that is the original flavour? The
tale is at once surrealist-ludicrous, gory and obscurely moral, like many
Russian products from Gogol to Bulgakov and beyond, and Rimsky set it in the
accepted deadpan way: hardly any overt jokes, every scene composed at face
value. Acts 2 and 3 begin respectively with a vista of deathly desolation
and a scene of deep public anxiety, and the composer provided them with
music as 'advanced' and disturbing as anything he wrote. Yet the prevailing
tone is fairytale-exotic, wry but picturesque.
In this concert-performance, Mstislav Rostropovich and the London Symphony
preserved the ambiguous balance while revelling in Rimsky's opulent
orchestral palette. Everything shone, whether in crackling brass or with an
opalescent gleam, and the conductor paced the opera unerringly. He allowed
himself several cuts in the score, with the happy result that he got through
it in less than two hours (plus interval). Coq d'Or does have its
inconsequent stretches, and without production-tricks to help them along we
might grow weary of Rimsky's constant, unabashed recycling of a very few
musical elements.
The cast Rostropovich assembled, with principals who have sung for him
already in other capitals, turned up trumps. For the bass anti-hero, dopey
King Dodon, we had Bulat Mingelkiev from the Kirghiz and Kirov Operas:
staunch, forthright, never admitting that he might be a comic character.
Young Elena Brilova sang a fascinating Queen. There is more than a touch of
Ileana Cotrubas about her timbre (bright, plucky, plaintive) and her manner
(ditto), and no less intelligent calculation.
In the other roles, all much smaller, Robin Leggate and Simon Keenlyside
made clean impressions as the princely sons, dead before Act 2 begins, and
David Wilson-Johnson was his reliable self as Dodon's surly General Polkan.
The Danish contralto Mette Ejsing sang the royal housekeeper with imposing
warmth and breadth; we shall surely hear much more of her. Rimsky wrote the
sinister Astrologer at near-impossible heights, usually attempted in a
character-squeak, but here we had a unique 'tenor altino' - the
Philippine-American Noel Espiritu Velasco - who braved them with a kind of
desperate urgency, eerily effective.
Though the Cockerel itself gets no more to do than Strauss's Falcon in Die
Frau ohne Schatten, but his/her/its warnings need to be just as telling. The
young American soprano Colleen Gaetano was forceful, even strident: it
worked. The London Choral Society were excellent as soldiers, handmaidens
and townsfolk. Nonetheless, we owed this unexpectedly enchanting evening to
Rostropovich above all. I was rude about some of his conducting in the
Barbican's Prokofiev festival a few months ago, but he has Rimsky
beautifully in hand. One couldn't have hoped for a performance more
judicious, eager and alert.

FT  23 JUN 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Court authorises multiple
professional practices - European Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, the European Court of Justice added another judgment to those
already guaranteeing the rights of EC professionals to operate in more than
one Community country.
A Luxembourg law preventing foreign doctors, dentists and vets from
practising in Luxembourg, if they already do so in another EC country, was
condemned by the ECJ as infringing the Rome Treaty rules on establishment
and free movement of employees.
The EC Commission brought infringement proceedings under its general Treaty
enforcement powers against the Luxembourg law's blanket ban on foreign
doctors, dentists and vets establishing secondary practices or accepting
additional employment in Luxembourg.
While the law recognises the freedom of foreign professionals to provide
cross-border services, only Luxembourg professionals enjoy the limited
exceptional rights to have second practices.
This case reinforces the fundamental rights under the Rome Treaty of
businessmen and professionals to establish or accept employment in more than
one member country.
Luxembourg argued that doctors, dentists and vets could not provide an
adequate service to the public unless they operated from a single practice
and were constantly available.
The Court rejected Luxembourg's attempts to justify the restrictions on
health and public policy grounds because other measures were available to
safeguard these interests which interfered less with basic Treaty rights.
For example, a 24-hour service could be guaranteed through substitutes and
temporary employees rather than by a professional being on permanent call.
Other professions, such as lawyers and accountants, may now be better placed
to resist protectionist pressures from certain EC countries. Professionals
may rely on the protection of the ECJ to operate from secondary offices or
accept employment while maintaining their original establishments.
Case C-351/90, Commission v Luxembourg, ECJ FC June 16 1992
Jurisdiction in non-contractual product liability cases
In a decision that may limit the possibilities for plaintiffs to shop around
for the best forum in which to bring product liability claims, the ECJ
clarified the meaning of 'contractual matters' in the Brussels Convention on
Jurisdiction and Judgments.
The Court held that proceedings brought by a sub-buyer against a
manufacturer do not concern 'contractual matters' when the goods subject to
the proceedings alleged to be defective and unfit for their purpose were
bought from a party other than the manufacturer in a chain of contracts.
The question of interpretation arose in a damages action brought in France
by a French plaintiff against a German manufacturer and French seller of a
suction system bought to be attached to two metal polishing machines
purchased from a Swiss company.
The plaintiff claimed damages against all parties on the basis of alleged
breaches of French health and safety at work rules and on the ground that
the goods were unfit for the purpose for which they were bought.
The French court ruled that while it had no jurisdiction over the Swiss
company it did have jurisdiction over the German manufacturer and French
seller under the Brussels Convention.
The ECJ made what is known as an 'autonomous' interpretation of the Brussels
Convention provisions, applying the interpretative approach laid down in
previous cases.
It interpreted the special rules for 'contractual matters', which allow a
defendant to be sued in the place where the contract was to be performed, in
accordance with the Convention's fundamental objective of ensuring legal
certainty for business in the jurisdiction.
The ECJ said that even though under French law the plaintiff was entitled to
sue in the French courts, this deprived business of the legal certainty
assured by the Convention's general rule that a defendant must be sued in
the country of his domicile, unless one of the Convention exceptions
applies.
In the case of dispute between a manufacturer and a sub-buyer of his
product, there is no direct contractual relationship. For this reason alone,
the Court found the dispute could not benefit from the special jurisdiction
rules applicable to 'contractual matters' because there was no obligation
freely entered into between either party.
The other reasons given by the ECJ for rejecting the broader interpretation,
advocated by the Commission in its observations, illustrate the significance
the decision may have in product liability disputes.
First, the ECJ said that in a chain of international contracts, the
contractual obligations accepted by a manufacturer in his agreement with the
purchaser are not necessarily the same as those that the purchaser may agree
with his own customer.
Second, the principle of judicial protection of parties established in the
Community excludes an interpretation of the special jurisdiction rules which
deprives the defendant of certainty as to which court he may be sued in
other than a court of his domicile.
Finally, in the vast majority of member countries, including the UK, the
liability of a manufacturer to a sub-buyer for defective goods is a tortious
or non-contractual liability.
Case C-26/91, Societe Jakob Handte et Cie GmbH v Societe Traitements
mecano-chimiques des surfaces, ECJ FC June 17 1992.
Looking Ahead
The ECJ and the CFI will begin the summer vacation on Friday July 10 1992.
In the next three weeks, several judgments are expected as the judges try to
clear their desks, including decisions on tachographs in the UK and an
appeal in a competition case involving fur breeders.
Advocates General's opinions are also due in the first week of July in the
Woodpulp and UK Sunday trading cases.
On July 1, the first day of the UK presidency of the Council of Ministers,
the oral hearing in the British drinking water case will take place in
Luxembourg.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vlad Stanic, former head of management development at TSB group, has been
appointed development director for the Management Charter Initiative, the UK
body which aims to set standards in management training.
He faces a stiff challenge. The MCI was launched in 1988 only to find - a
year later - it lacked the support of UK managers who described the
organisation as bureaucratic and uninspiring. Since then, the response from
employers has been patchy.
Already christened 'the Impaler' by waggish MCI staff, Stanic believes the
approach may be useful in his new post: 'I would like to impale all those
senior managers who go through the motions but do not actually relate their
management development to their business objectives.'
He has a reputation for asking people penetrating questions; former
colleagues say he is intelligent and confident and has a knack of putting
those around him at their ease. He describes his working style as informal
and flexible but is determined to meet the business objectives he sets even
if that means working all night.
During more than 20 years in personnel he has left some scars on the human
resources he managed. At Spicer &amp; Oppenheimer he put reluctant partners
through their paces with the introduction of performance appraisal, while
senior managers at Rank Xerox found they were required to acquire MBAs.
Born in Yugoslavia in 1941, he was educated and has worked largely in the
UK. He is a chartered psychologist who describes himself as a maverick:
'Most psychologists have a purer than white approach. They have never heard
of the idea of customer services or user-friendly psychology. I have dirtied
my hands in industry so I see things from a business point of view.'
Most recently he has worked as an independent consultant advising blue chip
companies on personnel issues.

Tony Rieger has resigned from TIP Europe, the trailer rental group he helped

Rieger's role as managing director of the company's trailer rental division

TIP Europe's financial restructuring after it breached a loan agreement in
1990.
Jim Davis, chairman, says there are 'no hard feelings'. 'Tony Rieger had
great entrepreneurial flair but what we are seeking at the present time is a
more steady approach.'
Rieger is understood to be receiving about Pounds 250,000 in final
remunerations.

Sales House business to profit. Sales House, primarily a clothes retailer,
makes over 30 per cent of its sales in footwear so Thompson clearly knows
one end of a shoe from the other.
His brief will be to differentiate British Shoe's retail brands far more
clearly. The problem has been that many of British Shoe's formats, which
include Freeman Hardy Willis, Saxone, Dolcis and Cable &amp; Co, overlap in the
marketplace.

the office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British have a traditional affection for warm beer and muggy offices but
just as cooled lagers have frozen out many traditional ales, so more and
more businesses are turning to air conditioning, writes Charles Batchelor.
This can make sense even in Britain's unpredictable climate because the
sun's rays on large city centre offices cause them to store heat and can
push internal temperatures up to 10 degrees higher than those outside.
Often the only affordable way to obtain the effects of air conditioning in
many older and smaller offices is to install a mobile air conditioner. What
to Buy for Business* lists 16 suppliers and 44 different machines in a
review of air conditioners in its June edition.
A mobile air conditioner will not achieve the same uniform degree of
coolness as a built-in system and many of the benefits will be lost if a
window has to be opened to allow the exhaust hose to vent into the open air.
But they can be used as spot coolers by one or two desks.
Users will face a choice between water cooled air conditioners, which
require topping up and more elaborate maintenance, or the air cooled variety
which have recently become more popular.
What to Buy selects three best buys ranging in price from Pounds 700 to
Pounds 1,495 and six good value models from Pounds 599 to Pounds 1,325.
However, it estimates that buyers should be able to negotiate a 20 per cent
discount on one-off purchases and suggests renting for short-term use. A
week's rent usually works out at one-tenth of the purchase price.
The unpredictability of the British weather means it is difficult to predict
when you may need to rent and renting or buying in the middle of a heatwave
will make it difficult to obtain the best deal.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Anyone for tennis? - A
licensing deal to use the name of a prestigious event like Wimbledon or a
popular cartoon character can give a big boost to sales
</HEADLINE>

A small west London company, G Ettinger, has spent 60 years establishing a
name for itself as a designer and manufacturer of high quality leather goods
and fashion accessories.
Until a year ago, growth was steady rather than spectacular but it has since
taken off on the back of a licensing agreement with the All England Lawn
Tennis &amp; Croquet Club, home of the Wimbledon championship. Ettinger's use of
the Wimbledon logos - crossed tennis rackets and a stylised letter W, both
in the club's distinctive purple and green colours - has given a significant
boost to the company.
Sales of bags, belts and wallets with the Wimbledon logo are expected to
account for up to Pounds 100,000 of Ettinger's Pounds 1.5m turnover this
year, estimates Robert Ettinger, marketing director. The Wimbledon line is
now on sale in two shops at the championship site, at upmarket outlets such
as Harrods and in leather goods shops around the country. 'We have opened up
dozens of large new accounts,' says Ettinger. 'Having products with a famous
name attached makes selling so much easier.'
Ettinger acknowledges that although he initiated the link with Wimbledon, he
was concerned that licensing would not be appropriate for a small company.
He feared it would require enormous financial resources and an army of sales
reps.
In fact, small firms may be better placed to win licensing deals than large
companies, says Tony Gadsby Peet, vice-president in charge of licensing at
International Management Group (IMG), which arranges sporting promotions.
'Bigger companies tend to have a well established reputation and most of
their activity is designed to promote their own name,' he comments.
'A small company will pay more attention to detail and will devote more
attention to a licence because it is worth more to it in terms of its
overall business,' adds Rob McCowen, marketing director for the All England
Club.
The licensor will, however, be looking for a well-run small business which
will not damage the 'property' it wants to license. 'We have to make sure
the company is not so small that it is not financially viable,' says
McCowen. 'It would depend on the product. If the company made clothing, you
would expect a high level of sales and the company would have to make a
significant investment.'
'You want a company with an established reputation and established
distribution networks,' notes Gadsby Peet. There is no point licensing a
brand name to a company which is too small to exploit the opportunity.
Eros Products, a north London company, established itself as a distributor
of plastic housewares and children's lunchboxes and drinking flasks before
signing up its first Disney licence in November 1989. 'We had a customer
base among the multiple stores; a broad range of products; and a good
position in the low to medium price range,' says Joseph Yeung, financial
director.
Eros now has no fewer than 15 licences from companies such as Disney, Mattel
and Warner Brothers for 'characters' including Mickey Mouse, Winnie the
Pooh, Postman Pat, Barbie and Batman. Character merchandising accounts for
65 per cent of turnover, projected to be Pounds 6m this year.
The company now has such a well established position in the field of
character merchandising that it can afford to turn away propositions which
do not meet its own requirements. It turned down approaches to license the
Gazza name, because the former Tottenham footballer Paul Gascoigne would not
attract a broad enough public. 'We are not interested in short-run licences
or characters who are too obscure,' says Yeung.
Copywrite Stationery, a Duxford-based company which makes 90 per cent of its
Pounds 15m sales from folders, pencils and rucksacks bearing licensed
characters, checks whether characters have been successful on other products
and that they appeal to retailers.
Copywrite discusses 'properties' and market trends at regular meetings with
other distributors of character merchandise (none of them in the stationery
area), says Mike Redfern, managing director and joint founder.
'We also try to get some customer reaction,' he adds. 'We mock something up
and ask Woolworths if they like it. The licensors hate you doing that but I
would advise it.'
Copywrite is very dependent on its licensors but makes sure it has a wide
spread of characters across its three main ranges: children, students and
fashion.
Redfern says he makes sure that the characters he picks get good television
exposure. He looks for guaranteed repeats as well as the initial 13-week run
of a TV series. Gadsby Peet advises licensees to ensure that associated TV
programmes are actually being made and are not just being discussed.
A company which is looking for licences can either approach a licensor
direct or use a licence agent. The agents who handle characters or brands
are a different breed to those who deal with technical product licences,
notes Gadsby Peet.
When drawing up a contract there are four main areas to be considered:
DURATION
The typical contract is for between one and three years though one year
contracts do not really allow the licensee to obtain the maximum benefit so
they should negotiate for an option on renewal where possible. A company
will not want to commit itself to developing new products for a very
short-term arrangement.
ROYALTIES
The level will depend on the products covered by the contract. Wimbledon
normally agrees 'single figure' royalties with its licensees because it is
selling what it believes is a durable brand image and not a character which
may only have a short shelf-life.
Royalties have risen over the past decade from a normal 5 to 6 per cent to
around 10 per cent, says Gadsby Peet. But this is an average figure and
low-margin items such as confectionery and food would carry a lower royalty
than jewellery. Copywrite spends nearly Pounds 1.5m a year on royalties on
turnover of Pounds 15m, says Redfern.
MINIMUM FEES
Licensors will usually set a minimum royalty figure to ensure that the
licensee works hard to exploit the character or the brand. A licensee who
agrees to a 10 per cent royalty with a minimum fee of Pounds 5,000 must
expect to sell at least Pounds 50,000 worth of goods to cover his royalty
payment.
TERRITORY
Licensees would normally expect to have exclusive rights for a particular
character or name and an agreed range of products in a set geographical
area. Ettinger started with European rights and recently negotiated the
right to sell to duty-free shops around the world except for Japan. US
licensors are normally only interested in selling Europe-wide rights, rather
than single-country territories.
Signing the rights to a character or brand is only the start of the
relationship, the experts warn. The characters and the products must be kept
'fresh'. Eros arranges for regular redesigns of the illustrations which
appear on its lunchboxes and flasks (the licensor must approve the drawings
and the colours used) and constantly improves on the products themselves.
But if the relationship is properly managed, it can bring many benefits to
the licensee. As well as increased sales, the branded products often carry
higher margins than their unbranded rivals. A successful licence can also
improve the licensee's negotiating power with suppliers or with customers.
One potential customer offered Eros unattractive credit terms when it was
initially approached. After several months the company came back with an
improved offer when it saw how well Eros's products were selling through
rival outlets.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Technology: Sounds from the myth makers - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The myth-making industry has outdone itself with two products set to be
launched later this year: the minidisc and the digital compact cassette, new
digital recording formats developed by Sony and by Philips and Matsushita.
The companies themselves can be absolved of blame. It is natural, after all,
that they want to see us throw out perfectly good electronic equipment and
replace it with the latest gizmos. Yet an extraordinary number of new audio
products have been acclaimed as winners before anyone has seen or heard them
except in prototype form.
The first myth about these latest offerings is that because MD and DCC are
digital they must sound as good as compact discs.
While audiophiles may argue over CD quality, it is undeniable that the sound
which hi-fi equipment makers have been able to achieve on a CD has improved
over the years as they have gained experience with digital processing.
Unfortunately that experience may not be directly transferable because the
MD and DCC formats are different from CDs and from each other. Indeed, MD
and DCC may never match a CD in quality because they employ compression
technologies to store more information in a small space. Compression works
by eliminating storage of repeated information, theoretically not needed,
but this is a bit like saying that a frozen vegetable tastes theoretically
like a fresh one because everything important is preserved.
The test is in the tasting, or in this case the listening, and the final
quality depends on how well the engineers do their jobs. No one knows just
yet. And don't believe anyone who claims to have heard the two new
technologies run off against CDs. Proper testing comparisons of audio
equipment is a subjective business, often best performed in the quiet of
your own living room.
The second myth is that MD is in direct competition with DCC, and that only
one can succeed. Although both are digital recording formats, from the point
of view of consumers, they will be competing in different segments of the
traditional analogue cassette market, and probably not against CDs at all.
DCC will appeal to consumers ready to replace their old tape recorder who
want to be able to play old cassettes on the new machine, while at the same
time enjoying the advantages of digital sound, namely the absence of
background noise. But consumers ought to ask whether their old cassettes
will sound nearly as good on the new machines as on the analogue recorder
they now own, which probably has high-quality sound reproduction already.
And while no tape hiss is a strong point, musical fidelity of DCC for
digital tapes may be no better than the analogue machines.
MD, by contrast, is really for people on the go, who want recordable digital
sound in an extremely small package. In a few years, when the engineers have
time to shrink it further, an MD machine may be a fraction of the size of
the smallest currently available Walkmen-type cassette players, and will
offer instant access to musical tracks just as a CD does.
In short, both formats have a their place. Indeed, Sony, as one of the
world's biggest manufacturers of magnetic tape, has a strong interest in
seeing both products succeed. DCC, apparently rival to Sony's MD, will
happily use Sony tape.
The third myth is that the fate of the the companies involved, if not the
entire consumer electronics industry, hangs on the success of these two
products. Certainly the consumer electronics industry is in the doldrums, in
large part because of a lack of exciting new blockbuster products.
Yet neither DCC nor MD really offers the promise of revolutionising the
music industry, as did the launch of compact discs a decade ago. More
likely, both will be moderately successful products that will neither make
nor break their backers.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Technology: Acquiring a taste for innovation / Describing
how retail banking in eastern Europe is adjusting to computerisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until last year the Slaski Bank in Katowice, in south west Poland, was much
like any other in eastern Europe: customers queued for so long that they
took sandwiches to eat while they watched the drawn out and bureaucratic
transactions. These could take so long that people looked on a visit to the
bank as a social event.
Behind the scenes, things were even worse. Management information that would
be considered vital to banks in the west would either be provided late or
not at all. Fraud was also a problem.
In 1990 the Polish government created nine new regional retail banks and
told them to prepare for competition and privatisation. Marian Rajczyk,
president of the Katowice-based Bank Slaski, the largest of the nine, took a
quick decision based on his knowledge of western banks: to use technology to
improve customer service, management information and establish competitive
advantage.
He invited western computer companies to provide software, hardware and to
undertake the project management for the computerisation of the bank's 42
branches. He wanted automated teller machines (ATMs), account management,
transaction handling, administrative support, and even signature
verification. And he stipulated that it had to be done quickly.
As Poland's largest retail bank, and a pioneer in technology, the Slaski
project attracted competitive bids. IBM, anxious to establish market share
in Eastern Europe, won a fixed-price contract to manage the project, beating
off competition from ICL, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.
The conditions for beginning a project of this kind could not have been
worse, says the banking project manager for IBM Eastern Europe, Maciej
Borysoglebski. Slaski's managers had seen western banks in operation and
they had high expectations of what could be achieved, but little
understanding of either computers or western banking procedures. And unlike
western banks, they did not have the computer skills, the stable legislative
environment or the infrastructure.
The Slaski managers were also unprepared for such a large computer project.
Although they were highly motivated, they were not used to 'task ownership',
says Borysoglebski. 'They were given tasks and dates for completion and
found it very frightening.'
From the outset, Poland's poor telecommunications system was a problem.
Banks in western countries are able to connect their ATMs to central
computers using leased telephone lines, but this is not yet feasible on a
large scale in Poland.
In consequence, each branch operates as a self-contained unit, with the ATMs
only able to access data held on the local IBM AS/400 minicomputers in each
branch. Only when the telecommunications infrastructure is in place will the
machines be linked on a network.
The lack of telecommunications support created another problem for Slaski:
how to verify that account holders were who they said they were. This led to
Slaski's biggest innovation. Using a software package called Infosign from
Inform, a German software house, a customer's signature can be called up
electronically on the personal computer workstations for immediate
comparison.
IBM chose to use a banking software package from the German software company
Actis in order to avoid costly application development. But this created
problems of its own: the Polish banking laws changed by the month, creating
a need for repeated changes. The dilemma of how much software to re-write,
and when, is continuous.
Another problem was that Slaski's offices were not designed for computers.
Most branches needed refurbishing, but the quality of the local workmanship
could not always be relied upon. Two days before the opening of one branch,
the ceiling collapsed. In another branch the walls gave in.
Despite these problems, the project has been completed on schedule. Today,
staff at the Katowice Bank pose for photographs behind new computer
terminals while behind them customers withdraw money in the banking hall.
Slaski's banking applications are now being eyed by other banks in Poland
and eastern Europe. Buoyed up by its technological leadership, Slaski is
planning to expand its operations into other parts of Poland.
